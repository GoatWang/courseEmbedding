NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



(In U.S. Dollars Thousands, Except Number of Shares and Per Share Data)


1.   The Company


Global Sources Ltd. (the "Company") was incorporated in November 1999
under the laws of Bermuda. The Company is majority owned by Hung Lay
Si Co Ltd. (the "Parent Company"). The Parent Company is a company
organized under the laws of the Cayman Islands. It is wholly owned by
the Quan Gung 1986 Trust, a trust formed under the laws of the Island
of Jersey. Hill Street Trustees Ltd. is the trustee of the trust (the
"Trustee") and the Trustee has sole and exclusive voting investment
and dispositive power over the shares of capital stock of the Parent
Company owned by the Trust.


The Company's principal business is to provide services that allow
global buyers to identify suppliers and products, and enable suppliers
to market their products to a large number of buyers. The Company's
primary online service is creating and hosting marketing websites that
present suppliers' product and company information in a consistent,
easily searchable manner on Global Sources Online. The Company also
offers electronic cataloguing services for buyers and suppliers. My
Catalogs enable buyers to maintain customized information on
suppliers. Private Supplier Catalogs are password-protected online
environments where suppliers can develop and maintain their own
product and company data. Complementing these services are various
trade magazines and CD-ROMs. The Company's businesses are conducted
primarily through Trade Media Ltd., its wholly owned subsidiary, which
was incorporated in October 1984 under the laws of Cayman Islands.
Through certain other wholly owned subsidiaries, the Company also
organizes conferences and exhibitions on technology related issues and
licenses Asian Sources / Global Sources Online and catalog services.


2.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies


(a)  Basis of Consolidation and Presentation


(i)  The accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America and comprise the accounts of the
Company, its majority owned subsidiaries and those owned through
nominee shareholders. All significant intercompany transactions
and balances have been eliminated on consolidation.


(ii) The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the
year are included in the consolidated statement of income from
the effective dates of acquisition or up to the effective dates
of disposal.


(iii) The functional currency of the Company and certain subsidiaries
is the United States dollar. The functional currencies of other
subsidiaries are their respective local currencies. United States
dollars are used as the reporting currency as the Company's
operations are global.


(b)  Use of Estimates


The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S.
GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements
and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.


-48-





(c)  Cash Equivalents


The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an
original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.


(d)  Inventory of Paper


Inventory of paper is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable
value. Cost is determined on the first-in, first-out basis.


(e)  Property and Equipment


(i)  Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation. Cost represents the purchase price of the asset and
other costs incurred to bring the asset into its existing use.


(ii) Depreciation on property and equipment is calculated to amortize
their cost on a straight line basis over their estimated useful
lives as follows:








Fixtures, fittings and office equipment........   5 years
Leasehold improvements.........................   5 years
Motor vehicles.................................   5 years
Computer equipment and software................   3 years








(iii) EffectiveJanuary 1, 1999, the Company adopted Statement of
Position 98-1, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software
Developed or Obtained for Internal Use," to account for the costs
incurred to develop computer software for internal use. Costs
incurred in the preliminary project stage with respect to the
development of software for internal use are expensed as
incurred; costs incurred during the application development stage
are capitalized and are amortized over the estimated useful life
of three years upon the commissioning of service of the software.
Training and maintenance costs will be expensed as incurred.


To account for the development costs related to the products to
be sold, leased or otherwise marketed, the Company adopted SFAS
No. 86, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to Be
Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed." Development costs incurred
subsequent to the establishment of the technological feasibility
of the product are capitalized. The capitalization will end when
the product is available for general release to customers.


The Company expensed $NIL, $1,117 and $64 during the years ended
December 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively, for the costs
incurred prior to the establishment of the technological
feasibility with respect to the development of products to be
sold, leased or otherwise marketed.


(f)  Intangible Assets


Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 142 effective on January 1, 2002,
copyrights were amortized on a straight line basis over a period of
ten years and Goodwill, was amortized on a straight-line basis over
twenty years.


-49-





In June 2001, FASB issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations," and
SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS No. 141
requires all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 to be
accounted for using the purchase method and broadened the criteria for
recording intangible assets separated from goodwill. Under SFAS No.
142, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no
longer amortized but are reviewed annually (or more frequently if
impairment indicators arise) for impairment. Separable intangible
assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives will continue to
be amortized over their useful lives (but with no maximum life). The
amortization provisions of SFAS No. 142 apply immediately to goodwill
and intangible assets acquired after June 30, 2001. With respect to
goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to July 1, 2001, we
adopted SFAS No. 142 effective January 1, 2002. As goodwill was fully
amortized and no acquisitions occurred during 2001, the Company
believes that the adoption of these standards did not have a material
impact on the Company's financial statements of position, results of
operations, or cash flows.


(g)  Investments


Long term investments for business and strategic purposes in
privately-held companies where such investments are less than 20% of
the equity capital of the investees, with no significant influence
over the investees, are stated at cost.


Long term investments in companies where such investments are in the
range of 20% to 50% of the equity capital of the investees and over
whom the Company exercises significant influence, are accounted under
equity method.


Interest in subsidiaries with more than 50% ownership are consolidated
and the ownership interests of minority investors are recorded as
minority interest.


Long term investments in U.S. Treasury strips zero % coupon, held to
maturity are stated at amortized cost.


(h)  Impairment of Long-lived Assets


The Company reviews the carrying value of its long-lived assets based
upon a gross cash flow basis and will reserve for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the
assets may not be fully recoverable. The impairment loss is measured
based on the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and
its fair value. There was no impairment of the Company's property and
equipment or intangibles as of December 31, 2002.


(i)  Revenue Recognition


The Company derives its revenues from advertising fees in its
published trade magazines and Websites, sales of trade magazines, fees
from licensing its trade and service marks, service fees from the
provision of software maintenance service, and organizing business
seminars.


Revenues from advertising in trade magazines and Websites are
recognized ratably in the period in which the advertisement is
displayed. Advertising contracts do not exceed one year. Revenue from
sales of trade magazines is recognized upon delivery of the magazine.
Magazine subscriptions received in advance are deferred and recognized
as revenue upon delivery of the magazine. Revenue from the provision
of maintenance service is deferred and recognized ratably over the
maintenance


-50-





service period. Revenue from organizing business seminars is
recognized at the conclusion of the seminar.


The Company receives license fees and royalties from licensing its
trade and service marks. Revenue from license fees is recognized
ratably over the term of the license, currently four to five years.
Royalties from license arrangements are earned ratably in the period
in which the advertisement is displayed by the licensee.


The interest income from investments in U.S. Treasury strips zero %
coupon is recognized as it accrues, taking into account the effective
yield on the asset.


(j)  Transactions with Sales Representatives and Related Party Sales
Representatives


The Company utilizes sales representatives and in the past utilized
related party sales representatives in various territories to promote
the Company's products and services. Under these arrangements, these
sales representatives are entitled to commissions as well as marketing
fees. Commissions expense is recorded when owed to these sales
representative and is included in sales expenses.


These sales representatives which are mainly corporate entities,
handle collections from clients on behalf of the Company. Included in
receivables from these sales representatives are amounts collected on
behalf of the Company as well as cash advances made to these sales
representatives.


As of December 31, 2001, the boards of directors of eight of these
sales representative companies each included a director nominated by
the Company to monitor the receivables collected from the Company's
clients by these related party sales representatives, and to monitor
any changes to the authorized signatories of the depository bank
accounts. The nominated directors were employees of the Company. The
Company and the nominated directors did not have any interest in the
share capital of these related party sales representatives companies.
However as of December 31, 2002, the Company does not have any
nominated directors on the board of directors of any of the Company's
sales representative companies. Approximately $20,315, $20,172 and
$9,986 of the commissions and marketing fees expense was associated
with these related party sales representative companies for 2000, 2001
and 2002, respectively.


(k)  Advertising Expenses


Advertising expenses are expensed as incurred. The Company incurred
advertising expenses of $658, $277 and $161 during the years ended
December 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively.


(l)  Operating Leases


The Company leases certain office facilities under cancelable and
non-cancelable operating leases that expire in two to five years.
Rentals under operating leases are expensed on a straight line basis
over the life of the leases.


(m)  Liabilities for Bonus Plan


Before the commencement of the Equity Compensation Plans as described
in note 23, the Company rewarded its senior management staff based on
their performance through long term discretionary bo-


-51-





nus awards. These awards were payable in cash generally at the end of
five or ten years from the date of the award, even in the event of
termination of employment unless certain non-compete provisions had
been violated. These awards were expensed in the period to which the
performance bonus relates.


(n)  Retirement Benefits


The Company operates a number of defined contribution retirement
benefit plans. Contributions are based on a percentage of each
eligible employees' salary and are expensed as the related salaries
are incurred.


(o)  Income Taxes


The Company accounts for deferred income taxes using the liability
method, under which the expected future tax consequences of temporary
differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of its
assets and liabilities are recognized as deferred tax assets and
liabilities. A valuation allowance is established for any deferred tax
asset when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will
not be recovered.


(p)  Minority Interest


In 2000 the Company entered into an agreement with CMP Media Inc.,
through United Business Media B.V., a subsidiary of United News and
Media plc. (CMP) to set-up a corporation (eMedia Asia Ltd.) to provide
new technology content, media and e-commerce services to the
electronics technology market in Asia. The Company holds a 60.1%
controlling equity interest in eMedia Asia Ltd. and consolidates the
results of operations. As part of obtaining its 39.9% interest, CMP
has committed to pay $6,000 and interest thereon to the Company upon
the payment of specified future dividends of eMedia Asia Ltd. Due to
the contingent nature of the payment, the Company did not record in
its balance sheet the promissory note receivable of $6,000 due from
CMP and no interest income was accrued as at December 31, 2002 and
2001. The minority interest liability of $2,823 and $2,515 at December
31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, reflects CMP's proportionate interest
of the net book value of the eMedia Asia Ltd.


(q)  Foreign Currencies


Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are
measured and recorded in the functional currency using the exchange
rate in effect on the date of the transaction. As of the balance sheet
date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in
currencies other than the functional currency are remeasured using the
exchange rate at the balance sheet date. All gains and losses arising
from foreign currency transactions and remeasurement of foreign
currency denominated accounts are included in the determination of net
income in the year in which they occur.


The financial statements of the subsidiaries reporting in their
respective local currencies are translated into U.S. dollars for
consolidation as follows: assets and liabilities at the exchange rate
as of the balance sheet date, shareholders' equity at the historical
rates of exchange, and income and expense amounts at the average
monthly exchange rates. The cumulative translation differences were not
material as of December 31, 2001 and 2002.


-52-





(r)  Segment Reporting


Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 131,
"Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information"
("SFAS 131") requires that companies report separately, in the
financial statements, certain financial and descriptive information
about operating segment profit or loss, certain specific revenue and
expense items, and segment assets. Additionally, companies are
required to report information about the revenues derived from their
products and services groups, about geographic areas in which the
Company earns revenues and holds assets, and about major customers.


The Company identifies its operating segments based on business
activities, management responsibility and geographic location. The
Company has two reportable segments: online services and other media
services.


(s)  Comprehensive Income


SFAS No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income," establishes standards
for reporting comprehensive income and its components in financial
statements. Comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity of
a company during a period from transactions and other events and
circumstances excluding transactions resulting from investment by
owners and distribution to owners. For each of the years ended
December 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002, the Company had no material other
comprehensive income items.


(t)  Basic and Diluted Net Income Per Share


Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the
weighted average number of shares of ordinary shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted net income per share is calculated using
the weighted average number of outstanding ordinary shares, plus other
dilutive potential ordinary shares. For all periods presented, the
Company did not have any dilutive securities; therefore, both the
basic and diluted net income per share computations resulted in the
same amounts.


(u)  Stock Based Compensation


The Company has adopted the disclosure only provisions of SFAS No.
123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation." The Company accounts
for stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value method
prescribed in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 (APB 25),
"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" and related
interpretations. Accordingly, compensation cost of stock options is
measured as the excess, if any, of the fair value of the Company's
stock at the date of the grant over the option exercise price and is
charged to operations over the vesting period.


The Company accounts for equity instruments issued to non-employees in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS No.123 and Emerging Issues Task
Force (EITF) Issue No. 96-18, "Accounting for Equity Instruments that
are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction
with Selling Goods and Services." All transactions in which services
are received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for
based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair
value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably
measurable. The measurement date of the fair value of the equity
instrument issued is the earlier of the date on which the
counterparty's performance is complete or the date on which it is
probable that performance will occur.

A majority of the Company's employee stock compensation plans are share
grants without any exercise price or exercise period. Therefore the
fair value of the share grants at the date of grant approximates the
intrinsic value. As a result, the impact of fair value based accounting
under SFAS No. 123 is not significantly different from the intrinsic
value method under APB 25.


(v)  Recent Accounting Pronouncements


In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Statements of Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" as amended by SFAS No.
137 and SFAS No. 138. This statement, as amended, was effective
January 1, 2001, and established accounting and reporting standards
for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments
imbedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. The adoption
of SFAS No. 133, as amended, did not impact the Company's financial
position or results of operations.


In June, 2001, FASB issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations," and
SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS No. 141
requires all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 to be
accounted for using the purchase method. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill
and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized
but are reviewed annually (or more frequently if impairment indicators
arise) for impairment. Separable intangible assets that are not deemed
to have indefinite lives will continue to be amortized over their
useful lives (but with no maximum life). The amortization provisions
of SFAS No. 142 apply immediately to goodwill and intangible assets
acquired after June 30, 2001. With respect to goodwill and intangible
assets acquired prior to July 1, 2001, we adopted SFAS No. 142
effective January 1, 2002. As goodwill was fully amortized and no
acquisitions occurred during 2001, management believes that the
adoption of these standards did not have a material impact on the
Company's financial statements of position, results of operations, or
cash flows.


In June 2001, FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations." This statement addresses financial accounting
and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of
tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs.
The purpose of this statement is to develop consistent accounting for
asset retirement obligations and related costs in the financial
statements and provides more information about future cash outflows,
leverage and liquidity regarding retirement obligations and the gross
investment in long-lived assets. We adopted SFAS No. 143 on January 1,
2003 and believe that the adoption of this standard did not have a
material impact on the Company's financial statements of position,
results of operations, or cash flows.


In August 2001, FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." This statement addresses
financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of
long-lived assets, superseding SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be
Disposed Of." The statement also supersedes the accounting and
reporting provisions of APB Opinion No. 30, Reporting the Results of
Operations -- Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a
Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events
and Transactions, for segments of a business to be disposed. The
Company adopted this statement on January 1, 2002 and believes that
the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the
Company's financial statement of position, results of operations, or
cash flows.


In April 2002, FASB issued SFAS No. 145, "Rescission of FASB
Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and
Technical Corrections." The provisions of this Statement


-54-





relating to the rescission of Statement 4 will be effective for fiscal
years beginning after May 15, 2002. The provisions in paragraphs 8 and
9(c) of this Statement relating to Statement 13 are effective for
transactions occurring after May 15, 2002. All other provisions of
this Statement are effective for financial statements issued on or
after May 15, 2002. We believe that the adoption of this standard does
not have a material impact on the Company's financial statements of
position, results of operations, or cash flows.


In December 2002, FASB issued SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation - Transition and Disclosure," which requires additional
disclosures in interim and annual financial statements about the method
of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of
the method used on reported results. The disclosure provisions of SFAS
No. 148 are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002.

6.       Long-term Investments and Bonds held to maturity:


(i)  As at December 31, 2002, the Company holds equity instruments carried
at $100 in a privately held unaffiliated electronic commerce company
for business and strategic purposes. The investment is accounted for
under the cost method since the ownership is less than 20% and the
Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence
over the investee. The investment is shown under long term investments
in the consolidated balance sheets.


The Company's policy is to regularly review the carrying values of the
non-quoted investments and to identify and provide for impairment when
circumstances indicate impairment other than a temporary decline in
the carrying values of such assets.


During the fourth quarter of year 2000, the Company recorded $11,750
impairment loss for other than a temporary declines in the carrying
value of the investments based on the financial position of the
investees and other information, which became available in the fourth
quarter of year 2000 and developments in the technology and internet
sectors in fourth quarter of year 2000. During the year 2001, the
Company recorded a further $1,150 impairment loss for other than
temporary decline in the carrying value of the investment based on
economic


-56-





events and other factors. The net carrying value of the long term
investment as at December 31, 2001 and 2002 was $100. The Company will
continue to evaluate this investment for impairment.

11.      Liabilities for Incentive and Bonus Plans


Before the commencement of the Equity Compensation Plans the Company
rewarded its senior management staff based on their current performance
through long term discretionary bonus awards. These awards are payable
approximately at the end of five or ten years from the date of the
award, even in the event of termination of employment unless certain
non-compete provisions have been violated. The Company did not incur
any expenses related to these awards during the years ended December
31, 2000, 2001 and 2002. The required funds were set aside for payment
of the discretionary bonuses by purchasing U.S. Treasury strips zero %
coupons maturing in either five or ten years. These investments are
held until maturity and the proceeds are used for payment of the
discretionary bonuses.


Certain sales representatives of the Company are eligible for incentive
awards under plans administered by the Company. Costs incurred related
to incentive awards under plans administered by the Company for the
years ended December 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002 were $116, $78 and $128,
respectively. Amounts under liabilities for incentive plans include
amounts owed under plans previously administered by the Company.

12.      Retirement Benefit Plans


The Company operates a number of defined contribution retirement
benefit plans. Employees working in a jurisdiction where there is no
statutory provision for retirement benefits are covered by the
Company's plans.


The two principal defined contribution plans are plans where employees
are not required to make contributions. One of these two plans is
separately administered by an independent trustee and the plan assets
are held independent of the Company. The other one is not independently
administered and is currently unfunded. The Company's liabilities under
this unfunded plan as of December 31, 2001 and 2002 were $376 and $447,
respectively.


The Company incurred costs of $1,039, $1,085 and $1,101 with respect to

The Company recorded a full valuation allowance for the deferred tax
assets due to the uncertainty as to their ultimate realization.


As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, a United States subsidiary has net
operating loss carry forwards of approximately $17.3 million. These
losses which expire in year 2020, can be utilized to reduce future
taxable income of the subsidiary subject to compliance with the
taxation legislation and regulations in the relevant jurisdiction.


The Company recognized a deferred tax liability of US$610 and US$604 as
at December 31, 2001 and 2002, respectively, which primarily arose from
the temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax
bases of fixed assets in one of the subsidiaries of the Company.


14.      Share Capital


On April 14, 2000, in conjunction with the Share Exchange Agreement
discussed in Note 21, Fairchild (Bermuda), Ltd. issued 25,051,380
ordinary shares to the shareholders of Trade Media Holdings Ltd.,
predecessor to Global Sources Ltd., in exchange for all of its 10,000
ordinary shares outstanding at that date. All share and per share
amounts in these consolidated financial statements have been restated
for the year ended December 31, 1999 in a manner similar to a 2,505 to
1 stock split. In addition, Fairchild (Bermuda), Ltd. issued 62,628
ordinary shares and 1,189,941 ordinary shares to The Fairchild
Corporation and the shareholders of The Fairchild Corporation
respectively. After the share exchange Fairchild (Bermuda), Ltd was
renamed Global Sources Ltd. On February 28, 2002, the Company issued
5,000 ordinary shares purchased by a director of the Company under the
Directors Stock Option Plan. The authorized share capital of the
Company as at December 31, 2001 and 2002 is 50,000,000 ordinary shares
of $0.01 per value. As at December 31, 2001 and at December 31, 2002,
the Company has 26,303,949 and 26,308,949 ordinary shares issued and
outstanding, respectively.

15.      Fair Value of Financial Instruments


The carrying amounts of the Company's cash equivalents, accounts
receivable, related party receivables, accounts payable and accrued
liabilities approximate fair value due to their short maturities. The
fair value of related party payables cannot be determined due to the
related party nature. The information with respect to long term related
party payables is disclosed in Note 10. The carrying amount and market
value of long term investments are discussed in Note 6.


16.      Concentration of Credit Risk and Other Risks


Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to
concentration of credit risk, consist primarily of investment in
checking and money market accounts, investment in U.S. Treasury strips
zero % coupon, trade accounts receivable and receivables from sales
representatives. The Company maintains checking and money market
accounts with high quality institutions. The Company has a large number
of customers, operates in different geographic areas and generally does
not require collateral on accounts receivable or receivables from sales
representatives. In addition, the Company is continuously monitoring
the credit transactions and maintains reserves for credit losses where
necessary. No customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company's
revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002.
No customer accounted for more than 10% of the accounts receivable as
of December 31, 2001 and 2002.


In 2002, the Company derived approximately 93% of its revenue from
customers in Asia. The Company expects that a majority of its future
revenue will continue to be generated from customers in this region.
Future political or economic instability in Asia could negatively
impact the business.


17.      Operating Leases

19.      Contingencies


From time to time the Company is involved in litigation in the normal
course of business. While the results of such litigation and claims
cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company believes that the
probability is remote that the outcome of the outstanding litigation
and claims as of the current date will have a material adverse effect
on the Company's consolidated financial position and results of
operations.


20.      Capital Commitments


There were no material capital commitments as at December 31, 2002. The
commitments as at December 31, 2001 for the renovation work to be
carried out on the leasehold office facilities amounted to $91.


21.      Share Exchange Agreement


On December 6, 1999, a Share Exchange Agreement was executed by The
Fairchild Corporation, Fairchild (Bermuda), Ltd., Trade Media Holdings
Ltd. and the shareholders of Trade Media Holdings Ltd. (the "Share
Exchange"). Under the Share Exchange, Fairchild (Bermuda), Ltd. issued
additional common shares in exchange for all of the issued and
outstanding shares of the Company.


On April 3, 2000, the Form F-1 was declared effective, and on April
14, 2000, the above Share Exchange Agreement was consummated. After
the Share Exchange, Fairchild (Bermuda), Ltd. was renamed Global
Sources Ltd. As of April 14, 2000, the Company was publicly listed on
NASDAQ.


The transaction costs associated with the Share Exchange Agreement,
amounting to $609, $NIL and $NIL have been expensed during the year
ended December 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively. This expense is
included under general and administrative cost for the year ended
December 31, 2000 in the Consolidated Statements of Income.


22.      Restricted Share Award Plan


On February 4, 2000, the Company established a restricted share award
plan for the benefit of its chairman and chief executive officer in
recognition of services to the Company. In conjunction with the
restricted share award plan, the Parent Company assigned 4,008,221
ordinary shares of the Company, representing a 16% equity interest in
the Company to the Company. The Company then awarded these shares to
its chairman and chief executive officer. The chairman and chief
executive officer's entitlement to 501,028 of these shares is subject
to an employment agreement with one of the Company's United States
subsidiaries and entitlement to such shares vested immediately. The
chairman and chief executive officer's entitlement to the remaining
3,507,193 shares is subject to employment, non-compete and vesting
terms under an employment agreement with one of the Company's


-64-





United States subsidiaries. The 3,507,193 shares were to vest ratably
over 10 years, 10% each year on each anniversary date from the grant
date. However, effective August 30, 2000, the Company's Board of
Directors approved the accelerated vesting of all the restricted
shares granted to the chairman and chief executive officer resulting
in immediate vesting of all the shares. The Company recorded total
$64,000, $NIL and $NIL non-cash compensation expense associated with
these awards in the year ending December 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002,
respectively. At the modification date and subsequently the Company,
based on historical evidence and the Company's forecast of future
employee separations, estimated that the chairman and chief executive
officer will not terminate employment and appointment as director
prior to the date that vesting in the shares would have occurred
absent the modification. Therefore, the Company has estimated that
additional compensation expense to be recognized as a result of the
modification is nil. Should actual results differ from this estimate,
adjustment in future reporting periods will be required.


23.      Equity Compensation Plans


On December 30, 1999, the Company established the Global Sources
Employee Equity Compensation Trust (the "Trust") for the purpose of
administering monies and other assets to be contributed by the Company
to the Trust for the establishment of equity compensation and other
benefit plans. The Trust is administered by Harrington Trust Limited
(the "Bermuda Trustee"). The Bermuda Trustee in the exercise of its
power under the Declaration of Trust may be directed by the plan
committee, including the voting of securities held in the Trust. The
Board of Directors of the Company will select the members of the plan
committee.


On February 4, 2000, in conjunction with the establishment of the Trust
and the Share Exchange, the Parent Company assigned 2,505,138 ordinary
shares of the Company, representing a 10% equity interest in the
Company, for the establishment of share option plans and/or share award
plans, known as ECP I, ECP II and ECP III. Subsequently, share option
plans and/or share award plans, known as ECP IV, ECP V, ECP VI and ECP
VII were established.


Eligible employees, directors and consultants under ECP I are entitled
to purchase common shares of Global Sources Ltd. at a price determined
by the plan committee at the time of the grant. The exercise price of
these options may be below the fair market value of the Company's
ordinary shares. The plan committee determines who will receive, and
the terms of, the options.


Optionees may pay for ordinary shares purchased upon exercise of
options in the manner determined by the plan committee at the time of
grant.


Eligible employees, directors and consultants under ECP II were
entitled to purchase common shares of Global Sources Ltd. at an
exercise price determined by the plan committee at the time of the
grant. There are two types of options under this plan. The exercise
price of both of these options were below the fair market value of the
Company's ordinary shares at that time. The plan committee determines
who will receive, and the terms of, the options. Employees could decide
whether to take up the options for a period of 95 days ending June 29,
2000. All the options granted were exercised. Optionees were able to
pay for ordinary shares purchased upon exercise of options by check to
the trust. Payment has been made to the Trust. Entitlement of the
employees, directors and consultants to these common shares is subject
to employment and vesting terms.


-65-





Eligible employees, directors and consultants under ECP III were
awarded a defined amount of compensation payable in Global Sources Ltd.
common shares, the number of which were determined by dividing the
amount of compensation awarded by an amount determined by the plan
committee prior to the Share Exchange.


Entitlement of the employees to these common shares is subject to
employment and vesting terms.


The non-cash compensation expense associated with awards in accordance
with APB 25 and SFAS 123, under ECP II and ECP III of approximately
$2,948 and $2,357, respectively, are recognized ratably over the three
year vesting term from the respective award dates.


Eligible employees, directors and consultants under ECP IV are awarded
a defined amount of compensation payable in Global Sources Ltd. common
shares, the number of which are determined by the plan committee
periodically.


Entitlement of the employees, directors and consultants to these common
shares is subject to employment and vesting terms.


Eligible employees, directors and consultants under ECP V were awarded
a one-time grant of shares, the number of which were determined by the
plan committee.


Entitlement of the employees to these common shares is subject to
employment and vesting terms.


The Equity Compensation Plan committee approved the awards of common
shares under ECP IV and ECP V on January 23, 2001. The Equity
Compensation Plan committee approved additional awards of common shares
under ECP IV on April 1, 2001 and July 1, 2001 and under ECP V on
January 1, 2002.


The non-cash compensation expenses associated with the above awards in
accordance with APB 25 and SFAS 123, under ECP IV and ECP V of
approximately $3,086 and $1,940, respectively, are recognized over the
five year vesting term from the respective award dates.


Eligible employees, directors and consultants under ECP VI are awarded
a one-time grant of Global Sources Ltd. common shares, the number of
which are determined by the plan committee.


Entitlement of the employees, directors and consultants to these common
shares is subject to non-compete and vesting terms.


The Equity Compensation Plan committee approved ECP VI on March 13,
2001 and made awards of common shares under plan on various dates
during the year 2001 and 2002.


The non-cash compensation expenses associated with the awards in
accordance with APB 25 and SFAS 123, under ECP VI totaling to
approximately $433, are recognized over the five year vesting term from
the respective award dates.


Eligible employees, directors and consultants under ECP VII are awarded
a grant of defined number of Global Sources Ltd. common shares, the
number of which are determined by the plan committee periodically.


-66-





The Equity Compensation Plan committee approved the awards of common
shares under ECP VII on January 1, 2002. The non-cash compensation
expenses associated with the above awards in accordance with APB 25 and
SFAS 123, under ECP VII of approximately $538 are recognized over the
six years vesting term from the respective award dates.


Entitlement of the employees, directors and consultants to these common
shares is subject to employment and vesting terms.


The Company expensed $1,689, $2,501 and $2,564 in non-cash compensation
costs associated with the awards under the above ECP plans in the years
ended December 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively.

24.      Directors Stock Option Plan


A Non-executive Director Option Plan was approved on October 26, 2000
by the shareholders of the Company. Each eligible Director on the date
of the first board meeting of each calendar year, commencing in 2001,
would receive the grant of an option to purchase 20,000 common shares
on that date. The Options granted are subject to such terms and
conditions as determined by the Board of Directors at the grant.


-67-





The option price, per share, payable before the end of each February,
is determined by the Board of Directors for each such grant of options.
The non-executive Directors may decline all or part of the award, which
is non-transferable.


The Board granted the first awards under the above plan in 2001. The
option price was fifteen percent less than the average closing price of
the shares for the last five trading days of the previous calendar
year. The award vests over four years with one quarter of the shares
vesting each year. Full payment must be made upon exercising the
option. Upon resignation of an eligible Director, all unvested shares
are forfeited and the option price received for the forfeited unvested
shares is refunded. Only one director accepted the offer on February
10, 2001 for the 20,000 shares granted under option. The $164 received
as proceeds of this plan was included in additional paid-in capital. On
February 28, 2002, the Company issued to the director the 5,000
ordinary shares that vested on that date.


As per the terms of the plan, the Board granted options to all eligible
directors again in February 2002. These awards will vest after four
years. Optionees must pay 15% of the option price, which is the average
closing price of the shares for the last five trading days of year
2001, at the time of exercising the option. The balance of 85% must be
paid on or before the vesting date. The resignation of a Director
following his or her exercise of the Grant of Options and payment of
the Option Price shall not cause a forfeiture of the unvested shares.
All the eligible non-executive Directors accepted the offer before
February 28, 2002. The $50 received towards the 15% of the option price
was included in additional paid-in capital.


The Board granted options to all eligible directors again in February
2003. These awards will vest after four years. Optionees must pay 10%
of the option price, which is the average closing price of the shares
for the last five trading days of year 2002, at the time of exercising
the option. The balance of 90% must be paid on or before the vesting
date. The resignation of a Director following his or her exercise of
the grant of options and payment of the option price shall not cause a
forfeiture of the unvested shares. Three eligible directors accepted
the offer before February 28, 2003.


25.      Credit Facilities


On March 17, 2000, the Company entered into a credit facility with the
Bank of Bermuda (Isle of Man) Limited. The credit facility has a term
of one year and provides for borrowings of up to $25,000, with minimum
borrowings of $1,000. The lender may request security from time to time
to secure borrowings under the credit facility. The credit facility
bears interest, payable quarterly in arrears, at the London Inter-Bank
Market Rate plus 0.5%. The Parent Company has guaranteed all of the
Company's obligations under the credit facility.


On March 20, 2002, the credit facility was renewed for $10,000 for one
more year subject to the same terms and conditions as applicable to the
original facility.


As of December 31, 2001 and 2002, the outstanding principal amount
under this credit facility was $NIL.


This credit facility was renewed for $10,000 for a further one year
period on March 7, 2003, subject to the same terms and conditions as
applicable to the original facility.


-68-





The Company also holds a Documentary Credit facility with the Hongkong
and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited, for providing documentary
credits to the Company's suppliers. This facility has a maximum limit
of $800. One of the Company's fellow subsidiaries has guaranteed the
Company's obligations under the credit facility. As at December 31,
2002, the unutilized amount under this facility was approximately $713.
