By using high-powered, low-frequency terrestrial-based technology instead of low-power satellite systems, we help provide assured position, navigation and timing services for telecommunications, financial, energy, transportation, and military clients on a worldwide basis.Our eLoran systems and services are complementary to and can be fully integrated with existing GPS and all other GNSS systems currently in the planning stages or already in use in other countries. Our technology strengthens the ability to protect and receive GPS signals regardless of location or terrain. Timing is crucial to finance, telecommunications, electrical grid and transportation companies.  The high-powered low-frequency terrestrial-based system created by UrsaNav uses eLoran signals to penetrate skyscraper walls without the need for external antennas. Our solution cuts the cost of installing and leasing expensive roof space and antennas. Using this system we are able to get precise time into large metropolitan buildings. Whether you are in a crowded Wall Street trading floor, on open waters aboard a ship, or in a densely wooded forest, UrsaNav gets you to your target destination safely, securely, and accurately. Our customers can rely on UrsaNav for technology to safeguard business interests and national security. We live in a time where innovative technology is changing our world, such as driverless cars, drones and other unmanned vehicles. In that landscape, UrsaNav’s eLoran navigation equipment provides a complementary service to the GPS system that protects critical transportation, military and economic infrastructure.

Political offices[edit]
On May 1, 1976, Bartlett was defeated as a delegate in the Republican presidential primary pledged to then U.S. President Gerald R. Ford, Jr. His defeat occurred ironically in Texas's 3rd congressional district, which he later represented in Congress. Victory went to a slate of delegates pledged to Ronald W. Reagan and headed by future State Senator John N. Leedom and Barbara Staff, one of three Reagan co-chairmen in the Texas campaign that year.[3][4]
Bartlett served as a U.S. Representative from 1983 until his resignation in 1991.[5] He won the open seat over former state Representative Kay Bailey Hutchison, later the state treasurer, U.S. senator, and an unsuccessful gubernatorial candidate. The position became vacant when the long-term incumbent, James M. Collins ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate against the Democrat Lloyd M. Bentsen, Jr., of Houston.
While in Congress, Bartlett served as a member of the House Banking Committee, where he "led the successful push to let the market set interest rates on government-insured mortgages."[1] He served as Deputy Whip and was a sponsor or principal cosponsor of nearly 20 major pieces of legislation,[citation needed] including the Enhanced Secondary Mortgage Market Act, Fair Labor Standards Act Reforms, FHA Deregulation and the Americans with Disabilities Act.[6]
Bartlett left the House when he was elected to the nonpartisan position as mayor of Dallas. As mayor, Bartlett led an effort to reduce violent crime and adopted a $5 billion capital improvements plan. He worked to significantly improve an economic revitalization, a downtown renaissance, and 30,000 new residential units in or adjacent to downtown Dallas.[citation needed] Bartlett served as the city's executive until 1995.
Private sector and lobbying[edit]
Bartlett was hired to head the Financial Services Roundtable in 1999.[1] In 2012, he was replaced as president and CEO by former Republican presidential candidate and the former Governor Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota.[7]
Following his government service, Bartlett served on a number of boards of directors, including IMCO Recycling, Kaufman and Broad Home Corporation, Sun Coast Industrial and the YMCA of Metropolitan Washington. In addition, he also served on the Board of Governors of the National YMCA, the Fannie Mae National Advisory Council and the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport Board. In 2001 he served on the President's Commission on Excellence in Special Education.[8]
Bartlett has been recognized for his leadership skills by the National Association of Manufacturers, National Federation of Independent Business; Ebony, Essence, and Jet magazines; Texas Association for Retarded Citizens; Anti-Defamation League; National Council of La Raza; American Electronics Association; Watchdogs of the Treasury; and Best Dad by the NF Foundation.[2]
In 2011, Bartlett earned about $2 million a year at Financial Services Roundtable.[1]
Other activities[edit]
Bartlett has served as an adjunct professor at the University of Texas Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs and as a member of the Leadership Group on U.S.-Muslim Engagement.[9]
Personal life[edit]
Bartlett was born in Los Angeles, California and reared in Lockhart, Texas. He attended Kimball High School in Dallas, where he met his future wife at a Young Republicans bake sale;[1] he graduated in 1966.[5] Barlett attended the University of Texas at Austin, where he received a B.A. in 1971.[5] He also became a member of Sigma Phi Epsilon.
Bartlett is married to the former Gail Coke; the Bartletts have three children and three grandchildren.[2]

Political offices[edit]
On May 1, 1976, Bartlett was defeated as a delegate in the Republican presidential primary pledged to then U.S. President Gerald R. Ford, Jr. His defeat occurred ironically in Texas's 3rd congressional district, which he later represented in Congress. Victory went to a slate of delegates pledged to Ronald W. Reagan and headed by future State Senator John N. Leedom and Barbara Staff, one of three Reagan co-chairmen in the Texas campaign that year.[3][4]
Bartlett served as a U.S. Representative from 1983 until his resignation in 1991.[5] He won the open seat over former state Representative Kay Bailey Hutchison, later the state treasurer, U.S. senator, and an unsuccessful gubernatorial candidate. The position became vacant when the long-term incumbent, James M. Collins ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate against the Democrat Lloyd M. Bentsen, Jr., of Houston.
While in Congress, Bartlett served as a member of the House Banking Committee, where he "led the successful push to let the market set interest rates on government-insured mortgages."[1] He served as Deputy Whip and was a sponsor or principal cosponsor of nearly 20 major pieces of legislation,[citation needed] including the Enhanced Secondary Mortgage Market Act, Fair Labor Standards Act Reforms, FHA Deregulation and the Americans with Disabilities Act.[6]
Bartlett left the House when he was elected to the nonpartisan position as mayor of Dallas. As mayor, Bartlett led an effort to reduce violent crime and adopted a $5 billion capital improvements plan. He worked to significantly improve an economic revitalization, a downtown renaissance, and 30,000 new residential units in or adjacent to downtown Dallas.[citation needed] Bartlett served as the city's executive until 1995.
Private sector and lobbying[edit]
Bartlett was hired to head the Financial Services Roundtable in 1999.[1] In 2012, he was replaced as president and CEO by former Republican presidential candidate and the former Governor Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota.[7]
Following his government service, Bartlett served on a number of boards of directors, including IMCO Recycling, Kaufman and Broad Home Corporation, Sun Coast Industrial and the YMCA of Metropolitan Washington. In addition, he also served on the Board of Governors of the National YMCA, the Fannie Mae National Advisory Council and the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport Board. In 2001 he served on the President's Commission on Excellence in Special Education.[8]
Bartlett has been recognized for his leadership skills by the National Association of Manufacturers, National Federation of Independent Business; Ebony, Essence, and Jet magazines; Texas Association for Retarded Citizens; Anti-Defamation League; National Council of La Raza; American Electronics Association; Watchdogs of the Treasury; and Best Dad by the NF Foundation.[2]
In 2011, Bartlett earned about $2 million a year at Financial Services Roundtable.[1]
Other activities[edit]
Bartlett has served as an adjunct professor at the University of Texas Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs and as a member of the Leadership Group on U.S.-Muslim Engagement.[9]
Personal life[edit]
Bartlett was born in Los Angeles, California and reared in Lockhart, Texas. He attended Kimball High School in Dallas, where he met his future wife at a Young Republicans bake sale;[1] he graduated in 1966.[5] Barlett attended the University of Texas at Austin, where he received a B.A. in 1971.[5] He also became a member of Sigma Phi Epsilon.
