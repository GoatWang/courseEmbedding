The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

History[edit]
CornerWorld was founded in 2003[2] as a social network service that provided a way for users to earn revenue from photos, music and videos posted to the site.[3] Building off of an original product called Cornerband,[4] CornerWorld evolved into platform for users to connect with one another using business manager services such as sending and receiving emails, live chats, interactive classified ads and invitations.[2]
In May 2007, CornerWorld officially changed its name to CornerWorld Corporation,[2] and in August of that year became a publicly traded company through a share exchange agreement with Olympic Weddings International, Inc.,[5] a tour company specializing in wedding packages for past Olympic Games cities.[6] In September 2007, CornerWorld entered into a distribution agreement with Napster to increase the exposure to musicians on the site.[7]
In April 2009, as a result of the acquisitions of Enversa Companies and Woodland Holdings, CornerWorld removed their social network from www.cornerworld.com, and rebranded the domain as the corporate website.
Acquisitions[edit]
CornerWorld attempted to purchase Sway, Inc., a social media marketing company, but the deal was cancelled in May 2008 due to CornerWorld's inability to meet the financial terms of the arrangement.[8] In September 2008, CornerWorld acquired Leadstream, LLC, a technology-oriented direct response marketing company that was founded by Marc Pickren.[9] As part of the agreement, Leadstream, LLC merged with Enversa and now operates under the name Enversa Companies, LLC.[10]
On February 23, 2009 CornerWorld completed the acquisition of Woodland Holdings, Ltd, which included Woodland Wireless Solutions, West Michigan Colocation Services, T2TV, Wireless Solutions, Visitatel and T2 Communications.[11] This included acquisition of the 611 Roaming Service patent,[12] which generates revenue by processing over 14 million calls from roaming wireless customers per year and seamlessly transferring them to their service provider.[13] On March 30, 2011, CornerWorld announced that it had completed the terms of the Settlement Agreement with former Woodland Holding Ltd owner and CornerWorld Board member Ned Timmer.[14]

History[edit]
CornerWorld was founded in 2003[2] as a social network service that provided a way for users to earn revenue from photos, music and videos posted to the site.[3] Building off of an original product called Cornerband,[4] CornerWorld evolved into platform for users to connect with one another using business manager services such as sending and receiving emails, live chats, interactive classified ads and invitations.[2]
In May 2007, CornerWorld officially changed its name to CornerWorld Corporation,[2] and in August of that year became a publicly traded company through a share exchange agreement with Olympic Weddings International, Inc.,[5] a tour company specializing in wedding packages for past Olympic Games cities.[6] In September 2007, CornerWorld entered into a distribution agreement with Napster to increase the exposure to musicians on the site.[7]
In April 2009, as a result of the acquisitions of Enversa Companies and Woodland Holdings, CornerWorld removed their social network from www.cornerworld.com, and rebranded the domain as the corporate website.
Acquisitions[edit]
CornerWorld attempted to purchase Sway, Inc., a social media marketing company, but the deal was cancelled in May 2008 due to CornerWorld's inability to meet the financial terms of the arrangement.[8] In September 2008, CornerWorld acquired Leadstream, LLC, a technology-oriented direct response marketing company that was founded by Marc Pickren.[9] As part of the agreement, Leadstream, LLC merged with Enversa and now operates under the name Enversa Companies, LLC.[10]
On February 23, 2009 CornerWorld completed the acquisition of Woodland Holdings, Ltd, which included Woodland Wireless Solutions, West Michigan Colocation Services, T2TV, Wireless Solutions, Visitatel and T2 Communications.[11] This included acquisition of the 611 Roaming Service patent,[12] which generates revenue by processing over 14 million calls from roaming wireless customers per year and seamlessly transferring them to their service provider.[13] On March 30, 2011, CornerWorld announced that it had completed the terms of the Settlement Agreement with former Woodland Holding Ltd owner and CornerWorld Board member Ned Timmer.[14]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
