 Michael Sandonato is an experienced trial lawyer, who has served as lead trial counsel in patent litigations in district courts across the country, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) and arbitrations. He has been praised by clients as a "terrific" lawyer (Chambers 2016) who is “extremely smart and client-focused” (Best Lawyers, 2015) who “always proposes thoughtful and creative strategies” (Legal 500, 2012).Michael is equally adept at representing both patent owners and accused infringers, and has an established reputation as a "winner" who “puts his clients’ needs first” (Best Lawyers, 2015). As one client said, “In my 15 years of working with Mike, I and our executive team have been impressed by the professionalism, legal acumen, attitude and client-focused approach to his work” (Managing Intellectual Property IP Stars, 2015).Michael's clients include Canon, Dentsply Sirona, Prudential and Rohde & Schwarz, among many others. His litigation work has involved technologies such as digital cameras, dental imaging systems, graphical user interfaces, laser toner cartridges, software for managing digital music, smartphones, financial products and electronic test equipment.Michael has lectured on patent law at conferences around the globe, and has spoken on panels along-side the Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the Chief Administrative Law Judge of the ITC, as well as Judges from the Intellectual Property High Court in Japan and the IPR Tribunal of the Supreme People’s Court of China.Michael chairs Fitzpatrick’s Electronic and Computer Technologies practice group and is a member of the firm’s Management Committee. 


 Case Highlight

As a result of that work, Mike and his team secured for Canon the rare and powerful remedy of a General Exclusion Order (GEO) from the ITC on two separate occasions, representing 2 of only 5 GEOs issued in 2013-2015.
