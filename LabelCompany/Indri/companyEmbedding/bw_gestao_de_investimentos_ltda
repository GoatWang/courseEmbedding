Increased Positions
 As revealed in this 13f filing the institutional investor increased its stakes in Vanguard S&P 500 Etf (VOO) by 458% to $26.30 million, Spdr S&P Bank Etf (KBE) by 10% to $4.81 million, Ishares Msci Japan Idx (EWJ) by 5% to $4.91 million, Noble Energy Inc (NBL) by 28% to $998,000 and Amazon.Com Inc (AMZN) by 15% to $1.04 million.

Building positions gradually is normal investing strategy for many institutional investors. 
Fund Sells
This fund got rid of its stakes in Pacific Drilling Sa (PACD), Adr (CIA VALE DO RIO DOCE), Chicago Bridge & Iron (CBI), Spdr Gold Trust (Put) (GLD) and Ocean Rig Udw Inc (ORIG). These securities constituted 5.22%, 1.54%, 1.04%, 0.73% and 0.37% of the manager’s portfolio, respectively. We can only speculate about the reasons for the dumping but we believe it has to do with either value, momentum or a better place for Bw Gestao De Investimentos Ltda’s capital.

Reduced Positions
The fund also reduced its postitons in Ishares Msci Spain Index Fund (EWP) by -9.49%, Oracle Corp (ORCL) by -9.31%, Microsoft Corp (MSFT) by -9.90%, Citigroup Inc (C) by -4.08% and Aon Plc (AON) by -2.20%. 
Top 3 Holdings
Vanguard Ftse Pacific Etf (VPL), Vanguard S&P 500 Etf (VOO) and Vanguard Ftse Developed Etf (VEA) made up the majority of Bw Gestao De Investimentos Ltda’s total US long portfolio in Q1 2015. These holdings were top 3 and constitute 59.78% of Bw Gestao De Investimentos Ltda’s US-listed securities. The top 10 holdings make approximately 73.93% of the investment manager’s portfolio.

 It seems Bw Gestao De Investimentos Ltda holds concentrated portfolio. We wonder do they believe, same as many legendary traders, that diversification is losing investment approach? The picture above provides a summary of Bw Gestao De Investimentos Ltda’s top 10 US-listed securities in Q1 2015. 
Sector Allocation And Analysis
Bw Gestao De Investimentos Ltda increased the finance sector from 65% to 80%. According to the 13f filing, the investment manager also has securities for 2% in the health care sector. The utilities & telecommunications sector is 0% of Bw Gestao De Investimentos Ltda’s 13f reported assets. The fund reduced the Energy, Industrials and Information Technology sector positions by 1%, 4% and 8%, respectively. 
So these are Q1 2015 fund’s sector weights now: finance 80% for $144.73 million, consumer discretionary 5% for $9.05 million, information technology 4% for $7.24 million, industrials 3% for $5.43 million, consumer staples 3% for $5.43 million, health care 2% for $3.62 million, materials 2% for $3.62 million and energy 1% for $1.81 million.
