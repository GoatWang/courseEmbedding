The Appleton Group is an independent Registered Investment Advisor offering objective, unbiased wealth management, research and investment advisory services. As a mid-sized privately held firm, we work to help individuals, families, foundations, corporations and other advisors build and manage more predictable, sustainable and profitable portfolios over time. We’re committed to the long-term economic sustainability of our clients, and work to balance the rewards of investing with the risks of today’s dynamic marketplace.  Contact us!
Ask a Question – In Fact, We Encourage It…Who does Appleton Group typically serve?
Our typical clients are either 1) retirement plan sponsors (such as corporations or government entities), or 2) individuals and/or families.
What services do you offer for retirement plan sponsors?
Appleton Group serves as an ERISA 3(38) Fiduciary, which is the highest level of service to retirement plan sponsors.  We coordinate all aspects of a successful retirement plan, including investment selection and monitoring, administrative oversight, participant education, and sponsor services.  We offer two employer-sponsored retirement plan programs: Wisconsin Select (consisting primarily of in-state service providers), and Appleton Group 401(k) (consisting of service providers located throughout the United States).
What services do you offer for individuals and families?
Appleton Group’s private client services are robust, and include investment planning, strategy selection and monitoring, retirement sustainability analysis, tax-minimization guidance, multi-generational wealth strategies, and more.  These services are typically used by individuals and families with total assets of $250,000 and up.
How much can I expect to pay for your services?
It depends.  For retirement plan sponsors, our annual fees range from 0.10% (for fiduciary services only) to as much as 0.70% (which also includes participant education, administration oversight, sponsor services, etc.).
For private clients services, our annual fees generally range from 1.00% to 1.40% depending on the strategies you choose and the complexity of your particular financial situation.  These fees can sometimes be tax-deductible, and are most often charged directly to your managed account(s).
Who are your competitors?
There are a number of excellent, independent Registered investment Advisors (RIAs) in the State that you might compare us to.  In fact, we’d be more than happy to give you the names and phone numbers of any number of similar firms in Wisconsin at your request.  Wisconsin has many solid advisors and investment managers to choose from, and it’s not at all unusual for us to include other in-state talent in a portfolio (especially in our employer-sponsored retirement plans).
Occasionally, investors might confuse a Registered Investment Advisor (like Appleton Group) with a brokerage firm.  But it’s important to know that brokers are paid to sell securities, which we don’t do.  Instead, we’re required as a fiduciary to offer advice and guidance that’s always in your best interest, and for that important service we’re paid fairly, openly, and with complete transparency at all times.  Investors with few assets can be served well by brokers; but for clients with larger portfolios, a Registered investment Advisor is often a far better choice.




Introducing, the Wisconsin Select 401(k) Program…Discover the Wisconsin Select Program, an employer-sponsored retirement plan platform comprised primarily of in-state investment managers, administrators, advisors and plan fiduciaries.
This important new retirement plan platform is designed to help Wisconsin-domiciled corporations, non-profits and government entities provide a best-in-class employee benefit to their participants.  It’s also built to leverage the exceptional investment management talent in our state, and to serve as a powerful economic development tool for Wisconsin residents.
I want to…

Discover The Appleton Group LLC
The Appleton Group is an independent Registered Investment Advisor offering objective and unbiased wealth management, research and investment advisory services. We are compensated solely for the investment management, research and fiduciary services we provide to our clients, and are in no way compensated by commissions of any kind. As a mid-sized privately held firm, we work to help individuals, families, foundations, and corporations build and manage more predictable, consistent and profitable portfolios over time.
Perhaps one of the most exciting aspects of our firm is the care we’ve taken and the planning we’ve done to successfully serve the institutional marketplace. First, we’ve maintained a commitment to being a highly focused firm, offering a select number of wealth management offerings and clearly identifying areas in which we can add the most value. We’ve invested in our firm’s infrastructure to offer significant scalability, with our current asset capacity in excess of $1.6 billion (as of 12/31/2013). We remain a completely independent firm, ensuring that our wealth management discipline can be repeatedly delivered without conflicts of interest and always with the best interest of investors in mind. We have a culture of compliance that works to anticipate issues ahead of time, and that works closely with regulators and the compliance industry to stay ahead of our competition.
Our staff is experienced and knowledgeable, and we stand ready to serve you.



Our MissionThe Appleton Group LLC’s mission is to serve the private client, institutional and corporate retirement plan communities by offering independent and objective wealth management solutions that prepare for both cooperative and uncooperative market environments. We work daily to produce investor returns that efficiently balance the rewards of investing with the risks of investing. We maintain a culture of compliance, working to anticipate issues before they arise so as to meet the needs of investors and advisors while being fairly compensated for our work.
We Believe…
… in the value of portfolio efficiency, working to adequately reward investors over time while managing the risk of significant market declines;
… in the value of being proactive, anticipating risks and working daily to manage those risks;
… in the value of full diversification as a technique to produce returns that are more consistent and beneficial to the investor;
… in the importance of focusing on the core competency of wealth management alone;
… in creating a culture of compliance in which conflicts of interest are eliminated and in which portfolio performance is reported fairly;
… in the value of transparency, working to create realistic and achievable expectations based on a complete and thorough performance history;
… in the importance of professional relationships with independent third-parties, including regulators, independent auditors, outside counsel, custodians, information technology partners, and advisors.
Investment PhilosophyThe Appleton Group Wealth Management Discipline™ is designed to address an investor’s desire to achieve useful, predictable and meaningful portfolio returns over time with only as much investment risk as is absolutely necessary along the way. It targets net portfolio returns over time that are considered generally necessary for an individual investor to maintain distributions in retirement, for endowments/pensions to meet spending goals in perpetuity, and for pre-retirees to achieve measurable progress toward saving goals.
The Appleton Group Wealth Management Discipline combines three fundamental aspects to successful portfolio management: 1) What to own, 2) How much to own, and 3) When to own. It addresses the importance of investing in both “at-risk assets” and “no-risk assets,” and the importance of adjusting an investor’s exposure to each in response to changing market conditions.
Implementation of The Appleton Group Wealth Management Discipline is designed to be systematic in nature, objective, and most importantly is designed to produce performance characteristics that are predictable and repeatable during various market environments. The discipline seeks to efficiently balance investment risk with investment reward, systematically exposing investors to more “at-risk assets” during periods of sustained market advances, and in turn to more “risk-free assets” during periods of sustained market declines. It seeks to limit portfolio losses during market environments that are unsupportive of at-risk assets, and seeks to achieve significant market correlation during environments that are supportive of at-risk assets.
Although The Appleton Group Wealth Management Discipline prioritizes risk and return management over tax efficiency, our experience has also helped high net-worth and high income investors successfully manage today’s complex tax code.
The Appleton Group Wealth Management Discipline has a measurable performance history through all three market environments (rising markets, falling markets and stagnant markets). This performance history is rigorously documented, and includes all necessary metrics for advisors and investors to objectively evaluate the benefits and limitations of the discipline. Such metrics include mean return (net performance), beta (risk), alpha (value added by manager), standard deviation (predictability), and R-squared (market dependence needed for returns).
Our CommunityAppleton Group’s commitment to our community runs deep. Our firm is an avid supporter of a wide variety of local and state non-profits, including the following:
St. Elizabeth Hospital Community Foundation
Theda Clark Medical Center Foundation
Appleton Medical Center Foundation
Fox Valley Symphony
White Heron Chorale
Trout Museum of Art
Lawrence Academy of Music
Lawrence University – Conservatory of Music

Our Shared Future…
Retirement – it’s something we all look forward to, and getting there should be as easy as possible.
But today’s economy is challenging, and you need a retirement savings plan that’s built with Wisconsin residents in mind. After all, it’s a future that we’re all invested in.
So discover the Wisconsin Select 401(k) program. It’s an employer-sponsored retirement plan built and run primarily by Wisconsin residents like you. From expert plan administration and investment management to fiduciary support and objective investment advice, Wisconsin Select offers it all.








We believe that a prosperous future for all of us is best achieved by using the experience and dedication of Wisconsin professionals who share in our love of this great state. From the earliest settlers to our most recent new residents, there’s something special about the Wisconsin values of integrity,  community and shared purpose. We all prosper when we put these values into action, and that’s exactly what Wisconsin Select is about.
For our more than 20,000 in-state businesses, we offer the Wisconsin Select 401(k), but we’re also built for non-profit employers in the form of a 403(b) and for most public school district and other government employees as a 457(b). Together, these three structures offer a comprehensive retirement plan experience available to nearly three million in-state workers.

Creates and oversees easy-to-use investment fund lineup

Since 1999, the Center has served as the standards-setting body of fi360, the investment industry’s leading source of insights, education, and advocacy on all aspects of fiduciary responsibility.  The Center’s team of subject matter experts includes experienced investment professionals, attorneys,  technologists, and educators, all of whom share a commitment to promoting the widespread adoption of the fiduciary standard and helping advisors deliver the highest level of service to plan sponsors and their participants.

Investment Management…
Named a “Mutual Fund Mecca” by Bloomberg News in 2012, Wisconsin boasts a deep roster of successful, highly-ranked investment managers. Who knew? By combining in-state talent with nationally recognized exchange-traded fund sponsors, Wisconsin Select achieves a highly competitive and cost-effective comprehensive lineup that meets your participant needs.
And Wisconsin Select offers what few other programs do: risk-managed strategies built right into the lineup at no additional cost.  This feature helps participants to better navigate today’s dynamic markets, taking advantage of market opportunities while simultaneously managing investment risk along the way (a fiduciary need that many plan sponsors often overlook).

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 09/17/2007
            

                BBB has determined that The Appleton Group, LLC meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                            4. complete the required application and pay all monetary obligations to BBB in a timely manner
                        









Advertise Honestly









            Adhere to established standards of advertising and selling.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Appleton Coated to acquire Spectra Jet business06/06/2017Combined Locks, Wis. (June 6, 2017) � Doug Osterberg, President and Chief Executive Officer of Appleton Coated LLC, and Guy Spinelli, President and Chief Executive Officer of Spectra Jet Inc., announce that they have entered into an agreement for Appleton Coated to acquire the principal business of Spectra Jet Inc., a developer and distributor of sublimation transfer papers headquartered in Woodstock, Illinois.  The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2017.  However, beginning immediately, Appleton Coated and Spectra Jet will both promote Spectra Jet�s Silverback3 brand of sublimation papers and associated products through a coordinated sales and marketing program. 
Spectra Jet Inc. was founded in 2006 by its current owners, Guy Spinelli and Paul DeWyngaert.  Since 2015, Appleton Coated has been the exclusive producer, for Spectra Jet, of Silverback3 paper, a product that utilizes Spectra Jet�s proprietary technology. The paper is produced at Appleton Coated�s manufacturing facility in Combined Locks, Wisconsin. 
Sublimation transfer paper, such as Silverback3, is used to produce images on textiles or other treated materials.   In this process, an image is printed, often utilizing inkjet technology, onto the paper, and then a heat press is used to sublimate the image to the fabric or other material.  �The combination of our technology and experience in this business with Appleton Coated�s manufacturing expertise is working well, and we agreed it was time to take our partnership to the next level,� commented Guy Spinelli, Spectra Jet�s president.  �This provides our customers with a consistent source of supply coupled with the reliability and service platform that a high quality North American paper mill can provide,� he continued.   
�We are excited to integrate Spectra Jet�s high performance sublimation transfer products into our diverse product portfolio,� commented John Mazuroski, Appleton Coated�s Vice President of Uncoated and Specialty Products.  �Appleton Coated�s unique manufacturing capabilities combined with our sales and service network will allow us to reach and serve more customers effectively,� he added. Spinelli and DeWyngaert have agreements with Appleton Coated to remain with the business after the transaction closes.
