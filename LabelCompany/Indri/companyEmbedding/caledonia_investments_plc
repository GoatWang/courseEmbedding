Welcome
Caledonia is a self-managed investment trust company with net assets of £1.9bn. Our heritage can be traced back to the shipping empire established by Sir Charles Cayzer in 1878. We continue to enjoy the backing of the Cayzer family, who own some 48.5% of the share capital. The Cayzer family shareholding provides both support to our long term value investment horizon and provides a foundation to our culture of conservative generational wealth management.
Caledonia maintains a concentrated portfolio of international investments and funds. These are organised as pools of capital, with clearly agreed objectives and strategy. We believe in good transparent governance, keeping our promises and behaving properly. We are unique, not for what we do but for what we are and how we do it.
We invest our own capital: in people, not assets. We back high quality management teams with drive and the proven ability to generate exceptional long term shareholder value. We are supportive, because we are likely to be working with them for the long term.

Funds
Introduction
The Funds pool contains investments in private and public equity funds in the UK, Europe, US and Asia. Investment through funds enables us to broaden our geographic and sector spread, by taking advantage of managers' specialist knowledge and ensures exposure to areas of the world where we are less willing to invest directly.The nature of the longer term investment process within the Funds pool requires the continuous origination and investment in new funds, to ensure both effective vintage management and a balance between maturing funds and those at the initial stages, where returns are naturally phased to later years.

As per service industry reports of a global survey, it has become a multibillion dollar industry worldwide. The service industry is today not only a one point function but have multiple tasks included in it. It gives you access to various other utility functionaries as most of the services are interconnected today i.e.: Just by calling your cell phone operator you can also access your movie tickets, travel planners and online shopping portals. Therefore it won�t be wrong to say that the service sector has today become a prominent feature for the smooth flowing of the economy of a nation as huge volumes of business just depend on this sector.

United States of America (For the Federal Trade Commission), Plaintiff, v. Caledonia Investments plc, Defendant. 

      FTC Matter/File Number:
    

        151 0123      



      Civil Action Number:
    

        1:16-cv-01620

        Civil Penalty (7a)      



      Federal Court:
    

        District of Columbia      


    Case Summary  

Investment trust Caledonia Investments plc agreed to pay $480,000 in civil penalties to resolve charges that it violated federal premerger reporting laws by failing to report its purchase in 2014 of voting shares in the helicopter services company Bristow Group, Inc. According to the complaint, in June 2008, Caledonia first acquired voting shares in Bristow and reported its purchase to U.S. antitrust authorities, as required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. Subsequently, Caledonia made additional purchases that were exempt from reporting under HSR rules. During that same timeframe, however, two Caledonia employees were designated to serve on Bristow’s board. Bristow awards restricted-stock voting securities to its board members, and by agreement, it set aside the securities for the two Caledonia board members for purchase by Caledonia. In February 2014, these voting shares vested, and Caledonia acquired them, according to the complaint. The Commission charged that Caledonia was required under the HSR Act to report this purchase but failed to do so. The HSR Act allows a company that has reported an initial purchase of voting shares to purchase additional voting shares from the same issuer – as long as those purchases do not cause the company’s total holdings to cross a higher reporting threshold over a five-year period following the initial purchase. The complaint charges that Caledonia’s 2014 purchase of voting shares in Bristow fell outside the five-year period following its initial purchase.

Caledonia Investments - Wikipedia





















 






Caledonia Investments

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search


Caledonia Investments plc (LSE: CLDN) is a UK investment trust company based in London and is premium listed on the London Stock Exchange.

Operations[edit]
Caledonia is a self-managed investment trust. It takes significant holdings in listed equities, private companies and funds. Taking a long term investment approach, Caledonia Investments is a value investor with a global outlook. Roderick Kent is the chairman and Will Wyatt the chief executive.[1]
History[edit]
The company which became Caledonia Investments was incorporated in 1928 as the Foreign Railways Investment Trust Ltd.[2] It was acquired by the Cayzer family in 1951 to hold their diverse interests and was renamed Caledonia Investments Ltd.[2] In 1955 Caledonia acquired the Cayzer family's interest in the British & Commonwealth Shipping Co. Ltd, formed out of the merger of Clan Line (started by the Cayzer family in 1881) and Union-Castle Line.[3] In 1960 the company was listed on the London Stock Exchange and in 1981 their name was changed to Caledonia Investments PLC. After their holding in British & Commonwealth was sold in 1987, Caledonia Investments became a diversified trading and investment company,[2] which in turn was converted into a UK Investment trust company on 1 April 2003.[4] The Cayzer family collectively owns some 48% of the share capital of Caledonia Investments plc.[5]

Caledonia Investments

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search


Caledonia Investments plc (LSE: CLDN) is a UK investment trust company based in London and is premium listed on the London Stock Exchange.

Operations[edit]
Caledonia is a self-managed investment trust. It takes significant holdings in listed equities, private companies and funds. Taking a long term investment approach, Caledonia Investments is a value investor with a global outlook. Roderick Kent is the chairman and Will Wyatt the chief executive.[1]
History[edit]
The company which became Caledonia Investments was incorporated in 1928 as the Foreign Railways Investment Trust Ltd.[2] It was acquired by the Cayzer family in 1951 to hold their diverse interests and was renamed Caledonia Investments Ltd.[2] In 1955 Caledonia acquired the Cayzer family's interest in the British & Commonwealth Shipping Co. Ltd, formed out of the merger of Clan Line (started by the Cayzer family in 1881) and Union-Castle Line.[3] In 1960 the company was listed on the London Stock Exchange and in 1981 their name was changed to Caledonia Investments PLC. After their holding in British & Commonwealth was sold in 1987, Caledonia Investments became a diversified trading and investment company,[2] which in turn was converted into a UK Investment trust company on 1 April 2003.[4] The Cayzer family collectively owns some 48% of the share capital of Caledonia Investments plc.[5]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
