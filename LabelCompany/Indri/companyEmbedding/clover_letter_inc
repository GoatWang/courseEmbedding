SEC Staff No-Action Letter (Division of Investment Management): Clover Capital  Management, Inc., October 28, 1986















Home | Previous Page






























SEC Staff No-Action Letter, Clover Capital  Management, Inc.
Pub. Avail. October 28, 1986
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20549
October 28, 1986
RESPONSE OF THE OFFICE OF CHIEF COUNSEL 
DIVISION OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT
Our Ref. No. 86-264-CC 
Clover Capital Management, Inc. 
File No. 801-27041 
Your letter of June 3, 1986, requests our assurance that we would not recommend any enforcement action to the Commission under Rule 206(4)-1(a)(5) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Act") if Clover Capital Management, Inc. ("Clover"), a registered investment adviser, uses investment results derived from a "model" portfolio in advertisements (hereinafter "model results").  As described more fully in your letter, the model portfolio was established by Clover on January 1, 1985, and consists of the same securities that Clover recommended to clients during that time period.  As your letter notes, Clover's investment approach incorporates the philosophy that all of its clients should invest in the same securities, with variances in specific client objectives being addressed via the asset allocation process (i.e., the relative weighting of stocks, bonds, and cash equivalents in each account).  Thus, while the model results do not correspond directly to the results achieved by any actual client account, Clover has managed the model portfolio with the same investment philosophy it uses for client accounts.  Because of the significant degree of interest in this issue, and in the related issue of advisers using actual investment results of client accounts under management in advertisements (hereinafter "actual results"), we wish to take this opportunity to set forth the staff's views on these issues. 
Section 206 of the Act prohibits certain transactions by any investment adviser, whether registered or exempt from registration pursuant to Section 203(b) of the Act.  Under paragraph (4) of Section 206, the Commission has authority to adopt rules defining acts, practices, and courses of business that are fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative.  Pursuant to this authority, the Commission adopted Rule 206(4)-1, which defines the use of certain specific types of advertisements1 by advisers as fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative.2  Although the rule does not specifically prohibit an adviser from using model or actual results, or prescribe the manner of advertising these results, paragraph (5) of the rule makes it a fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative act for any investment adviser to distribute, directly or indirectly, any advertisement that contains any untrue statement of a material fact or that is otherwise false or misleading.3  Accordingly, the applicable legal standard governing the advertising of model or actual results is that contained in paragraph (5) of the rule, i.e., whether the particular advertisement is false or misleading.4
The staff no longer takes the position, as it did a number of years ago, that the use of model or actual results in an advertisement is per se fraudulent under Section 206(4) and the rules thereunder, particularly Rule 206(4)-1(a)(5).5  Rather, this determination is one of fact, and we believe the use of model or actual results in an advertisement would be false or misleading under Rule 206(4)-1(a)(5) if it implies, or a reader would infer from it, something about the adviser's competence or about future investment results that would not be true had the advertisement included all material facts.6  Any adviser using such an advertisement must ensure that the advertisement discloses all material facts concerning the model or actual results so as to avoid these unwarranted implications or inferences.7  Because of the factual nature of the determination, the staff, as a matter of policy, does not review any specific advertisements.8  Therefore, we express no opinion regarding your proposed advertisements. 
In order to assist advisers who advertise model or actual results, we wish to take this opportunity to set forth certain advertising practices the staff believes are inappropriate under Rule 206(4)-1(a)(5).  The list is not intended to address all advertising practices prohibited by Rule 206(4)-1(a)(5) and does not create a "safe harbor" that may be relied upon by an adviser as an exclusive list of the factors that must be considered in determining the type of disclosure necessary when advertising model or actual results.  Items (1)-(6) below apply to both model and actual results; Items (7)-(10) apply to model results; and Item (11) applies to actual results. 
In the staff's view, Rule 206(4)-1(a)(5) prohibits an advertisement that: 
Model and Actual Results 
(1) Fails to disclose the effect of material market or economic conditions on the results portrayed (e.g., an advertisement stating that the accounts of the adviser's clients appreciated in the value 25% without disclosing that the market generally appreciated 40% during the same period);9
(2) Includes model or actual results that do not reflect the deduction of advisory fees, brokerage or other commissions, and any other expenses that a client would have paid or actually paid; 
(3) Fails to disclose whether and to what extent the results portrayed reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other earnings;
(4) Suggests or makes claims about the potential for profit without also disclosing the possibility of loss;10
(5) Compares model or actual results to an index without disclosing all material facts relevant to the comparison (e.g. an advertisement that compares model results to an index without disclosing that the volatility of the index is materially different from that of the model portfolio);11
(6) Fails to disclose any material conditions, objectives, or investment strategies used to obtain the results portrayed (e.g., the model portfolio contains equity stocks that are managed with a view towards capital appreciation); 
(7) Fails to disclose prominently the limitations inherent in model results,12 particularly the fact that such results do not represent actual trading and that they may not reflect the impact that material economic and market factors might have had on the adviser's decision-making if the adviser were actually managing clients' money; 
(8) Fails to disclose, if applicable, that the conditions, objectives, or investment strategies of the model portfolio changed materially  during the time period portrayed in the advertisement and, if so, the effect of any such change on the results portrayed;
(9) Fails to disclose, if applicable, that any of the securities contained in, or the investment strategies followed with respect to, the model portfolio do not relate, or only partially relate, to the type of advisory services currently offered by the adviser (e.g., the model includes some types of securities that the adviser no longer recommends for its clients);13
(10) Fails to disclose, if applicable, that the adviser's clients had investment results materially different from the results portrayed in the model;   
Actual Results
(11) Fails to disclose prominently, if applicable, that the results portrayed relate only to a select group of the adviser's clients, the basis on which the selection was made, and the effect of this practice on the results portrayed, if material.14
We wish to emphasize that: (1) it is the responsibility of every adviser using model or actual results to ensure that the advertisement is not false or misleading; (2) the list set forth above of advertising practices the staff believes are prohibited by Rule 206(4)-1(a)(5) is not intended to be all-inclusive or to provide a safe harbor; and (3) the staff, as a matter of policy, will not review specific advertisements. 
As we agreed, this response will be made public immediately. 
Thomas P. Lemke 
Chief Counsel 
1 Rule 206(4)-1(b) generally defines an "advertisement" to include any communication addressed to more than one person that offers any investment advisory service with regard to securities.
2 For example, Rule 206(4)-1 prohibits an adviser from using advertisements that include testimonials (paragraph (a)) or that refer to past specific recommendations unless certain information is provided (paragraph (b)).  The staff is currently reviewing Rule 206(4)-1 to determine whether it needs to be revised or updated.  See Investment Advisers Act Rel. No. 1033 (Aug. 6, 1986).
3 As a general matter, whether any advertisement is false or misleading will depend on the particular facts and circumstances surrounding its use, including (1) the form as well as the content of the advertisement, (2) the implications or inferences arising out of the advertisement in its total context, and (3) the sophistication of the prospective client.  See, e.g., Covato/ Lipsitz, Inc. (pub. avail. Oct. 23, 1981)("Covato"); Edward F. O'Keefe (pub. avail. Apr. 13, 1978)("O'Keefe"); Anametrics Investment Management (pub. avail. May 5, 1977)("Anametrics").
4 Of course, if an advertisement containing model or actual results also includes any of the specific advertising practices addressed by paragraphs (a)(1)-(a)(4) of the Rule 206(4)-1, the advertisement would have to comply with the requirements of these paragraphs.
5 See, e.g., A. R. Schmeidler & Co. (pub. avail. June 1, 1976); Schield Stock Services, Inc. (pub. avail. Feb. 26, 1972).
6 See, e.g., Anametrics, Covato, and O'Keefe, supra noted 3.
7 Id.
8 See, e.g., Anametrics, supra note 3.
9 Id.
10 See F. Eberstadt & Co., Inc. (pub. avail. July 2, 1978). 
11 See, e.g., Anametrics, supra note 3; Multinational Investments, Inc. (pub. avail. Sept. 17, 1977).
12 With respect to model results, the staff recognizes that advisers may wish to advertise model results derived from model portfolios that differ in form and structure from that presented by your letter.  We believe that to the extent it is more difficult to verify or objectively test the criteria underlying the model portfolio in question, the disclosure obligation of the adviser would correspondingly increase.

Pittsford, New York 14531 
(716) 385-6000 
June 3, 1986
Mr. Thomas P. Lemke, Chief Counsel 
Division of Investment Management 
Securities & Exchange Commission 
450 5th Street N.W. 
Washington, D.C. 20549
Dear Mr. Lemke: 
Clover Capital  Management, Inc. is an investment counseling firm registered with the S.E.C. under the Investment Advisors Act of 1940.  I have enclosed a copy of a letter we recently received from Mr. Frank Morrison of the S.E.C.'s New York City office informing us that our use of a Model Portfolio for tracking the firm's investment record violates Rule 206 (4)-1(a)(5).  In a subsequent telephone conversation with Mr. Dolan, an associate of Mr. Morrison's, we were made aware that your office has the authority to rule on such matters on a case-by-case basis and to issue "No Action Letters," where warranted.  Please consider our case based on the following information: 
 1. Clover Capital Management, Inc. is an investment management firm founded in October, 1984 by Michael E. Jones, CFA and Geoffrey Rosenberger, CFA.  We had several very successful years experience as investment analysts and portfolio managers at the firm of Manning and Napier Advisors, Inc..  In starting our new firm, we were faced with the dilemma of providing prospective clients with an understanding of our prior and current investment results and style of management.  In dealing with this problem, we aspired to maintain the highest possible ethical standards.  Thus, we have not represented our previous firm's record as our own or as an indication of Clover Capital Management's ability. We have choosen to forego discussion of our specific results on clients prior to forming Clover Capital.  However, as you know, the issue of demonstrating the firm's competence and style of management is important in presenting our service to prospective clients.  Our problem is to find a way to show what we are doing in our research and management effort at Clover Capital Management, Inc., without violating client confidentiality and without misrepresenting our performance to the public. 
One approach to this problem involves presenting the performance achieved among our account base.  However, the securities markets have been quite volatile in the past 18 months and our client based has grown consistently each month.  As a result, a portfolio that started in January, 1985 has different results than one we began in September, 1985.  To take an arithmetic average of each client's actual results and present that as the firm's track record would be misleading due to the significant standard deviation from client to client based on date of entry to our firm's management. 
On the other hand, to just pick one or two client portfolios would be equally misleading because of differences in the timing of cash flows, specific client objectives and other considerations which may be unique to a small sample of accounts.  We recognized at the outset that this would be the case.  We also recognized this presentation of results would not satisfy questions on portfolio construction and investment style with respect to diversification, portfolio beta, asset allocation and related items.  The raw results would also be impossible to verify without violating client confidentiality. 
The most accurate, verifiable reflection of our true investment product, in light of these circumstances, was to establish a Model Portfolio as of January 1, 1985, which we would manage exactly as we would a tax-exempt client portfolio with no restrictions as to income and without any cash flow into or out of the fund. 
 2. The securities purchased and sold in the Model Portfolio are also purchased and sold in our client accounts under management at the time of the transaction. It is important to note that our investment approach incorporates the philosophy that all of our clients should own the same stock selections, with variances in specific client objectives being addressed via the asset allocation process (the relative weightings of stocks, bonds and cash equivalents in each account).  For example, when we make a decision to invest in a common stock, we also decide what percentage of each client's assets we wish to commit to that particular equity.  Differences in client objectives are reflected in the weightings placed for each account.  Most of our accounts are tax exempt retirement funds with conservative objectives and therefore receive similar weightings.  However some clients have differing objectives due to current income requirements, moral considerations, tax considerations, "equities only" restrictions, and other factors which may alter the weightings in specific investments.  The Model Portfolio weightings are determined according to it's stated hypothetical structure as a conservative pension fund. 
 3. We have taken extensive steps to insure that the reporting format is an objective one.  The independent accounting firm of Davie, Kaplan & Braverman was hired to audit our efforts in this effort.  To place a purchase or sale transaction, we call Davie, Kaplan & Braverman prior to the 9:30 a.m. market opening.  All transactions are assumed to occur at the prior day's closing price as listed in the Wall Street Journal, which Davie Kaplan & Braverman can easily verify.  Commissions are charged against each transaction based on a 35% discount from the Cowen & Co. commission schedule, which is roughly the same commission expense level we incur in our client accounts.  Investment management fees are also charged against the portfolio in line with our standard client fee schedule. 
 4. In addition to monitoring the purchase and sale transactions in the Model Portfolio, Davie, Kaplan & Braverman also accounts for the dividend and interest income, commission charges and investment management fee reimbursement in the portfolio.  The quarterly investment performance reports are also compiled and issued by Davie Kaplan & Braverman, not by  Clover Capital  Management, Inc. There is a measure of independence and objectivity to our Model Portfolio Report and its calculations which may be lacking in the investment performance figures reported by other investment management firms. 
 5. We feel it is important that prospective clients see how the investment returns being presented to them were achieved.  Use of the Model Portfolio allows people to see what stocks we hold and what the recent transaction activity in the account has been.  They can develop a feel for our investment style that would otherwise be difficult to achieve prior to entering into a relationship with our firm. 
 6. The only reference the report makes to investment results is on an absolute return basis.  The report only records a percentage increase in asset value.  It makes no comparisons to any stock or bond market indexes.   We believe that, for the above reasons, our Model Portfolio report provides an excellent proxy for our investment approach and track record.  However, we also understand the Commission's concern about the potential for misunderstanding of the Model's purpose on the part of the public.  Therefore, we are willing to incorporate the following statement (or a similar version which you may prefer) into our report: 
"The Clover Capital Management, Inc. Model Portfolio represents a fictional account which Clover Capital Management, Inc. ("CCM") attempts to manage in a manner similar to that of a tax-exempt client fund with no need for special portfolio considerations.  The investment objective for this portfolio over a four year time period is to exceed, by at least 3%, the compound annual rate of return available on a Treasury Note with a four year maturity and at the same time to limit volatility in such a way as to avoid the incurrance of a negative return during any calendar year. 
It is CCM's intention to own the same securities in each client portfolio with similar objectives.  Securities transactions will not be undertaken in the Model Portfolio until at least half the existing accounts under management have completed the contemplated transaction.  However, circumstances such as market fluctuations may exist which may prevent an individual CCM client from owning one or more of the specific securities held in the Model Portfolio.
Since the account is fictional, there can be no assurance that a CCM client would have achieved similar rates of return over the same time frame.  In addition, since the time period in question is a historical one, there can be no assurance that future results achieved by the firm's clients will in any way resemble those represented by the Model Portfolio." 
We believe that use of the Model Portfolio is the most valid approximation we can provide a prospective client as to what our investment activity has been since January 1, 1985.  While no form of investment performance measurement is entirely without fault, of all those available to us this approach is the one which provides the least amount of bias.  We therefore respectfully request that you confirm that you will not recommend enforcement action if we continue to use the Model Portfolio in the manner stated in this letter and with the explanatory and disclaimer language found in the enclosed Model Portfolio copy. 
Your assistance in this matter is most appreciated.  If you have any questions, please call either me or Michael E. Jones, at 716-385-6090. 
Sincerely, 
Clover Capital  Management, Inc.
by Geoffrey Rosenberger, President

The good news is that your training will teach you everything you need to know to succeed on the job. But there are a few skills you should have from the get-go: You’re a fun and friendly person who values customers and takes absolute pride in everything you do. Communication skills are key – you’re not going to be able to text message customers back and forth. In other words, you should be comfortable talking to strangers. You’ve got attitude - the right kind of course - and understand the need to be on time, all the time. With loads of energy, you understand that work is easier – and more fun – with some teamwork. And you’re at least 16 years old – 18 if you want to be a driver. Keep in mind, this is just basic information. You’ll find out more after you apply. And independently-owned franchised or licensed locations may have different requirements.

Teeter Creek Herbs, Inc  5/21/13
  Department of Health and Human ServicesPublic Health ServiceFood and Drug Administration Kansas City DistrictSouthwest Region8050 Marshall Drive, Suite 205Lenexa, Kansas 66214Telephone: (913) 495-5100MAY 21, 2013WARNING LETTERHand Delivered Ref. – 2013-09 Mr. Robert M. Liebert, OwnerMrs. Janice M. Liebert, OwnerTeeter Creek Herbs, Inc.Rt. 5, Box 1126Ava, MO 65608 Dear Mr. and Mrs. Liebert: On January 31 through February 11, 2013, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigators inspected your dietary supplement manufacturing facility located at Rt. 5, Box 1126, Ava, MO. During the inspection, our investigators identified significant violations of the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations for dietary supplements, Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 111 (21 CFR Part 111). These violations cause dietary supplements manufactured at your facility adulterated within the meaning of Section 402(g)(1) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. §342(g)(1)] in that the dietary supplements have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet CGMP regulations for dietary supplements. Our investigators’ observations were noted on form FDA-483, Inspectional Observations, which was issued to you on February 11, 2013. Additionally, our investigators collected and reviewed samples of the labeling of your dietary supplement products during the inspection of your facility. We also reviewed labeling on your website at www.teetercreekherbs.com in March 2013. Based on our review of your product labeling, we have determined that your Lymphaid, Astragalus, Pau d Arco, Violet, Sheep Sorrel, Blood Build, Red Clover, Yellow Dock, and Immunaid products are promoted for conditions that cause them to be drugs within the meaning of section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B)]. The therapeutic claims on your labeling establish that the products are drugs because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. Further, your Mistletoe and Burdock Root dietary supplement products are misbranded under section 403 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343] because they do not comply with FDA’s labeling regulations under 21 CFR Part 101.  In addition, if your Immunaid, Blood Build, Lymphaid, Astragalus, Pau d’Arco, Yellow Dock, Violet, Sheep Sorrel, and Red Clover products did not have disease claims, which make these products drugs, they would also be misbranded for the same reason. We acknowledge receipt of your letter, dated February 21, 2013, and address it below. You may find the Act and the FDA’s regulations through links on FDA’s home page at http://www.fda.gov. Unapproved New Drug Examples of some of the claims observed on your website include: Featured Herb: Astragalus [an ingredient in your Immunaid and Astragulus products]: “They should be considered for those with cancer, those who have had long-term infections like Hepatitis, as well as by those with auto-immune and allergic … disorders … The herbs include Astragalus, Maitake, Shiitake, Reishi and Turkey Tail mushrooms, Elecampane, and Ginseng.”“Astragalus is … for those with chronic immune deficiencies leading to re-current infections; including viral infections.”“It is also a valuable aid in recovery from infectious diseases.”“[P]rograms for cancer emphasize blood-purifying and detoxifying herbs….best results when the immune reserve builders are used. The immune system is the body’s own defense against cancer. Maitake has been shown to … have a number of important anti-cancer and anti-tumor compounds. Shitake and Turkey Tail as well. Astragalus has been show in studies to bring back the immune system after chemo- and radiation therapy.“Astragalus and the mushrooms … valuable for those with any form of chronic Hepatitis or … for those who have been taking chemo or other drug therapy.” Featured Herb: Dandelion [an ingredient in your Blood Build product]: “The leaves have … relieve high blood pressure.”“It is an aid in…hepatitis, gall bladder…formation of stones...”“[A]n aid in food allergies.”“A preventative in high cholesterol and arteriosclerosis.”“Dandelion … A blood purifier for the toxins that aggravate arthritis, rheumatism and gout.”“Used … for chronic metabolic disorders; ...  cirrhosis, both high and low blood sugar, anemia.”“[O]ther uses … for Dandelion include breast conditions (mastitis, breast tumors and cancer) …” Featured Herb: Maitake/Grifolia Mushroom [an ingredient in your Immunaid product]: “Maitake and its extracts … contains a number of anti-tumor and tumor-inhibiting compounds.”“Maitake may be of benefit in cancer, as well as AIDS … [f]or those undergoing chemotherapy … [f]or liver disease … [f]or hypertension, and … diabetes.”“We absolutely do not claim cures for cancer, but have seen some remarkable results with those that have used the Immunaid in conjunction with the Sheep Sorrel Formula, Red Clover extracts … in a number of instances in conjunction with chemo-and other standard therapies …” Featured Herb: Red Clover: “Red Clover … is used for chronic degenerative conditions such as rheumatism and arthritis … it is used in chronic skin conditions such as eczema and allegic [sic] dermatitis …”“Its … properties are used … with … children’s whooping cough.”“Red Clover has a long-standing reputation as a … remedy for cancer. It has also langored long in medical texts as [a] … cancer remedy.”“[C]ompounds such as genistein, a powerful … anti-tumor compound, have been found in Red Clover.”“[A]s an adjunct in cancer. It was one of the herbs in the Hoxsey anti-cancer formula. As a … anti-cancer remedy it should be used freely. A … salve for skin cancers was made by boiling down the blossoms … its traditional uses include use for skin, breast and ovarian cancers …”“Note that its traditional use points to use in some cancers that are estrogen-dependent …” Featured Herb: Violet: “Violet … its use for dry and allergic skin conditions like eczema. It seems to have antihistamine…properties, suggesting its use in other allergic … conditions … its traditional use in asthma.”“This herb has a long tradition as an anti-cancer and anti-tumor … aid.”“[I]ts use … to cure throat cancer…it has been used as an aid in breast, uterine, lung, throat, stomach and colon cancers. Its use in breast cancer is augmented by its lymph-clearing properties. It is also used externally on tumors … particular use by women in cancer.”“Its effects on the lungs make it useful for … chronic bronchitis and asthma …” Featured Herb: Yellow Dock “Yellow Dock and important herb for anemic conditions …”“Food allergies are addressed with Yellow Dock … symptoms of … jaundice call for this herb. Chronic gastritis.”“[T]his herb may be used as an aid for … tumors and cysts … adjunct in cancer … Breast, ovarian and uterine cancer. Combined with Nettles and an herb like Juniper Berry, it … a preventative in gout, and arthritis and rheumatism … aid in eczema …” Traditional Herbal Aids in Health Issues “The following is a list of health issues and some of the herbs and formulas … used as … aids. CANCER- Immunaid Formula (… anti-cancer compounds, effect of chemo.). Sheep Sorrel Formula (anti-tumor …). Yellow Dock... Blood Build Formula (low red count). Lymphaid, Violet …CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME- … ImmunaidCOLD SORES- … ImmunaidECZEMA- … Lymphaid FormulaFIBROCYCSTIC BREAST- … Lymphaid FormulaFIBRO-MYALGIA- … Immunaid FormulaHEPATITIS- … Immunaid FormulaINFECTION- … Astragalus … Pau D’ ArcoLEUKEMIA- … Blood Build FormulaLYME DISEASE- … Immunaid FormulaMENIERE’S DISEASE- … Lymphaid FormulaPSORIASIS- … Immunaid FormulaRINGWORM- … Pau D’ Arco” The products identified above are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and therefore, the products are “new drugs” under section 201(p)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §321(p)(1)]. New drugs may not be legally marketed in the U.S. without prior approval from FDA as described in section 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C §355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data submitted by a drug sponsor to demonstrate that the drug is safe and effective. Furthermore, because these products are offered for conditions that are not amenable to self-diagnosis and treatment by individuals who are not medical practitioners, adequate directions cannot be written so that a layman can use them safely for their intended uses. Thus, the labeling of Lymphaid, Astragalus, Pau d Arco, Yellow Dock, Violet, Sheep Sorrel, Blood Build, Red Clover, Yellow Dock and Immunaid fails to bear adequate directions for their intended uses, causing the products to be misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §352(f)(1)]. The introduction of these products into interstate commerce is a violation of section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)]. Dietary Supplement CGMP Violations:  Even if the products listed above did not have therapeutic claims which make them drugs, your dietary supplement products are adulterated based on the following significant violations:    You failed to qualify a supplier of a component by establishing the reliability of the supplier’s certificate of analysis (COA) through confirmation of the results of the supplier’s tests or examinations, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(a)(2)(ii)(A). Specifically, you relied on a supplier’s COA for the component, (b)(4), used in all dietary supplement products you manufacture and distribute. However, you were unable to provide documentation for the qualification of your supplier for this component and you stated that you were unaware that you were required to establish the reliability of the supplier’s COA prior to using the component in the manufacture of your dietary supplement products.      Your letter dated 2/21/13 is inadequate because you failed to address the qualification of your supplier’s COAs for the component (b)(4), used in the manufacture of all of your dietary supplement products. You failed to establish a specification for any point, step, or stage in the manufacturing process where control is necessary to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(a). Specifically, your firm is conducting organoleptic and/or macroscopic examination on all components, labels and finished products; however, you did not provide any documentation to show that you have established specifications. Your master manufacturing records for your Lymphaid, Bld-Build and Immunaid products did not include specifications for each point, step, or state in the manufacturing process where control is necessary to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement. Consequently, since you failed to establish specifications, it is not possible for you to determine whether your examinations of components, labels, and finished products are appropriate to verify whether specifications are met, in accordance with 21 CFR 111.75. Your letter dated 2/21/13 is inadequate because you failed to include any details regarding establishing specifications. We note that you stated that you will create documents over the next year to provide specifications; however, you did not indicate how you will ensure the quality of your dietary supplement products that are manufactured and distributed prior to the next year when you commit to establishing specifications. You failed to prepare a written master manufacturing record (MMR) for each unique formulation of dietary supplement that you manufacture, and for each batch size, to ensure uniformity in the finished batch from batch to batch, as required by 21 CFR 111.205(a). Specifically, you were not able to provide MMRs for any of your dietary supplement products that you manufacture, other than for Bld-Build, Lymphaid, and Immunaid. Furthermore, the MMRs that you did provide failed to include complete information in accordance with 21 CFR 111.210. For example, You failed to include the strength, concentration, and weight of the dietary supplement to be manufactured, and the measure of each dietary ingredient for each batch size [21 CFR 111.210(a)]. Specifically, your MMR for your Lymphaid product indicated a yield of (b)(4) oz; however, a review of your batch production record with the date (b)(4) indicated a yield of (b)(4)oz. You indicated that you had increased the amounts of each dietary ingredient used to make a bigger batch, but you did not prepare a MMR for the larger batch size. You failed to include an accurate statement of the weight or measure of each component to be used [21 CFR 111.210(c)]. Specifically, your MMR for your Bld-Build product indicates the addition of (b)(4)oz of the raw ingredient “Nettles”; however, your MMR does not indicate whether the ingredient is to be added in dried or liquid form. You indicated to our investigators that you vary the amount of Nettles in your finished product based on the availability of each form. You do not prepare a unique formulation for the use of dry herbs versus liquid extract, or a combination of the two, to assure that each batch of finished product is uniform. Likewise, your MMRs for your Immunaid and Lymphaid products call for specified amounts of ingredients, but do not specify the form, and you indicated that you vary the form and amounts routinely. You failed to include the identity and weight or measure of each dietary ingredient that will be declared on the Supplement Facts label [21 CFR 111.210(d)]. Specifically, you routinely use the ingredient, Watercress, in your Bld-Build product, and Watercress is listed on your product label; however, your MMR does not indicate Watercress in the formulation of the product. Similarly, the ingredient, Licorice or Licorice Root, is listed in your Immunaid MMR and is used in your Immunaid product; however, you indicated that this ingredient was used as a substitute for Turkey Tail Mushroom, which is listed on your Immunaid product label. You failed to include specifications for each point, step or stage in the manufacturing process where control is necessary to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record [21 CFR 111.210(h)(1)]. Your letter dated 2/21/13 is inadequate because you failed to address preparing and following a complete written master manufacturing record for each unique formulation of dietary supplement that you manufacture.  Your failed to prepare a batch production record (BPR) every time you manufactured a batch of a dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.255(a). Specifically, you were unable to provide a BPR for your “VioLet (b)(4)#2” product that is currently held for sale. Furthermore, the BPRs that you did provide for your Astragalus (lot size (b)(4)), Pau D Arco (lot size (b)(4)), Mistletoe (lot size (b)(4)), Yellow Dock (lot size (b)(4)), Violet (lot size (b)(4)), BLD-Build (lot size (b)(4)), Immunaid (lot size (b)(4)) and Lymphaid (lot size (b)(4)) products failed to include complete information relating to the production and control of each batch of dietary supplement that you manufacture, as required by 21 CFR 111.255(b). Specifically, your BPRs document the date of manufacturing, product name, and yield, but fail to include all other required information under 21 CFR 111.260. Furthermore, the information that is included on your BPRs is incomplete and inconsistent. You must prepare a BPR for each batch of dietary supplement that you manufacture with complete information, as required by 21 CFR 111.255(b) and 21 CFR 111.260. In your letter dated 2/21/13, you stated that you have created a new template for batch records that are now in use. However, as you did not submit the revised batch record, nor did you submit any documentation to show that you are now using this revised template for batch records, we have found your response to be inadequate. Misbranded Dietary Supplements  Your Mistletoe and Burdock Root dietary supplement products are misbranded under section 403 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343] because they do not comply with FDA’s labeling regulations under 21 CFR Part 101. If your Immunaid, Blood Build, Lymphaid, Astragalus, Pau d’Arco, Yellow Dock, Violet, Sheep Sorrel, and Red Clover products did not have disease claims, which make these products drugs, they would also be misbranded for the same reason. 1.      Your Immunaid, Bld-Build, Lymphaid, Astragalus, Pau d’Arco, Mistletoe, Yellow Dock, Violet, Sheep Sorrel, Burdock Root, and Red Clover products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(s)(2)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(s)(2)(A)] in that the labels fail to list the quantity of each ingredient of the supplement that is described in section 201(ff) [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)] or with respect to a proprietary blend of such ingredients, the total quantity of all ingredients in the blend. For example, The nutrition information for your single herb extract product labels lists the single dietary ingredient (herbs) contained in each product but fails to list the quantitative amount by weight per serving of the dietary ingredient in accordance with 101.36(b)(2)(ii).The nutrition information for your Immunaid, Bld-Build, and Lymphaid herbal formula labels lists a proprietary blend of ingredients but fails to list the quantitative amount by weight per serving of the proprietary blend in accordance with 101.36(c)(3).  Your herbal formulas, Immunaid, BLD-BUILD, and Lymphaid, and your single herb extracts, Astragalus, Pau d’Arco, Mistletoe, Yellow Dock, Violet, Sheep Sorrel, Burdock Root, and Red Clover products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(5)(F)] in that the Supplement Facts panels are not in an appropriate format as defined in 21 CFR 101.36. For example, the title “Supplemental Facts” should be changed to “Supplement Facts” [21 CFR 101.36(e)(1)]. Your Immunaid, BLD-BUILD, and Lymphaid products contain intervening material in the labels within the meaning of 21 CFR 101.2(e). The “Other ingredients” must be listed outside of the Supplement Facts box either in accordance with 21 CFR 101.4(g).   Your herbal formulas, Immunaid, BLD-BUILD, and Lymphaid, and your single herb extracts, Astragalus, Pau d’Arco, Mistletoe, Yellow Dock, Violet, Sheep Sorrel, Burdock Root, and Red Clover products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(y) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(y)] in that they are dietary supplements marketed in the United States, but the labels do not include a domestic address or domestic phone number through which the responsible person (as described in section 761) may receive a report of a serious adverse event with such dietary supplement. Your Immunaid, Bld-Build, Lymphaid, Astragalus, Pau d’Arco, Mistletoe, Yellow Dock, Violet, Sheep Sorrel, Burdock Root, Red Clover products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(1)(B)] because the labels fail to declare the servings per container in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(1). This letter may not list all the violations at your facility. You are responsible for ensuring that your facility operates in compliance with the Act and all applicable FDA regulations, including the CGMP regulation for dietary supplements. We may take further action if you do not promptly correct these violations. For instance, we may take further action to seize your product(s) and/or enjoin your firm from operating. Section 743 of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 379j-31, authorizes FDA to assess and collect fees to cover FDA’s costs for certain activities, including re-inspection-related costs. A re-inspection is one or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that identified non-compliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act, specifically to determine whether compliance has been achieved. Re-inspection-related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses, incurred in connection with FDA’s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the results of the re-inspection and assessing and collecting the re-inspection fees, 21 U.S.C. § 379j-31(a)(2)(B). For a domestic facility, FDA will assess and collect fees for re-inspection-related costs from the responsible party for the domestic facility. The inspection noted in this letter identified non-compliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may assess fees to cover any re-inspection-related costs. You should notify this office in writing of the steps you have taken to bring your firm into compliance with the law within fifteen (15) working days of receiving this letter. Your response should include each step which has been taken or will be taken to correct the violations and prevent their recurrence. If corrective action cannot be completed within fifteen (15) days, state the reason for the delay and the time frame within which the corrections will be completed. Please include copies of any available documentation demonstrating corrections have been made.  Your response should be sent to Jessica E. Hensley, Compliance Officer, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Kansas City District, 8050 Marshall Drive, Suite 205, Kansas 66214. If you have any questions about this letter, please contact Compliance Officer, Jessica E. Hensley at 913-495-5183.                                                                                       Sincerely,/S/ John W.
