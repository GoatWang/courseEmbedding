The Heritage

Luxury hotel experiences were revolutionised by The Langham, London. Elevators, in-room hot and cold running water, and other one-of-a-kind indulgences made it the first of Europe's "Grand Hotels." Little wonder that it soon became the favoured venue for the fashionable and the influential.
Our hotels and resorts are truly the epitome of luxury in every city. Exceptionally unique in design. Unparalleled in its level of service. Meticulous in its attention to detail. We are renowned for these hallmarks and more.
Discover more of our legendary heritage below.

Our Pillars

An illustrious heritage demands lofty standards. Our four core pillars continue to guide and challenge the luxury hotel experience.










Elegance in Design
Delightful. Intimate. Luxurious. Each hotel envelops guests in a gentle caress of classic or contemporary luxury, designed to refresh and relax.  








Innovation in Hospitality
The departure from the ordinary. An essential fundament of our brand that distinguishes and defines us.








Genuine Service
The eternal essence of our hotels and resorts. Dedicated, discreet, passionate. It’s the natural elements of what makes every stay alluringly pampering and uniquely memorable.








Captivation of the Senses
An immediate, soothing sensation upon entering our hotel. The engagement and awakening of the five senses. A singular identification that is designed to captivate, surprise, and delight.











The Langham Hotel and Resorts Signatures
From touch to taste, to sight, sound, and smell, each signature is carefully selected and thoughtfully refined. Each is a distinction devised to elevate every guest experience.






Service Stylists
Every task. Every request. All expertly handled by our dedicated Service Stylists. Always delivering service with poise in their classically elegant, iconic, Chanel-inspired, pink tweed suits. 





Ginger Flower Fragrance
Alluring. Vibrant. Unmistakable. A fragrance to match the essence and rich sophistication of The Langham brand.





The Langham Afternoon Tea with Wedgwood
It’s the personification of grace and elegance. An afternoon tea that transforms this ordinary British tradition into a refined social affair.





Pink Roses
Luscious and vivid in its pink colour, delicate and ethereal in its floral bouquet. A vase of elegantly arranged, freshly-cut pink roses can always be found in our hotel lobby.











One Brand, Two Styles

The Heritage

Luxury hotel experiences were revolutionised by The Langham, London. Elevators, in-room hot and cold running water, and other one-of-a-kind indulgences made it the first of Europe's "Grand Hotels." Little wonder that it soon became the favoured venue for the fashionable and the influential.
Our hotels and resorts are truly the epitome of luxury in every city. Exceptionally unique in design. Unparalleled in its level of service. Meticulous in its attention to detail. We are renowned for these hallmarks and more.
