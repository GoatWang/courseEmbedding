BOUCHERVILLE, Quebec, Nov. 30, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Campagna Motors today announced their launch of a crowdfunding campaign under the Title III Regulation Crowdfunding created by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act on the crowdfunding platform StartEngine. With a proven track record of over 20 years building trikes including the Campagna T-REX® and Campagna V13R® models, the campaign represents the first opportunity for retail investors to join Campagna Motors in their mission to advance the Company's signature reverse trikes across the globe beginning with the Company's first headquarters in the United States under US-based sister company, Campagna Motors USA.














							 		Since 1988, Campagna Motors has developed and produced three-wheeled vehicles designed for pure performance.
							  



 

 
 



"Campagna is an innovative vehicle manufacturer that has been the reference in the trike market for the last 20 years and wants to expand and grow in the USA," says André Morissette, CEO of Campagna Motors. "We chose the Title III route because it provided us with the possibility of engaging our large fan base to become investors and partners in the business, while allowing us to aim at raising the required capital in conditions that are interesting for both the investor and Campagna to realize our vision."
According to the Global Trike Market Report by Technavio, North America and Europe comprised 90% of the trike market in 2015, with the adoption of auto cycle regulation and car licensing requirements contributing to the expansion of the market in the United States. With the entire global trike market expected to grow by 13.2% annually through 2020, Campagna Motors feels they are well positioned to benefit with over 2,000 vehicles already on the road and 150 new vehicles being produced each year available for purchase from authorized dealers across Canada and the United States. The funds raised from this campaign for Campagna's US-based sister company, Campagna Motors USA, will go directly towards developing the channel to break into these market trends through the development of a United States headquarters, increasing the company's distribution network and product line-up to ramp up production for expansion throughout the United States.

Campagna Motors Expands Across United States With Launch Of Title III Crowdfunding CampaignHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreTry Yahoo Finance on Firefox »YahooSearchSearchSign inU.S. Markets closedS&P 5002,475.42-2.41 (-0.10%)Dow 3021,796.55+85.54 (+0.39%)Nasdaq6,382.19-40.56 (-0.63%)Campagna Motors Expands Across United States With Launch Of Title III Crowdfunding CampaignPR NewswireNovember 30, 2016ReblogShareTweetShareBOUCHERVILLE, Quebec, Nov. 30, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Campagna Motors today announced their launch of a crowdfunding campaign under the Title III Regulation Crowdfunding created by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act on the crowdfunding platform StartEngine. With a proven track record of over 20 years building trikes including the Campagna T-REX® and Campagna V13R® models, the campaign represents the first opportunity for retail investors to join Campagna Motors in their mission to advance the Company's signature reverse trikes across the globe beginning with the Company's first headquarters in the United States under US-based sister company, Campagna Motors USA."Campagna is an innovative vehicle manufacturer that has been the reference in the trike market for the last 20 years and wants to expand and grow in the USA," says André Morissette, CEO of Campagna Motors. "We chose the Title III route because it provided us with the possibility of engaging our large fan base to become investors and partners in the business, while allowing us to aim at raising the required capital in conditions that are interesting for both the investor and Campagna to realize our vision."According to the Global Trike Market Report by Technavio, North America and Europe comprised 90% of the trike market in 2015, with the adoption of auto cycle regulation and car licensing requirements contributing to the expansion of the market in the United States. With the entire global trike market expected to grow by 13.2% annually through 2020, Campagna Motors feels they are well positioned to benefit with over 2,000 vehicles already on the road and 150 new vehicles being produced each year available for purchase from authorized dealers across Canada and the United States. The funds raised from this campaign for Campagna's US-based sister company, Campagna Motors USA, will go directly towards developing the channel to break into these market trends through the development of a United States headquarters, increasing the company's distribution network and product line-up to ramp up production for expansion throughout the United States.Interested individuals can find out more about Campagna Motors' vehicles and current crowdfunding campaign by visiting https://www.startengine.com/startup/campagnamotors.About Campagna MotorsFounded in 1988, Campagna Motors is an innovative vehicle manufacturer based in Montreal. The company designs, hand-builds and distributes powerful, stylish, innovative, street-legal and unique trikes, with many V13R and T-REX owners around the world. As the reference in this niche market, Campagna Motors is also one of the only manufacturers to offer performance trikes that compare to high-end supercars in performance.
