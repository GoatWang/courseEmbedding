Fusion Secures Multi-Year Contract to Provide Cloud Communications Solution to International Self-Storage Company
Jul 18 17
Fusion secured a three-year, $350,000 cloud communications solution contract with an international self-storage company. The new customer operates 195 self-storage facilities with more than 15 million square feet of storage space in the United States, Canada and United Kingdom. This win reflects the increasing pace of cloud adoption in the $217 billion cloud services industry, and Fusion's success in delivering cloud-based solutions to enterprises seeking advanced yet proven cloud solutions as traditional carriers decommission their traditional wireline networks to focus on wireless services. Fusion's experience and growing success in its specialized retail vertical market strategy earned the self-storage company's confidence as it made its decision to migrate to the cloud. Looking for a solutions provider it could trust to advance its business-critical communications infrastructure now and in the future, the company cited Fusion's focus on delivering the full complement of the integrated solutions a retail enterprise needs to benefit from the cloud. The company further cited Fusion's end to end managed support, which will relieve the company from the costly administrative burden of identifying, selecting and managing multiple vendors in support of its increasingly cloud-based communications rbequirements. Additionally, given the urgency of selecting an alternative provider in a matter of a few short months, Fusion's ability to engineer, provision and deliver its solutions well in advance of the incumbent's imminent decommissioning of its network was a prime consideration.


Fusion and XComIP, LLC to Launch Fusion Global Services, LLC
Jun 12 17
Fusion has reached an agreement with XComIP, LLC to create Fusion Global Services, LLC, a newly formed company organized to provide voice services to carriers worldwide. The transaction is expected to close before the end of the third quarter of 2017 subject to customary approvals and consents. Fusion and XComIP will both contribute their carrier services revenue, customers, vendor agreements and certain system and infrastructure assets to the newly formed entity. Upon the close of the transaction, Fusion's Carrier Services division will be organized and managed separately from Fusion, with Fusion holding a 60% ownership position in the new entity. XComIP, an established service provider of similar size in carrier services revenue and customer base, will hold a 40% ownership position in the new entity. The new company, which will be led by Jay Adams, XComIP's CEO, will leverage the considerable strengths of both companies in serving the global carrier community while relieving Fusion of much of the day-to-day management of the business that currently resides in its Carrier Services division. This will likewise enable Fusion's management team to devote greater time and resources toward expanding the company's rapidly growing and higher margin Business Services division. Other anticipated benefits to Fusion of the newly formed joint venture include: An increase in consolidated revenue and gross profit; A reduction in operating expenses achieved by leveraging XComIP's capital equipment and network across the combined entity; Continued access to lower termination costs as well as potential distribution opportunities for Fusion's Business Services division from its larger base of carrier customers and vendors; and an expanded EBITDA margin profile on a consolidated basis.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.
