("Agrium") (TSX / NYSE:   AGU) across Canada.  JANA, which is Agrium's largest shareholder, has proposed a slate of five new directors for election to Agrium's Board:  former United Agri Products (UAP) CFO and COO David Bullock, former Brenntag CEO and current board member Stephen Clark, former MSC Industrial CEO and current Chairman Mitchell Jacobson, former Canadian Minister of Agriculture The Honourable Lyle Vanclief, and JANA Managing Partner Barry Rosenstein.  
JANA believes these nominees can address crucial deficiencies in the current board, including a lack of legitimate distribution experience and a failure to pursue obvious value creation measures for shareholders until pressed to do so, which have prevented Agrium from realizing its full value creation potential.  JANA's new presentation and other updated information are available at www.JANAAguAnalysis.com.
"Agrium's board has been living in an alternate universe where shareholders have no desire to explore the many ways we've identified to unlock value," said Rosenstein.  "All along we have been speaking to shareholders and seeing a much different picture, with just about every shareholder we speak to wanting to see a serious discussion of these issues and a large and growing number who support enhancing the board so Agrium can reach its full potential."
While Agrium has moved to address certain issues first raised privately by JANA – including boosting its capital return to shareholders and beginning to improve disclosure relating to its retail business ("Retail") – JANA's new presentation zeroes in on the remaining issues previously identified by JANA which the board has yet to fully address, and which JANA has broken down into "5 C's": 

Costs:  Managing costs at Retail and corporate overhead. 
Controls:  Aligning performance targets and incentives with shareholder value creation, and providing sufficient disclosure for shareholders to assess performance. 
Capital Allocation:  Committing to a long-term shareholder-friendly capital return plan, improving execution of M&A and investments, and reducing Retail working capital. 
Conglomerate Structure:  Conducting a fair and unbiased review of Agrium's structure with the sole purpose of maximizing shareholder value. 
Corporate Governance:  Adding an enhanced shareholder perspective and experienced oversight to the board, which has had serious corporate governance lapses following JANA's engagement. 
Each of JANA's candidates has invested personally in Agrium and will also be incentivized based upon the performance of Agrium shares, and each meets the independence requirements of the Canadian Business Corporation Act, the NYSE and Agrium's governance guidelines.  JANA has stated that it will work with the current Board to ensure that any changes in composition will not raise regulatory issues for or burdens on Agrium.
Biographical Information for JANA's Candidates
David Bullock:  Mr. Bullock was the Chief Financial Officer of Graham Packaging Inc. ("Graham Packaging"), a global supplier of plastic packaging, from 2009 to 2011, where he led the Company from private ownership under Blackstone to a public listing and its ultimate sale to Reynolds Group at a substantial premium to its IPO price.  
Prior to Graham Packaging, Mr. Bullock was Chief Financial Officer (2003-2007) and Chief Operating Officer (2007-2008) of United Agri Products, Inc. ("UAP") which, prior to its acquisition by Agrium, was the largest independent distributor of agricultural input products in the U.S. and Canada with approximately 350 stores.   At UAP, Mr. Bullock was responsible for improving the business including the creation and implementation of its supply chain and logistics strategy and implementation of its core operating systems and controls. UAP was cited by Agrium's financial advisor, Morgan Stanley, as the best comparable peer for Agrium's Retail business (see Agrium's August 20, 2012 Investor Update, page 9).
Mr. Bullock was a key member of the management team that created substantial value by separating UAP from agricultural conglomerate ConAgra Foods, Inc. in an acquisition by Apollo Management and then turning UAP around through substantial operating improvements.  Mr. Bullock also oversaw the subsequent public offering of UAP and its eventual sale to Agrium at a substantial premium to its IPO price.  The successful turnaround of UAP has made it one of the top performing investments in Apollo's history.  Prior to UAP, Mr. Bullock held management positions with FMC Corporation.  Mr. Bullock has a B.S. from Lehigh University and an M.B.A. from Cornell University.
According to JANA, during Mr. Bullock's tenure at UAP from 2002 to 2008, the company experienced significant operating profit growth and margin expansion, driving EBITDA growth of more than 16% per year. 
Stephen Clark:  Mr. Clark is a member of the Supervisory Board of Brenntag AG. Mr. Clark had previously served as Chief Executive Officer from 2006 to 2011 and as President of Brenntag North America from 1990 to 2006.  Mr. Clark managed Brenntag during its private ownership by two different private equity investors (Bain Capital and BC Partners), and then led the company through a successful public offering in 2010.  Brenntag AG is the global market leader in distribution for industrial and specialty chemicals with over $12 billion in total sales and an enterprise value of more than $8 billion.  Brenntag was cited by Agrium's financial advisor as a relevant distribution peer for Agrium's Retail business (see Agrium's August 20, 2012 Investor Update, page 10).   Mr. Clark is a graduate of Pennsylvania State University.
According to JANA, during Mr. Clark's tenure as CEO from 2006 to 2011, Brenntag grew EBITDA by more than 15% per year and the company experienced significant margin expansion despite a challenging macroeconomic environment, and since the company's IPO, Brenntag shareholders have realized a total annual return of 25% per year through November 16, vs. a 3% annual return for the STOXX 600 index over the comparable period.
Mitchell Jacobson:  Mr. Jacobson is Chairman of the Board and one of the principal shareholders of MSC Industrial Direct Co., Inc.  Mr. Jacobson previously served as Chief Executive Officer of MSC from its formation as a public company in October 1995 to November 2005, and has since served as its Chairman and remained its largest shareholder.  MSC today has a $4 billion market capitalization and is one of the largest distributors of a broad range of metalworking and maintenance, repair and operating products with over 600,000 unique SKUs and over 100 branches in the United States.  MSC was also cited by Agrium's financial advisor as a relevant distribution peer for Agrium's Retail business (Agrium's August 20, 2012 Investor Update presentation, page 10, footnote 1).
In addition to his experience with MSC, Mr. Jacobson is an investor and board member of privately held HD Supply, Inc., a leading industrial distributor for professional customers in the infrastructure, maintenance, repair and improvement and specialty construction markets with approximately $8 billion in annual sales.  He is a member of the Board of Trustees for both New York University and the New York University School of Law and is a member of the Investment Committee of the New York University School of Law Foundation. He serves as a Trustee for New York-Presbyterian Hospital and is a member of the Hospital's Investment Committee as well as Co-Chair of the Hedge Fund Subcommittee and a member of both the Asset Allocation and Private Investments Subcommittees. Mr. Jacobson is a graduate of Brandeis University and the New York University School of Law.
According to JANA, under Mr. Jacobson's leadership, MSC has grown operating profit more than 12 fold since its IPO through August 2012, representing compound annual growth of 16%, in the process realizing operating leverage and margin expansion, and over this 17 year time period MSC's shareholders have realized a total annual return of 12% per year through November 16, vs. a 7% annual return for the S&P 500 index over the comparable period. 
The Honourable Lyle Vanclief, P.C., P.AG (Dist):  Mr. Vanclief was formerly the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (1997-2003) and a Member of Parliament (1988-2004).  In his role as Minister, Mr. Vanclief had responsibility for a $140 billion industry and oversaw a Ministry with 12,000 employees. His responsibilities as Minister included stewardship of various Canadian federal agencies including the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Farm Credit Canada, the Canadian Dairy Commission, the Canadian Grain Commission and the National Farm Products Council. 
Prior to his government service, Mr. Vanclief spent twenty-two years as an entrepreneur in the agriculture industry, during which time he built Willowlee Farms Limited into a diversified fruit, vegetable, grains, oilseeds and livestock operation in Prince Edward County, Ontario.  Mr. Vanclief currently serves on the board of Bioniche Life Sciences Inc.   Mr Vanclief is a graduate of the University of Guelph in Crop Science, a professional Agrologist, a Fellow of the Agricultural Institute of Canada, a graduate of the Directors Education Program at the Rotman School of Management (University of Toronto) and is an Institute certified director with the professional designation ICD.D.  Currently he provides agricultural and agri-food consulting.  Mr. Vanclief was inducted into the Canadian Agricultural Hall of Fame in 2010.

The firm's tagline is, "Ignore the crowd" - a sentiment that can be easily seen in the firm's management. Barry Rosenstein used to be a "follow the jockey, not the horse" kind of manager, but that has all changed. Barry Rosenstein explains, "We're still very focused on the jockeys, but we're equally focused on the cash the businesses produce. In cases where we can't find an absolute superb jockey, we'll still invest if the cash flow is there, although it may make us more likely to invest in more senior parts of the credit structure or to buy a basket of the strongest companies rather than just one."

The fund was able to bring in returns of 23.9% in 2009, but it still wasn't enough to recoup its 2008 losses. Jana Partners turned things around in 2010, recovering its 2008 losses and returning 8.4%. The strong performance continued. By October 2011, Jana Partners had returned a whopping 200% since its inception.Barry Rosenstein is a highly qualified activist investor. He comes to the table with a CPA and an MBA in business from Wharton, which he earned in 1984. Before starting Jana Partners, Barry Rosenstein spent years as the managing partner at private equity fund Sagaponack Partners.
