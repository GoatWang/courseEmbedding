CTD Holdings Announces First Patient Dosed in Phase I/II Clinical Trial to Evaluate Trappsol(R) Cyclo(TM) in Niemann-Pick Disease Type C
Study Evaluating Safety and Efficacy of Trappsol(R) Cyclo(TM) in a Multi-center European Trial
Company Expects Final Data from Trial by End of 2018
ALACHUA, FL -- (Marketwired) -- 07/19/17 -- CTD Holdings, Inc. (OTCQB: CTDH), a clinical stage biotechnology company developing cyclodextrin-based products for the treatment of disease, today announced that the first patient has been dosed intravenously in the Company's European Phase I/II clinical trial evaluating Trappsol® Cyclo™ in patients with Niemann-Pick Disease Type C (NPC), a rare and fatal genetic disease that impacts the brain, lung, liver, spleen, and other organs.
The first patient was dosed by Dr. Reena Sharma and her team at Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust in the United Kingdom. Dr. Sharma is Consultant for Adult Metabolic Medicine and Honorary Senior Lecturer at the Mark Holland Metabolic Unit of the Salford NHS Trust, and the Coordinating Investigator for the Phase I/II trial of Trappsol® Cyclo™ in Europe. The first patient visit was supported by NIHR Manchester Clinical Research Facility, which provides 24-hour cover for intensive and complex research studies.
"There is currently no treatment available globally for this condition. Those that are available, are limited to delaying the progression of neurological symptoms or providing palliative care to relieve, for example, the gastrointestinal symptoms and seizures," said Dr. Sharma. "We need new treatments that help to address progression of neurological involvement and some of the other problems our patients experience relating to the liver, spleen and lungs. I hope that this study will lead to a new treatment for this devastating condition."
The Phase I/II clinical trial, which will include additional sites in the UK and Sweden and is also expected to be expanded to Italy, requires 12 patients to be fully enrolled. The trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of Trappsol® Cyclo™ in NPC patients ages two and older. Patients will be randomized into three dose groups of 1500 mg/kg, 2000 mg/kg and 2500 mg/kg of Trappsol® Cyclo™ administered via bi-weekly intravenous injections over a period of 48 weeks.
"Commencement of dosing of the first patient at the Salford clinical site is another significant milestone for the Company in the development of our Trappsol® Cyclo™," said CTD Chairman and CEO, N. Scott Fine. "We expect final data from this important clinical trial by the end of 2018. CTD remains grateful for the continued support from the many patient families, researchers and clinicians, such as Dr. Sharma, who have helped us reach this important milestone."
Trappsol® Cyclo™ is a parenteral grade of hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin, a donut-shaped molecule comprised of seven glucopyranose units. To date, intravenous Trappsol® Cyclo™ has been administered to 21 NPC patients worldwide, some for more than six years, via Compassionate Use Programs. Data from treating physicians in the compassionate use program have demonstrated that multiple patients have shown marked improvements in neurological symptoms, lung function or liver morphology, or had stabilization of disease progression, with no significant safety concerns.
In addition to the European study, CTD Holdings has initiated a Phase I clinical trial in the U.S. evaluating intravenous administration of Trappsol® Cyclo™ in NPC patients. CTD previously received Fast Track Designation in the U.S. and Orphan Drug Designation for the use of Trappsol® Cyclo™ in the treatment of NPC from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency.

CTD Holdings Corrects Mis-Statements about Its Product Made in On-Line Publication
Download PDF

ALACHUA, FL -- (Marketwired) -- 04/19/17 --  CTD Holdings, Inc. (OTCQB: CTDH), a clinical stage biotechnology company that develops cyclodextrin-based products for the treatment of disease, today corrects false and misleading statements published on April 18 in the on-line open access journal PLOS One.
"Patients struggling with Niemann-Pick Disease Type C (NPC) deserve accurate and complete information about drug products used in clinical trials," said N. Scott Fine, Company Chairman and CEO. "The PLOS One journal does a disservice to the patient community and their caregivers, as well as to all the stakeholders whose investments have brought our company into two clinical trials."
The article states that CTD's hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin, Trappsol® Cyclo™, used in its clinical programs, has different chemical and biophysical properties than another hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin also used in clinical programs. The article implies superiority of one version over another. CTD Holdings did not provide its clinical Trappsol® Cyclo™ material to any of the authors of the PLOS article, nor to their laboratories, to make such a comparison possible. The results in the PLOS article thus appear to be based on a different product than clincal Trappsol® Cyclo™ material. If so, the results are false and misleading.
CTD Holdings has also alerted the FDA about this second instance of false and misleading information about our product as propagated by another public company.
"We will continue to ensure that information about Trappsol® Cyclo™ in the public domain is accurate. We owe it to the families and physicians with whom we work so closely in our compassionate use program and in our clinical trials to do so," said Mr. Fine.


About CTD Holdings:

 CTD Holdings, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company that develops cyclodextrin-based products for the treatment of disease. The company's Trappsol® Cyclo™, an orphan drug designated product in the United States and Europe, is used to treat Niemann-Pick Disease Type C, a rare and fatal genetic disease. Additional indications for the active ingredient in Trappsol® Cyclo™, are in development. For additional information, visit the company's website: www.ctd-holdings.com

  Download Investor Presentation  Overview CTD Holdings, Inc. was organized as a Florida corporation on August 9, 1990, with operations beginning in July 1992. In conjunction with a restructuring in 2000, we changed our name from Cyclodextrin Technologies Development, Inc., or CTDI, to CTD Holdings, Inc.; CTDI was then incorporated as a Florida corporation and became a wholly owned subsidiary of CTD Holdings, Inc.  We are a family of biotechnology growth companies focused on the use of cyclodextrins in drug development. The FDA recently accepted the Type II Drug Master File for our lead drug candidate, Trappsol ® Cyclo™, for filing.  The Company anticipates launching a clinical trial program, initially in Europe, for its Trappsol® Cyclo™ in 2015 as treatment for Neiman-Pick Type C disease (NPC). We also sell cyclodextrins and related products to the pharmaceutical, nutritional, and other industries, primarily for use in diagnostics and specialty drugs with continuing growth in research and new product development.  In 2012, we began providing pulse spray drying services to produce raw materials used primarily in industrial and consumer products.   If you have any questions about cyclodextrins or our company, feel free to email us, or contact Dr. Jeffrey Tate at 386-418-8060.  Mission & Vision Mission The mission of CTD Holdings Inc. is to develop, manufacture, and distribute cyclodextrin-based high value products. Our products treat disease, improve quality of life, and provide solutions in a broad range of applications including pharmaceutical formulation, medical diagnostics, cosmetics, nutraceuticals, and nutrition. Vision CTD Holdings Inc. provides the world’s widest range of cyclodextrin-based fine chemicals available from a single source. Through its Sphingo Biotechnology division it develops biopharmaceuticals using cyclodextrins as the active ingredient. The NanoSonic Products division provides industrial quantities of cyclodextrins for high value biotechnology manufacturing applications. The CTD division provides research quantities of cyclodextrins to biotechnology laboratories world-wide.  Business Strategy Substantially all of our revenues are derived from the sales of cyclodextrins, bio-pharmaceuticals containing cyclodextrins, cyclodextrin complexes, resale of cyclodextrins manufactured by others for our clients to their specifications, and our own licensed cyclodextrin products.  We currently sell our products directly to customers in the diagnostics, pharmaceutical, and industrial chemical industries, and to chemical supply distributors.  In 2012, we began offering pulse drying services. Our core business has transitioned to a biotech drug development company from a business which had been primarily reselling basic cyclodextrin products, which have the least value-added attributes.  Our strategy going forward is to pursue opportunities in healthcare where cyclodextrin applications have maximum value. We market and sell bio-pharmaceuticals containing cyclodextrins, and cyclodextrins and related products to the pharmaceutical and other industries.   Our revenues are principally from the sales of chemically modified cyclodextrins.  For the year ended December 31, 2014, our revenues consisted of 58% biopharmaceuticals, 40% basic natural and chemically modified cyclodextrins, and 2% cyclodextrin complexes represented. Our business strategy is to increase sales by transitioning to the more value-added biopharmaceuticals and complexes and maintaining profitability for these products. Our cyclodextrin sales historically involve small quantities (i.e., less than 1.0  Kg).  We sell directly to our customers, package the orders at our facility and ship using common carriers.   The majority of our revenues are from five to ten customers who have historically been repeat purchasers.   In 2014, one customer (UNO Healthcare, Inc.) accounted for more than 57% of our total revenue. In 2013, two customers (UNO Healthcare, Inc. and Sigma-Aldrich Fine Chemical, Inc.) accounted for more than 10% each of our total revenue, and collectively for 60% of our total revenue.  Sigma-Aldrich Fine Chemical, Inc. accounts for almost 100% of our annual sales of Aquaplex®. In a year we typically sell to fewer than 200 individual customers. We anticipate our customer trend to be moving to long-term or sole source contracts with our customers.  In 2012, we signed a four-year supplier agreement for  Trappsol® HPB with Siemens Corporation.   Our customers buy products from us as needed primarily for product research and development purposes.  Therefore, it is difficult to predict future sales, as it is dependent on the current cyclodextrin related research and development activities of others, which we have monitored in the past by following  the issuance and applications of patents in the US and elsewhere. We have identified pulse drying as a technology that promises benefits for turning commercial quantities of aqueous (liquid) solutions of Trappsol® cyclodextrins and Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients and other ingredients into a powdered solid. Pulse drying does this more economically and with less degradation to the materials than the traditional drying processes. The cyclodextrin and active ingredient come out in a complexed powder form that can be readily used by our customers to mix into their specific product formulations. In 2012 we completed construction of a c-GMP (current Good Manufacturing Practice) facility and installed a pulse drying system to manufacture commercial quantities of cyclodextrin complexes.  These products will meet current food and Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (“API”) production standards and will be sold using our Trappsol® and Aquaplex® product marks.  API production quality standards are higher than those for foods but somewhat less stringent than those for finished pharmaceutical dosage manufacturers. We expect to expand and diversify our product offerings.  We expect over time this will result in less volatility in our sales due to lower dependence on our cyclical research and development customers.                   Share Structure:  Outstanding: 57,476,820 (as of August 11, 2015)   Investor Relations Sitrick and Company Wendy Tanaka 11999 San Vicente Blvd Los Angeles, CA 90049 415-369-8447         DD Links:     Download Investor Presentation   CTD Holdings NNPDF Conference Presentation, Chicago > Aug 2015   CTD Holdings Niemann-Pick – UK Conference Sept 18-20 2015  CTD Holdings Fact Sheet March 31, 2012 - http://content.stockpr.com/ctdholdings/media/747eeebeb6c96b81d74eee2eecff9687.pdf  WSR Equity Research Report February 21, 2012 - http://www.wallstreetresources.net/pdf/fc/CTDH.pdf  CTD Holdings - Nanosonic Uses USDA Grant to Install Solar Energy System October 19, 2011 - http://www.gainesville.com/article/20111019/ARTICLES/111019423?tc=ar  FDA Orphan Drug Status Designation - Trappsol May 17, 2010 - http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/opdlisting/oopd/OOPD_Results_2.cfm?Index_Number=303910  Dateline Story on Addi & Cassi Hempel - Using Trappsol to Treat Niemann Pick Type C January 5, 2010 - http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=se1Pzqjh26o      Cyclodextrin As A Therapeutic "Drug" For HIV AIDS, Niemann Pick Type C and other Viruses April 16th, 2009 - http://webofhope.com/2009/04/cyclodextrin-as-a-theraputic-drug-for-hiv-aids-niemann-pick-type-c-and-other-viruses/   Mentioned in a Wall Street Journal Article: http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123871183055784317.html   Cyclodextrin - Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclodextrin   CEO Rick Strattan - Personally thanked following FDA Approval: http://fightnpc.wordpress.com/2009/03/18/fda-approves-novel-cyclodextrin-treatment-for-addi-cassi/                                                                                                         What are Cyclodextrins? Cyclodextrins are donut shaped circles of glucose (sugar) molecules that bring together oil and water and have potential applications anywhere oil and water must be used together. Successful applications have been made in the areas of agriculture, analytical chemistry, biotechnology, cosmetics, diagnostics, electronics, foodstuffs, pharmaceuticals and toxic waste treatment. Stabilization of food flavors and fragrances is the largest current worldwide market for Cyclodextrin applications. We and others have developed Cyclodextrin-based applications in stabilization of flavors for food products; elimination of undesirable tastes and odors; preparation of antifungal complexes for foods and toiletries; stabilization of fragrances and dyes; reduction of foaming in foods; cosmetics and toiletries; and the improvement of quality, stability and storability of foods. Cyclodextrins can improve the solubility and stability of a wide range of drugs. Many promising drug compounds are unusable or have serious side effects because they are either too unstable or too insoluble in water. Strategies for administering currently approved compounds involve injection of formulations requiring pH adjustment and/or the use of organic solvents. The result is frequently painful, irritating, or damaging to the patient. These side effects can be ameliorated by Cyclodextrins. Cyclodextrins also have many potential uses in drug delivery for topical applications to the eyes and skin. Cyclodextrin Background Cyclodextrins are formed naturally by the action of bacterial enzymes on starch. They were first noticed and isolated in 1891 by a French scientist, Villiers, as he studied rotting potatoes. The bacterial enzyme naturally creates a mixture of at least three different Cyclodextrins depending on how many glucose units are included in the molecular circle; six glucose units yield Alpha Cyclodextrin (“ACD”); seven units, Beta Cyclodextrin (“BCD”); eight units, Gamma Cyclodextrin (“GCD”). The more glucose units in the molecular circle, the greater the volume of the toroid. The inside of this “donut” provides an excellent resting place for “oily” molecules while the outside of the donut is significantly compatible with water enabling clear stable solutions of Cyclodextrins to exist in aqueous environments even when an “oily” molecule is carried within the donut hole. The net result is a molecular carrier that comes in small, medium, and large sizes with the ability to transport and deliver “oily” materials using water as the primary vehicle. Cyclodextrins are manufactured in large quantities by mixing appropriate enzymes with starch solutions, thereby reproducing the natural process. ACD, BCD and GCD can be manufactured by an entirely natural process and therefore are considered to be natural products. Additional processing is required to isolate and separate the Cyclodextrins. The purified ACD, BCD, and GCD are referred to collectively as “natural” Cyclodextrins (NCDs). The chemical groups on each glucose unit in a Cyclodextrin molecule provide chemists with ways to modify the properties of the Cyclodextrins, i.e. to make them more water soluble or less water soluble, thereby making them better carriers for a specific chemical. The Cyclodextrins that result from chemical modifications are no longer considered “natural” and are referred to as chemically modified Cyclodextrins. Since the property modifications achieved are often so advantageous to a specific application, the Company does not believe the loss of the “natural” product categorization will prevent its ultimate commercial use. It does, however, create a greater regulatory burden.  Applications One of the premises that CTD based its future success on was the endless (literally) applications available to Cyclodextrin's. Wherever water and water insoluble or immiscible materials need to be brought together, one of the Cyclodextrin's is likely to make it possible and/or more efficiently accomplished. The following table will give you an idea of the variety of the applications possible.

A recent study (by QY Research Cyclodextrin Research Center) cites global demand as having almost doubled between 2009 and 2013 from 191,900 metric tons to 353,160 metric tons.  Within the last 10 years, many more European countries have approved the use of cyclodextrins in food products. In the United States, major starch companies are renewing their earlier interest in cyclodextrins as food and nutraceutical additives. We believe the food additive industry world-wide will continue to increase its use of cyclodextrins.   Natural cyclodextrins have been confirmed to be generally recognized as safe (GRAS) in most of the world, now including the U.S. Moreover, approvals of products containing cyclodextrins by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 2001 suggest that regulatory approval for new products may be easier in the future. In 2001, Janssen Pharmaceutica, now a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, received FDA approval to market Sporanox®, an antifungal which contained hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin as an excipient. In 2008, one of our clients used our product, Trappsol® hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin, in an FDA approved compassionate use investigational new drug protocol for the treatment of Niemann-Pick Type C disease. We now sell this product under our trademark Trappsol® Cyclo™.  Our customer successfully applied to the FDA to designate Trappsol® Cyclo™ as an orphan drug in the treatment of Niemann Pick Type C disease in support of an Investigational New Drug protocol.  Under the Orphan Drug Act, companies that develop a drug for a disorder affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the United States may seek designation as an orphan drug and, if such application is approved, they have the ability to sell it exclusively for seven years, and may get clinical trial tax incentives.  On May 17, 2010, the FDA designated Trappsol® Cyclo™ as an orphan drug for the treatment of Niemann-Pick Type C disease.   Applications of cyclodextrins in personal products and for industrial uses have appeared in many patents and patent applications. Cyclodextrins are used in numerous brand-name household goods, including fabric softeners and air fresheners. With increased manufacturing capacity and supply the prices of the natural cyclodextrins have decreased to the point that use of these materials is considered in even the most price sensitive goods. We believe this will result in increasing demand for commercial uses of cyclodextrins.   In Japan, at least twelve pharmaceutical preparations are now marketed which contain cyclodextrins; there are also multiple products in Europe and the United States.  The cyclodextrins permit the use of all routes of administration. Ease of delivery and improved bioavailability of such well-known drugs as nitroglycerin, dexamethasone, PGE(1&2), and cephalosporin permit these “old” drugs to command new market share and sometimes new patent lives. Because of the value added, it is management’s opinion that the dollar value of the worldwide market for products containing cyclodextrins and for complexes of cyclodextrins can be a hundred times that of the market sales of the cyclodextrin itself. This value increment portends opportunities for company growth in the pharmaceutical grade cyclodextrins and in custom cyclodextrin complexes.   Trappsol® Cyclo™   Trappsol® Cyclo™ is a parenteral grade of hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin available in either a powdered or sterile liquid presentation. It has been designated an orphan drug by both the U.S. FDA and the European EMA. Trappsol® Cyclo™ is being developed in the Sphingo Biotechnology division for the treatment of Niemann Pick Type C disease, a rare and fatal illness tied to an autosomal recessive genetic defect.    Trappsol® Trappsol® is the trade name given to the Cyclodextrins CTD, Inc. provides to its customers. The Trappsol® name assures you the cyclodextrin you purchase is of the finest possible quality. The letter designations after the Trappsol® (T) name indicate the actual Cyclodextrin (Cyclodextrin); e.g. "B" is for Beta (β). THPG stands for Trappsol® Hydroxypropyl Gamma. Whenever possible, the catalog number will correspond to the cyclodextrin's name. Trappsol® products are organized by commercial category of Cyclodextrin: Alpha (α), Beta (β), and Gamma (γ). While all of CTD's products are of Fine Chemical quality, CTD is also pleased to provide materials suitable for exacting Chromatographic procedures that are listed as Capillary Electrophoresis grade material. Therefore, the same catalog number may have two pricing levels referred to as FC-Grade and CE-Grade. The chemical entity is the same, but the isomeric purity and/or the level of impurities will be different for the CE-Grade, which is reflected in the higher pricing. Within the Fine Chemical category, CTD is also pleased to be able to provide different grades of material, such as Pharmaceutical, Technical, Food, etc. These grade designations are primarily intended for Cyclodextrin's that are produced in bulk. The grade classification for these materials results from the manufacturing standards met by the manufacturer in terms of testing the bulk product before it is released. The different industries (Pharmaceutical, Food, Packaging, Adhesives, etc.) often require different kinds of testing; hence the grade designation is more an indication of the testing that has been done rather than differences in physical or chemical properties. CAUTION The Trappsol® and Aquaplex® products described on this site are intended for research and investigational uses only. They are not for human, veterinary or household use. (Since the pharmacological properties of the compounds described in this brochure are incompletely characterized, due care should be exercised in their use.) Material Safety Data Sheets and Certificates of Analysis are available upon request.    Aquaplex® CTD offers a line of chemicals already complexed with Trappsol® cyclodextrins. They are categorized as Drugs, Flavors, and Miscellaneous chemicals. Their catalog numbers begin with AP to designate that they are Aquaplex complexes. The AP is followed by a four or five letter abbreviation of the active ingredient, ending with a number designating the type of Trappsol® cyclodextrin used in their manufacture as listed below.    1 THPB     Trappsol® Hydroxypropyl Beta   2 TRMB     Trappsol® (Randomly) Methyl Beta   3 TBCD     Trappsol® Beta   4 TDMB     Trappsol® (2,6-di-O) Methyl Beta   5 TACD     Trappsol® Alpha   6 TGCD     Trappsol® Gamma   7 TG2BM     Trappsol® Maltosyl Mixture                Management:    Board of Directors N.

CTD Holdings Enrolls First Patient in European Phase I/II Clinical Trial of Trappsol(R) Cyclo(TM) for Treatment of Niemann-Pick Disease Type C
Download PDF

Company Expects Final Data from Trial by End of 2018
ALACHUA, FL -- (Marketwired) -- 06/21/17 -- CTD Holdings, Inc. (OTCQB: CTDH), a clinical stage biotechnology company that develops cyclodextrin-based products for the treatment of disease, today announced that it has enrolled the first patient in the Company's European Phase I/II clinical trial evaluating the intravenous administration of Trappsol® Cyclo™ in patients with Niemann-Pick Disease Type C (NPC), a rare and fatal genetic disease that impacts the brain, lung, liver, spleen, and other organs. The first patient was enrolled at Salford NHS Trust UK by Dr. Reena Sharma, Consultant for Adult Metabolic Medicine and Honorary Senior Lecturer at the Mark Holland Metabolic Unit. Dr. Sharma is also the Coordinating Investigator for the Phase I/II trial in Europe. 
The Phase I/II clinical trial, which will include additional sites in the UK and Sweden and is also expected to be expanded to Italy, will require 12 patients to be fully enrolled. The trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of Trappsol® Cyclo™ in NPC patients ages two and older, with the primary objective of determining the optimum dose for further study. Patients will be randomized into three dose groups of 1500 mg/kg, 2000 mg/kg and 2500 mg/kg of Trappsol® Cyclo™, which will be administered via bi-weekly intravenous injections over a period of 48 weeks.
"Enrollment of the first patient at the Salford clinical site is a significant milestone for the Company in the development of this treatment for a devastating disease," said CTD Chairman and CEO, N. Scott Fine. "We expect final data from this important clinical trial by the end of 2018. In addition, we anticipate enrolling the first patient in our U.S. Phase I clinical trial of Trappsol® Cyclo™ in the near future. CTD is grateful for the continued support from the many patient families, researchers and clinicians who have worked with us to get to this point."
Trappsol® Cyclo™ is a parenteral grade of hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin, a donut-shaped molecule comprised of seven glucopyranose units. To date, intravenous Trappsol® Cyclo™ has been administered to 21 NPC patients worldwide, some for more than six years, via Compassionate Use Programs. Data from treating physicians have demonstrated that multiple patients have shown marked improvements in neurological symptoms, lung function or liver morphology, or had stabilization of disease progression, with no significant safety concerns.
"I am pleased to be participating in this promising clinical trial," said Dr. Sharma. "Based on the data generated from the ongoing Compassionate Use Programs, Trappsol® Cyclo™ administered intravenously has significant potential to be a safe and effective treatment for NPC, a catastrophic condition with a substantial unmet need. I look forward to further evaluating this important drug candidate in a clinical setting."
"NPC is a systemic disease, which is why we are administering Trappsol® Cyclo™ intravenously in this study," said Dr. Sharon Hrynkow, CTD's Senior Vice President for Medical Affairs. "We look forward to working with our colleagues to enroll additional patients in Salford, and other sites, as we move this promising drug candidate forward in this Phase I/II study."
In addition to the European study, CTD Holdings has initiated a Phase I clinical trial in the U.S. evaluating intravenous administration of Trappsol® Cyclo™ in NPC patients. CTD previously received Fast Track Designation and Orphan Drug Designation for the use of Trappsol® Cyclo™ in the treatment of NPC from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency.

(CTDH), a biotechnology company that develops cyclodextrin-based products for the treatment of disease, today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has cleared its Investigational New Drug application (IND) for its orphan drug product Trappsol® Cyclo™ in the treatment of Niemann-Pick Type C (NPC) disease. CTD will be initiating a Phase I study to investigate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic parameters and pharmacological effects of the intravenous administration of Trappsol® Cyclo™, CTD's hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin. Trappsol® Cyclo™ has Orphan Drug Designation in both the EU and the US."We are pleased to see Trappsol® Cyclo™ moving into its first formal clinical trial," said N. Scott Fine, CTD Chairman and CEO. "With patients soon to be enrolled in the US, and with the Phase I/II Clinical Trial Application under review in the UK, this is an exciting time for our company and all stakeholders, and most importantly for the NPC families who are waiting for approved cyclodextrin-based treatments."Niemann-Pick Type C is a rare and fatal genetic disease that impacts primarily children but is increasingly diagnosed in older patients who may live with this disability for many years. NPC impacts the brain and major organs through abnormal accumulation of cholesterol in cells.The randomized, double-blinded study will be centered at one site, UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland, and is expected to enroll 12 patients over the age of 18. It will examine two dosage levels of Trappsol® Cyclo™, 1500 mg/kgBW and 2500 mg/kgBW, administered intravenously, and will examine outcome measures on cholesterol synthesis and cholesterol storage in major organs, including the liver. "We were pleased by the level of cooperation and input from FDA as we finalized our study design," said Dr. Sharon H. Hrynkow, CTD's Senior Vice President for Medical Affairs. More information on the study parameters will be posted to ClinicalTrials.gov.Dr. Caroline Hastings, Pediatric Hematologist/Oncologist, UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland, is the Principal Investigator. Dr. Hastings was the first physician in the US to administer hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin in the form of Trappsol® Cyclo™ to NPC patients. Dr. Benny Liu, Gastroenterologist, Alameda Health System Oakland, and also affiliated with UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland, will be acting as a Co-Investigator. Dr. Liu made the seminal discovery showing that hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin is effective in treating NPC in animal models. "This approval is the culmination of years of work by many families and physicians along with CTD and other partners," said Dr. Hastings. "It is an honor to lead the formal clinical trial of IV administration of Trappsol® Cyclo™, the same cyclodextrin product used in named patient programs going back to 2009."About the Company:  CTD Holdings, Inc. is a biotechnology company that develops cyclodextrin-based products for the treatment of disease.

CTD Holdings Corrects Mis-Statements about Its Product Made in On-Line Publication

ALACHUA, FL--(Marketwired - April 19, 2017) -  CTD Holdings, Inc. (OTCQB: CTDH), a clinical stage biotechnology company that develops cyclodextrin-based products for the treatment of disease, today corrects false and misleading statements published on April 18 in the on-line open access journal PLOS One."Patients struggling with Niemann-Pick Disease Type C (NPC) deserve accurate and complete information about drug products used in clinical trials," said N. Scott Fine, Company Chairman and CEO. "The PLOS One journal does a disservice to the patient community and their caregivers, as well as to all the stakeholders whose investments have brought our company into two clinical trials."The article states that CTD's hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin, Trappsol® Cyclo™, used in its clinical programs, has different chemical and biophysical properties than another hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin also used in clinical programs. The article implies superiority of one version over another. CTD Holdings did not provide its clinical Trappsol® Cyclo™ material to any of the authors of the PLOS article, nor to their laboratories, to make such a comparison possible. The results in the PLOS article thus appear to be based on a different product than clincal Trappsol® Cyclo™ material. If so, the results are false and misleading.CTD Holdings has also alerted the FDA about this second instance of false and misleading information about our product as propagated by another public company."We will continue to ensure that information about Trappsol® Cyclo™ in the public domain is accurate. We owe it to the families and physicians with whom we work so closely in our compassionate use program and in our clinical trials to do so," said Mr. Fine.About CTD Holdings: CTD Holdings, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company that develops cyclodextrin-based products for the treatment of disease. The company's Trappsol® Cyclo™, an orphan drug designated product in the United States and Europe, is used to treat Niemann-Pick Disease Type C, a rare and fatal genetic disease. Additional indications for the active ingredient in Trappsol® Cyclo™, are in development.
