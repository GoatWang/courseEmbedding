Grape Varietals




Of the many factors that determine the characteristics of a given wine, the grape varietal is perhaps the most important. Although there are over 10,000 different documented varietals within the species Vitis Vinifera (regarded as the "true" wine grapes), the grapes listed on this page are the ones most commonly cultivated for fine wines.
Each grape varietal has differing aroma and flavor characteristics when it is made into wine. But wines made from individual varietals will also vary in character depending on where in the world the grapes are grown: for example, vineyards in New World growing regions will produce wines with different flavors and aromas than vineyards from Old World growing regions, even when the wines are made from the exact same grape varietal.
Use the links below to find top-rated wines for each of the varietals and learn about what makes each varietal unique.

Viña Concha Y Toro: A Strong Ship Facing Sharp Headwinds - Vina Concha y Toro S.A. (ADR) (NYSE:VCO) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Viña Concha Y Toro: A Strong Ship Facing Sharp HeadwindsJul.27.17 | About: Vina Concha (VCO) William Daniel Long/short equity, long-term horizon, dividend growth investing, valueSummaryThe consistent historical strength of Concha y Toro has not faded and with a burgeoning market for Chilean wines, the future looks bright.Q1 2017 was a rough one for the company as they faced serious pressure from exchange rate variation and adverse weather conditions.I will be keeping my eye out for an entry point into this solid company as their current headwinds are temporary and they present long term value.Introduction: In April 2017, 83% of fund managers believed U.S. stocks to be overvalued, according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch monthly fund manager survey. That was three months ago, and since then valuations have continued to rise in the U.S., because of this I, along with many investors, began looking at foreign equities to find value plays. While many are looking to Europe, I decided to take a look into South America to see if I could find lesser known names. Although I didn’t find exactly what I was looking for, I instead found one of the strongest and oldest wine producers in the world that only a few analysts on the street cover. Today I want to dive into Viña Concha y Toro S.A (NYSE:VCO), a company that was founded in 1883 by Don Melchor de Santiago Concha y Toro and his wife, Emiliana Subercaseaux. The business began when Don Melchor brought over prized vines from the Bordeaux region of France and opened a vineyard in Chile. Today the company exports to over 147 countries and has become a well-recognized player in the industry. They currently distribute under the brands: Don Melchor, Amelia, Terrunyo, Marqués de Casa Concha, Trío, Casillero del Diablo, Sunrise y Frontera and have been trading on New York Stock Exchange since October 12, 1994. Source: Concha y Toro 


 Viña Concha y Toro is a battle tested and well diversified producer and distributer of mostly non-premium wines. They have faced serious challenges of late and thus their stock price has remained fairly flat. Still, their historic strengths have been unwavering and they will present a solid long-term value play once they overcome the temporary headwinds they have faced in 2016 and the beginning of 2017. Historic Strength and Burgeoning Market: Viña Concha y Toro has been one of the most consistent wine producers in the world for years.

In a business that is so dependent on optimal weather conditions and exchange rate variations this is impressive and a testament to management’s ability to work with its producers to achieve steady production.

The company distributes its award winning wines around the world, enabling it to take advantage of growing markets in Asia, Europe, Canada, the U.S and Africa. In Q1 2017 63.5% of Concha y Toro’s total sales were from its exportation business. Made in Word: Data from Q1 2017 report 


 The historic strength of Viña Concha y Toro has always been backed by a consistent demand for their product. Millennials are continuing the trend of wine obsession and even increasing consumption relative to past generations. Michael Mondavi, one of the most well-known names in the industry who founded the Folio Fine Wine Partners and Michael Mondavi Family Estate in an interview with Business Insider: The average age of the consumer has dropped, and the millennials and Gen X'ers are the exciting part of the wine business. The millennials were the first generation where men and women preferred wine or beer over spirits. The millennial generation was the first where women drank as much wine as men. The Chilean wine scene is also becoming increasingly accepted and well-thought of world-wide. This is partly due to new perceptions among younger consumers about wines from Chile and South America in general. In the past South American wines have been known mainly as inexpensive alternatives, but of late an increasing number of brands are receiving quality marks from enthusiasts and critics. For example, the renowned wine critic James Suckling recently toured Chilean vineyards and gave rave reviews of their products. In fact, on his trip 84% of the wines he tasted were given ratings of 90 points or higher. James Suckling: There’s never been a better time to buy Chilean wine. The quality-price ratio is also hard to ignore: highly rated Chilean bottles that cost $15 to $30 a bottle in the United States can easily compete with European or Californian counterparts that would cost three to four times as much. Sharp Headwinds in Q1 2017:   In MM $ Q1 2017 Q1 2016   EBITDA 12,766 16,825   Operating Income 7,550 12,123   Total Cost of Sales 82,998 81,520   Total Sales 127,474 132,155   Total Volume (in Liters) 70,173 69,691   The cost of sales rose by 12.7% in Q1 due to increased wine costs which were caused by adverse weather conditions during the 2016 harvest. Both Argentina and Chile faced severe rains in 2016 due to the impact of “El Niño”, causing some serious headaches for wine producers in the region. According to Eduardo Chadwick, President of Viña Errazuriz & Seña:
 This drop in production will affect the supply of Chilean entry level wines, and will speed up the premiumization process of our industry for export. We should also see an increase in the price for top Chilean wines. For Concha y Toro, whose sales mostly come from commodity level wine, Chadwick was correct and the effects on wine production and sales numbers in Q1 2017 were evident. However, we have also seen the average price of wine sold by Concha y Toro rise. Domestically in Chile, for example, the company saw a 3.7% rise in average price and their premium sales grew by 10% while their non-premium sales decreased by .4%. In Argentina the average price per liter domestically went up a whopping 77.8%, the area, which has been hampered by bad weather conditions, looks to be a growth opportunity going forward. Unfortunately, 2017 has seen yet another year of adverse weather conditions for the company, especially in Chile. According to the annual wine production report of the Servicio Agricola y Ganadero of Chile production fell in 2017 by 6.4%. This was due to abnormally hot and dry conditions which brought the harvest forward by anywhere from two weeks to a month in the wine producing regions of Chile. This, of course, will increase the cost of sales for Concha y Toro going forward. There is a silver lining though. When I spoke to Blanca Bustamante at investor relations for the company she said that the harvest would be of very high quality this year and that the much talked about fires in the region did not impact Concha y Toro. This higher quality crop will increase the average price per liter domestically yet again(and abroad as well), a continuing trend for the company. Although exportation prices have been affected by exchange rate variations this is only a temporary issue and could lead to a price drop in the stock which would present a buying opportunity. Exchange rate variation is one of the largest issues Concha y Toro faced in Q1 2017. This is exemplified by the fact that the company’s total wine sales fell by 1.7% in Q1 2017 vs. Q1 2016, but when you ignore exchange rate variations wine sales actually went up by 9.3%. Like they said in the introduction to the Q1 2017 report:
 En el primer trimestre de 2017, Concha y Toro enfrentó un escenario externo desafiante, marcado por depreciación de monedas claves para las exportaciones frente al peso Chileno.  My translation is as follows: In Q1 2017, Concha y Toro faced a challenging international scenario, marked by depreciation of key currencies for exportation versus the Chilean peso. The depreciation of the Euro and GBP was particularly harmful to the company’s bottom line. Unforeseen issues like Brexit had a serious impact on Concha y Toro this quarter. When I asked Ms. Bustamante about this she said that although it is difficult to determine the future of the Chilean peso and other currencies, the exchange rate variation issues should lessen going forward. The other area of concern for Concha y Toro was in the 'other income' sector of the business. The termination of a distribution deal with Monster led to a 17.8% decrease in revenues in the segment. They also faced pressure in their distribution of water (-16%), Diageo products (-10%) and pisco (-10). There were however some positives in Q1 as always with Concha y Toro. Mainly, their continued commitment to reducing their debt ratio and increasing dividends. The decrease in debt is impressive given the trials faced by the company in 2016 and Q1 2017.    Q1 2017 Q1 2016   Dividend Yield 2.58% 2.06%   Debt ratio .94% .96%    Conclusion: All of these stark headwinds faced by Concha y Toro have led to investors being wary of the company.

Source: Bloomberg I can see why as they have faced exceedingly difficult challenges in their exportation business due to exchange rate variation, as well as pressure on their production and costs due to poor weather. That being said, all of these issues are temporary and haven’t changed what makes Concha y Toro one of the best and most well respected wine producers in the world. They still have excellent diversification in exportation, production and distribution, quality management, ever-increasing assets in quality locations, a state of the art center for research and innovation and a rapidly growing market. I will be keeping my eye on Concha y Toro and waiting for my entry point. In an overpriced U.S. equity market, it is wise to find value internationally and although Concha y Toro may not be ready just yet, given time they will be ripe for the picking.

Concha y Toro Winery Inc (NYSE:VCO)
Gross Property, Plant and Equipment
=GURUF("VCO","Gross Property, Plant and Equipment")

$0.0 Mil (As of Mar. 2017)
Concha y Toro Winery Inc's quarterly gross PPE increased from Sep. 2016 ($0.0 Mil) to Dec. 2016 ($912.1 Mil) but then declined from Dec. 2016 ($912.1 Mil) to Mar. 2017 ($0.0 Mil).
Concha y Toro Winery Inc's annual gross PPE declined from Dec. 2014 ($912.1 Mil) to Dec. 2015 ($826.1 Mil) but then increased from Dec. 2015 ($826.1 Mil) to Dec. 2016 ($912.1 Mil).

Definition
Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) are the fixed assets of the company. Fixed assets are also known as non-current assets.
Property, plant, and equipment includes assets that will - in the normal course of business - neither be used up in the next year nor will become a part of any product sold to customers.
Some of the most common parts of property, plant, and equipment are:

	Land
	Buildings (and leasehold improvements)
	Transportation equipment
	Manufacturing equipment
	Office equipment
	Office furniture

Companies with lots of property, plant, and equipment often have special categories. For example, railroad property includes:

	Track
	Ties
	Ballast
	Bridges
	Tunnels
	Signals
	Locomotives
	Freight Cars

There is often a note in the financial statements - found in a companys 10-K - that will explain the different categories of property a company owns.
The market value of property, plant, and equipment can differ tremendously from the book value of property, plant, and equipment.
For example, when Berkshire Hathaway liquidated its textile mills, it had to pay the buyers of the companys manufacturing equipment to haul the equipment away. That property, plant, and equipment was literally worth less than zero. On the other hand, some companies own thousands of acres of land.
All property, plant, and equipment other than land is depreciated. Land is never depreciated. However, land is not marked up to market value either. Under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), land is shown on the balance sheet at cost.
The property, plant, and equipment line shown on the balance sheet is usually net property, plant, and equipment. This means it is the cost of the property, plant, and equipment less accumulated depreciation.

Explanation
A company with durable competitive advantage doesnt need to constantly upgrade its equipment to stay competitive. The company replaces when it wears out. On the other hand, a company without any advantages must replace to keep pace.
Difference between a company with a moat and one without is that the company with the competitive advantage finances new equipment through internal cash flows, whereas the no advantage company requires debt to finance.
Producing a consistent product that doesnt change equates to consistent profits. There is no need to upgrade plants which frees up cash for other ventures. Think Coca Cola, Johnson & Johnson etc.

Concha Y Toro Winery Inc Stock Downgraded (VCO)






TheStreet Wire




Apr 22, 2013 5:08 AM EDT













 


























































  Editor's Note: TheStreet ratings do not represent the views of TheStreet's staff or its contributors. Ratings are established by computer based on metrics for performance (which includes growth, stock performance, efficiency and valuation) and risk (volatility and solvency). Companies with poor cash flow or high debt levels tend to earn lower ratings in our model.  NEW YORK ( TheStreet) -- Concha y Toro Winery (NYSE: VCO) has been downgraded by TheStreet Ratings from buy to hold. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its revenue growth, largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures and expanding profit margins. However, as a counter to these strengths, we also find weaknesses including a generally disappointing performance in the stock itself, deteriorating net income and disappointing return on equity.   EXCLUSIVE OFFER: Jim Cramer's Protégé, Dave Peltier, only buys Stocks Under $10 that he thinks could potentially double. See what he's trading today with a 14-day FREE pass.   Highlights from the ratings report include:   The revenue growth came in higher than the industry average of 3.3%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues rose by 14.4%. This growth in revenue does not appear to have trickled down to the company's bottom line, displayed by a decline in earnings per share.   The current debt-to-equity ratio, 0.40, is low and is below the industry average, implying that there has been successful management of debt levels. Although the company had a strong debt-to-equity ratio, its quick ratio of 0.90 is somewhat weak and could be cause for future problems.   36.20% is the gross profit margin for VINA CONCHA Y TORO SA which we consider to be strong. Regardless of VCO's high profit margin, it has managed to decrease from the same period last year. Despite the mixed results of the gross profit margin, VCO's net profit margin of 6.31% is significantly lower than the industry average.   Current return on equity is lower than its ROE from the same quarter one year prior. This is a clear sign of weakness within the company. In comparison to the other companies in the Beverages industry and the overall market, VINA CONCHA Y TORO SA's return on equity is significantly below that of the industry average and is below that of the S&P 500.   The share price of VINA CONCHA Y TORO SA has not done very well: it is down 6.40% and has underperformed the S&P 500, in part reflecting the company's sharply declining earnings per share when compared to the year-earlier quarter. Looking ahead, other than the push or pull of the broad market, we do not see anything in the company's numbers that may help reverse the decline experienced over the past 12 months. Despite the past decline, the stock is still selling for more than most others in its industry.  .  Vina Concha y Toro S.A., together with its subsidiaries, produces and markets wine products. The company has a P/E ratio of 16.6, below the S&P 500 P/E ratio of 17.7. Concha y Toro Winery has a market cap of $1.46 billion and is part of the consumer goods sector and food & beverage industry. Shares are up 0.1% year to date as of the close of trading on Friday.

SUMMARYBULLSBEARSTOPICSDATA CENTRALSTOCK CHARTSEC FILINGSBALANCEINCOMECASH FLOWVCO » Topics » Export Marketing StrategyThis excerpt taken from the VCO 20-F filed Jul 27, 2006.          Export Marketing Strategy

          The Company strategy is to continue developing and strengthening the Concha y Toro brand and is seeking to focus future growth in export markets on the sale of premium and varietal wines.  The Company believes future growth is possible if the company is successful in the following efforts:




  


 


improving the quality of   its wines as a result of state-of-the-art technology used by the Company in   the vinification process and vineyard management; 




  


  


  




  


 


increasing production from   current and new vineyards; 




  


  


  




  


 


changing attitudes of   consumers, especially in the United Kingdom and the United States, with   respect to the quality of Chilean wines, creating a growth opportunity for   the Company for its premium and higher-priced wines; 



  


  


  




  


 


launching new products; 




  


  


  




  


 


marketing efforts and   upgrading packaging for all product lines with a special focus on its global   brand Casillero del Diablo; and 




  


  


  




  


 


promotional and   advertisement campaigns, including on-premise sales (e.g., sales to   restaurants). 



30





          Another key part in the Companys export marketing strategy has been to diversify its export markets on a regional basis.  Diversification helps protect against economic, and in some cases political, changes which may affect the market for the Companys products.  In particular, the Company has expanded its sales to Asian, African, Eastern European and Middle Eastern countries, where the consumption of wine is increasing.
          The Company believes that there is a trend towards the consumption of varietal wines in general, and certain varietal wines in particular, in its major export markets, principally the United States, Europe, Asia and Canada.  The Company has tailored its new grape plantings to respond to this trend.  See Item 4  Information on the Company  Business Overview  Vineyards.

          Seasonality

          The Company has experienced, and expects to continue to experience, seasonal fluctuations in its revenues and net income. Both domestic and export wine sales tend to be lower during the first quarter of the year and higher during the third quarter in anticipation of the year-end holiday period. Sales volumes also typically decrease if distributors begin a quarter with larger-than-normal inventory levels, which is usually the case in the first quarter of the year. For these reasons, the operating results of the Company in any one quarter of the year may not be indicative of the year-end results.

          The following table sets forth the average quarterly percentage of the Companys sales in the domestic and export segments for the 2002-2004 periods, as a percentage of sales by volume.

SUMMARYBULLSBEARSTOPICSDATA CENTRALSTOCK CHARTSEC FILINGSBALANCEINCOMECASH FLOWVCO » Topics » Domestic Marketing StrategyThis excerpt taken from the VCO 20-F filed Jun 30, 2009.          Domestic
Marketing Strategy
          The Company
is seeking to increase its market share in all segments of the Chilean wine
market, especially in the premium and varietal wine segment. The Company believes it is well positioned
within this market due to its portfolio of brands, which it believes
successfully competes with other wine producers in all segments of the domestic
market.
          In terms of
distribution, the strategy of the Company is to be present in all relevant
channels for wine sales in Chile, with special focus on supermarkets and the
retail channel. Accordingly, the retail
sector of the Company has been strengthened both in commercial and marketing
terms.
          Regarding
the portfolio of products, the Company is permanently developing new formats
and updating the presentation of its products.
Advertising methods and marketing strategies differ depending on whether
the targeted segment is comprised of potential consumers of the Companys
premium, varietal, bi-varietal, or popular wines. During 2008, the greatest efforts in advertising were focused on
strengthening the Clos de Pirque and Casillero del Diablo brands in the market
through mass media campaigns, including television and press. 
          Domestic Sales  Other Products. In the past few years, Comercial Peumothe
distribution subsidiary for the Chilean local markethas entered into new
non-wine businesses, especially in the liquor and beer categories. These categories show strong growth and
present an expanded business opportunity for the subsidiary. In April of 2008, Comercial Peumo signed a
distribution agreement with SAB Millerone of the three largest brewers world
widewith the aim of enhancing the Companys presence in the imported premium
beer category. Accordingly, since May
of 2008, Comercial Peumo has distributed, mainly in supermarkets, Miller
Genuine Draft© beer. In April 2009, Comercial Peumo signed a distribution agreement
with Diageo Chile Limitada and commenced wholesale distribution of Diageos
products in Chile, which include the different domestic distribution channels,
except for the largest supermarket chains. The Diageo products covered by the
agreement include Johnnie Walker©, Pampero Rum©, Baileys Liquors©, Smirnoff
Vodka©, Gordons Gin© and Cuervo Tequila©.  
          Sales of
Comercial Peumo in 2008 were Ch$56,746 million, with its new business area
contributing 7.5%. With the distribution of the new Diageo products, the
Company believes that this business area could eventually contribute 20% of the
sales of Comercial Peumo.
          Company Sales - Export Markets
          According
to the Exporters Association, exports of Chilean wine totaled US$1,376 million and 589 million
liters in 2008, representing an increase of 9.5% in value and a decrease of
3.5% in volume terms, as compared to 2007.
          Export Sales and Competition. The Company is the largest exporter of
Chilean wines on both a volume and US$ value basis, with market share in 2008
of 25.4% and 28.3% (including bulk) respectively, according to the Exporters
Association. The Companys bottled wine
market share by volume and US$ value was 37.0% and 31.4%, respectively, in
2008. The Companys closest Chilean
competitor in the bottled export segment, in terms of volume and US$ value,
reported the equivalent of 34% and 36% of the Companys sales, respectively.

Grape Varietals




Of the many factors that determine the characteristics of a given wine, the grape varietal is perhaps the most important. Although there are over 10,000 different documented varietals within the species Vitis Vinifera (regarded as the "true" wine grapes), the grapes listed on this page are the ones most commonly cultivated for fine wines.
Each grape varietal has differing aroma and flavor characteristics when it is made into wine. But wines made from individual varietals will also vary in character depending on where in the world the grapes are grown: for example, vineyards in New World growing regions will produce wines with different flavors and aromas than vineyards from Old World growing regions, even when the wines are made from the exact same grape varietal.
Use the links below to find top-rated wines for each of the varietals and learn about what makes each varietal unique.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
