CPI International made its initial public offering in April, 2006.[3]

Exhibit 99.1CPI INTERNATIONAL ANNOUNCES FISCAL 2016 FINANCIAL RESULTSPALO ALTO, Calif. - December 14, 2016 - CPI International Holding Corp., the parent company of CPI International, Inc. (CPI), today announced financial results for its fiscal year 2016, which ended on September 30, 2016.“The second half of fiscal 2016 was very strong for CPI, offsetting the somewhat slow start to the year that was caused by delays in the placement of government orders.  These delays have eased somewhat and business conditions strengthened as the year progressed.  As we enter fiscal 2017, our defense market remains healthy, our communications market is strong and our medical market is beginning to rebound,” said Joe Caldarelli, chief executive officer.  “Additionally, over the course of the year, we announced several noteworthy, large programs that were awarded to CPI, promising not only ongoing shipments but also fostering our research and development activities and expanding our capabilities in microwave and millimeter wave technologies.”Orders and SalesCPI’s total orders and sales were at the highest levels in its history in fiscal 2016.  In addition, orders in each of the company’s three largest markets were at or near record levels.  Sales in the defense and communications markets set new records, as well.CPI booked orders totaling $501 million in fiscal 2016, a 14 percent increase from the $437 million booked in the prior year.  Orders increased in the defense, medical and communications markets.Sales in fiscal 2016 totaled $495 million, a 10 percent increase from the $448 million generated in the previous year.  Sales increased in the defense and communications markets, but decreased in the medical market.CPI ASC Signal Division contributed approximately $50 million in orders and approximately $47 million in sales to fiscal 2016.  The significant majority of CPI ASC Signal Division’s business is in the communications market; the remainder is in the radar segment of the defense market.Net Income and Adjusted EBITDACPI generated net income totaling $5.7 million in fiscal 2016, a 16 percent increase from the $4.9 million generated in the prior year.The company’s adjusted EBITDA totaled $86.1 million in fiscal 2016, a nine percent increase from the $79.1 million generated in fiscal 2015.The increases in net income and adjusted EBITDA were primarily the result of higher sales volume in fiscal 2016, particularly from the ASC Signal Division.Defense MarketIn fiscal 2016, CPI’s orders in the defense market increased one percent to $177 million.  This increase was primarily the result of higher orders for a variety of radar programs, including the Aegis radar systems, and for an airborne electronic countermeasure system.Defense sales increased three percent to $186 million.  The inclusion of sales from the ASC Signal Division and higher sales for radar programs, including the Aegis radar systems, were the primary reasons for this increase.

CPI International, Inc. is the holding company for Communications & Power Industries, the largest[citation needed] manufacturer and rebuilder of electron devices (primarily vacuum tubes) in the United States. CPI was founded in 1995[2] when Varian Associates sold its electron-device business (the original business of its founders) to concentrate on medical systems. Its major subsidiaries include Eimac (which manufactures new vacuum tubes for the broadcasting, radar, medical systems, and other applications), Econco (a vacuum-tube rebuilder), Beverly Microwave Systems, and Radant Technologies. CPI International made its initial public offering in April, 2006.[3]
CPI's Econco division remanufactures Eimac and Machlett power tubes.
In February 2011, an affiliate of Veritas Capital, a private equity investment firm which invests in companies that provide critical products and services to governments worldwide, acquired CPI for approximately $525 million. CPI International ceased trading on The Nasdaq Stock Market.
In fiscal 2013, CPI employed approximately 1,670 people and generated approximately $420 million in sales.[citation needed]

CPI International, Inc. is the holding company for Communications & Power Industries, the largest[citation needed] manufacturer and rebuilder of electron devices (primarily vacuum tubes) in the United States. CPI was founded in 1995[2] when Varian Associates sold its electron-device business (the original business of its founders) to concentrate on medical systems. Its major subsidiaries include Eimac (which manufactures new vacuum tubes for the broadcasting, radar, medical systems, and other applications), Econco (a vacuum-tube rebuilder), Beverly Microwave Systems, and Radant Technologies. CPI International made its initial public offering in April, 2006.[3]
CPI's Econco division remanufactures Eimac and Machlett power tubes.
In February 2011, an affiliate of Veritas Capital, a private equity investment firm which invests in companies that provide critical products and services to governments worldwide, acquired CPI for approximately $525 million. CPI International ceased trading on The Nasdaq Stock Market.
In fiscal 2013, CPI employed approximately 1,670 people and generated approximately $420 million in sales.[citation needed]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
