To midstate shareholders attracted to local stocks, Harsco Corp. hasn’t had much allure these days.    The Wormleysburg-based company’s portfolio has dropped about 70 percent since hitting its peak of $64 in 2008, stalling at $22 on Friday when the Fortune 500 company announced the resignation of its chairman and CEO, Salvatore D. View full sizeSalvatore D. FazzolariFazzolari.  
Officials contended the company has underdelivered over the past two years and needs new leadership.    “A new leader will better position the company to deliver shareholder value,” company spokesman Ken Julian said.    The company’s board of directors named Henry W. Knueppel, a member of the board, as interim CEO until a permanent replacement is found.    Harsco, a company worth $3 billion, provides industrial services and engineered products primarily to steel, construction, railways and energy industries worldwide, employing 19,000 employees at 350 sites in 53 countries.    It’s a big company, and it’s footprint stretches across the world, as more than 85 percent of its employees work outside the United States.    Without a stake in company, you probably wouldn’t notice its global headquarters overlooking the Susquehanna River, where about 120 employees work.    The company sponsors the Harsco Science Center in the Whitaker Center for Science and the Arts in Harrisburg, but Doug Thomas, a research analyst, said most wouldn’t recognize the name.    “It’s not McDonald’s or Hershey,” said Thomas, president of Lancaster-based JET Research Investments. “No one knows what they do.”    And you wouldn’t know of its struggles.    Fazzolari’s exit followed the heels of $270 million loss in the company’s infrastructure branch — an almost $1 billion operation that includes the building of highways and buildings — since 2010.    Harsco’s stock dropped about 36 percent during that time, moving from a peak of about $34 in 2010 to $22.57 at the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday. The decline comes as the rest of the market is enjoying a surge to heights not seen in years.    What happened?    The giant might have grown too big for its own good, some analysts say.    It’s a problem Fazzolari, who started at Harsco as an auditor 32 years ago, might have inherited when he took over as CEO in 2008, before the global economy soured, said Robert Norfleet III, a stock analyst with BB&T Capital Markets.    “They are way too spread out,” Norfleet said. “They had offices everywhere.”    Harsco had 350 offices in 2009 and bought new equipment for every construction project, Norfleet said. In both 2007 and 2008 Harsco spent about $220 million on equipment, about half of the branch’s operating costs.    Harsco spent a lot of money hoping to make even more, Norfleet said.    But during the process, the company notched several high-profile projects.    Harsco supplied the equipment used in the construction of Burj Khalifa, formerly known as Burj Dubai, the world’s tallest building, in the United Arab Emirates.    New York City’s Bank of America Tower, considered by some to be one of the world’s greenest office buildings, is equipped with Harsco hot-water systems.    The company also helped build the Marina Bay Sands, the largest resort in Singapore.    And then the bottom fell out.    Confidence crumbled with the collapse of the economy at the end of 2008, people stopped building, and Harsco was left with unused equipment, expensive offices and droves of employees with no work to do, industry analysts say.    In 2008, Harsco’s infrastructure branch made a $190 million profit and brought in less than half that in 2009, logging $68 million.    In 2010, Harsco decided to close offices and cut staff to balance their budget.    Over the next two years, the company closed 73 branch offices, 11 administration offices and axed about 800 people.    The cuts accounted for a 40 percent decline in Harsco’s infrastructure operations and cost the company $171 million in restructuring charges.    In total, the infrastructure branch lost $270 million in 2010 and <ze>¤’11.    This year, Harsco has already lost about $18 million, Norfleet said.    So how do you fix it?    More cuts, Norfleet said.    “There is a way out of this. Fazzolari did a lot,” he added. “Perhaps the company is looking for someone with fresh eyes with more aggressive restructuring initiatives.”    Derek Hathaway, who has been particularly quiet about the company’s progress since his departure as CEO in 2007, offered little comment Friday.    “It saddens me to see him go,” he said, “and I wish the company the best of luck in choosing its new leader.”

He is also an advisory board member of Current Capital LLC, and is a trustee of Susquehanna University. He earned his bachelor of business administration degree in accounting from Pennsylvania State University.

 

The Board of Directors has determined that Mr. Fazzolari should serve as a Director because of his extensive executive management experience, including his service as Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Harsco Corporation. In that position, Mr. Fazzolari dealt with many of the major issues, such as financial, strategic, technology, compensation, management development, acquisitions, capital allocation, government and stockholder relations, that the Company deals with today. Also, Mr. Fazzolari has extensive global experience, and because of his considerable financial background, he is a financial expert for the Company's Audit Committee and serves as its chairman.
