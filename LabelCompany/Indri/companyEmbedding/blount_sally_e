Building on MORS-430 (Leadership in Organizations), this 5-week course moves the focus from mid-level leadership to the senior executive level of the organization. The goal is to provide insight into leading at "height and scale" - that is, what management and leadership look and feel like when you oversee 1,000 to 100,000 people and $500M to billions in revenue. How do you lead when you are only one person and you can't "do" the work of the organization yourself, you can only steer those who do? 
To make this perspective as concrete as possible, we will focus on four key behavioral levers/activities that leaders have available to them to shape and have impact within large, complex organizations. 
Four Key Behavioral Levers/Activities:
- Establishing a power base ("power")
- Navigating the organizational dynamics of change ("politics")
- Honing and leveraging your communications skills ("talk")
- Building your senior leadership team
The 1/2 credit course will include 5 plenary sessions (2 hours/session) and 5 small-group discussion sections (1 hour/session).  Each plenary session will combine lecture and senior executive guest speakers who will build on that week's topic by sharing their own insights and experiences.  Discussion groups will follow each plenary as forums for reacting and engaging in dialogue with a smaller group of classmates about lecture content, readings and speakers.Executive EducationAdvanced Management Program For high-potential executives with enterprise-level responsibilities, this condensed, immersive experience — enhanced throughout with executive coaching — focuses on developing senior executive leadership agility, driving innovation, identifying growth opportunities and equipping your organization for the challenges and opportunities of the 21st-century.View ProgramAdvanced Management Program: The Global Experience Designed for the the high-potential executive, Kellogg’s Advanced Management Program: The Global Experience provides an immersive journey into leadership agility, driving innovation and identifying growth opportunities. This modular format provides a weeklong, unparalleled  intensive week in a global market.View Program

Faculty and ResearchThe Kellogg School faculty is an esteemed group of scholars and practitioners, and members provide a rich source of international experience in professional management problems and practices. Faculty members combine real-world and academic knowledge of management problems to augment their theoretical training. Senior faculty members also teach courses to senior executives through the Kellogg School’s executive programs. This approach reinforces faculty research and keeps faculty members abreast of changes in corporate practices. All Kellogg School courses combine theory and practice. Teaching methods include case study, field study, seminars, simulations, and independent work. Faculty members choose the method most appropriate to the material and their individual styles. Research is a vital component of Kellogg’s program, and faculty members have developed groundbreaking theories in many academic fields, such as marketing, banking, strategy, and game theory. There are several research centers, on topics ranging from dispute resolution to banking. Several scholarly journals are edited at Kellogg, two of which—the Journal of Economics and Management Strategy and Games and Economic Behavior—were founded here. The Journal of Financial Intermediation was also founded at Kellogg.

Sally Blount - Wikipedia





















 






Sally Blount

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Sally Blount is the Dean of the Kellogg School of Management and the Michael L. Nemmers Professor of Management and Organizations at Northwestern University. She serves on the board of directors for Abbot Laboratories and on advisory boards for the Aspen Institute, the Chicago Innovation Awards, the Indian School of Business, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, and the Fundação Dom Cabral.[1] In 2012, she co-chaired the World Economic Forum’s conference on Latin America.[2][3]
Blount graduated from Princeton University in 1983 with a joint degree from the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. She then worked as an associate for the Boston Consulting Group and as a business manager for Eva Maddox Associates in Chicago. In 1988, she enrolled in the doctoral program at Kellogg, graduating with a PhD in Organizational Behavior in 1992.[4]
Upon completing her studies, Blount served on the faculty at the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago for nine years. She transitioned to the Stern School of Business at New York University in 2001. After teaching at Stern for three years, in 2004, Blount was appointed dean of undergraduate students. Under her leadership, Stern received a $15 million gift, the largest fundraising gift in its history. In 2007, Blount added onto her work at Stern by becoming the special adviser for global academic integration for NYU’s president and provost. She played a key role in the establishment of NYU’s new campus in Abu Dhabi.[5][6]
Blount became Kellogg’s dean in 2010. When she was appointed, the Financial Times wrote, "Blount will arguably become the most influential female dean in the US, representing the only one of the self-appointed group of seven top graduate business schools to have a woman in the job".[7]

Sally Blount - Wikipedia





















 






Sally Blount

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Sally Blount is the Dean of the Kellogg School of Management and the Michael L. Nemmers Professor of Management and Organizations at Northwestern University. She serves on the board of directors for Abbot Laboratories and on advisory boards for the Aspen Institute, the Chicago Innovation Awards, the Indian School of Business, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, and the Fundação Dom Cabral.[1] In 2012, she co-chaired the World Economic Forum’s conference on Latin America.[2][3]
Blount graduated from Princeton University in 1983 with a joint degree from the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. She then worked as an associate for the Boston Consulting Group and as a business manager for Eva Maddox Associates in Chicago. In 1988, she enrolled in the doctoral program at Kellogg, graduating with a PhD in Organizational Behavior in 1992.[4]
Upon completing her studies, Blount served on the faculty at the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago for nine years. She transitioned to the Stern School of Business at New York University in 2001. After teaching at Stern for three years, in 2004, Blount was appointed dean of undergraduate students. Under her leadership, Stern received a $15 million gift, the largest fundraising gift in its history. In 2007, Blount added onto her work at Stern by becoming the special adviser for global academic integration for NYU’s president and provost. She played a key role in the establishment of NYU’s new campus in Abu Dhabi.[5][6]
Blount became Kellogg’s dean in 2010. When she was appointed, the Financial Times wrote, "Blount will arguably become the most influential female dean in the US, representing the only one of the self-appointed group of seven top graduate business schools to have a woman in the job".[7]
