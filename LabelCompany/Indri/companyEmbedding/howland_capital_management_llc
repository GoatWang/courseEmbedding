Our Firm
Howland Capital Management LLC was founded in 1967 to serve the interests of one family. The successful supervision of their wealth set the standard and provided stability for the firm as it evolved from a family office into a multifaceted private investment advisor. The firm has grown to serve a wide range of clients including individuals, families, and small institutions, providing the prudent and personal counsel that a constantly changing investment environment requires.
Howland Capital is a privately owned, SEC Registered Investment Advisor, with over $1.7 billion in assets under management. We have made the strategic decision to remain independent in order to provide the personal attention, client-centric focus, and continuity that our clients deserve.
Located in downtown Boston, we have a staff of over 26 employees who provide investment management services to our clients. While investment management is at the core of what we do, our professional staff includes six who hold the Chartered Financial Analyst designation, five Certified Public Accountants, and two who are Certified Financial PlannerTM professionals. Together, they create financial plans, serve as trustees and executors, prepare tax returns and offer advice, thus providing a comprehensive "turnkey" solution for a wide range of individuals, families and small institutions.
Personalized service starts with the understanding that no two clients are alike. We partner with our clients to provide the:

Time
Interest
Knowledge
Discipline

to effectively manage their financial affairs. The firm's low client-to-manager ratio allows us to develop an in-depth understanding of our clients' needs and goals, recognizing that they evolve over time.
Key Tenets of Howland Capital:

Focus on Individuals & Families - While our investment approach is certainly appropriate for the management of institutional assets, our primary focus remains on the management of assets for individuals and their families.
Confidentiality - Recognizing that our clients do not want to be measured by their wealth, we are very sensitive to client privacy and disclosure.
Continuity - Knowing that the investment professionals and the firm to whom they have entrusted their assets will be there in the future is an essential component to the peace of mind that our clients have. This is especially so given the depth and breadth of the relationship.

We purposely do not have a minimum account size, believing that a fruitful relationship is driven more by the alignment of a client's needs and goals with our capabilities and services.  If the appropriate chemistry and trust exist, the foundation for a successful relationship is in place.

Client Services
While managing investment portfolios is at the core of what we do, we provide a wide range of services for our clients in order to help them manage, simplify and consolidate their financial affairs. This holistic approach allows us to integrate the full scope of a client's financial picture.  Clients benefit from our ability to help address questions which they may not have even considered, in addition to the ones they might initially raise on their own.  Ultimately, consolidating their affairs brings clients a breadth of service and peace of mind at a very competitive fee. Our services include:
Custody:

Corporate trustee
Individual custody 
Scheduled remittances to client or vendor accounts
IRA distributions and funding 
Annual family and charitable gifts 

Trust Services:
With nearly two-thirds of the assets we manage held in trust, we understand the important role that a carefully drafted estate plan can play in achieving a variety of desired objectives.  Typically it is how a family's assets are held that provides the most effective after-tax result. While we do not perform legal services, we live within the confines and constraints of estate planning documents, and have developed an in-depth understanding of the legal and tax issues unique to various types of trust instruments.  Given this expertise, we are commonly asked by clients to:

Serve as an individual trustee 
Provide trust administration / probate accounting
Provide foundation and charitable trust management / accounting
Provide irrevocable life insurance trust administration 

Tax Preparation & Advice:
We use our in-house staff of tax professionals to prepare tax returns for many clients, and to help answer tax-related questions or concerns that commonly arise during the investment management  and estate planning process.  Specific services include:

Tax preparation (Individual, Trust, Foundation, Gift, Estate, Corporate, Partnership)
Tax advice and retirement planning
Required minimum distribution  calculations
Estimated tax payments
Roth IRA conversions

Estates:
We also perform the following estate-related duties, usually in conjunction with a client's estate planning attorney:

Estate settlement
Executor role
Generational gifts
Real estate / personal property ownership and transfer

Financial Planning:
Many of our clients share at least two areas of concern: 1) not outliving their assets and 2) leaving some sort of legacy to the next generation.  While broad-based in its scope, our financial planning is focused on addressing these dual concerns through:

Income / cash flow projections
Mortgage / refinancing  decisions
Lease vs. buy decisions
Education planning 
Recommended estate planning vehicles

Charitable Giving
We help many clients determine and achieve their philanthropic goals, including how to ensure these values transfer to the next generation. We administer these gifts via:

Annual gifts (both cash and stock)
Donor-advised funds
Foundations
Charitable trusts



Client Management
Clients benefit from our ability to answer their questions as well as address topics which they may not have even considered. Ultimately, consolidating their affairs brings clients a breadth of service and peace of mind.

Custody
Trust services
Tax preparation & advice
Estate planning
Financial planning
Charitable giving

Investment Management
Our long-term investment approach involves constructing and managing individual portfolios for our clients, which allows their wealth to grow long-term after taxes, fees and inflation.
Our goal is to ensure that wealth becomes positive influence in our clients' lives and in the lives of their families.  By addressing concerns and asking the questions they may not have considered, we partner with our clients to allow them to both "sleep well" and "eat well".
Often times, the most important determinant to success is how assets are "structured" or owned, not how they have performed.  Consequently, we utilize multiple account types for the same client, including the following: 

Individual Agency Accounts
Revocable and Irrevocable Trusts
Retirement & Pension Accounts
Custodial Accounts and Educational Trusts
Foundations & Charitable Trusts
Endowments for Small Non-profits
Estates

Our approach emphasizes the use of individual securities to construct portfolios augmented by mutual and exchange traded funds to achieve the desired level of diversification. We seek to balance growth of assets with the preservation of capital, being mindful of the role current income plays in any investment plan.
Typical asset classes include the following:

Domestic Equities
International Equities 
Municipal Bonds
Corporate Bonds
Treasury and Agency Bonds
Inflation Protected Bonds
Venture Capital
Direct Private Investments
Hedge Funds
Commodities

Portfolio Construction:
After the appropriate accounts are opened, portfolio construction begins with the development of an Investment Policy Statement (IPS) for each client/family. The IPS is created through collaboration between our clients and the portfolio manager with primary account responsibility. The IPS balances a variety of factors such as income needs, risk tolerance, tax and legal issues and future cash flows, to ultimately determine an appropriate asset allocation.  The result is a "road map" that guides both the portfolio manager and client.  The IPS also allows for the disciplined management of client portfolios, incorporating changes in client circumstance/goals and the dynamics of the investment environment.  The portfolio construction process is sensitive to the tax ramifications of any changes that are made in specific accounts, further highlighting the importance of owning individual securities where the tax consequences of any transaction can be controlled.
While each account is unique, we utilize four Model Portfolios which help guide and lend discipline to the portfolio construction process.

Aggressive Growth
Growth 
Growth & Income
Income

With most clients having multiple accounts, we look at a client's consolidated portfolio when rebalancing against a model, while placing individual securities in the accounts where they are likely to generate the best after-tax return or where they lighten the administrative burden of tax reporting.	
Research:
Our clients take comfort in the fact that the portfolio managers who manage their portfolios are also those who conduct the underlying securities research.  Our approach to investment research is collaborative, and draws upon our portfolio managers' unique backgrounds and experience, including specific industry knowledge or expertise related to a certain asset class.  Every portfolio manager is assigned specific research responsibilities, and ideas are shared and decisions made at weekly Investment Committee meetings attended by all portfolio managers.  The result of this vetting process is to identify securities that can be held by most if not all accounts, so as to have all clients benefit from this collective knowledge and expertise.
In addition to our own research, we receive research reports from numerous Wall Street brokerage firms with whom we have long-standing relationships.  We also benefit from our downtown Boston location, which affords us the opportunity to meet with company management and industry analysts.  
Equity Selection Process:
Our equity selection process centers on identifying companies with the following characteristics:

Superior earnings and dividend growth
Dominant market share 
Sustainable competitive advantage
Conservative financial structure
Management strength and ownership with a consistent track record of success
Attractive valuation relative to earnings potential

Fixed Income Selection Process:
For fixed income securities, we look for:

Income/Yield
Credit Quality with a focus on safety of principal
Sustainable, recurring cash flow
Balance sheet strength

Venture Capital and Direct Private Investments:
The founding family began investing in venture capital in its early years, forming a number of fruitful relationships with some of the top firms in this sector. Not all of our clients are willing or able to take on the illiquidity and risk associated with this asset class, but for those where it is an appropriate investment, we target a prudent allocation to this higher-growth asset class. While regulatory and risk tolerance constraints limit the number of clients who can directly participate, all of our clients benefit from our view into nascent technologies and products as it informs our analysis of current core holdings and generates new investment ideas.


Research
Our clients take comfort in the fact that the portfolio managers who manage their affairs are also those who conduct the underlying securities research. Our approach draws on 175 years of collective investment management experience.
