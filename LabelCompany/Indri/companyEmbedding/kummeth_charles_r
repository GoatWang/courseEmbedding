Patent number:  6264533
                                            

Abstract:  An apparatus and method for abrasively processing an article involves the use of an abrasive product provided with a machine discernable pattern representative of information of varying types. The pattern is read while the abrasive product moves relative to the article, and is used to control the movement of the abrasive product relative to the article. The pattern may include one or more of a machine discernable electrical characteristic, optical characteristic, topographic characteristic or magnetic characteristic. Reading the pattern may involve one or more of electrically, optically, mechanically or magnetically reading the machine discernable pattern provided on the abrasive product. The pattern may include one or more of indicia, protrusions, depressions, holes, voids, color or pigment variations, bar codes, magnetic transitions or periodic markings. The pattern may include one or more of indexing information, servo information, alignment information or abrasive product identification information.

Method for locating data in a data cartridge system



Patent number:  5373485
                                            

Abstract:  A physical and logical block search method and apparatus that also locates the end of data on a data tape written in a serpentine pattern. A physical address is decoded to determine the track location and physical block address of a physical block on a serpentine data pattern written on a data cartridge tape. The tape is manipulated in the forward and reverse direction depending on the location of the beginning of data on the track. The search algorithm exploits serpentine nature of the tape and the location of the physical blocks in each track to find the physical address. The logical address of a logical block is used to determine a target track number. A prediction is made as to the location of the target track. The prediction is verified by checking the block. If the logical block was not accurately predicted the method repredicts until the logical block is found. The end of tape is located using a binary search based on knowledge of the track assignment of the serpentine data pattern on the tape.
                        

Type: 
                                                    Grant
                                            

Filed: 
                        September 3, 1991
                    

Date of Patent: 
                                                        December 13, 1994
                        

Assignee:

Good morning. And welcome to the Bio-Techne Earnings Conference Call for the Fourth Quarter, for 2015 Year End. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the call will be open for the questions following management's prepared remarks.
I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jim Hippel, Chief Financial Officer.
James T. Hippel - CFO, VP-Finance & Principal Accounting Officer
Good morning and thank you for joining us. Also on the call this morning is Chuck Kummeth, Chief Executive Officer of Bio-Techne.
Before we begin, let me briefly cover our Safe Harbor statement. Some of the remarks made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements. The company's 10-K for fiscal year 2014 identifies certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected any forward-looking statements made during this call. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of any new information or future events or developments. The 10-K as well as the company's other SEC filings are available on the company's website within its Investor Relations section.
During the call, non-GAAP financial measures may be used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. Tables reconciling these measures to most comparable GAAP measures are available in the company's press release issued early this morning or on the Bio-Techne Corporation website, at www.biotechne.com.
One other item before we get started and as I mentioned in previous quarter calls, please note that the commentary today regarding the total company's Q4 organic growth by end market and geography does not include the performance of our Protein Platforms division.
With that, I will turn the call over to Chuck.
Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today for our fourth quarter call. This morning, we reported a 27% increase in revenue for the fourth quarter, with strength organically in most of our end markets and with sales contribution from the acquisitions we made over the past year.
Organic growth was solid for the quarter, at 7%, with nice contribution from both our Biotechnology and Clinical Control segments. The strong finish for the year allowed us to end fiscal year 2015 with full-year revenues that grew 26% overall and 4% organically. Protein, the Biotech product that we are most well known for, experienced mid-single digit growth in Q4, just as it has for the last several quarters. We feel Proteins are positioned well to continue this growth trajectory going forward.
Antibodies, another significant Biotech product category, also had a solid quarter with mid-single digit organic growth. This marks the first quarter in over eight quarters where we have had positive growth in antibodies. Biotech's Assays product category also performed similarly, and together this is the reasons that the Biotech division had the best quarter in years. We are delighted to see this and it gives us confidence that we are doing the right things to rejuvenate the core of the company.
We are very excited about the progress with integrating our Reagents-based acquisitions, PrimeGene and Novus. PrimeGene has experienced near 100% growth in our China for China brand strategy. They've just moved to a new factory, where we will focus on G&P level products as well as boosting the product portfolio.

Novus is completely integrated now and the internal system infrastructure that managed over 200,000 antibody products is now a central system in our overall antibody commercial operations. We have now crossed the 800 mark for certified antibodies to run on our Simple Wes platform within our ProteinSimple business. This will allow researchers to purchase our antibodies with confidence that they'll perform as advertised.
In Q4, North America continued to experience stable organic growth for the Biotech division. In this region, our biopharma end markets experienced approximately 10% growth, as they've done for all of fiscal year 2015. And our academia end market continued with its streak of sequential improvements since the Fisher channel partnership was put in place over a year ago, with growth this quarter in the mid-single digits. Both our U.S. sales team and the Fisher channel remain focused on engaging customers and understand their specific needs in combination with our new trade show investment and strategies.
Europe rebounded in Q4, with most countries continuing to perform nicely. Germany was less the drag on organic growth during the quarter, with low-single digit declines year-over-year compared to the double-digit declines throughout the rest of fiscal year 2015. There are signs now that the pharma research cycle in Germany may have bottomed and we could see an uptick in growth here later in fiscal year 2016. Currency translation in Europe continued to be a significant headwind in Q4 and this is headwind will stay with us throughout the first half of fiscal year 2016, assuming they stay where they are today.
When we look at our results in Asia, China really knocked it out of the park in Q4, with 35% organic growth, finishing the year with organic growth in the mid-20%s, just as we expected at the beginning of the fiscal year. What we didn't foresee a year ago was the disruption caused by the Chinese government's anti-corruption auditing activities. But our team in China persevered despite the distractions and I'm very proud of what they achieved this year. We've now grown the Bio-Techne organization in China from just 12 people two years ago to now near 100. We expect exciting times in China to continue.
In the Pacific Rim, we reported last quarter this region was impacted negatively by distributors reducing inventories due to the sudden strengthening of the U.S. dollar. In Q4 Japan was still soft, showing signs of stabilizing, while the rest of the Pacific Rim markets returned to double-digit growth. Assuming no further change in exchange rates, we believe the worst is behind us and Japan too will return to growth in fiscal year 2016.
In our Clinical Controls division, some new projects from OEM customers that were delayed last quarter began to transfer in Q4, resulting in revenue growth in the high-single digits for the quarter. For the year, Clinical Controls grew mid-single digits. We remain excited about some of the projects that we have for the business and we expect this kind of annual growth rate to continue.
Lastly, our Protein Platforms segment finished the year with 22% organic growth on a standalone basis but suffered in Q4 of roughly flat year-over-year revenue and breakeven operating profit. The year-over-year comparable was especially difficult in Q4, given it was the last full quarter under prior ownership. However, the Q4 performance of this division was still below our expectations. There were several setbacks in the quarter, mostly related to the integration of CyVek and commercial team attrition.
We have done a lot of reviewing of the situation, the operations, the team and the commercial processes and feel we have corrected the primary issues causing the bump in the road. We also recognize that it's an instruments business that will be more lumpy quarter-to-quarter than our core run rate reagents business model. Nothing has changed in our view of the market potential of the game-changing platform solutions and continue to expect the business to operate at 20% organic growth annually for the foreseeable future.

We must also remember that CyVek is a pure start-up. And while we are now selling instruments, the product line should be viewed as a few years behind ProteinSimple. Thus, this product line will be dilutive to adjusted earnings until revenues start to scale, with profitability not expected until fiscal year 2017. But the future is very bright here, it's just not here yet.
To help guide us towards this bright future, we have hired a new Head of Human Resources who is experienced in change management. We are very excited about this new addition to our executive team. The company has grown in the past two years from 750 people to nearly 1,500 and from six sites to 21.
The promise of success for Bio-Techne will be directly related to how fast we can get businesses and teams working together, collaborating on complete solutions that are comprised of both reagents and instruments in our strategic markets. Focusing on managing change, culture and collaboration will accelerate our time to success.
I am proud of our team's record performance this quarter and the increasing amount of dedication to our business. There is true excitement and energy coming not only from our headquarters in Minneapolis, but all our new sites and regions. It shows our recently conducted commercial reviews and in the faces of all those involved. We look forward to another strong year ahead with ever-increasing growth levels of the company, given new many platforms that we now have in our portfolio.
With that, I will turn the call over to Jim for more detail on the financials before we open the line up for Q&A. Jim?
James T. Hippel - CFO, VP-Finance & Principal Accounting Officer
Thanks, Chuck. As on prior earnings calls, I will provide an overview of our Q4 financial performance for the total company and then provide some color on each of our three segments. As a reminder, at the total company level, reported organic growth excludes the results of acquired companies up to the one-year anniversary date of acquisition and it also excludes the impact of foreign currency translation. However, for the Protein Platforms segment, we are providing organic revenue growth on a pro forma basis as if we owned ProteinSimple and CyVek for all 2014 and 2015.
So starting with the overall financial performance for the fourth quarter. Adjusted earnings was approximately flat to the prior year at $32.6 million, while adjusted EPS was $0.87 versus $0.88 in the prior year. The impact of currency translation was a $0.05 year-over-year headwind. For the full year 2015 adjusted earnings were $126.8 million, a 1% increase versus prior year. Adjusted EPS was $3.40 versus $3.39, with a foreign currency translation headwind of $0.18.
Under GAAP, EPS recorded was $0.71 compared to $0.72 in the prior year. And for the full year GAAP EPS was $2.89 versus $3 last year. The decrease from last year for both the quarter and the year was driven by the amortization of intangibles and other costs related to acquisitions, in addition to the impact of currency translation.
On the top line, Q4 reported sales were $117.7 million, an increase of 27% year-over-year, with organic growth of 7%. Q4 sales included approximately 25% growth from acquisitions and a negative 4% impact from foreign exchange. Full-year reported revenue was $452.2 million, an increase of 26%, with organic growth at 4%. Revenue for the full year included approximately 25% growth from acquisitions and a 2% headwind from currency translation.
Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin came in at 70.8% in Q4, down 250 basis points from the prior year. The decrease is due to product mix change associated with the acquisitions that have occurred since last year as well as the impact of currency translation.

For the full year, adjusted gross margin was 71.6%, down 190 basis points from last year. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and FX, core gross margins marginally improved year-over-year for both the quarter and the full year due to the business productivity initiatives. Adjusted SG&A in Q4 was 21.7% of revenue and R&D was 9.2% of revenue, 650 basis points and 100 basis points higher than last year, respectively. The increases in these operating expenses were driven by the acquisitions made since Q4 of last year. The resulting adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 39.9%. Operating margins excluding the impact of acquisitions and FX were flat compared to Q4 of last year.
For the full year, adjusted SG&A was 21.7% of revenue and R&D expense was 9% of revenue, a 700 basis point and 30 basis point increase, respectively, from the prior year. The resulted adjusted operating margins for the full year were 40.8%. Again, excluding the impact of acquisitions, FX and higher non-cash stock-based compensation, operating margins were essentially flat to the prior year.
Looking at our numbers below operating income, net interest expense in Q4 was $260,000 compared to $1 million of net interest income last year. This is as a result of a line of credit that was opened in July of 2014 to partially fund the acquisitions of ProteinSimple and CyVek. Net interest expense for the full year was $0.9 million versus interest income of $2.7 million in the prior year.
Adjusted other non-operating income for Q4 was $0.7 million compared to $0.4 million of non-operating expense in the prior year quarter. And for the full year, adjusted non-operating expense was $0.3 million versus $1.1 million in the prior year. Adjusted non-operating year-over-year improvements for both the quarter and the full year were driven by favorable transactional currency exchange fluctuation.
Our adjusted effective tax rate in Q4 was 31.2%, up 50 basis points from the fourth quarter of last year due to acquisition and geographic mix. And for the full year, the adjusted effective tax rate was 31% EBIT, up 10 basis points from the prior year.
In terms of returning capital, we continue to pay our dividend and paid out $11.9 million in the quarter and $47.1 million for the year. Average diluted shares were up 0.2 million shares for both the fourth quarter and the full year at 37.3 million shares and 37.2 million shares, respectively. Both time periods represent less than 1% dilution from last year as a result of stock option grants.
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. $37.1 million of cash was generated from operations in the fourth quarter and $139.4 million was generated during the full year. Our investment in capital expenditures was $6.9 million for the quarter and $19.9 million for the year.
We ended the year with $110 million of cash and short-term available-for-sale investments, down $50 million sequentially from the end of Q3. The decrease was driven by incremental pay-down of our line of credit. As a result, our long-term debt obligations at the end of Q4 stood at $112 million, a decrease of $75 million from the end of Q3. That wraps up my comments on the total company performance for the fourth quarter and full year.
And now I'll discuss the performance of our three business segments, starting with the Biotechnology segment. Q4 net sales for the segment were $83.83 million, with reported growth of 9% compared to last year and organic growth of 7%. Growth from acquisitions was 7%, while the impact from foreign exchange was negative 5%.
By geography, North America increased in the high-single digits organically. Biopharma sales continued to be strong in the region, with growth nearing 10%, while academic and government experienced its best quarter in many years, with growth in the mid-single digits. Europe rebounded from Q3 and experienced organic growth in the mid-single digits, with most countries performing well and Germany less of a drag on the growth for the region. China experienced fantastic organic growth in the mid-30%s while Pacific Rim was flat year-over-year. As Chuck noted earlier, excluding Japan, the Pacific Rim grew approximately 10%. And for the full year, Biotechnology segment revenue was $325.9 million with organic growth at 3%.

Adjusted operating income for the Biotechnology segment increased 2% in Q4 compared to the prior year and adjusted operating margin was 52.4%, a decline of 340 basis points year-over-year. Foreign exchange currency translation impacted adjusted operating income negatively by 7% and operating margin by 120 basis points. The remaining decline in adjusted margin percentage is attributable to a change in product mix associated with the acquisition of Novus Biologicals. For all of fiscal year 2015, adjusted operating margin was 52.5%, also a decline of 340 basis point year-over-year, driven by the negative impact of FX and mix from acquisitions.
Turning now to our Clinical Controls segment, where Q4 sales were $17.2 million. Both reported and organic growth was 9% compared to last year. For all of fiscal year 2015, sales were $60.4 million and organic growth was 5%. Adjusted operating income for the segment increased 5% in Q4 and adjusted operating margin was 30.1%, a decrease of 120 basis points from the prior year. The decrease was attributable to pricing pressure in the blood glucose controls market. However, margins have since stabilized and were flat to Q3. For the full fiscal year 2015, adjusted operating margin was also 30.1%, a decrease of 60 basis points year-over-year.
Moving on to our Protein Platforms segment, where net sales in Q4 were $17.2 million. On a pro forma basis, assuming ProteinSimple and CyVek were owned for the entire quarter in both current and prior years, organic revenue for the segment decreased 2%. As Chuck mentioned earlier, the ProteinSimple business experienced a very tough comparable where they grew 48% last year in what was their final quarter of prior ownership. This tough comparable together with the integration of CyVek and commercial transition activities in Q4 contributed to a lack of growth. For the full year, on a pro forma basis, Protein Platforms grew 22% organically and we expect to see this kind of growth in fiscal year 2016 and beyond.
Adjusted operating margin in Q4 was essentially breakeven. As independent companies, ProteinSimple and CyVek together reported negative 6.2% adjusted operating margin in the quarter ended June 30, 2014. In all of fiscal year 2015 for the period of time since the acquisitions that formed this new segment, adjusted operating margin was 6.7%.
That concludes my prepared comments. And with that, I will turn the call back to the moderator to open the line up for some questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Our first question is going to come from Dan Leonard from Leerink. Please go ahead. Dan?
Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC
Apologies. I had you on mute. Can you hear me now?
Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah, we can year you, Dan.
James T. Hippel - CFO, VP-Finance & Principal Accounting Officer
Yeah.
Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC
Great. So my first question is on the Platforms business. Can you speak to the visibility you have on the 20% organic growth view and whether there's any sort of backlog to support that or new product funnel?
Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
There's a strong new product funnel. In fact ProteinSimple's organization has three different product lines, Simple Western, Biologics and some other analytics that go along with the imaging stuff. Biologics was the biggest issue for this bump in the road this quarter. Actually on a Simple Wes platform, we had a record quarter for installations, it was a record number. So the pipeline is strong. They've got deep programs in all the areas, including Biologics. So more products coming and announcements soon to be had.
Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC
Okay. And then my follow up. Is there anything we should be aware of as it relates to pacing throughout fiscal 2016, any days issues in any given quarter or anything you'd call out?

James T. Hippel - CFO, VP-Finance & Principal Accounting Officer
Yeah, Dan, nothing I'd call out specifically. There may be a day here or there quarter-to-quarter, but nothing that we haven't seen in our pacing from last year.
Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
And our next question is going to come from Matt Hewitt from Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.
Dillon K. Hoover - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC
Hey. Good morning, guys. This is actually Dillon on for Matt. Digging into the Biotech segment growth, just wondering or trying to get a better sense of the customer mix that's driving that growth. Is that just new product growth, getting deeper with existing customers, or are you guys taking business from peers?
Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, it's a combination of things. I mean, one is we've talked about announcing a new website. We've had strong traction with that. We've had a pretty good lift with our academia by the market this quarter. And the Fisher numbers were the strongest we've ever had as well. Biotech pharma was also kind of on par where it's been, right at around 10%, around there, which is also very good. All things considered, that's what's been adding up to the (19:39) growth in the Biotech side, a record for us while I've been here anyway, probably been many years.
James T. Hippel - CFO, VP-Finance & Principal Accounting Officer
Yeah, I would just add it's too early to claim victory in terms of taking share from anywhere. What we've seen from reported results from other companies in our space, biopharma and academic has performed fairly well this quarter as well. So I think we're definitely keeping up with the market, but I think it's too early to say we're at the point of taking share.
Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
I think the thing to point out is we were much stronger than we have been in the past in antibodies. So that's our biggest, deepest, our broader investment area for the company. I mean, we're on the fence with Proteins, and that's going fine. It's about antibodies and we've make some pretty good strides there.
Dillon K. Hoover - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC
Okay. And then a quick follow up. Just in terms of the capital deployment strategy in 2016 in the form M&A, are we going to expect any changes in the form of pace or size of deals?
Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, in terms of capital, we were kind of consistent with the capital the way we've been in the past and for operations. On the M&A side, we did officially one deal we bought in last, (20:42) most of these we did the first month into the fiscal year this last year. And we're on the way to integrating most of them. Novus is completely integrated at this plant.
Looking forward, we've never worked any less hard than we are now. We're trying, like everyone does. We've got a strong funnel 60-some-plus targets that we've had. (20:58) They range in size from start-up to large transformational deals. We're on the hunt all the time for things that hit our strategy, but we think strategically first.
That said, especially on the front where there's auctions, it's not a great for finding great deals. It's a good time for owners thinking that they should think about selling because everybody knows the market is pretty hot. So that's helpful, but you've still got to get a good price and it's hard on both the private and public side, so we're diligent. We're working the process. We have a deep and very rigorous process, but we won't do a dumb deal, we walked away from lot in this last year because the numbers weren't good enough for us. But strategy first, numbers second. And we'll keep hunting.

Dillon K. Hoover - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC
Great. Thanks. And congrats on good quarter.
Operator
And our next question is going to come from Jeff Elliott from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Yeah, good morning. Nice quarter, guys. Chuck, can you provide any other color on the issues you had in the Protein Platforms division?
Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah, we've been digging into it pretty hard, as you might imagine. We had a lot of integration typical type concerns. We had some market conditions as well. We had, as you already know and others know, we had some bumps in some running buffers from some ancillary products that go with instruments. We have those corrected this last quarter, but that probably flowed through a little bit. Everything is caught up there, the backlog is caught up
As I mentioned, it was a record quarter for shipping Wes systems (22:32). Biologics is little bit lumpy. And on the Biologics side, we have some larger platforms there, hundreds of thousands of dollars. And that's where we've had some issues. I mean, you miss a couple of those and you're off a quite a bit. So could be timing in some of those orders, but they didn't hit.
I think also I've got to point out the FX in Europe. This has affected us in demand and our numbers in Europe quite a bit. And we see all that returning. Things are looking much better. We did have some commercial team attrition, fully expected. We knew that a lot of that team would move on with Tim and Terry when they transitioned out of the business, and they did. I will mention we brought in an individual from my past at Thermo Fisher that ran the entire mass spec business for us, (23:21) very strong person. He's on board and like a kid in a candy shop putting in processes for the saves (23:32) this company is in right now in a growth level.
It's coming together. I'm very confident that we've got things under control here. It's lumpy. And it is an instrument business, it's going to be lumpier. I think our full plan was low-double digits, because coming off the record fourth quarter last year and they sold everything they could before they sold to us, and that's natural. And so we'll see.
Now, if we have another quarter or two of flat going forward, then things are going to change. But we don't have any hair on fire alarms here yet. So it's kind of I think just the usual. And things are looking pretty good there this quarter and I think it's just a natural transition with this type of business model we think.
Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Got it. And it sounds like you don't want to give fiscal 2016 guidance, but would you be able to comment on the estimates that you see out there, the stuff in consensus?
Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah, we think you guys are closer on the revenue side and still some work to do I think on the bottom line with our investments in SG&A. So I think you're close or catching up. It looks good, we'll give the feedback we can.
We still are not giving guidance. We put out our notes for the future and our goals. I will say that we've been very public with everybody about, as we annualize these deals and looking forward, we should be in 8% to 12% kind of growth range going forward. And it could vary a lot depending on the lumpiness of our instrument platform, but that should be kind of the range.
Saying whether we can continue in the 7% range, we're not saying that in our organic core. We've said victory for us is mid-single digits and that's what we're sticking with right now. If we do better in antibodies, if we start taking more share, things could be better. It's just like Jim said, it's not time to claim any victory lap yet, that's for sure. But we are really happy with the quarter. It's obviously a lot better than last quarter. For the year we're right on track with where we told everybody we'd be at and at mid-single digit level in our core.

And so we're excited, we're happy. We don't have really any homework to do in the core side, everything is looking good. Even as of last we talked about the assays and ELISA being kind of a drag, this year, they've done a lot better. I think a lot of it's market as well. Everybody is looking pretty good this quarter. So, again, no victory lap. We're just happy to be in upper end of path.
James T. Hippel - CFO, VP-Finance & Principal Accounting Officer
I'd add a modeling aspect of it is, two things just to make sure and also being mindful of; one is of course the FX impact and making sure we're taking in account the bottom line impact is a very, very high dropthrough for us on that FX impact. And that's going to definitely be with us at least for the first six months of fiscal year 2016. And where rates go from there, we'll see. But that's one item.
The other item I'd mentioned is the fact that we had one month in fiscal year 2015 that we did not own ProteinSimple. And in that one month, given how that instruments business works, it's very, very light on revenue, but still has the cost burden of its SG&A and R&D run rate. And so that one month worth of cost was not in our fiscal year 2015 numbers, but will be in our fiscal year 2016.
And the same goes for CyVek, where we purchased CyVek outright in November of fiscal year 2015. So there's a good four months of their SG&A, R&D costs in our first four month run rate that's not in fiscal year 2015 that will be 2016. I just would ask you to be mindful of those two items.
Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. Good catch, Jim.
Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Good. Thanks, guys.
Operator
And our next question is going to come from Drew Jones from Stephens. Please go ahead.
Garrett Ryan Phelps - Stephens, Inc.
Hi, guys. This is actually Garrett on for Drew. But first question. You talked about placement strength with Simple Wes in the quarter. Was any of that seen on the academic market? Did you kind of...
Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
I'm sorry, Garrett, you're breaking up. We can't understand the question.
Garrett Ryan Phelps - Stephens, Inc.
Hear me better now?
Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes, that's better.
Garrett Ryan Phelps - Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Hi, guys. This is Garrett on for Drew. You talked about the Simple Wes placement strength in the quarter. Did you see any of that coming from the academic market as you kind of talked about addressing that market with ProteinSimple in the past?
Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
It's been even mix. So one of the major factors of us even making the acquisition, if you might recall, with ProteinSimple was that the desktop platform, the Wes, would find a significant following with academia because we were concerned academia wouldn't make the switch, and they did. Half their sales have been roughly with academia and I do believe that is continuing about the same trend.
Garrett Ryan Phelps - Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Great. And then also just on China, given the strength we've seen in the quarter, is this something where you think that strength will continue given more released funding or is this kind of a flood coming through of the funding that you saw in the quarter?
Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
We were pretty bullish all last year, even when others were flat to low-single digits, we still on strong double-digit growth. And we're largely a run rate business there. And not having instruments ship, (28:51) that's probably part of it. But we're still very much in an expansion mode. And while we're near 100 people, we're still in the front end of our opportunities in China. So as we open and grow in Beijing and other cities, I think we're going to find more growth as these institutions keep driving for healthcare.

I think the audit activities are probably progressing and travelling from this space to the next space they want to look at in terms of markets. And I think we're moving through that. I think the next riff of course is their market in general, with everything crashing over there and the government stepping in. I think there's a lot of unknowns for all of us if any of that's going to trickle down into the way purchasing happens within these programs they're funding.
Right now we believe and we hear that all funding in these areas is still there, still strong, as it was through the audit (29:43) operations this year, it's just people waiting for the process from the government how to actually spend the money. They're putting in place templates and processes actually how to account for their funding, which they didn't have a lot of controls before. So, now they do. So, I think if all those controls get put in place, we'll probably see maybe hope for some of that pent-up funding we could see come forward. For us to say we're going to do better than 25% growth, probably not. We're going to stick with we hope to be in that range for the foreseeable future, which we think is pretty darned good growth rate. We're just really ecstatic that we had a quarter at 35%.
And I could just tell you that the team is really a great team, really jazzed. We had zero attrition in over a year in our China team. I mean, kind of unheard of. So that's how happy they are. We're getting them a new site again. They've outgrown the other one. They were only in it for like two years. We're merging that team with the ProteinSimple team, which is also growing and building over there. So we have a full-fledged company there with demo capabilities and everything else. So that's all coming in the coming year.
So they're happy, they're excited, they're young. But it's a nascent market and industry, as we all know. And we're trying to ride that wave as best we can.
Garrett Ryan Phelps - Stephens, Inc.
All right. Thanks, guys.

And our next question is going to come from (31:08). Please go ahead. He disappeared. One moment. And our next question is going to come from Karen Padgett from Bio-Techne. Please go ahead.
Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Hello, Karen. Might be a mistake. She's probably listening in but...
Operator
And our next question is going to come from John Souter from Rail-Splitter. Please go ahead. Your line is live. Mr. Souter, did you have a question? Our next question is going to come from Paul Knight from Janney Montgomery. Please go ahead.
Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Hi, Chuck. I think everybody's confused on the star 1 or 1 star. We figured it out now.
Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
We know you know how to do this, Paul.
Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
How big is China do you think? Can you say?
Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
How big. What do you mean?
Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
$30 million revenue, is it $35 million?
Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
I think all-in this year we're in the $35 million-ish range, with ProteinSimple and everything in. We're mid to high $20 million in the core reagent side of the business.
Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
And on ProteinSimple, what are people saying? What would be their complaint or what do you see is the issue? Is it not enough people on the ground, is it applications?
Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
I think it's just, as I said, it was a bit of perfect storm. We had a plan in the low-double digit growth because it was a 48% growth comp from last year. We had a backlog issue to clear out from the quarter before on some of the, it's called running buffers, they're reagents that work with the system. That's all been corrected. Remember, that whole company, whole business moved to a new building in the past year. And there were a lot of new building start-up issues which were all – we're through all that.

The FX piece is a strong component. When you're in the instrument business, these are big ticket items. There's a lot of currency issues in Europe around that, so that was a hit for the quarter. That, too, has come around.
And we have had some commercial turnover. Terry had the commercial of the company before moving on six months to nine months ago. We've had to transition through that. We've gone with an incumbent, actually the person that trained in Terry years ago as Head of Commercial for the company now. She has 20-some years experience. She's wonderful we think and knows all the people. And we're filling in around that.
And then on the other operations side, with one of my people from my past at Thermo Fisher, in operations I think we're on track. For us, always was, always probably will be and was the plan going forward, our deepest concern was the R&D team. The development team, with this young company with this strong pipeline of technology and new products and that we preserve that and we preserve all of that. We've had zero attrition there on the R&D front, with Bob Gavin the head of that and running that business for us as the SVP of the division. And that's all gone very well. He's been in the role here for nine months or so. Very pleased with that.
So it's just a lot of little things. Going forward, we do still think this is a 20% kind of grower. I do believe that it is probably more feet in the street is probably important. I think regionally for sure we've got some coverage issues to deal with. It is a very, very exciting platform, as I mentioned. With all these issues, we had a record quarter in our Simple Western in our Wes platform. So we're shipping a lot of systems now in the quarter and it's starting to scale.
So the rest of the pipeline, it needs to get out. It's the bigger platforms we need to do a little better on and I think it's coming. So we'll watch it this quarter and have more input I guess.
James T. Hippel - CFO, VP-Finance & Principal Accounting Officer
Hi, Paul. This is Jim. Just to clarify in case you're looking at this from a modeling perspective for China. A very good guess by Chuck on the $35 million. I actually have the exact numbers here in front of me. What we call our China region finished the year around $33 million. But that also includes that Taiwan and Hong Kong and it also includes products that are made in China that ultimately get exported out of China from PrimeGene. So from a modeling perspective, if you're thinking about Mainland China where the high organic growth is coming from, it's probably more in the mid to high $20 million.
Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Okay, got it. And then lastly, Europe was a problem in the first quarter. I guess that's over now?
Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
In the fourth quarter, last quarter, you mean?
Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Sorry, in the March quarter.
Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
It was certainly a problem. It's less a problem this quarter. Is it over? Is Europe ever over? We're comfortable saying that we think we've seen the coming back of lot of projects with our Biotech pharma, our largest customer base in the German region. So I can say right now on that, we like what we see. The numbers are improving. It was still a low-negative single-digit drag, but that's a lot better than double-digits like last quarter.
Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Did the quarter's orders finish stronger, or was it even throughout the period?
Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
They finished strong at the end of the quarter. It's definitely been a trend.
Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC

Okay.
Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Another quarter or two and we hope to have Germany something like last year. Remember, last year was double-digit growth and so it is a little bit cyclical there.
Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Lastly, what do you think market growth is for your core Protein ELISA business, antibody business?
Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah, I think as a composite in the market is probably 5% to 6%. I think the best one, of course, are antibodies. We did all the primary research, like you guys do, it's high-single digits. And Proteins we think are 2% to 3% as a market, being the smallest market of the bunch. We've been in the mid-single digits. We definitely think we've been taking some share back the last couple years from these ankle biters that have been chasing us.
Our brand new strategies I think are working. We think the website has been phenomenal. Our traffic and our orders are up 8% in only in the first month of this new website. And I think I'd tell you that the website previously was about flat the two years I've been here. So we had immediate response on the new website.
And, again, that's coming off a lot of the infrastructure, the process system, tools and experience the Novus team brought with them, who already run this whole thing for us now. And it's been really wonderful, on time, on target, on budget. And I hope the growth in the traffic keeps going.
Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Great. Thank you.

Our next question is going to come from Amanda Murphy from William Blair. Please go ahead.
Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning. So just a couple on the competitive dynamics. So I appreciate all the commentary around the antibody business and it sounds like Fisher is doing pretty well for you. But have you seen any change – it sounds like you're gaining share, but any change in terms of pricing from any of the competitors?
And then I guess you mentioned some pricing pressure in the blood glucose segment, so maybe just talk a little bit about that as well.
Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
I'll go in reverse. The glucose is kind of old history, it's old news. That really happened almost a full year ago and we kind of worked through it.
Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC
Okay.
Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Jim's comment was really quarter-on-quarter the same. So we're through that. It's almost a last man standing kind of strategy here. So we don't think there's a lot more downside, one of the reasons we bought the business. And for us, it's all about building out that funnel to ever-increasing content. It's a bit of a super specialized high-content packaging organization with high volume processes, so we love it for that.
And the other side, antibodies, I would say no overall pricing differences there. We're still building who we are in antibodies. We're not at the same level of clout that we are in Proteins, of course. We are probably officially the largest supplier in the world right now, but that's not to say that we're maybe selling the most. We have processes and a website and everything including a wonderfully trained Fisher channel to now move things along and I think it's working.
We had the best quarter so far with Fisher. They just keep getting better, so we'll keep feeding that beast and hopefully it keeps working well. They're very committed to us. They're very good with our teams. We've had absolutely no channel conflict. It's been marvelous to watch how we all work together on that. They really like having us on board as a partner and as (40:27). Content rules in this space. It helps to pull through all the other million products they do, so it's a good thing for all of us.

Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC
So net-net, the market share gains were driven by Fisher and then the website. Is that fair?
Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
I would say less the website. It's been a month.
Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC
Yeah.
Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Giving some good initial data, but it isn't material yet probably. Fisher definitely helped on the academic side in the quarter, no doubt about it.
Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC
Got it. Okay. And then just last one on the ProteinSimple side. I don't think you guys talked specifically about the whole revenue synergy opportunity and what that added, if anything, in the quarter.
Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
For like the antibody catalogue?
Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC
Exactly, yeah.
Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
It's growing. It's still not material enough to say. Again, no victory lap here either. We are over 800 antibodies now. We're on track for over 1,000 end of the year annual here. And we like what we see. I think this is the kind of thing that takes some time. You're trying to woo academics mainly online into taking – going after your certification process. We're getting traction and it's going the right direction. I think it's the right strategy and for us it's probably all incremental growth. So that's important.
Amanda, the other revenue synergy that's much harder to measure is how much of additional instruments we're selling because there's an antibody solution geared for it. And it doesn't really show up in the numbers either, so it is hard to measure. But we believe that the combined offering helps both sides of the business, no doubt.
Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC
Got it. Thank you.

And with that, I will turn the call over to Chuck.
Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter conference call. This morning, we reported revenue growth of 15% for the third quarter with the majority of our end markets remaining strong organically, plus a solid contribution from our recent acquisition.
I'm extremely pleased with the achievement of 8% organic growth corporate-wide, with our core Biotech business growing 6% organically. In fact, this is Bio-Techne's strongest quarter since I joined the company three years ago, providing evidence that the strategy to reaccelerate Bio-Techne's top line by growing our core business and expanding to adjacent markets continues to gain traction.
Protein Platforms increased over 25% organically in the quarter with our commercial reorganization and focused strategy beginning to yield results. I'm also very pleased with our team's operational performance in the quarter with both growth and operating margins exceeding our internal plan, driving operating margins once again above 40%, and contributing to a 14% year-over-year increase in our adjusted net income.
In our Biotechnology business, overall, we experienced broad-based growth across the portfolio with proteins, antibodies and assays all contributing to solid performance. I would like to highlight the performance of our antibody portfolio in the quarter, which grew high single-digits overall, including a 20% increase in our Novus Biologicals brand.
In the U.S., our biopharma end markets remain strong with revenue increasing mid-teens for the quarter. Our biopharma customers continue to partner with Bio-Techne for the outsourcing of complex molecules with our reputation for ultra-pure, highly bio-reactive reagents driving additional business within our existing biopharma client base and creating opportunities with new customers.

Our academia and government end market grew in the low single-digits, similar to the trend we've experienced in recent quarters. We've been experiencing growth in this end market since the major update of our website last summer. We will continue to invest in the ongoing evolution of our website by making navigation improvements, and adding content and active links to thousands of products that resonate with our academia customers.
Since the release of our updated website, internal Internet traffic has continued to increase, and encouragingly, the visitors to our site are spending more time on the site, increasing the probability of ordering. We are also investing in search engine optimization to drive traffic to our website. These investments are starting to pay off with our Novus Biologicals brand, which was the first of our brands to use the enhanced website.
Seeing an upper-single-digit increase in website visits and a mid-teen increase in web-generated revenue, overall, we are making tremendous progress with our website redesign and view this as a key for long-term growth within our academic customer base.
Moving on to other regions, Europe organic growth was flat overall in Q3. However, underlying trends within our European Biotech business remain healthy. Adjusting for the timing of the Easter holiday, which occurred in Q3 this year versus Q4 last year, as well as the timing of some large biopharma orders, normalized growth rates would have been a mid-single digit increase. Thus, as these timing issues reverse in Q4, we expect to end fiscal year 2016 with a solid mid-single-digit organic growth rate for the year.
China remains a very strong geography for Bio-Techne with organic revenue increasing in the mid-20%s year over year. We are particularly impressed with the sustained growth in China, especially considering the 30% increase we experienced in this geography last quarter. Our new GMP factory for PrimeGene is complete and fully functional, giving Bio-Techne the competitive edge in our China for China strategy and supporting our expectations for continued strong double-digit growth in this geography. We anticipate the growing Chinese middle class will be driving ongoing demand for improved access to healthcare, driving additional investments in life science research and benefiting our rapidly growing business in this geography.
Overall, we are very pleased with the strong performance within our core Biotech product portfolio with Q3 representing the fourth consecutive quarter of at least mid-single digit organic growth in the segment. Getting our core back to consistent mid-single digit growth has been the most challenging and complex part of our five-year strategic plan, and I'm proud of our team's effort to get us there and have confidence in their ability to maintain this momentum.
Moving on to our Clinical Controls division, we experienced a strong performance from our acquired business, Cliniqa, although the timing of OEM delivery dates impacted organic growth in the quarter. As a reminder, our Bionostics and Cliniqa businesses both include chemistry-based reagent product lines with longer shelf lives, allowing OEM customers to buy in bulk, introducing the potential for quarter-to-quarter volatility.
Our legacy hematology controls business remains stable, growing mid-single-digits. Given the relatively shorter shelf life of our hematology control products, we view growth of these products as an indicator of stable underlying demand within our Clinical Controls end market. Cliniqa, a controls and reagent supplier for diagnostic market that we acquired last July, continues to outperform our expectations. Importantly, the addition of Cliniqa to the Bio-Techne Clinical Controls division continues to open up additional pipeline opportunities for the business, making Bio-Techne an even more important supplier to the biopharma and diagnostics industries.

Cliniqa under the Bio-Techne umbrella, we are now focused on filling and expanding the growing pipeline of opportunities for our Clinical Controls division. I would like to point out that the growth of our organic business combined with Cliniqa has created a business with critical mass and annualized revenue run rate approaching $100 million.
Lastly, the work we have done over the last couple of quarters to improve our Protein Platforms sales force and commercialization strategy is beginning to bear fruit of organic growth above 25% for the quarter. I want to update everyone on some of the positive developments within our Protein Platforms segment that give us confidence in our ability to maintain double-digit growth in this business exiting fiscal 2016 and beyond.
Our strength in Simple Western sales force has been in place for two quarters now, and given the six-month to nine-month instrumentation selling cycle, I believe we are in the early innings of realizing the efforts of our strengthened commercial team. Additionally, we continue to augment the Simple Western sales force with the entire R&D Systems commercial team to generate leads, cross-sell and demo this game-changing western blot technology. This game-changing technology continues to resonate with the scientific community, and we anticipate significant western blot share capture by automating a time-consuming, manual and poorly reproducible process that has been in place for over 35 years.
We remain very pleased with the performance of Simple Plex product line within the Protein Platforms segment this quarter. As a reminder, this is the rebranded CyVek startup business we acquired a year ago in November, consisting of the Ella line of multiplex ELISA instruments and associated assay cartridges.
We continue to see growing interest from our customers for the workflow enhancements that Simple Plex testing platform delivers. We remain in the very early stages of Ella instrument adoption and the associated revenue ramp, and anticipate Simple Plex to become a significant revenue contributor in future quarters.
During the quarter, we strengthened our Protein Platforms offering with the launch of Maurice, an advanced imaging capillary electrophoresis, or iCE, instrument. All pharmaceutical customers utilize iCE instruments for the quantitative analysis of identity, purity and heterogeneity.
Maurice improves our legacy iCE platforms by delivering higher sensitivity, easier workflow and shorter run times compared to legacy technologies, allowing researchers to shorten drug development timelines. We are very pleased of the early traction Maurice is gaining with biopharmaceutical customers with the initial launch exceeding our expectations. We anticipate Maurice to be a solid addition to the growing lineup of Protein Platforms instruments.
We further strengthened our Protein Platforms segment through the acquisition of Zephyrus Biosciences, adding a single-cell western blot instrument we named Milo to our growing portfolio of instruments. Zephyrus is currently a pre-revenue business, although we plan to commercialize Milo in July of 2016. We view Zephyrus's single-cell western blot technology as a natural fit with our ProteinSimple business and are excited to leverage our Protein Platforms sales force to bring another innovative instrument to market.
To summarize, we are very pleased with the Protein Platforms' overall performance in Q3 and believe we remain on track for continued momentum in this business in coming quarters. Based on the sales pipeline and positive momentum in both lead generation and quote activity, we believe Q1 was the start of a new long-term trend of double-digit growth for the Protein Platforms segment.
I also want to provide a quick update on our M&A pipeline. Following the Zephyrus acquisition, our pipeline of potential M&A targets remained stronger than ever with our strong balance sheet and cash flow providing Bio-Techne flexibility in our disciplined M&A approach. We plan to continue to augment our organic business with acquisitions that strengthen our position in existing businesses and geographies, or leverage our reagent expertise in adjacent markets.

With that, I'll pass the call over to Jim for a more detailed review of the financials before we open the line up for Q&A. Jim?
James T. Hippel - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Thank you, Chuck. As in our prior earnings call, I will provide an overview of our Q3 financial performance for the total company and then provide some color on each of our three segments.
Starting with the overall third quarter financial performance, adjusted earnings increased 14% year-over-year to $37.6 million, while adjusted EPS was $1.01 a share versus $0.88 in the prior year. The impact of currency translation represented a headwind to EPS of approximately $0.02. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.81 compared to $0.65 in the prior year.
Q3 reported revenue was $131 million, an increase of 15% year-over-year, with organic revenue increasing 8%. Third quarter reported sales included 7% growth contribution from acquisitions, partially offset by a 1% unfavorable foreign exchange headwind. Please note that the components of Q3 growth do not sum due to rounding.
Moving on to the details of the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin was 71.6% in Q3, decreasing 80 basis points from the prior year. Strong volume leverage and productivity gains in our Protein Platforms and Biotech divisions were more than offset by the lower margin Cliniqa acquisition and unfavorable FX impact. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and FX, core gross margins improved 50 basis points year-over-year in the third quarter.
Adjusted SG&A in Q3 was 20.7% of revenue, 30 basis points higher than last year. The SG&A increase was driven primarily by investments made to improve our website capabilities and commercial execution, as well as the additional SG&A from the acquisitions made since the beginning of the third quarter of last year.
R&D expense in Q3 was 8.6% of revenue, 90 basis points lower than last year, reflecting the volume leverage achieved from Protein Platforms. The resulting adjusted operating margin for Q3 was 42.4%, relatively flat to prior year and a sequential improvement of 300 basis points from Q2.
Looking at our numbers below operating income, net interest expense in Q3 was $0.4 million compared to $0.3 million of net interest expense last year due to higher draws on our line of credit, which partially funded our Cliniqa acquisition last July.
Other non-operating expense for the quarter was $0.7 million compared to $0.4 million of non-operating expense in the prior year quarter with unfavorable transactional FX explaining the year-over-year variance.
Our adjusted effective tax rate in Q3 was 31%, down 50 basis points from the third quarter of last year due to recognition of R&D tax credits. In terms of returning capital, we continue to pay our dividend and paid out $11.9 million in the quarter. Average diluted shares were relatively flat over the year ago at 37.3 million shares outstanding.
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, $37.1 million of cash was generated from operations in the third quarter, a 20% increase from the prior year, and our investment in capital expenditures was $2.8 million.
We ended the quarter with $84.6 million of cash and short-term available for sale investments. Our long-term debt obligations at the end of Q3 stood at $157.8 million, a decrease of $5.5 million from end of Q2.
Going forward, our capital deployment priorities remain opportunistic M&A, our dividend and debt pay down.
Now, I'll discuss the performance of our three business segments, starting with the Biotechnology segment. Q3 reported sales were $81.4 million, with organic growth of 6%. Foreign exchange negatively impacted reported sales growth by approximately 2%.
By geography, the U.S. grew approximately 10% organically with mid-teens biopharma sales growth and low single-digit academic results. Europe was flat organically with biopharma sales in this region increasing low single-digits, offsetting a low single-digit decline in academia.

As Chuck mentioned in his comments, the timing of the Easter holiday impacted our European results, representing an unfavorable 3% impact to our growth in this geography. However, this timing impact should reverse in Q4.
China experienced strong organic growth in the mid-20s%, while Pacific Rim declined upper single-digits year-over-year. Excluding Japan, however, the Pacific Rim grew in the low teens. Japan remains challenged by government funding reductions and delays.
Adjusted operating income for the Biotech segment increased 1% in Q3 compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 55.5%, a decrease of 130 basis points year-over-year due to the timing of certain commercial investments, partially offset by the impact of productivity initiatives and volume leverage.
Turning now to Clinical Controls, segment sales in Q3 were $29.9 million, with reported growth of 50% over last year. The acquisition of Cliniqa contributed 51% to growth, while organic revenue decreased 1%.
As with prior quarters, the timing of OEM shipment orders introduces variability to Clinical Controls segment, with customer ordering patterns weighing on our Q3 segment results.
Given the quarterly variability introduced by the OEM ordering patterns from our chemistry-based controls and now Cliniqa, we believe a trailing 12-month organic rate is more indicative of our Clinical Controls segment performance.
On a pro forma basis, assuming Cliniqa was included in our results last year, as well as this year, the trailing 12-month organic growth rate for the segment is 8%. Clinical Controls' adjusted operating income increased 53% in Q3; and adjusted operating margin was 31.6%, an increase of 70 basis points from the prior year. The higher adjusted operating income and margin was primarily attributable to strong volume leverage associated with the Cliniqa acquisition.
Moving on to our Protein Platforms segment, net sales in Q3 were $19.7 million, an organic increase of 26% from the prior year period. Unfavorable currency translation impacted revenues by less than 1%. Growth in the segment was broad-based with most major regions and product lines growing by solid double-digits.
Quarter ended March 2016 was the first March end quarter to grow sequentially from the previous December end quarter in the history of ProteinSimple, including the years predating the acquisition of Bio-Techne. We believe this provides further evidence that our new commercial strategy is taking hold, and the reacceleration of Protein Platforms have begun. Revenue from Simple Plex also continues to ramp, and we remain pleased with the revenue trajectory of this business.
As Chuck discussed, we acquired Zephyrus Biosciences in Q3, and anticipate to commercialize the associated single-cell western blot analysis instrument, Milo, during the first quarter of our fiscal 2017.
Adjusted operating income in Q3 for the Protein Platforms segment was $1.6 million, representing an operating margin of 8.1% compared to a $1.7 million adjusted operating loss one year ago, with strong volume leverage and productivity driving the year-over-year improvement. We continue to expect additional improvement in Protein Platforms' profitability as top-line growth and productivity gains drive operating leverage in coming quarters.
So in summary, Q3 was a record quarter for Bio-Techne on an adjusted bottom-line result, accomplished by solid commercial and operational execution in all of our businesses. We expect to finish the year strong as well, with Q4 looking very similar to Q3 from a top-line perspective. However, we expect the mix to change somewhat with the Biotechnology segment, in particular, facing a rather tough comp from prior year when they grew 7% organically. Thus, the margin profile in Q4 may not be as strong as Q3 due to a change in mix.

That concludes my prepared comments and with that, I will turn the call back over to Melanie to open the lines for some questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. We'll go first to Dan Leonard with Leerink Partners.
Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC
Thank you. So I just want to delve into the Protein Platforms performance a bit more. Can you talk more about the components of the growth there? I know you said it was broad-based, so maybe offer some color about how much of the strength was Maurice versus Simple Western, and any color on the consumable trends as opposed to the instrument revenue trends, would be helpful.
Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah, well, Maurice has a strong take-up here as the beginning platform, but it's still not material to the overall performance. Performance of the division really is still around Simple Western. We worked hard to get the commercial team really back into place and up to speed, and focusing on lead generations and productivity and cross selling with our R&D Systems commercial force, and that's all bearing fruit. We really thought – we're near the 60 kind of number of instruments per quarter, and that's up from the 40s or so a year ago. So, it's pretty good growth there overall.
The Simple Plex is also ramping and is close to plan. Still a small business, but not a startup anymore. It's starting to bear fruit. The revenue component in Simple Plex will be stronger in consumables, the assays being a strong component because it's a closed system. We remain at about a 25% consumable rate on the rest of the biologics platform.
So, really, growth is really kind of across all the platforms, with the biggest component being Simple Western. Biologics has always been a strong platform, and even the existing product platforms are still selling well and Maurice is a new category, so almost the same size in general as Simple Western, but the acceleration of Simple Western outpaces biologics, of course. We could have a surprise going forward. Maurice is exceeding our expectations, but we are still banking on the fact that Simple Western will outdo it. It's a much larger market opportunity.
Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC
Got it. That's all helpful. And then my follow-up question, can you give us an update on how you're looking at Japan?
Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, the same way everybody else is, with a lot of prayers. So, they're – we've been hearing that they're aimed at new consortium of funding pharma. The government is starting to release funds. We're starting to see early, I guess, data from that. It's as much an issue of easy comps as anything, probably, but it's still early.
I just – we don't – we're not banking on any strong, fast recovery in Japan, to be honest, and I don't think anyone else is talking about it either. I don't think we're worse off than anybody else, it's just a matter of waiting on funding. We're still growing. Actually, our team just came back from Protein Platforms division and they had a positive report on some uptake in Japan. But in general, it's kind of steady as she goes and just not enough happening, waiting on funding.
Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC
Got it. Thanks, Chuck.

We'll go next to Jeff Elliott with Robert Baird.
Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Thanks for the question. Jim, can you just verify, did you have any change in selling days in the quarter? I get the Easter impact, but were you kind of same year-over-year in terms of the number of days in the quarter.
James T. Hippel - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. We didn't have any drastic change due to any kind of 4-4-5 calendar because we operate on a normalized typical calendar. However, admittedly, there was an extra day with leap year. So leap year was the extra day in February, did provide an extra day of revenue there. It may have had a 1% or so lift. It's hard to say exactly.

Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay. So pretty minor, though. And just, moving over to – I guess, sticking with Jim, I guess, looking at the segment margins, given the moving pieces with Cliniqa and some of the, I guess, deals, I guess, can you just help us think about the segment margins maybe in the next couple of quarters? How should we think about modeling those?
James T. Hippel - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. From a segment margin perspective, I would say that with regards to our Biotech and Clinical Controls divisions, fairly steady margins from what we've seen. It's more around Protein Platforms that we can continue to see some expansion there with the margin pull-through – with the net revenue pull-through.
So like we saw from not only year-over-year, but quarter-over-quarter perspective with Protein Platforms, we saw some nice – very nice margin expansion there with the additional revenue. And as they continue to recover on the top line, we should see some continued leverage on their cost base.
So I'd say steady – Chuck put it as steady as she goes in two of our three segments with some increasing margin pull-through in Protein Platforms. But also, keep in mind, the overall mix, with that reacceleration of Protein Platforms' revenue, the overall mix will be a bit of a headwind due to the low margin overall of PPD versus our Biotech division.
Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay.
Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
When you start doing the math, when you start doing your math on CCD, you're going to see the strong component tradition here from Cliniqa. We had a huge quarter for them. It didn't count organically, but it's there in the numbers and it's big. It is a lumpier business and we're going to go to a TTM kind of number. It won't sustain at that run rate this quarter. It's going to be up and down just to realize that. That would be – you're going to – $29.9 million is not a typical quarter for this segment.
Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Got it. Okay. Thanks, guys. That's helpful. Nice quarter.
Operator
And we'll go next to Amanda Murphy with William Blair.
Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning. Just a couple of quick ones. So, first, I don't think you mentioned the Fisher distribution agreement specifically, I guess how that's gone this quarter. I know it's kind of been a little bit back and forth in terms of how much contribution it's had, so wondering if it was helpful and how you're thinking about it long term.
Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, we're still low single-digits in academia, which is still way better than it used to be. I think it's kind of steady as she goes there. I would say the Fisher performance as a component of that was marginally better than last quarter; still not as good as it was in the first early quarters in our relationship.
Now, we are starting to hit some size issues here. It's becoming a larger and larger percentage share of our channel in the academia sector. I think if you compare it to their results overall, and we study their results and we talk to them, I'd say we came in under where they were at in their own performance. So, we're working through that.
All-in-all, though, better than last quarter, so we're optimistic. And it is still a crucial element to our channel strategy and helping us keep our costs down in our commercial organization, and the attitude is good, cross-selling is good, teams get along.
So, we're hanging in there with that. And it would be nice to see them break it out and do at least as well as they talk about their entire segment as a company at Thermo, but we have not yet achieved that.

Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC
Is there any specific driver of that slowdown or is it just a function of kind of being early in the relationship and working through, and as you said, just similar size?
Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
No, it's not only that. I think we had some great preliminary results for five quarters, six quarters in a row, really. And I think what changed was a couple – the dynamics within their own company as they integrated life tech.
One, you've added a lot of the portfolio. They've got a much bigger bag to sell, and it opened up opportunities internally, I think, for a lot of their rock star salespeople and their technical people. So, they've had more internal turnovers.
So, people are jumping from the Fisher side to the Thermo Fisher division. And so we're having to train and retrain and get a more – more of a rhythm going with their sales force. I think as a bigger issue, it's how much is in the bag and staying current with their technical workforce. Our portfolio is – it doesn't sell itself. It's very complicated technical reagents, and we trained their entire technical sales force from the beginning and we've got to keep the pace with that. And I think that's probably why it's been a little bit different the last couple of quarters, but it's coming back. We've identified the issues there, and they are very supportive and we're working on that, so...
Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC
Got it.
Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
It is a big company and it's firing in all cylinders, as you saw their report, so they've got lots of opportunities for people and people are moving around.
Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC
Makes sense. And then just one, I guess, broader question. I think in the past, you've said that based on your current book of business, that you could see a revenue run rate closer to $750 million if you include potential synergies that you might be able to drive. And so, I guess, my question is, is that still the case? And then secondly, you talked about the pipeline that you have being fairly strong. And when you first came on board, you outlined a plan of inorganic and organic growth. So, given what you have in the pipeline, do you still see that, those targets as being achievable?
Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. So, our strat plan is trying to get to $1 billion in five years. I think we're still within the range of that possibility. It wasn't – it's always been more of an ideal. It's not a forecast or anything, of course.
I think we backed off to $750 million number a little over a year ago when FX kind of went crazy on us here, Europe especially, really talking more of a steady state around $650 million or so if we did no other deals, and then getting up into the low 40%s, the margin area. I think we are on track for that. There's no issue, but we are going to do deals.
Our pipeline remains very strong. We've been in some actions we haven't – one as of late, we spent a lot of time on the Affymetrix deal. We really wanted that. Clearly, we were outbid by a heavyweight that wanted it badly and had a lot more synergies than we could offer. But we're always working on many at the same time and we currently are as well. They are probably leaning a little more toward the private side, and we'll try to do a few things without attracting the big guys, but there's a lot of opportunities.
We have strong cash flow. We've got a great team. We've got – we're working together on some deals where the teams do get along, so it's just about making the numbers work and making investors happy and all that stuff. But our pipeline remains on the order of 100 different targets from small to large, so...

Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC
Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.

We'll go next to Matt Hewitt with Craig-Hallum Capital Group.
Matt G. Hewitt - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC
Good morning. Congratulations on the strong quarter. A couple of questions from me. First, so if I'm understanding, in the Clinical Controls segment, you had some benefit with timing on shipments in the third quarter. Just trying to calibrate what that means for Q4. Is it – are you expecting something similar to Q2 at $25 million, $26 million or something similar to the year ago period with maybe a few basis points of growth so that would be closer to $21 million?
James T. Hippel - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, Matt, well – we're not going to give a specific guidance by segment. I think what I would share with you is that it is lumpy and it's – so, in fact, we had strong orders out of Cliniqa, which doesn't count organically, but I mean, out of our legacy chemistry-based controls business, which, in fact, is organic. And going forward, it could be lumpy as well. But again, at a high level, what we will share is that we expect our overall company revenues to be similar in Q3 – or Q4 and Q3.
The mix between the business units could change a little bit. I think it will change somewhat in the sense that PPD overall revenue will be likely a lower percentage that's a negative mix impact. That's what we'll share.
Matt G. Hewitt - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC
Okay.
Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
And we will also – hematology component has been and have been, and remains and will remain steady as she goes at 5%-ish growth rates, very much a run rate...
Matt G. Hewitt - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC
Okay. All right. Thanks. And then, Chuck, maybe a question for you. When you came on board, there was a lot of heavy lifting on the investment side, there was a lot of internal investments that need to be made. Where do you think you are in that stage? What stage do you think you are in those heavy investments? Do you see that tailing off? Obviously, investing for growth will be necessary, but from some of those initial investments, where do we sit and how does that play out over the next year or two years?
Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
That's a great question. I think – I'd say we're about in the seventh inning on that. The investments kind of come in two categories for me. One is they're really operational and they're really needed for productivity or they're capital, right? And we have built out three different buildings already here on my watch, and at the most, we have one more to do here, internally here and locally in headquarters that we're playing around with in terms of ability to kind of rework our total work streams.
I mean, you've been here, right? This place is like a honeycomb. It's like – changing around and making improvements is like working a Rubik's cube. So, you need to start with a big enough blank sheet of paper or space to try and redo everything and clean it up. So, we're in the middle of that. We're doing a lot of lean things. As you saw, our margins improved again. We had absolutely phenomenal productivity again in this – in the Biotech sector.
But software around email, computers all being replaced, LMS system, and we're ready to pull the trigger on phase one of our ERP system in July. That's all on track, which is fairly expensive.
We've got a lot of – and the team, the executive team is pretty much in place. I don't see a lot of new additions going forward. The stock and equity-based compensation is all in place for the top 100 people. There's not a big need to further do that right now, unless there's need through acquisitions of new team members that way.

So I think we're in a good place there. We have capital needs going forward, I think, with the phase two and three of ERP. There's continued investment, I'd say a steady-state on the website development, nothing more, but nothing less. We've made improvements there. So that will be a same as she goes going forward. We are putting in place another – putting in place Hyperion for consolidation. We've gone from 6 sites to 21 sites, and poor Jim is tired of consolidating the spreadsheets on napkins, so we're getting a – the real system he's used to using from his days at Thermo and most of the world uses, and things like that you have to do. But really the – you said it well. The heavy lifting, I think, is really behind us. We're going through a – our – my third round of roundtables. I've probably done over 30 different meetings with groups of employees on the last three months, four months, and they're noticing it. They're very appreciative and they get it. They see where we're going and they see it.
Matt G. Hewitt - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC
That's – go ahead. That's great. Thank you very much. That's a really good update. Thank you.

We'll go next to William March with Janney Montgomery Scott.
William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Hey, guys, it's Bill March on for Paul Knight. How are you guys doing?
Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Good.
James T. Hippel - Chief Financial Officer
Good.
William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
First question, maybe if you could – you saw mid-double digit growth in the biopharma segment, what's driving the growth from that end market?
Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Okay. Well, a couple of things. When we worked hard at getting our core back in place, I mean, we certainly took some arrows over ProteinSimple a few quarters ago. But the harder part of this company turning around and getting it going has been getting this core because it is just so fragmented, as you know.
We still don't have really any reagent products over 2 million, and we still have customer base is 1% or less in general. We typically have done a lot of prioritization since I've come here around what we're going to make and why, instead of just throwing 2,000 or more new products at the wall and see what sticks every year. We're substantially down from that now, somewhere around 1,500, but a lot quicker time to revenue.
A lot more focus on the marking end of it and why there is going to be quick take-up. And part of that has been the trend, I think, in CRO. There's been a lot of custom in the industry and Abcam reported, won a lot of custom going on as well. We're seeing it, too. So we're getting on the Biotech pharma side.
We're getting a lot of requests because we're a quality producer, we've got great scientists and we were, in some cases, the only game in town for the things we make. And they're coming more and more for special things. We try to put as much of that into the catalogue as possible. It doesn't all go. If it doesn't go, it's always still a recurring revenue stream with that partner.
And the thing I like, it's immediate sales. You're not waiting at all. So we've had a dramatic improvement in our vitality index. If you remember though, our first year here, we reported about $2.4 million in first year sales. Last year, we reported $5.8 million. This year, we're probably well over $10 million, we're thinking. So it's been a dramatic improvement in the core, but also from custom and everything else, and it's largely Biotech pharma, which has been driving this double digit growth rate when you start adding the numbers up.
William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Great. And then...
Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director

And what's interesting, much more visible, too, are the websites helping there. We're – I could go on and on about our tradeshow strategies and investments there, the booth redesigns, the comprehensive look we have around our family of brands. We just came back from ACR and the response was unbelievable. We had a record number of leads and pretty much across the board, customers are saying, yeah, we know who Bio-Techne is now and we're – and we like doing business with you. We like the path you are on with all the different segments because you're becoming more and more of a one-stop shop for us, so.
William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Great. And then secondly, in terms of end markets, maybe on the academic side, what are you seeing from that end market in terms of with the new NIH budget and maybe what you see for the rest of the calendar year? Thanks.
Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah, we're seeing kind of what everyone else is reporting on. I don't think we've seen too much of a take-up yet from that extra funding and spending. Maybe a little bit, but we're not really seeing a lot of evidence. We're – like everyone thinks, it's going to be really occurring mostly in the second half of the calendar year here. And we're hopeful. It should be – we've talked about what it should give us. When you roll it all through, when you go through our analytics with our customers, it should be about a 1% overall improvement for us. Is it there yet or not? Well, we had a record quarter, maybe a little bit there. It's hard to start separating the stuff under 1% like that, so...
William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Understood. Thanks, guys. Have a good day.
Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
At least we're moving in the right direction. At least we're not contracting. We're going to – we're in an expansion timeframe for a while, we think. So that's good.
William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Great. Thank you.

And that will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.
Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, very proud of our team. It was a great quarter. I'm sure hope it continues. We see a lot of – we see a very bright future here. People are having fun, and we'll talk to you again next quarter. Thank you.
