When Timing Matters...

With roots in precision crystal filters for radar in 1965, MtronPTI designs and manufactures RF & microwave solutions for data timing and radio frequency spectrum control in high reliability and harsh environment applications. Formed in 2004 with the acquisition of Piezo Technology, Inc. by M-tron Industries, Inc., MtronPTI is a wholly owned subsidiary of the LGL Group, Inc.

In aerospace and defense markets, MtronPTI’s digitally tuned filters support secure communications in the presence of electromagnetic interference. Low drift, highly accurate oscillators provide reliable frequency lock for ground, vehicle, air and satellite communication as well as electronic countermeasures. Vibration and shock resistant crystal clocks sharpen radar images and help monitor commercial aircraft engine performance.

For Internet communication, MtronPTI very low noise and packet sync clocks help increase bandwidth and prevent data loss in cellular base stations, micro and femto cells and Wi-Fi access points. Millimeter wave filters ensure corporate and telecom point-to-point links stay error free.

On the lab bench or consumer electronics production test floors, MtronPTI ultra low noise frequency reference oscillators insure accurate measurements. When public safety is paramount, MtronPTI wide temperature range/waterproof cavity filters insure reliable radio communication.

Satellite links, phased array radars and anti-IED jammers use MtronPTI RF power amplifiers to boost the signal to the antenna.

Based in Orlando, Florida with manufacturing in the United States and India, MtronPTI is vertically integrated with deep experience in basic material science, design and manufacturing.

When Timing Matters...
Focusing on three market segments, Aero/Defense, Internet Infrastructure and instrumentation, MtronPTI designs and manufactures customized electronic components used primarily to control frequency or timing of electronic signals. These components include crystal oscillators, RF power amplifiers and RF to millimeter wave filters. MtronPTI products are typically high-end devices and often custom designed for the specific application.

Precision oscillators are used for data timing in Internet and mobile infrastructure to ensure reliability and high data rates. Avionic, military and civilian radios use MtronPTI RF and microwave filters to keep connections open under adverse environments including extreme temperature. Satellite terminals and phased array radars depend on shock and vibration resistant oscillators to provide the Internet to commercial airline passengers and clear tactical images to military pilots.
Satellite links, phased array radars and anti-IED jammers use MtronPTI RF power amplifiers to boost the signal to the antenna. On the lab bench or consumer electronics production test floors, MtronPTI ultra low noise reference oscillators insure accurate measurements.

History

The LGL Group Inc.'s engineering and design origins date back to the early part of the last century. In 1917, Lynch Glass Machinery Company, the predecessor of LGL, was formed, and emerged in the late twenties as a successful manufacturer of glass-forming machinery. The company was then renamed Lynch Corporation, and was incorporated in 1928, under the laws of the State of Indiana. In 1946, Lynch was listed on the “New York Curb Exchange,” the predecessor to the NYSE MKT. The company has had a long history of owning and operating various businesses in the precision engineering, manufacturing and services sectors.
The LGL Group, Inc. (the “Company”) was reincorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in 2007, and serves as a holding company with subsidiaries engaged in manufacturing custom-designed, highly-engineered electronic components. The company maintains its executive offices at 2525 Shader Road, Orlando, Florida 32804. The Company’s telephone number is (407) 298-2000. The Company’s common stock is traded on the NYSE MKT under the ticker symbol “LGL”.
The Company operates through its principal subsidiary, M-tron Industries, Inc., which includes the operations of M-tron Industries, Ltd. (“Mtron”), and Mtron’s subsidiaries Piezo Technology, Inc. and Piezo Technology India Private Ltd (jointly, “PTI”). In October of 2004, Mtron and PTI were merged into a single company with one of the broadest product portfolios in the industry. The combined operations of Mtron and PTI are referred to as “MtronPTI.” MtronPTI has operations in Orlando, Florida, Yankton, South Dakota and Noida, India. In addition, MtronPTI has sales offices in Hong Kong and Shanghai, China.
M-tron Industries, Inc. (“Mtron”) was originally founded in 1965 as Mechtronics, Industries, Inc. Shortly thereafter, the name was formally changed to M-tron Industries, Inc. The primary business of Mtron during the early years was building crystals for the CB radio market. When technology changed in the late 1970s, so did Mtron. A change in marketing approach and continued development of products provided new life for the company. Mtron became known as a supplier of high quality, high reliability crystal, oscillator, and to some degree, VCXO (Voltage Controlled Crystal Oscillator) and TCXO (Temperature Compensated Crystal Oscillator) products which would be used in applications such as telecommunication infrastructure used to make phone systems and later on, the internet function. In 1976, M-tron Industries, Inc. was acquired. In 2002, Mtron acquired the assets of Champion Technologies, Inc. of Franklin Park, Illinois. Champion was a spin-off of Motorola during the mid-1980s. This acquisition helped Mtron recover more quickly from the telecom market collapse of 2001 and 2002 by expanding product offering, as well as customer base.
In 1965, at nearly the same time that Mtron was established, another company was organized, known as Piezo Technology, Inc. PTI was organized for the purpose of designing and building crystal filters used in all types of equipment where certain types of noise need to be filtered out of a circuit. PTI grew over the years in both business and products to include LC (Lumped Element) filters, TCXO and OCXO (Oven Controlled Crystal Oscillator) products. Primary markets for PTI were Military, Avionics and Instrumentation. In 1995 PTI opened a manufacturing location in India and in 2004 M-tron Industries, Inc. acquired Piezo Technology, Inc.
LGL’s business development strategy is primarily focused on expanding the existing operations via MtronPTI through organic growth, expansion into new geographic market segments and through other strategic opportunities. MtronPTI currently has a global footprint and serves most major markets that require precision timing and filter products. The Company’s target market segments include high-end telecommunications, and military, instrumentation, space and avionics (referred to as “MISA”).

When Timing Matters...

With roots in precision crystal filters for radar in 1965, MtronPTI designs and manufactures RF & microwave solutions for data timing and radio frequency spectrum control in high reliability and harsh environment applications. Formed in 2004 with the acquisition of Piezo Technology, Inc. by M-tron Industries, Inc., MtronPTI is a wholly owned subsidiary of the LGL Group, Inc.

In aerospace and defense markets, MtronPTI’s digitally tuned filters support secure communications in the presence of electromagnetic interference. Low drift, highly accurate oscillators provide reliable frequency lock for ground, vehicle, air and satellite communication as well as electronic countermeasures. Vibration and shock resistant crystal clocks sharpen radar images and help monitor commercial aircraft engine performance.

For Internet communication, MtronPTI very low noise and packet sync clocks help increase bandwidth and prevent data loss in cellular base stations, micro and femto cells and Wi-Fi access points. Millimeter wave filters ensure corporate and telecom point-to-point links stay error free.

On the lab bench or consumer electronics production test floors, MtronPTI ultra low noise frequency reference oscillators insure accurate measurements. When public safety is paramount, MtronPTI wide temperature range/waterproof cavity filters insure reliable radio communication.

Satellite links, phased array radars and anti-IED jammers use MtronPTI RF power amplifiers to boost the signal to the antenna.

Based in Orlando, Florida with manufacturing in the United States and India, MtronPTI is vertically integrated with deep experience in basic material science, design and manufacturing. With AS9100 Rev C and ISO 9001:2008 certification, sales and support worldwide and as a recognized service leader, MtronPTI supports innovation and reliability at major OEMs including Cisco, Raytheon, Ericsson, Harris, Rockwell Collins, UTC Aerospace and nearly 2,000 smaller clients through distribution partners.
