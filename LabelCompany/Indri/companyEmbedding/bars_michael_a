  "Staying healthy after stepping off the football field was harder than I        thought" 



CINCINNATI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, Meta—a new line of wellness products from the makers of 
      Metamucil—announces its partnership with Michael Strahan, co-host of 
      LIVE with Kelly and Michael, FOX NFL Sunday analyst, Good Morning 
      America special co-host, and 2014 Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee for 
      the launch of its new suite of products. His shared passion for health 
      and understanding of the importance of making small, healthy changes to 
      get big rewards made Strahan the perfect choice for a spokesperson.
    

      As the brand spokesperson, Strahan will appear in print and television 
      advertising, public relations efforts and online properties, including 
      the brand’s new website: MetaWellness.com. The national campaign kicks 
      off in August.
    

      In addition to the Metamucil powder that Americans know and love, the 
      Meta line will introduce two brand new products:
    


        Meta Health Bars™ are fiber bars containing psyllium fiber—available 
        in Cinnamon Oatmeal Raisin and Cranberry Lemon Drizzle—that can help 
        lower cholesterol to promote heart health†, help satisfy 
        hunger as a healthy snack, and help promote digestive health.
      

        MetaBiotic™ is a 2-in-1 MultiHealth probiotic supplement containing 
        Bio-Active 12™ which helps maintain digestive balance and promote a 
        healthy immune system.*
      


      “Metamucil is an iconic brand, helping consumers for more than 80 years! 
      We’re thrilled to partner with Michael to usher in a new era for the 
      brand. We want to bring significant new innovation that offers 
      clinically proven benefits to all consumers and help them be their best 
      every day,” said Patrick Lockwood-Taylor, Vice President, General 
      Manager of North America Personal Health Care at P&G. “Michael is 
      equally committed to helping everybody find new and simple ways to 
      maintain their health.”
    

      Transitioning from professional athlete to morning show mainstay, 
      Strahan also knows about reinvention and is looking forward to helping 
      introduce Americans to the new Meta.
    

      “Staying healthy after stepping off the football field was harder than I 
      thought,” said Strahan. “My schedule became busier than ever. Now I look 
      for small, healthy things I can do every day and that includes using 
      Meta products. I am a believer in the brand, which is why I am excited 
      to partner with them and help other people realize maintaining their 
      health doesn’t have to be so hard.”
    

      The full Meta line of products will be available in the digestive 
      wellness aisle of major retailers nationwide beginning in mid-August.
    




            † Diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol that include 7 grams 
            of soluble fiber per day from psyllium husk, as in Meta Health 
            Bars, may reduce the risk of heart disease by lowering 
            cholesterol. One Meta Health Bar has 1.8 grams of this soluble 
            fiber.

About Meta ProductsCreated and introduced for the first 
      time in 1934 by G.D. Searle & Co., Metamucil powder was acquired by P&G 
      in 1985. Metamucil powder is the number one doctor, pharmacist1, 
      and gastroenterologist2 recommended fiber brand. Made with 
      100% natural psyllium fiber, Metamucil and new Meta Health Bars fit any 
      lifestyle when you are looking to increase your fiber intake. Use as 
      directed.
    

      MetaBiotic helps support health from within. The probiotic capsule 
      contains Bio-Active12™ to naturally help support a healthy digestive 
      system and a healthy immune system.* Use as directed.
