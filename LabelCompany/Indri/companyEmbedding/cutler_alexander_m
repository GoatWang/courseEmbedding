      Ohio 44114-2584; http://web.eaton.com.
    

      ■ In less than 20 years with Eaton Corporation, Alexander M. Cutler
      became president, chairman, and chief executive officer of the company
      that had become the second-largest manufacturer of hydraulic equipment and
      the largest maker of truck transmissions in the United States. Eaton
      started out as a provider of automotive parts; Cutler's vision and
      his ability to act upon that vision made him highly instrumental in the
      diversification of the company into the multinational manufacture of fluid
      power systems; distribution and control systems; automotive parts;
      aerospace equipment; and electrical power quality, distribution, and
      control systems.
    

      COMPANY GROWTH THROUGH MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS, AND DIVESTITURES
    

      Cutler began his career in 1975 as a financial analyst with Cutler-Hammer.
      Created in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1893 by Harry T. Cutler (who bore no
      relation to Alexander Cutler), Franklin S. Terry, and Edward West Hammer,
      the company first patented a starting box for motors. Through an
      acquisition, it added rheostats and light dimmers for theaters to its
      product line and eventually became a pioneer in electricity control.
      Through further acquisitions and the development of 54 patents,
      Cutler-Hammer's sales soared from $193,000 in 1900 to $12 million
      in 1920.
    

      The young Eaton Corporation, which began in 1911 in Bloomfield, New
      Jersey, when J. O. Eaton, Henning O. Taube, and V. V. Torbensen started
      the Torbensen Gear and Axle Company, also grew largely through
      acquisitions. In its first year the company manufactured seven truck axles
      by hand; six years later it produced 33,000 axles. By 1970 it had
      undergone more than a dozen mergers and acquisitions, vastly expanding its
      line of automotive products.
    

      Eaton acquired Cutler-Hammer in 1979—and along with it, Cutler, who
      became a division controller. He was promoted to manager of the Power
      Distribution Division in 1982 and general manager of the Industrial
      Control and Power Distribution Operations for the United States. Before
      long, Cutler had his eye on Westinghouse, the electric-industry giant that
      in the late 1800s developed the component that led to alternating current
      surpassing direct current as the world standard in electricity delivery.
      In the 20th century, Westinghouse became a nuclear-energy powerhouse,
      supplying nuclear-generated electricity to the navy, national defense
      systems, television companies, and the general populace.
    

      Cutler was looking to make Eaton a major player in the
      electrical-distribution and control industry and was impressed with the
      strategic directional change Westinghouse had made in that sector during
      the late 1980s and early 1990s. In January 1994 Eaton merged Westinghouse
      into its Cutler-Hammer division in what became one of the biggest
      acquisitions in the electric industry's history. Throughout the
      1990s Eaton made 50 acquisitions while divesting itself of 48 less
      profitable divisions. In 2000 Cutler was named chairman, CEO, and
      president of the company. By 2004 Eaton boasted 48,000 employees and had
      manufacturing facilities in more than 20 countries and product sales in
      more than 50.
    

      A MAN OF ACTION
    

      A brief description of Eaton on the National Leadership Council's
      Web site declared, "Eaton plays for keeps—if it can't
      win, it doesn't play," a philosophy clearly evident in
      Cutler's management style. Robert Sherefkin wrote in 
      
        Crain's Cleveland Business
      
      , "Alexander Cutler, the new chief executive officer of Eaton
      Corporation, has wasted little time shaking up the supplier"
      (September 11, 2000). After rising to the head of the company, he almost
      immediately announced plans to sell off Eaton's cockpit-switch
      business, which manufactured switches used in automobile door locks,
      mirrors, seats, and windows. Cutler made the decision to sell the business
      while it was still profitable; its sales the previous year had totaled
      $330 million. Proceeds from the sale were used to pay off debt or
      reinvested in the company, allowing Eaton to focus more heavily on its
      engine and drive-train divisions. Sherefkin wrote that, according to
      analyst Kent Mortensen of Robert W. Baird & Company of Milwaukee,
      the probable reason for Cutler's decision was that Eaton had not
      developed the "critical mass to lead the consolidation of vehicle
      interiors, where its switches are used. 'So it was fish or cut
      bait, and they decided to cut bait'" (September 11, 2000).
    

      In his CEO message on Eaton's Web site, Cutler wrote, "Eaton
      has changed. We have transformed our company from a manufacturer of
      vehicle components into a diversified industrial enterprise."
      Cutler always searched for the most lucrative mix of products, acquiring
      and divesting appropriately in order to achieve that goal. As the demand
      for cars and trucks decreased, he focused more heavily on the industrial
      and commercial controls divisions. He led Eaton to take advantage of two
      huge challenges that the auto industry faced: improving both gas mileage
      and emission controls. He also readily positioned the company to avail
      itself of the opportunity that was presented, and missed by many electric
      companies, when the industry deregulated and the demand for power surged.
      In an article in 
      
        Tirekicking Today
      
      , Cutler was reported as saying, "It's necessary to know
      what adds true value to a product, and what does not. Who are the value
      creators and who are the value destroyers?" (September 1998).
    

      GROWTH UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP
    

      After Cutler became chairman and CEO, Eaton spun off its
      semiconductor-equipment business, which became Axcelis Technologies and of
      which Cutler became a board member. In a series of moves that evoked
      images of a game of Monopoly on an international scale, in 2001 Eaton
      purchased Sumifomo Heavy Industries' 50 percent share in a
      fluid-power joint venture, which became Eaton's first wholly owned
      Japanese business. Eaton then sold its Switch/Electronics Division for
      $300 million and later became Lockheed Martin's primary fluid-power
      system supplier for the billion-dollar Joint Strike Fighter program. The
      subsequent additions of several other such contracts brought
      Eaton's aerospace-industry sales to almost $2 billion within a
      six-month period. Cutler noted that the Joint Strike Fighter contract in
      particular was a major win for Eaton, proving that they were forerunners
      in the research and development of high-pressure fluid-power systems for
      aircraft.
    

      Attesting to Cutler's vision for streamlining Eaton's
      product line, the company sold its Navy Controls business in 2002 for
      $92.2 million; bought the remaining 40 percent interest in its Jining
      Eaton Hydraulica Company in China; acquired the hose, tubing, and
      fluid-power systems connector division of Dana Corporation for $130
      million; and bought Mechanical Products' line of aerospace circuit
      breakers. Eaton later won an $84 million contract with the Boeing Company
      to provide high-pressure hydraulic and other systems for the U.S. Air
      Force. In 2003 it acquired Commonwealth Sprague Capacitor's power
      systems and the electrical division of London-based Delta.
    

      When introducing Cutler to a class of students at the Tuck School of
      Business at Dartmouth College, instructor Sydney Finkelstein noted that
      one of the major principles in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) was
      that they must "augment, regenerate, or create new competitive
      advantages." Finkelstein pointed out that, spearheaded by Cutler,
      Eaton had done just that and, "as such, represents a great
      opportunity to see the M&A principle in action."
    

      PERSPECTIVE ON PEOPLE, PRINCIPLES, AND PARTNERSHIPS
    

      In an interview with 
      
        Design News
      
      , Cutler stressed the importance of teamwork among design engineers and
      the need for those engineers to get out of the lab, into the marketplace,
      and around customers. He said that people who design products for a
      consumer must know what the consumer wants and understand his problems,
      and that meeting with customers was not just necessary, it was mandatory.
      "That's really how you get the creative juices running, and
      it's how you ensure that you're solving the problems your
      customers really need solved," he said (March 6, 1995).
    

      During the interview, Cutler said that the rapidly changing environment
      "puts a tremendous premium on employee speed and
      flexibility." His philosophy, however, was "simplify first,
      automate second." Rather than using technology to replace
      employees, he preferred to use technology as a way to help them become
      more productive and flexible. When asked by the interviewer how such a
      huge company could remain efficient, Cutler commented that the most
      important factor was communication, which meant moving away from the
      traditional management style and becoming "a facilitator, a coach,
      a communicator, whatever word you want to use" (March 6, 1995).
    

      Cutler wrote in his CEO Web-site message that while Eaton's
      business had changed, their principles had not. He noted three fundamental
      principles he believed helped Eaton grow as a business and its employees
      grow as individuals: innovation—"We value innovation and
      change as a source of strength";
      impact—"High-performance products, employees, and operations
      make a positive impact on the world around us"; and
      integrity—"We care about how we get results." He
      wrote: "Eaton values, Eaton people, and the power of one integrated
      operating company are what make us strong. They're also what drives
      our success."
    

      MANAGING ASSETS AND EDUCATION
    

      Cutler believed that to keep his company on the cutting edge, it was
      essential to provide its employees with continuing education and
      efficiently manage its assets. With the goal of transforming his workforce
      in mind, he was a major proponent of the Eaton Business System, an
      extensive and sweeping program to systematically monitor the
      company's assets and employees. Cutler's idea was to remove
      what he called the "silos," or barriers, from between each
      business unit in order for managers to learn from each other's
      experiences.
    

      Eaton University was launched shortly after Cutler's rise to
      chairman and CEO. It began as an instructor-based management-training
      program but soon became an e-learning facility. Quickly added to the
      original e-library was a wealth of material acquired from an outside
      organization, and general business courses were later added that trained
      managers to set performance goals, reward employee performance, develop
      coaching skills, and provide general career development. On the 
      
        Alchemy
      
       Web site, Cutler commented that the program was about "capturing
      the benefits of diversity, scale, and rapid transfer for best practices
      and turning that into the 'power of one'" (December
      3, 2002).
    

      TRIM TO SURVIVE
    

      In the process of keeping Eaton profitable and on the cutting edge, Cutler
      had the unpleasant responsibility of cutting jobs. Between 2001 and 2002,
      Eaton closed 34 factories and slashed 12,000 jobs. Even though the
      cockpit-switch works was only a small part of Eaton's huge
      Automotive Components Group, its sale eliminated more than four thousand
      employees in eight plants in North America, South America, and Europe.
      While Cutler did what he felt was necessary for his company's
      overall health, he remained aware of the effects it had on individuals.
      The 
      
        Taipei Times
      
       reported that Cutler said in an interview, "When you go through
      the kind of human trauma that organizations go through when they downsize,
      there's a very natural tendency to be very, very careful about how
      you add back resources" (November 4, 2001).
    

      After the general downturn of the U.S. economy in the early 2000s, Cutler
      announced in 2004 that the previous year had been a very good one.
      Fourth-quarter earnings in 2003 surpassed expectations, with sales growth
      of 17 percent and a net-income increase of 70 percent—from $67
      million in 2002 to $114 million in 2003.

Nationality: American.

Career: Cutler-Hammer, 1975–1977, financial analyst; 1977–1979, business group controller; Eaton Corporation, 1979–1980, division controller; 1980–1982, assembly plant manager; 1982–1985, manager of U.S. Power Distribution Division; 1985-1986, general manager of U.S. Industrial Control and Power Distribution Operations; 1986–1989, president of Industrials Group; 1989–1991, president of Controls Group; 1991–1993, executive vice president of Operations; 1993–1995, executive vice president and COO of Controls; 1995–2000, president and COO; 2000–, chairman, president, and CEO.
Address: Eaton Corporation, Eaton Center, 1111 Superior Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44114-2584; http://web.eaton.com.
■ In less than 20 years with Eaton Corporation, Alexander M. Cutler became president, chairman, and chief executive officer of the company that had become the second-largest manufacturer of hydraulic equipment and the largest maker of truck transmissions in the United States. Eaton started out as a provider of automotive parts; Cutler's vision and his ability to act upon that vision made him highly instrumental in the diversification of the company into the multinational manufacture of fluid power systems; distribution and control systems; automotive parts; aerospace equipment; and electrical power quality, distribution, and control systems.
COMPANY GROWTH THROUGH MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS, AND DIVESTITURES
Cutler began his career in 1975 as a financial analyst with Cutler-Hammer. Created in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1893 by Harry T. Cutler (who bore no relation to Alexander Cutler), Franklin S. Terry, and Edward West Hammer, the company first patented a starting box for motors. Through an acquisition, it added rheostats and light dimmers for theaters to its product line and eventually became a pioneer in electricity control. Through further acquisitions and the development of 54 patents, Cutler-Hammer's sales soared from $193,000 in 1900 to $12 million in 1920.
The young Eaton Corporation, which began in 1911 in Bloomfield, New Jersey, when J. O. Eaton, Henning O. Taube, and V. V. Torbensen started the Torbensen Gear and Axle Company, also grew largely through acquisitions. In its first year the company manufactured seven truck axles by hand; six years later it produced 33,000 axles. By 1970 it had undergone more than a dozen mergers and acquisitions, vastly expanding its line of automotive products.


Eaton acquired Cutler-Hammer in 1979—and along with it, Cutler, who became a division controller. He was promoted to manager of the Power Distribution Division in 1982 and general manager of the Industrial Control and Power Distribution Operations for the United States. Before long, Cutler had his eye on Westinghouse, the electric-industry giant that in the late 1800s developed the component that led to alternating current surpassing direct current as the world standard in electricity delivery. In the 20th century, Westinghouse became a nuclear-energy powerhouse, supplying nuclear-generated electricity to the navy, national defense systems, television companies, and the general populace.
Cutler was looking to make Eaton a major player in the electrical-distribution and control industry and was impressed with the strategic directional change Westinghouse had made in that sector during the late 1980s and early 1990s. In January 1994 Eaton merged Westinghouse into its Cutler-Hammer division in what became one of the biggest acquisitions in the electric industry's history. Throughout the 1990s Eaton made 50 acquisitions while divesting itself of 48 less profitable divisions. In 2000 Cutler was named chairman, CEO, and president of the company. By 2004 Eaton boasted 48,000 employees and had manufacturing facilities in more than 20 countries and product sales in more than 50.
A MAN OF ACTION
A brief description of Eaton on the National Leadership Council's Web site declared, "Eaton plays for keeps—if it can't win, it doesn't play," a philosophy clearly evident in Cutler's management style. Robert Sherefkin wrote in Crain's Cleveland Business, "Alexander Cutler, the new chief executive officer of Eaton Corporation, has wasted little time shaking up the supplier" (September 11, 2000). After rising to the head of the company, he almost immediately announced plans to sell off Eaton's cockpit-switch business, which manufactured switches used in automobile door locks, mirrors, seats, and windows. Cutler made the decision to sell the business while it was still profitable; its sales the previous year had totaled $330 million. Proceeds from the sale were used to pay off debt or reinvested in the company, allowing Eaton to focus more heavily on its engine and drive-train divisions. Sherefkin wrote that, according to analyst Kent Mortensen of Robert W. Baird & Company of Milwaukee, the probable reason for Cutler's decision was that Eaton had not developed the "critical mass to lead the consolidation of vehicle interiors, where its switches are used. 'So it was fish or cut bait, and they decided to cut bait'" (September 11, 2000).
In his CEO message on Eaton's Web site, Cutler wrote, "Eaton has changed. We have transformed our company from a manufacturer of vehicle components into a diversified industrial enterprise." Cutler always searched for the most lucrative mix of products, acquiring and divesting appropriately in order to achieve that goal. As the demand for cars and trucks decreased, he focused more heavily on the industrial and commercial controls divisions. He led Eaton to take advantage of two huge challenges that the auto industry faced: improving both gas mileage and emission controls. He also readily positioned the company to avail itself of the opportunity that was presented, and missed by many electric companies, when the industry deregulated and the demand for power surged. In an article in Tirekicking Today, Cutler was reported as saying, "It's necessary to know what adds true value to a product, and what does not. Who are the value creators and who are the value destroyers?" (September 1998).
GROWTH UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP
After Cutler became chairman and CEO, Eaton spun off its semiconductor-equipment business, which became Axcelis Technologies and of which Cutler became a board member. In a series of moves that evoked images of a game of Monopoly on an international scale, in 2001 Eaton purchased Sumifomo Heavy Industries' 50 percent share in a fluid-power joint venture, which became Eaton's first wholly owned Japanese business. Eaton then sold its Switch/Electronics Division for $300 million and later became Lockheed Martin's primary fluid-power system supplier for the billion-dollar Joint Strike Fighter program. The subsequent additions of several other such contracts brought Eaton's aerospace-industry sales to almost $2 billion within a six-month period. Cutler noted that the Joint Strike Fighter contract in particular was a major win for Eaton, proving that they were forerunners in the research and development of high-pressure fluid-power systems for aircraft.
Attesting to Cutler's vision for streamlining Eaton's product line, the company sold its Navy Controls business in 2002 for $92.2 million; bought the remaining 40 percent interest in its Jining Eaton Hydraulica Company in China; acquired the hose, tubing, and fluid-power systems connector division of Dana Corporation for $130 million; and bought Mechanical Products' line of aerospace circuit breakers. Eaton later won an $84 million contract with the Boeing Company to provide high-pressure hydraulic and other systems for the U.S. Air Force. In 2003 it acquired Commonwealth Sprague Capacitor's power systems and the electrical division of London-based Delta.
When introducing Cutler to a class of students at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College, instructor Sydney Finkelstein noted that one of the major principles in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) was that they must "augment, regenerate, or create new competitive advantages." Finkelstein pointed out that, spearheaded by Cutler, Eaton had done just that and, "as such, represents a great opportunity to see the M&A principle in action."
PERSPECTIVE ON PEOPLE, PRINCIPLES, AND PARTNERSHIPS
In an interview with Design News, Cutler stressed the importance of teamwork among design engineers and the need for those engineers to get out of the lab, into the marketplace, and around customers. He said that people who design products for a consumer must know what the consumer wants and understand his problems, and that meeting with customers was not just necessary, it was mandatory. "That's really how you get the creative juices running, and it's how you ensure that you're solving the problems your customers really need solved," he said (March 6, 1995).
During the interview, Cutler said that the rapidly changing environment "puts a tremendous premium on employee speed and flexibility." His philosophy, however, was "simplify first, automate second." Rather than using technology to replace employees, he preferred to use technology as a way to help them become more productive and flexible. When asked by the interviewer how such a huge company could remain efficient, Cutler commented that the most important factor was communication, which meant moving away from the traditional management style and becoming "a facilitator, a coach, a communicator, whatever word you want to use" (March 6, 1995).


Cutler wrote in his CEO Web-site message that while Eaton's business had changed, their principles had not. He noted three fundamental principles he believed helped Eaton grow as a business and its employees grow as individuals: innovation—"We value innovation and change as a source of strength"; impact—"High-performance products, employees, and operations make a positive impact on the world around us"; and integrity—"We care about how we get results." He wrote: "Eaton values, Eaton people, and the power of one integrated operating company are what make us strong. They're also what drives our success."
MANAGING ASSETS AND EDUCATION
Cutler believed that to keep his company on the cutting edge, it was essential to provide its employees with continuing education and efficiently manage its assets. With the goal of transforming his workforce in mind, he was a major proponent of the Eaton Business System, an extensive and sweeping program to systematically monitor the company's assets and employees. Cutler's idea was to remove what he called the "silos," or barriers, from between each business unit in order for managers to learn from each other's experiences.
Eaton University was launched shortly after Cutler's rise to chairman and CEO. It began as an instructor-based management-training program but soon became an e-learning facility. Quickly added to the original e-library was a wealth of material acquired from an outside organization, and general business courses were later added that trained managers to set performance goals, reward employee performance, develop coaching skills, and provide general career development. On the Alchemy Web site, Cutler commented that the program was about "capturing the benefits of diversity, scale, and rapid transfer for best practices and turning that into the 'power of one'" (December 3, 2002).
TRIM TO SURVIVE
In the process of keeping Eaton profitable and on the cutting edge, Cutler had the unpleasant responsibility of cutting jobs. Between 2001 and 2002, Eaton closed 34 factories and slashed 12,000 jobs. Even though the cockpit-switch works was only a small part of Eaton's huge Automotive Components Group, its sale eliminated more than four thousand employees in eight plants in North America, South America, and Europe. While Cutler did what he felt was necessary for his company's overall health, he remained aware of the effects it had on individuals. The Taipei Times reported that Cutler said in an interview, "When you go through the kind of human trauma that organizations go through when they downsize, there's a very natural tendency to be very, very careful about how you add back resources" (November 4, 2001).
After the general downturn of the U.S. economy in the early 2000s, Cutler announced in 2004 that the previous year had been a very good one. Fourth-quarter earnings in 2003 surpassed expectations, with sales growth of 17 percent and a net-income increase of 70 percent—from $67 million in 2002 to $114 million in 2003.

Learn more about citation styles 




Citation styles

									Encyclopedia.com gives you the ability to cite reference entries and articles according to common styles from the Modern Language Association (MLA), The Chicago Manual of Style, and the American Psychological Association (APA).
								

									Within the “Cite this article” tool, pick a style to see how all available information looks when formatted according to that style.  Then, copy and paste the text into your bibliography or works cited list.
								

									Because each style has its own formatting nuances that evolve over time and not all information is available for every reference entry or article, Encyclopedia.com cannot guarantee each citation it generates.  Therefore, it’s best to use Encyclopedia.com citations as a starting point before checking the style against your school or publication’s requirements and the most-recent information available at these sites:
								

Modern Language Association
http://www.mla.org/style
The Chicago Manual of Style
http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html
American Psychological Association
http://apastyle.apa.org/

Notes:


										Most online reference entries and articles do not have page numbers.  Therefore, that information is unavailable for most Encyclopedia.com content.  However, the date of retrieval is often important.  Refer to each style’s convention regarding the best way to format page numbers and retrieval dates.
									

										In addition to the MLA, Chicago, and APA styles, your school, university, publication, or institution may have its own requirements for citations.  Therefore, be sure to refer to those guidelines when editing your bibliography or works cited list.

Cleveland, Ohio, USA and Dublin, Ireland – May 21, 2012 


Eaton to Acquire Cooper Industries to Form Premier Global Power Management Company 

• Complementary Products and Markets Create Opportunities for Growth in Global Electrical Industry 

• Cooper Shareholders to Receive $39.15 per Share in Cash and 0.77479 in Ordinary Shares for 29% Premium; Transaction Equity Value of $11.8 Billion 

• Transaction Expected to be Accretive to EPS in 2014 

Diversified industrial manufacturer Eaton Corporation (NYSE: ETN) (“Eaton”) and electrical equipment supplier Cooper Industries plc (NYSE: CBE) (“Cooper”) today announced they have entered into a definitive agreement under which Eaton will acquire Cooper in a transaction that will significantly increase the capabilities and geographic breadth of the combined company’s power management portfolio and electrical business. 








Courtesy of Eaton


 



Founded in 1833, Cooper is a leading supplier of electrical equipment with a wide range of electrical products including electrical protection, power transmission and distribution, lighting and wiring components. 

This suite of electrical products enhances customer energy efficiency and safety across a number of end markets globally. 








Courtesy of Eaton


 



Founded in 1911, Eaton is a global power management company. Its electrical business is a global leader in power distribution, power quality, control and automation, power monitoring, and energy management products and services. 








Courtesy of Eaton


 



Eaton is positioned to answer today’s most critical power management challenges through its electrical, aerospace, hydraulics and vehicle businesses. 








Courtesy of Eaton


 



At the close of the transaction, which is expected in the second half of 2012, Eaton and Cooper will be combined under a new company incorporated in Ireland, where Cooper is incorporated today.

The newly created company, which is expected to be called Eaton Global Corporation Plc or a variant thereof (“New Eaton”), will be led by Alexander M. Cutler, Eaton’s current chairman and chief executive officer.

“This compelling combination of Eaton’s power distribution and power quality equipment and systems with Cooper’s diversified component brands, global reach and international distribution creates a game changer to serve the electrical industry,” said Cutler. 
“We’re excited about bringing together two great companies to create shareholder value and continue our global growth. This combination significantly expands our ability to better serve our customers with their demands for critical energy saving technologies as they address the impact of the world’s growing energy needs.” 








Kirk Hachigian, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Cooper Industries. 
            Courtesy of Cooper


 



“We are extremely pleased to become part of Eaton’s global electrical business,” said Kirk Hachigian, chairman and chief executive officer of Cooper. 
“This combination creates endless opportunities to accelerate growth and serve our global customers through combining technology, distribution, penetrating important vertical industries and entering new emerging markets. The two companies are a perfect fit in every respect.” 








Courtesy of Eaton


 



The combined company would have had historical 2011 revenues of $21.5 billion and EBITDA of $3.1 billion, and it is expected to enhance shareholder value by: 

• Leveraging complementary product offerings between Eaton and Cooper’s electrical businesses. 

• Accelerating long-term growth potential by increasing exposure to attractive end markets and service opportunities. 

• Better satisfying customer global demands for energy efficiency and electrical safety. 

• Generating approximately $535 million in expected annual synergies by 2016 . 

The Acquisition is expected to be accretive to operating earnings per share by $0.35 in 2014 and by $0.45 in 2015. 








Courtesy of Eaton


 



Excluding the non-cash expense related to the amortization of intangibles arising from purchase accounting, the Acquisition is expected to be accretive to operating earnings per share by $0.65 in 2014 and by $0.75 in 2015 . 








Courtesy of Eaton


 



The Acquisition will be financed with a mixture of cash, debt, and equity. 

Under the terms of the Transaction Agreement, Cooper Shareholders will receive $39.15 in cash and 0.77479 shares of New Eaton for each Cooper share. Based on the Closing Price for Eaton common stock on Friday May 18, 2012, Cooper Shareholders will receive cash and shares valued at $72.00 per share, representing a premium of 29 percent and a total transaction equity value of approximately $11.8 billion. 








Courtesy of Eaton


 



Eaton Shareholders will receive one share of the new company for each share of Eaton that they own upon closing. 

The transaction will be taxable, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, to both the Eaton Shareholders and the Cooper Shareholders. 








Courtesy of Eaton


 



Eaton Shareholders are expected to own approximately 73 percent of the combined company while legacy Cooper Shareholders are expected to own approximately 27 percent. 

Shares of New Eaton will be registered with the U.S. SEC and are expected to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ETN. 








Courtesy of Eaton


 



Eaton has secured a $6.75 billion fully underwritten bridge financing commitment from Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A., Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. and Citibank, N.A. to finance the cash portion of the Acquisition. 








Courtesy of Eaton


 



Eaton plans to later refinance these bridge borrowings through a new term debt issuance, use of cash on hand, and the possible sale of assets. 

Any response in relation to the Acquisition should be made only on the basis of the information contained in the Proxy Statement or any document by which the Acquisition and the Scheme are made. 








Courtesy of Eaton


 



Eaton Shareholders and Cooper Shareholders are advised to read carefully the formal documentation in relation to the proposed transaction once the Proxy Statement has been dispatched.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
