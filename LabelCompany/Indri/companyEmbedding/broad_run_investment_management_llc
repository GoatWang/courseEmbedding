Our approach

Leaders of small and mid-sized businesses have multiple roles and competing priorities. You want a best-in-class retirement plan but may be unsure about all the complexities and requirements. You may be uncertain about the costs and fees involved. You need a provider focused solely on retirement and aligned with your needs and goals—and fully committed to you, your participants, and the ongoing improvement of retirement investing.

Vanguard is committed to the retirement business and is a leader in the retirement plan industry. Best of all, you can benefit from Vanguard's unique ownership structure: We're owned by our clients and not by outside investors or stockholders. That means you never need to question whose interests come first for us. This approach serves as a foundation for all that we do with Vanguard Retirement Plan Access™, our 401(k) offer for small and mid-sized plans. You can count on our expertise to remove the uncertainties from managing your plan and our leadership to help you offer a strong plan for your participants. 



Key benefits




You can:

Have confidence in your plan.
Understand your costs.
Focus on your business.





Cost-conscious?
As a business owner and plan fiduciary, you want to eliminate ambiguity in retirement plan costs. Research has shown that plan costs for the smaller end of the market tend to be higher, and you need a retirement plan provider that not only provides transparent pricing but has a fair and reasonable cost structure.1
With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access:

You receive an All-in Fee Report that shows the total cost of your plan.
You have access to low-cost Vanguard index funds, plus the opportunity to choose from among more than 12,000 non-Vanguard funds.
Your annual recordkeeping price is based on a per-participant fee—a fee that doesn't jump as your assets grow, as with many small to mid-sized retirement plans.
You have flexibility in how you cover your plan costs—including a recordkeeping credit depending on the share class selected.




Too busy?
 As a business owner, you're pressed for time and focused on many aspects of business. With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access, you can rely on high-quality recordkeeping and administration to ease your administrative burden and help your employees stay on track for retirement.

Investment Process



Our concentrated, low turnover investment approach requires only a few new investments per year, so we can closely monitor our current investments and be highly selective in adding new names to the portfolio. 
Security Selection

Our process is focused on identifying companies that meet our five investment criteria:  

	1)  High quality business
	2)  Large growth opportunity
	3)  Excellent management
        4)  Discount valuation
	5)  Low catastrophic “tail risk”

We conduct thorough fundamental research on investment prospects with the expectation that we will own them for five years or longer.  We source information from company events and regulatory filings, industry research reports, management interviews and other sources.  In our experience, this knowledge is cumulative, and the understanding that we build about a business, its industry, and its management team is often helpful in identifying new investment opportunities in companies in the same or adjacent industries.
Portfolio Construction
We construct concentrated portfolios – typically 20 to 30 positions – and size positions based upon our conviction in the businesses and their risk-return profiles.  Investments are selected through a bottom-up process.  Portfolio cash levels are a byproduct of this research process.  We weigh the investment merits of the companies that we own against each other, and against other businesses that we are contemplating for purchase.  We spread positions across a variety of industries, but do not factor index weightings into portfolio construction.

“We believe that a policy of portfolio concentration may well decrease risk if it raises, as it should, both the intensity with which an investor thinks about a business and the comfort-level he must feel with its economic characteristics before buying into it.”

APPROACH
 
 







Our Approach


Business Focused Investing
We invest in public securities with much the same approach a buyer would use if purchasing a partial interest in a private company.  We do not look for short-term trading opportunities or mediocre companies that we can flip in a quarter or a year – we seek to own high quality, modestly valued businesses over a period of many years so that we can profit from the growth in their intrinsic value as they expand and grow their earnings over time. 
Long-Term Orientation
We take a long-term view in our business analysis and investing. We approach each investment with the expectation that we will own it for five years or longer.  We believe that this provides an advantage in a short-term oriented market – we often find buying opportunities when short-term, yet resolvable business problems create selling pressure from investors lacking the patience or perspective to see through temporary uncertainty.  
Concentration & Conviction-Weightings 
We believe that it is rare to find a high quality business trading at a discount price, so when we find such an opportunity we like to make it a meaningful part of the portfolio.  Typically we hold 20 to 30 stocks with 60% to 80% of assets in the top ten positions.  At this portfolio size, we can concentrate our investments in our best ideas and still have holdings spread across a variety of industries. 
Independent Research
A stock price generally reflects the investment community’s consensus thinking about a business and its future prospects.  To produce superior investment results, we need to recognize when consensus thinking about a stock is wrong, and capitalize on that opportunity.  Our concentrated, low turnover investment approach allows us to put more research time into each idea, enabling thorough, independent fundamental research that we believe is important to uncovering such marketplace mispricings. 
Risk Management
As long-term investors, we are focused on the risk of “permanent capital loss” – the potential that an investment is worth less five years from now than it is worth today – rather than short-term price volatility or benchmark tracking error.  We view fundamental business risk – new competition, technological change, financial leverage, poor capital allocation, etc. – and excessive valuation as the key sources of this risk, so we focus our efforts on trying to manage these exposures.

Proprietary Research… With a concentrated and low turnover portfolio, we can put more time into rigorous fundamental research on each idea
Cost Efficiency… Over the long-term, a low turnover approach should provide lower trading costs and more tax-efficient portfolios

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:

Our approach

Leaders of small and mid-sized businesses have multiple roles and competing priorities. You want a best-in-class retirement plan but may be unsure about all the complexities and requirements. You may be uncertain about the costs and fees involved. You need a provider focused solely on retirement and aligned with your needs and goals—and fully committed to you, your participants, and the ongoing improvement of retirement investing.

Vanguard is committed to the retirement business and is a leader in the retirement plan industry. Best of all, you can benefit from Vanguard's unique ownership structure: We're owned by our clients and not by outside investors or stockholders. That means you never need to question whose interests come first for us. This approach serves as a foundation for all that we do with Vanguard Retirement Plan Access™, our 401(k) offer for small and mid-sized plans. You can count on our expertise to remove the uncertainties from managing your plan and our leadership to help you offer a strong plan for your participants. 



Key benefits




You can:

Have confidence in your plan.
Understand your costs.
Focus on your business.





Cost-conscious?
As a business owner and plan fiduciary, you want to eliminate ambiguity in retirement plan costs. Research has shown that plan costs for the smaller end of the market tend to be higher, and you need a retirement plan provider that not only provides transparent pricing but has a fair and reasonable cost structure.1
With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access:

You receive an All-in Fee Report that shows the total cost of your plan.
You have access to low-cost Vanguard index funds, plus the opportunity to choose from among more than 12,000 non-Vanguard funds.
Your annual recordkeeping price is based on a per-participant fee—a fee that doesn't jump as your assets grow, as with many small to mid-sized retirement plans.
You have flexibility in how you cover your plan costs—including a recordkeeping credit depending on the share class selected.




Too busy?
 As a business owner, you're pressed for time and focused on many aspects of business. With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access, you can rely on high-quality recordkeeping and administration to ease your administrative burden and help your employees stay on track for retirement.
