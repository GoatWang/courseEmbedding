Syndication Strategies: Which Is Right? 
By Griffin, Robert C.

Article excerpt

Choose between issuer-dominated and investor-dominated approaches... or somewhere in between  A few years ago, the syndicated loan market consisted of a small number of bankers making a few phone calls. Today, loan syndications are a major part of the corporate banking business for a large number of banks.  From 1990 to 1994, total loan syndication volume grew from $174 billion to $665 billion per year, according to Loan Pricing Corp. This phenomenal growth poses strategic questions for business banks: Do we fit into this market--and, if so, where and how?  Dividing lines blur  The convergence of the loan and securities markets is a definite trend--and accelerating. The main reasons that many business loans are not broadly accepted in the securities market are that they are customized and not subject to a common rating system. These limits, however, soon will all but disappear in the large corporate market. For example, earlier this year, Standard and Poor's introduced a rating scale especially for syndicated bank loans (ABA BJ, July, p. 10).  The initial attraction for banks in the development of syndications may have been the drive to make more money, the desire to spread risk more effectively, or simply a response to clients' wishes for the type of service they had become accustomed to in public debt markets.  By now, it is unimportant why it started. It is here and the net result has been a closer link to the public debt markets. In 1993, public debt was our biggest competitor. In 1994, it was our biggest generator of new business.  While commercial banks are entering investment banking arenas, investment banks are moving onto commercial banking turf. The new competitors for syndicated loans include Goldman Sachs, CS First Boston, Lehman Brothers, and Merrill Lynch, among others.  BofA opts for balanced approach  A bank's ability to move up the growth curve will depend on matching its syndication strategy to its portfolio strategy and client base. A bank's size, how it is funded and its appetite for risk also determine its most fitting strategy.  Those strategic choices can be viewed as a continuum between issuer-dominated and investor-dominated approaches to the market, with a balanced approach in the middle.  Most banks hold the issuer-dominated posture. Many business bankers started their careers in issuer-oriented positions and as a result are most comfortable with this model. Banks in this category tend to be regional, participate in larger deals agented by others, and buy in sizes that fit their hold targets. They typically do not resell.  These banks may buy loans via relationship managers or a small syndication shop that mimics some of the prime-rate mutual funds. A low-cost structure is critical. Among these banks, there is not much investor emphasis, because many of the institutions are themselves the investors. Many, if not all, of these banks have a strong retail focus, which is critical from a cost-of-funds viewpoint.  Profitability historically has come from attracting and holding local issuer assets and buying lower-return purchased loans. Although this strategy currently works extremely well for many banks, it is likely to prove problematic over time. Flows of capital are moving away from banks, public markets are becoming more flexible, loans are becoming more marketable, margins are shrinking, and capacity continues to swamp demand.  On the other end of the spectrum is the investor-dominated approach. Here, the bank tends to be transaction-driven, rather than focused on issuer relationships.  Taking this approach would typically demand an extreme shift in a bank's culture. The market sets and resets tactics quickly, as investors make large numbers of relative value decisions based on only a few basis points. Therefore, new product development is key to holding investors' interest. Full-line players must offer short- and long-term investments, investment-grade and non-investment grade credits and a host of other alternatives. …
