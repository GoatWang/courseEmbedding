A commitment to sustainability is at the foundation of everything we do.












We build sustainability into everything we do.



Our visionWe believe in minimizing the environmental impact of our buildings.
Read moreWe go through great efforts to reduce the environmental footprint of the construction and operation of our buildings, enhancing our client’s comfort, health and financial savings.We aim for the highest level of performance in energy and water efficiency, waste management, tenant engagement, environmental construction, sustainable building operations, green building certifications, materials selection and community involvement.Our track recordFrom awards to certifications, our commitment to sustainability is making an impact.

We will also include at least two pollinator-friendly plants in any new landscape installations.Certifications: Participate in the LEED EB Volume Program and certify eligible existing buildingsNew DevelopmentCertifications: To ensure our sustainability policies are implemented, all ground-up construction will pursue LEED Gold certification or better, and all major renovations will pursue LEED Silver certification or betterMaterials: To reduce impacts on human health and our environmental footprint throughout our supply chain, materials purchased for and disposed of during our projects will meet the rigorous standards in this policy: Construction Materials Sustainability Policy.Total materials used in development projects will achieve at least 20% recycled content.

Read moreWaterIn 2015, the result of our interior and exterior projects was an overall decrease in water use like-for-like by 8.9%, an impressive achievement, bringing our total reduction from 2012 levels to 10%. While we executed a variety of water-saving projects, we believe this large reduction was largely driven by legislation restricting outdoor watering as a result of the drought. Completed a major turf removal project in Long Beach that resulted in a savings of over 3 million gallons from 2014 levels, a 13% reduction in campus consumption overall. We also completed a major irrigation retrofit in 11 San Diego buildings, resulting in another 3 million gallon annual savings and an 18% reduction in overall consumption. Our reclaimed water infrastructure saves nearly 22.3 million gallons of potable water annually.Recycling and CompostingWe achieved an office waste diversion rate of 54% in 2015, a 3% increase from 2014 levels. Waste diversion is waste that is recycled or composted.Green CleaningThe high performance of our green cleaning program was verified via the LEED for Existing Buildings Volume Prototype certification process. The cleaning products we use meet the relevant LEED environment standard, either GreenSeal or the California Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) limit. Our vacuums achieve the Carpet and Rug Institute Seal of Approval, and we use microfiber cloths and rags to capture additional dirt to improve air quality. In 2015, we have expanded our use of aqueous ozone to 11 buildings in San Diego, which eliminates the need to use most cleaning chemicals.Janitors are the eyes and ears of a building, and have the ability to report energy and water waste as well as noncompliance with recycling practices, but janitors are not a population that is typically included in sustainability discussions. The US Green Building Council Los Angeles Chapter (USGBC-LA), Building Skills Partnership (BSP), Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and the Building Owners and Managers Association of Greater Los Angeles (BOMA-GLA) created a Green Janitor Education program to provide training on sustainability topics like vampire power, turning off lights, and reporting leaks. We piloted this training in our 800,000 square foot Long Beach campus, and the program was so popular and successful that we scaled it to our entire Los Angeles, Orange County and San Diego portfolios, over 4.9 million square feet, or 40% of our portfolio and 88 total janitors. Janitors reported not only implementing enhanced sustainability practices at work, but also bringing those practices, like making sure to turn off unneeded lights, home as well.Electric Vehicle Charging StationsWe support the mainstream adoption of electric cars, so we have been expanding our network of electric vehicle charging stations. We added an additional 17stations in 2015, for a portfolio total of 52 stations. 2015 EV charging highlights include: 646 unique users, 45.7 tons of CO2 saved, 12,394 gallons of gasoline saved and EV charging stations installed at every new development project.Energy EfficiencyWhen it comes to reducing building energy use, we get results.
Read moreThe energy management projects we implemented in 2015 reduced overall portfolio energy use by 3.7% and will save nearly 8.2 million kilowatt-hours annually. This is equivalent to planting 144,904 trees and letting them grow for 10 years. We were able to achieve these results via the implementation of both traditional and innovative energy efficiency projects, including demand response strategies, installation of HVAC oil fouling removal technologies, lighting system retrofits, installation of Variable Frequency Drives, elevator modernization projects, retrocommissioning and energy auditing. A great example of a retrocommissioning project is our 303 Second Street building (740,747 square feet) which went through retrocommissioning in 2014 and then spent 2015 implementing findings. Through working with Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) on the incentives, the building was able to reduce its energy use by 10%, over two million kWh, and received a rebate of over $86,000 from the utility for doing this work.1US Environmental Protection Agency. Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator.The Kilroy Realty Energy Policy can be found here. LEEDers in SustainabilityWe believe in LEED-certified design, development and property operation.
Read moreThe Leadership in Energy Efficient and Environmental Design certification process is designed to address the entire lifecycle of a property, taking into account issues like site design, low-impact development, water and energy efficiency, indoor environmental quality, materials and resources used in construction, and innovative responses to unique building or site conditions. In recent years, we’ve built all our new development projects to LEED specifications and achieved Gold or Silver certification levels for several buildings.We are also actively pursuing LEED certification for LEED Platinum, Existing BuildingFremont Lake Union Center/801 N 34th Street, SeattleKey Center, BellevueLEED Gold, Existing BuildingSkyline Tower, Bellevue 100 First Street, San Francisco​303 Second Street San Francisco201 Third Street, San FranciscoLEED Platinum, Core & Shell 350 Mission, San Francisco333 Brannan, San FranciscoLEED Gold, Core & Shell Westlake Terry/320 Westlake Avenue N, SeattleWestlake Terry/321 Terry Avenue N, Seattle360 Third Street, San Francisco331 Fairchild Drive, Mountain ViewMountain View Campus, Mountain ViewSunnyvale Campus/505 Mathilda Avenue, SunnyvaleSunnyvale Campus/555 Mathilda Avenue, Sunnyvale​Liberty Station, San Diego The Heights at Del Mar/12790 El Camino Real, San DiegoLEED Silver, Core & ShellKilroy Airport Center/2260 E Imperial Highway, El Segundo2211 Michelson Drive, Irvine Kilroy Sabre Springs/13480 Evening Creek Drive, San DiegoLEED Certified, Core & ShellFremont Lake View, Seattle​1633 26th Street, Santa Monica LEED Platinum, Commercial Interiors​Kilroy Airport Center/2260 E Imperial Highway, El SegundoLEED Gold, Commercial Interiors Westlake Terry/321 Terry Avenue N, Seattle401 Terry*, Seattle 331 Fairchild Drive, Mountain ViewKilroy Hollywood Regional Office* at Sunset Media Center, Los Angeles​LEED Silver, Commercial InteriorsMission City Corporate Center/​2375 Northside Drive*, San Diego LEED Gold, New ConstructionSunnyvale Campus/605 Mathilda Avenue, Sunnyvale LEED Silver, New ConstructionKilroy Airport Center/3880 Kilroy Airport Way, Long Beach *LEED certification covers partial building.BOMA 360 CertificationEleven of our buildings are BOMA 360 certified.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion relates to our consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report. The results of operations discussion is combined for the Company and the Operating Partnership because there are no material differences in the results of operations between the two reporting entities.  Forward-Looking Statements  Statements contained in this "Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" that are not historical facts may be forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements or information concerning our plans, objectives, capital resources, portfolio performance, results of operations, projected future occupancy and rental rates, lease expirations, debt maturities, potential investments, strategies such as capital recycling, development and redevelopment activity, projected construction costs, projected construction commencement and completion dates, projected square footage of office space that could be constructed on undeveloped land that we own, projected rentable square footage of or number of units in properties under construction or in the development pipeline, anticipated proceeds from capital recycling activity or other dispositions and anticipated dates of those activities or dispositions, projected increases in the value of properties, dispositions, future executive incentive compensation, pending, potential or proposed acquisitions, plans to grow our Net Operating Income and FFO, anticipated market conditions and demographics and other forward-looking financial data, as well as the discussion in "-Factors That May Influence Future Results of Operations," "-Liquidity and Capital Resource of the Company," and "-Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Operating Partnership." Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as "believes," "expects," "projects," "may," "will," "should," "seeks," "approximately," "intends," "plans," "pro forma," "estimates" or "anticipates" and the negative of these words and phrases and similar expressions that do not relate to historical matters. Forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations, beliefs and assumptions, and are not guarantees of future performance. Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to uncertainties, risks, changes in circumstances, trends and factors that are difficult to predict, many of which are outside of our control. Accordingly, actual performance, results and events may vary materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, and you should not rely on the forward-looking statements as predictions of future performance, results or events. Numerous factors could cause actual future performance, results and events to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including, among others: global market and general economic conditions and their effect on our liquidity and financial conditions and those of our tenants; adverse economic or real estate conditions generally, and specifically, in the States of California and Washington; risks associated with our investment in real estate assets, which are illiquid and with trends in the real estate industry; defaults on or non-renewal of leases by tenants; any significant downturn in tenants' businesses; our ability to release property at or above current market rates; costs to comply with government regulations, including environmental remediations; the availability of cash for distribution and debt service and exposure to risk of default under debt obligations; increases in interest rates and our ability to manage interest rate exposure; the availability of financing on attractive terms or at all, which may adversely impact our future interest expense and our ability to pursue development, redevelopment and acquisition opportunities and refinance existing debt; a decline in real estate asset valuations, which may limit our ability to dispose of assets at attractive prices or obtain or maintain debt financing, and which may result in write offs or impairment charges; significant competition, which may decrease the occupancy and rental rates of properties; potential losses that may not be covered by insurance; the ability to successfully complete acquisitions and dispositions on announced terms; the ability to successfully operate acquired, developed and redeveloped properties; the ability to successfully complete development and redevelopment projects on schedule and within budgeted amounts; delays or refusals in obtaining all necessary zoning, land use and other required entitlements, governmental permits and authorizations for our development and redevelopment properties; increases in anticipated capital expenditures, tenant improvement and/or leasing costs; defaults on leases for land on which some of our properties are located; adverse changes to, or implementations of, applicable laws, regulations or legislation; risks associated with joint venture investments, including our lack of sole decision-making authority, our reliance on co-venturers' financial condition and disputes between us and our co-venturers; environmental uncertainties and risks related to natural disasters; and our ability to maintain our status as a REIT. The factors included in this report are not exhaustive and additional factors could adversely affect our business and financial performance. For a discussion of additional factors that could materially adversely affect the Company's and the Operating Partnership's business and financial performance, see the discussion below as well as "Item 1A. Risk Factors" and in our "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in the Company's and the Operating Partnership's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 and their respective other filings with the SEC. All forward-looking statements are based on currently available information and speak only as of the date on which they are made. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement that becomes untrue because of subsequent events, new information or otherwise, except to the extent we are required to do so in connection with our ongoing requirements under federal securities laws.  KILROY REALTY CORPORATION AND KILROY REALTY, L.P. NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)  Overview and Background  We are a self-administered REIT active in premier office and mixed-use submarkets along the West Coast. We own, develop, acquire and manage real estate assets, consisting primarily of Class A properties in the coastal regions of Los Angeles, Orange County, San Diego County, the San Francisco Bay Area and Greater Seattle, which we believe have strategic advantages and strong barriers to entry. We own our interests in all of our properties through the Operating Partnership and the Finance Partnership and generally conduct substantially all of our operations through the Operating Partnership. We owned an approximate 97.9%, 97.5% and 97.2% general partnership interest in the Operating Partnership as of March 31, 2017, December 31, 2016 and March 31, 2016, respectively. All of our properties are held in fee except for the thirteen office buildings that are held subject to long-term ground leases for the land.  Factors That May Influence Future Results of Operations  Development Program  We believe that a portion of our long-term future growth will continue to come from the completion of our in-process development projects, stabilization of recently completed development projects, and, subject to market conditions, executing on our near-term and future development pipeline, including expanding entitlements. Over the past several years, we increased our focus on development opportunities and expanded our near-term and future development pipeline through targeted acquisitions of development opportunities on the West Coast.  We have a proactive planning process by which we continually evaluate the size, timing, costs and scope of our development program and, as necessary, scale activity to reflect the economic conditions and the real estate fundamentals that exist in our submarkets. We expect to execute on our development program with prudence and will be pursuing opportunities with attractive economic returns in strategic locations with proximity to public transportation or transportation access and retail amenities and in markets with strong fundamentals and visible demand. We plan to develop in phases as appropriate and we generally favor starting projects that are pre-leased.  Stabilized Development Projects  During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we added the following project to our stabilized portfolio since the project had reached one year from building shell substantial completion:   Columbia Square Phase 2 - Office, located in the heart of Hollywood, California, two blocks from the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Vine Street. This project is comprised of three buildings totaling approximately 365,359 rentable square feet with a total estimated investment of approximately $230 million. As of March 31, 2017, the project was 86% leased and 75% occupied.  Projects Under Construction  As of March 31, 2017, we had three projects in our in-process development pipeline that were under construction.   The Exchange on 16th, Mission Bay, San Francisco, California, which we acquired in May 2014 and commenced construction on in June 2015. This project is currently anticipated to encompass approximately 750,000 gross rentable square feet of office and life science space in four buildings at a total estimated investment of $560.0 million. Construction is currently in progress and the building and core shell are currently estimated to be completed in the first half of 2018.   100 Hooper, San Francisco, California, which we acquired in July 2015 and commenced construction on in November 2016. This project is fully entitled for approximately 314,000 square feet of office and approximately 86,000 square feet of PDR space configured in two, four-story buildings. The total estimated cost for this project is approximately $270.0 million. Construction is currently in process and the core and shell of the project is currently expected to be completed in the first half of 2018. The office portion of the project is 100% pre-leased to Adobe Systems Inc. In connection with 100 Hooper, the Company also intends to develop an adjacent 50,000 square foot PDR space located at 150 Hooper with a total estimated investment of approximately $22.0 million.   One Paseo - Phase I (Retail and Residential), San Diego, California, which we acquired in November 2007 and commenced construction on in December 2016. Phase I of this mixed-use project includes site work and related infrastructure for the entire project, as well as 237 residential units and approximately 96,000 square feet of retail space. The total estimated  investment for this project is approximately $225.0 million. Construction is currently in process and is currently expected to be completed in phases beginning in the second quarter of 2018.  Near-Term and Future Development Pipeline  As of March 31, 2017, our near-term development pipeline included three additional undeveloped land holdings located in various submarkets in San Diego County, Greater Seattle and Los Angeles with an aggregate cost basis of approximately $290.1 million at which we believe we could develop approximately 1.9 million rentable square feet at a total estimated investment of over $1.2 billion, depending on successfully obtaining entitlements and market conditions.  The following table sets forth information about our near-term development pipeline as of the date of this filing.   Potential Approx. Total Estimated Total Costs as of Near-Term Development Start Developable Investment 3/31/2017 (3) Pipeline (1) Location Date (2) Square Feet ($ in millions) ($ in millions) 333 Dexter (4) South Lake Union 2017 700,000 $ 385 $ 75.5 Academy Project Hollywood 2017 545,000 390 77.3 One Paseo - Phases II and III Del Mar TBD 640,000 440 137.3 Total Near-Term Development Pipeline 1,885,000 $ 1,215 $ 290.1 ________________________  (2) Potential start dates assume successfully obtaining all entitlements and approvals necessary to commence construction. Actual commencement is subject to extensive consideration of market conditions and economic factors.  (3) Represents cash paid and costs incurred as of March 31, 2017.  (4) Consists of four adjacent parcels in the South Lake Union submarket of Seattle.  As of March 31, 2017, our longer term future development pipeline included additional undeveloped land holdings located in various submarkets in San Diego County and the San Francisco Bay Area with an aggregate cost basis of approximately $306.3 million, at which we believe we could develop more than 2.5 million developable square feet, depending on successfully obtaining entitlements and market conditions.  Fluctuations in our development activities could cause fluctuations in the average development asset balances qualifying for interest and other carry cost and internal cost capitalization in future periods. During the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, we capitalized interest on in-process development projects and development pipeline projects with an average aggregate cost basis of approximately $1.0 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, as it was determined these projects qualified for interest and other carry cost capitalization under GAAP. For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, we capitalized $10.2 million and $14.3 million, respectively, of interest to our qualifying development projects. For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, we capitalized $5.7 million and $4.6 million, respectively, of internal costs to our qualifying development projects.  Acquisitions. As part of our growth strategy, which is highly dependent on market conditions and business cycles, among other factors, we continue to evaluate strategic opportunities and remain a disciplined buyer of development and redevelopment opportunities as well as value-add operating properties. We continue to focus on growth opportunities in West Coast markets populated by knowledge and creative based tenants in a variety of industries, including technology, media, healthcare, life sciences, entertainment and professional services. Against the backdrop of market volatility, we expect to manage a strong balance sheet, execute on our development program and selectively evaluate opportunities that either add immediate Net Operating Income to our portfolio or play a strategic role in our future growth.  We cannot provide assurance that we will enter into any agreements to acquire properties, or undeveloped land, or that the potential acquisitions contemplated by any agreements we may enter into in the future will be completed. In addition, acquisitions are subject to various risks and uncertainties and we may be unable to complete an acquisition after making a nonrefundable deposit or incurring acquisition-related costs.  Capital Recycling Program. We continuously evaluate opportunities for the potential disposition of properties and undeveloped land in our portfolio or the formation of strategic ventures with the intent of recycling the proceeds generated into capital used to fund new operating and development acquisitions, to finance development and redevelopment expenditures, to repay long-term debt and for other general corporate purposes. As part of this strategy, we attempt to enter into Section 1031 Exchanges and other tax deferred transaction structures, when possible, to defer some or all of the taxable gains on the sales, if any, for federal and state income tax purposes.  In connection with our capital recycling strategy, during the three months ended March 31, 2017, we completed the sale of one operating property to an unaffiliated third party for gross proceeds of $12.1 million.  Incentive Compensation. Our Executive Compensation Committee determines compensation, including cash bonuses and equity incentives, for our executive officers. For 2017, the annual cash bonus program was structured to allow the Executive Compensation Committee to evaluate a variety of key quantitative and qualitative metrics at the end of the year and make a determination based on the Company's and management's overall performance. Our Executive Compensation Committee also grants equity incentive awards from time to time that include performance-based and/or market-measure based vesting requirements and/or time-based vesting requirements. As a result, accrued incentive compensation and compensation expense for future awards may be affected by our operating and development performance, financial results, stock price, performance against applicable performance-based vesting goals, market conditions, liquidity measures, and other factors. Consequently, we cannot predict the amounts that will be recorded in future periods related to such incentive compensation.  As of March 31, 2017, there was approximately $41.1 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding nonvested shares of restricted common stock and RSUs issued under share-based compensation arrangements. Those costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.1 years. The $41.1 million of unrecognized compensation cost does not reflect the future compensation cost for any potential share-based awards that may be issued. Share-based compensation expense for potential future awards could be affected by our operating and development performance, financial results, stock price, performance against applicable performance-based vesting goals, market conditions and other factors.  Information on Leases Commenced and Executed  Leasing Activity and Changes in Rental Rates. The amount of net rental income generated by our properties depends principally on our ability to maintain the occupancy rates of currently leased space and to lease currently available space, newly developed or redeveloped properties, newly acquired properties with vacant space, and space available from unscheduled lease terminations. The amount of rental income we generate also depends on our ability to maintain or increase rental rates in our submarkets. Negative trends in one or more of these factors could adversely affect our rental income in future periods. The following tables set forth certain information regarding leasing activity for our stabilized portfolio during the three months ended March 31, 2017.  For Leases Commenced (1)   1st & 2nd Generation (2) 2nd Generation (2) Weighted Number of Leases (3) Rentable Square Feet (3) Changes in Average TI/LC per Changes in Cash Rents Retention Lease Term New Renewal New Renewal Sq. Ft. (4) Rents (5)(6) (7) Rates (8) (in months) Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 17 21 128,816 386,980 $ 23.41 30.6 % 19.7 % 54.0 % 46  For Leases Executed (1)(9)   1st & 2nd Generation (2) 2nd Generation (2) Weighted Number of Leases (3) Rentable Square Feet (3) Average TI/LC per Changes in Changes in Lease Term New Renewal New Renewal Sq. Ft. (4) Rents (5)(6) Cash Rents (7) (in months) Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 21 21 256,502 386,980 $ 38.90 28.9 % 15.2 % 57 ________________________  (2) First generation leasing includes space where we have made capital expenditures that result in additional revenue generated when the space is re-leased. Second generation leasing includes space where we have made capital expenditures to maintain the current market revenue stream.  (3) Represents leasing activity for leases that commenced or signed during the period, including first and second generation space, net of month-to-month leases. Excludes leasing on new construction.  (4) Tenant improvements and leasing commissions per square foot exclude tenant-funded tenant improvements.  (5) Calculated as the change between GAAP rents for new/renewed leases and the expiring GAAP rents for the same space. Excludes leases for which the space was vacant longer than one year or vacant when the property was acquired.  (6) Excludes commenced and executed leases of approximately 44,661 and 30,854 square feet, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2017, for which the space was vacant longer than one year or being leased for the first time. Space vacant for more than one year is excluded from our change in rents calculations to provide a meaningful market comparison.  (7) Calculated as the change between stated rents for new/renewed leases and the expiring stated rents for the same space. Excludes leases for which the space was vacant longer than one year or vacant when the property was acquired.  (8) Calculated as the percentage of space either renewed or expanded into by existing tenants or subtenants at lease expiration.  (9) For the three months ended March 31, 2017, 16 leases totaling 236,716 rentable square feet were signed but not commenced as of March 31, 2017.  As of March 31, 2017, we believe that the weighted average cash rental rates for our total stabilized portfolio are approximately 16% below the current average market rental rates, which includes a projection that the weighted average cash rental rates for our  San Diego stabilized portfolio are approximately 8% above current market rental rates. Individual properties within any particular submarket presently may be leased either above, below, or at the current market rates within that submarket, and the average rental rates for individual submarkets may be above, below, or at the average cash rental rate of our portfolio.  Our rental rates and occupancy are impacted by general economic conditions, including the pace of regional economic growth and access to capital. Therefore, we cannot give any assurance that leases will be renewed or that available space will be re-leased at rental rates equal to or above the current market rates. Additionally, decreased demand and other negative trends or unforeseeable events that impair our ability to timely renew or re-lease space could have further negative effects on our future financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.  Scheduled Lease Expirations. The following table sets forth certain information regarding our lease expirations for our stabilized portfolio for the remainder of 2017 and the next five years.  Lease Expirations (1) Number of % of Total Annualized Base Expiring Total % of Total Annualized Base Annualized Base Rent per Sq. Ft. Year of Lease Expiration Leases Square Feet Leased Sq. Ft. Rent (2) Rent (2) (2) (in thousands) Remainder of 2017 75 757,355 5.7 % $ 29,381 5.3 % $ 38.79 2018 83 1,240,669 9.3 % 52,258 9.2 % 42.12 2019 105 1,684,218 12.7 % 61,233 10.9 % 36.36 2020 110 2,061,335 15.5 % 78,858 14.0 % 38.26 2021 85 1,107,331 8.3 % 47,360 8.4 % 42.77 2022 48 558,528 4.2 % 21,740 3.8 % 38.92 Total 506 7,409,436 55.7 % $ 290,830 51.6 % $ 39.25 ________________________  (2) Annualized base rent includes the impact of straight-lining rent escalations and the amortization of free rent periods and excludes the impact of the following: amortization of deferred revenue related tenant-funded tenant improvements, amortization of above/below market rents, amortization for lease incentives due under existing leases and expense reimbursement revenue. Additionally, the underlying leases contain various expense structures including full service gross, modified gross and triple net. Percentages represent percentage of total portfolio annualized contractual base rental revenue. For additional information on tenant improvement and leasing commission costs incurred by the Company for the current reporting period, please see further discussion under the caption "Information on Leases Commenced and Executed."  In addition to the 0.9 million rentable square feet, or 5.9%, of currently available space in our stabilized portfolio, leases representing approximately 5.7% and 9.3% of the occupied square footage of our stabilized portfolio are scheduled to expire during 2017 and 2018, respectively. The leases scheduled to expire during the remainder of 2017 and in 2018 represent approximately 2.0 million rentable square feet or 14.5% of our total annualized base rental revenue. Individual properties within any particular submarket presently may be leased either above, below, or at the current quoted market rates within that . . .

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
