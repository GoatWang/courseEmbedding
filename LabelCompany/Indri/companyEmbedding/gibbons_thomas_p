            RT @GPTW_US: Three cheers @GibbonsPC, ranked #14 in #BestWorkplaces in New York from @FortuneMagazine https://t.co/IQJtJvrcja


10:10 AM - 18 Jul 17














OUR AWARDS





Gibbons has been certified as a great workplace by the independent analysts at Great Place to Work®, based on feedback from its employees.


Gibbons has been ranked among the top “25 Best Medium-Size Companies to Work for in America,” and was the only New Jersey-based company to receive this award. 


In 2009, Gibbons, among others, received the Catalyst Award, which honors exceptional initiatives from companies and firms that support and advance women in business.


Gibbons P.C. was the highest ranking law firm among this year's "Best Places to Work in New Jersey," reaching #14 on this annual list published by NJBIZ.


In July 2017, Gibbons was chosen as one of the Best Small and Medium Workplaces in New York. The firm ranked 14th and was the only law firm chosen for this year's list. Published together with Fortune, The Best Workplaces in New York ranking is based entirely upon feedback from employees at Great Place to Work–Certified™ companies either headquartered or with major locations in New York who completed their Trust Index Employee Survey.


Gibbons was one of only 32 law firms nationwide to earn the WILEF Gold Standard Certification, which is aimed at identifying law firms that include women in top leadership positions.


Gibbons was named to the National Law Journal's inaugural "Midsize Hot List" for innovatively positioning the firm in a crowded market.
