FAQ - Bioverge















































Frequently Asked Questions








Who can invest through Bioverge?

Currently only accredited investors can invest through Bioverge. The SEC
defines an accredited investor as anyone who: earned income that exceeded
$200,000 (or $300,000 together with a spouse) in each of the prior two years,
and reasonably expects the same for the current year, OR has a net worth
over $1 million, either alone or together with a spouse (excluding the value
of the person’s primary residence).


Please refer to the SEC website for additional information here.


While Bioverge is initially only available to accredited investors, we
anticipate offering investment opportunities to all investors (including
non-accredited investors) under
Regulation Crowdfunding
very soon.


We encourage all investors to sign up and complete a profile indicating your areas
of interest in order to keep updated on the latest news from Bioverge.


What is a Bioverge Fund?

A Bioverge Fund is a special purpose entity that is formed for the specific purpose
of investing in a startup.  The purpose of a Bioverge Fund is to allow accredited
investors to invest smaller amounts of capital into an individual startup, thus
enabling investors to build a more diversified portfolio.  We accomplish this by
aggregating accredited investors into a Bioverge Fund, which then makes the investment
into the startup.


Investors do not invest directly in the startup, but rather invest through a Bioverge
Fund.  All Bioverge Funds are managed by Bioverge Funds Management LLC., an except
reporting advisor.


How do I sell my investment?

Investments in a Bioverge Fund are illiquid and cannot be easily sold.  Investors earn a
return when the startup achieves a liquidity event, such as the sale of the company or an IPO.
When this occurs, investors receive their pro-rata share of the returns generated from the
Bioverge Fund.


Investing in startup is risky, and most startups fail, meaning you should be prepared to
lose all of your investment.


How do I earn a return?

The only way to realize a return is when the startup has a liquidity
event, such as an IPO or is acquired.  The Bioverge Fund will then
distribute each investor’s pro rata share of the profits (less the 15%
carry charge by the fund).


What fees do you charge?

We utilize the carried interest business model and charge investors a
15-20% carry on successful exits.


We also charge an administrative fee for the cost of establishing the
investment fund once the minimum threshold for establishing the fund
has been reached. Importantly, this administrative fee can only be
legally used to cover our direct fund costs, not taken as profit. Any
leftover funds are returned to investors.


How do you select which startups to list?

Startups must apply to be listed.  Please refer to the
Learn More page for a detailed
overview of our selection process.


What is Dynamic Diligence?

Our Dynamic Diligence utilizes a decision-analysis model — derived from
the OS Fund — to help determine the risk-adjusted return for novel
science and technology-based investments.  We combine this model with
input from our network of scientific and technical experts, and
professional investors to create a dynamic feedback loop, which we term
'Dynamic Diligence.'


All investment opportunities undergo this process prior to going live on our site.


What is the role of the Investment Committee?

The Investment Committee is tasked with answering the following questions:




Does the third party investment sufficiently serve to validate the
technology?


Do the Dynamic Diligence findings provide sufficient support to
justify an investment (i.e. is the risk / reward profile attractive)?


Are the financial terms proposed by the lead investor reasonable and
potentially attractive to our members (i.e. type of offering, pre-money
valuation, valuation cap, discount, etc.)?


What are the key risks associated with the offering?

The Next Driver of Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock: AI?


						View All Posts
					








You can count on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) to come up with … interesting … ideas. Like drone-delivered packages, Dash buttons for pushbutton ordering of products and the idea it came up with in 2015 to stuff its Alexa digital assistant in a wireless speaker — the Amazon Echo.
Source: Amazon

That Echo smart speaker has taken off in a way that no one predicted and spawned competitors like Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Home.
Now Amazon is cranking up the creative with the Echo Look, a device the company describes as “a hands free camera and style assistant.” And once again, Alexa is inside.
What Is Echo Look?
Amazon has built a wireless camera with a built-in microphone array, a speaker and Alexa integration. Like the Amazon Echo, you can ask Alexa to play music, order toilet paper or control you smart home devices using Skills. Oh, it’s also a camera.
Amazon is positioning it as something that works with your smartphone as a kind of virtual mirror. The command “Alexa, take a picture” snaps a full length photo with background blurred. Amazon says this makes your “outfit pop” and blurring the background makes your photos more shareable (presumably by hiding all your dirty laundry and unmade bed).
You can get a live look at yourself from different angles using the Echo Look app. You can ask Alexa to shoot a video so you can see yourself from every angle. And you can submit photos of yourself to Amazon for AI advice based on input from “fashion specialists.” You can also create a personal “lookbook” in the app, which appears to be a catalog (remember those?) of you modelling all your outfits.
Why Would Anyone Want This?
People who want to be dressed according to the whims of artificial intelligence? People who haven’t figured out mirrors? If you live alone, or don’t trust the fashion sense of the people you do live with, Echo Look promises a second opinion on your outfit choices. Albeit, an option from an AI owned by a company that wants to sell you new clothes.
With the ongoing addition of Skills that integrate it with other services and devices, it’s possible that the the Echo Look could also expand into functionality like a fitness camera (capturing progress photos) or a security camera.
So What Could Go Wrong?
It goes without saying that people will use Echo Look in ways Amazon had not intended. That’s human nature. Put a camera in bedroom that snaps photos or shoots video on voice command, with LED lighting and lenses that blur the background, and it seems inevitable that content shot with Amazon Echo is going to start showing up online.
Of course the elephant in the room is the ongoing privacy concerns about smart speakers. People have been freaked out about Alexa always listening. What if Alexa is also always watching? Amazon told ArsTechnica UK there is a button to physically disable the camera and microphone.
It’s a single button, however, so if you turn off the camera, you also shut down Alexa voice command. So people are going to be tempting to simply leave it on so they can continue to ask Alexa the weather forecast.

	Why Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Is No Safe Haven
Alphabet is a great company, but it's overpriced ... and that won't be tenable when the inevitable market pullback comes

We are very near the end of the current stock market rally. This — and not Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) business model — is the problem with GOOGL stock today.
Source: Travis Wise via Flickr

All the signs are there. People are driving faster, rushing for the last dollar. Money is being thrown at the market, heedless of risk. More important, it is being thrown at what has worked during this recovery, and those values are rising parabolically.
I’ve seen this movie before. I saw it with oil in 1980, with leveraged buyout companies in the late 1980s, with Internet stocks in the 1990s and with real estate during the last decade. Parabolic moves upward are followed by panicky moves down, like a tornado that lifts a house to the sky, then drops it.
At more than $1,000 per share, investors are paying over 32 times earnings for GOOGL stock. Even if Alphabet could maintain its 20% growth rate indefinitely, it would take 20 years to earn that investment back.
Google’s power and growth rate are simply unsustainable. The $9 billion fine being threatened by the European Union would represent 10% of its 2016 revenues. It is regularly accused of evil intent, even when it does things — like blocking annoying ads — that are unquestionably good.
Welcome to Silly Season
Even analysts who regularly pound the table for the stock, like our Bret Kenwell, are starting to have second thoughts.
Kenwell believes Alphabet’s Waymo self-driving car unit alone could be worth $70 billion. I find that hard to fathom in a world where General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) is fighting to hold $50 billion, and one in which Waymo has said it doesn’t know how to mass-produce motor cars.
Even taking that out, he still comes up with a price that’s “foamy.”
While Alphabet has a lot of fingers in interesting pies, it has yet to prove it can capitalize on any of them. Google Home is trailing Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) Echo badly when it comes to home automation, despite a long head start. The same is true with many other products and services, like Google Shopping, its virtual reality efforts and cloud services.
Something seems to happen at GOOGL between the time a new product is cool, and when it’s accepted by the mass market. Either Alphabet gets market share and no profits, or no market share.
Outside the key areas of search and digital advertising, it doesn’t execute well against competitors.
What Could Happen to GOOGL Stock
Most of the trouble with Alphabet stock here is, as Kenwell says, technical. It is far above its moving averages, whether measured by the quarter or the year, but wildly overbought by several readings.
But some of the problems are fundamental.

				Give us your soup, your chili, your deli treats! World Art™ Soup Containers can handle it.  The compostable Ingeo™ lining prevents leaks and nifty color coded sizes help you grab the right container when the lunch line is getting long. When you have had your last bite, these containers can be composted in one easy step. No matter what you put in it, World Art™ Soup Containers are a better alternative to foam.

Available in 8, 12, 16, and 32 oz. sizes (see colors at left)
Made from 100% renewable resources
Lined with  Ingeo™, a plant-based plastic
Not recyclable in most communities - Find out Why
Meet ASTM standards for compostability
World Art™ branding communicates your environmental commitment
 Lids sold separately













Traditional soup cups are lined with petroleum, the world's most 
	valuable, non-renewable resource, making them not compostable or recylable.
Polylactic acid (PLA) or "corn plastic" is made from annually renewable 
	resources, not oil. 
Our PLA products are compostable in commercial compost facilities, but 
	unfortunately not in your home compost.
Compost is a great way to improve vital soil resources and divert waste 
	that would otherwise be landfilled.







					 Sustainability is a journey, and every step of the way we want to make a smaller environmental impression. This footprint shows where our product life cycle stacks up today. Learn More

Traditional plastics are made from petroleum, the world's most valuable, 
	non-renewable resource.
Polylactic acid (PLA) or "corn plastic" is made from annually renewable 
	resources, not oil. 
Composting helps divert waste from landfills.
Compost is a great way to improve vital soil resources and divert waste 
	that would otherwise be landfilled.
Our PLA products are compostable in commercial compost facilities, but 
	unfortunately not in your home compost.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

LLC or Incorporation?

Click here to see our comparison chart




The LegalZoom 3-step process was developed by attorneys from some of the most prestigious law firms in America. There are no complex instructions to follow and nothing to download or print. Simply answer a few questions and get started on
              setting up your corporation.

Here's how it works:

Complete the Incorporation Questionnaire
						Complete our simple questionnaire. With LegalZoom, you can choose to form a new corporation or incorporate an existing business. You can also select provisions to help you guard against personal liability.
We Create and File Your Incorporation Papers
						We create and file the Articles of Incorporation (or, in some states, the "Certificate of Formation" or "Certificate of Incorporation") with the Secretary of State (or in some states, the "Department of State" or "Corporation Commission"). We even create company-specific bylaws and organizational minutes.
Final Wrap-Up
						When we receive your filed Articles of Incorporation back from the state, we send them to you along with the rest of your formation documents, as well as easy instructions regarding next steps.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Corporation FAQ
Find FAQs related to forming a corporation.
















What are the main differences between a C corporation and an S corporation?


C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, one tax at the corporate level on the corporation's net income, and another tax to the shareholders when the profits are distributed. S corporations have only one level of taxation. All of their income is allocated to the shareholders.
However, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility and can shield shareholders from direct tax liability. In addition, S corporations are subject to limitations, such as the number and type of shareholders they can have.
LegalZoom will help you start a C corporation or an S corporation. Get started by answering a few questions about your company, and we will file your paperwork with the Secretary of State.



 





How do I choose a corporate name?


In general, the name of a corporation must end with "incorporated,"
            "corporation" or an abbreviation of one of these. A name will not be accepted
            if it is likely to mislead the public or if it too closely resembles the name
            of another corporation already formed in that state. Many states also
            restrict the use of certain terms in a corporation's name (like bank, police
            or insurance).
LegalZoom allows you to choose up to three alternative names, in order of
            preference. We will conduct a name check before filing to see which names are
            available. Please note that for government purposes the names "ABC, Inc." and
            "A.B.C., Corp." are identical. Therefore, you should disregard spaces, periods
            and the corporate ending when coming up with your three name
            choices.
If the name of your corporation will be used in connection with
            goods or services, you may wish to consider obtaining federal trademark
            protection for the name. This helps ensure that no one else in the U.S. may use
            that name in connection with the same general type of goods or services
            (except in areas where someone else is already using that
            name).



 





Is a corporation required to have a registered agent?


Each corporation must have a registered agent  (some states use the term "resident agent" 
            or "statutory agent," but the concept is the same). This is the person
            designated to receive official state correspondence and notice if the
            corporation is served with a lawsuit. Most states require that the registered agent must be
            either:

(1) an adult living in the state of formation with a street
              address (P.O. boxes are not acceptable) or
(2) a corporation or limited liability company with a business office in the state of formation
              that provides registered agent services.

One of the advantages of forming a corporation or limited liability company in your home state is
            that any officer or director (of a corporation) or manager or member (of an LLC) can act as the registered agent. However, there
            are some advantages to having another person or company act as your
            registered agent. First, this adds an extra layer of privacy, since the
            registered agent's name and address are publicly available. Second, this
            helps limit the risk that if your corporation or LLC is named as a defendant in a lawsuit, no one will surprise
            you at home on a Sunday night with court papers.



 





How much will it cost to form and run a corporation?


Each state charges an annual fee to maintain a corporation. In many
            states, you must also submit an "annual report" or "list of directors and
            officers," which is a one-page form sent by the state. Some states also have
            state taxes.



 





What are the advantages of incorporating in Delaware?


The advantages of incorporating in Delaware according to the Delaware Secretary of State: 
More than half a million business entities have their legal home in Delaware. This includes more than half of all U.S. publicly-traded and Fortune 500 companies. Businesses choose Delaware for its complete incorporation services package, which includes modern and flexible corporate laws, the highly-respected Delaware Courts, a business-friendly state government and the customer service oriented staff of the Delaware Division of Corporations. 



 





What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?


An LLC has more operating flexibility and fewer
            corporate formalities than an S corporation. For example, an S corporation
            cannot have more than 100 stockholders and must hold both periodic director's
            meetings and an annual meeting of stockholders. However, owners of an S
            corporation may be subject to fewer taxes than LLC owners.
            For more information, please see "Differences
            Between a Corporation and a Limited Liability Company (LLC)" from the main
            guide.


 





Do I need an attorney to form a corporation?

            prepare the legal paperwork and file it yourself, or use a legal
            documentation service such as LegalZoom.

What is the procedure for forming a corporation, and what legal documents are required?


To create a corporation, you must file a document called the "articles of incorporation" 
            with the Secretary of State or other appropriate state agency. Next,
            bylaws and organizing resolutions must be adopted. A corporation will also
            need to apply for a tax identification number with the IRS.
Unlike many other incorporation services which only
            create and file the articles of incorporation, LegalZoom can 
            complete all of these required documents for you, including personalized bylaws
            and organizational resolutions.

What are the naming conventions for professional corporations?


Have you ever noticed the initials "P.C." or "P.A." after a company's
            name? These initials indicate the company is a professional corporation ("P.C.") 
            or a professional association ("P.A."). State law dictates what is required in the 
            name, and those requirements differ by state.



 





What is a professional corporation?


Professional corporations (PC) are corporations that provide
            professional services. State law and the regulating board determine what
            constitutes professional services and when you are required to be a
            professional corporation. This varies from state to
            state.



 





Can I be the only shareholder in my corporation?


Yes, a corporation can be formed with only one shareholder.
            However, corporate formalities, such as director and shareholder meetings,
            are still required in order to preserve the corporate form and prevent the
            shareholder from personal liability.



 





What is a corporation?



            A corporation is a distinct legal entity created under state laws which can
            open a bank account, purchase property, enter into contracts and operate a
            business. One of the most important features of a corporation is that,
            generally, its owners are not personally liable for the debts of the
            corporation.


 





When is a corporation considered a professional corporation?


The definition of "professionals" can vary from state to state, but typically includes professions that require a license, such as doctors, chiropractors, lawyers, dentists, accountants, architects or engineers. Depending on the state where you incorporate, the following activities may be classified as professional services. 
Accounting and financial services 
Architectural services
Legal services
Medical services



 





Where should I incorporate?


A corporation can incorporate in any of the 50 states, plus the
            District of Columbia. Many people choose to incorporate in their home
            state, which can save money in filing fees. That is because corporations are
            required to register in each state where they do business. For example, a
            Delaware corporation that has its main business office in Arkansas must
            register as a "foreign corporation" with the Arkansas Secretary of
            State and must pay applicable fees and taxes to both Delaware and Arkansas. Delaware is popular
            because of its history, experience and pro-business climate. Nevada is also
            popular because of its pro-business environment and lack of a formal
            information-sharing agreement with the IRS. Please read the next two FAQs for
            more specifics on each state.



 





Who can form a corporation?


Generally, anyone who completes the articles of incorporation and pays the
            state filing fee can form a corporation. There are usually no residency or
            other legal requirements. However, many states require that an individual forming 
            a corporation must be at least 18 years old.
