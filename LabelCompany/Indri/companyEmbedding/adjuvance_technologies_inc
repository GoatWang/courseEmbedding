Location:ny, USSpeaker:Jeffrey GardnerTitle:CEO & Co-FounderPrimary Industry:Biotech & MedicalExecutive Summary:Adjuvance Technologies is a private biopharmaceutical company dedicated to empowering global health through fundamental breakthroughs in adjuvant design. Adjuvants improve the efficacy, dose-sparing and immunopotentiation of otherwise inactive antigens and as important as adjuvants are, there are currently only two approved for use by the FDA. Adjuvance is commercializing synthetic methods of producing the world’s leading adjuvant molecule QS-21, which is extremely difficult to procure through other methods. Adjuvance is developing a portfolio of novel vaccine adjuvants using its proprietary Triterpene Saponin Synthesis Technology (TriSST). TriSST is a novel tool that allows us to synthesize a natural product that is the world’s leading vaccine adjuvant candidate (QS-21), which is extremely difficult to procure through either direct purchase or extraction/purification procedures.  For the first time, TriSST provides a commercially viable source of QS-21 that is capable of large scale synthesis of pure materials for human use.
Adjuvance’s operations are devoted to the commercial development of its leading adjuvant Saponex™(synthetic QS-21).  The development of production processes for scalable manufacturing of SQS-21 has been completed, although full scale implementation has not yet taken place. Our TriSST-derived QS-21 is currently in a PhII clinical trial for melanoma cancer and entering PhII for prostate cancer(MSKCC).Venture is:A-Round

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.
