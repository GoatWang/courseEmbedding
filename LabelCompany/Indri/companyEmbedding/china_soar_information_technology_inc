The above figures represent only estimated costs for the next 24 months. If
necessary, Mu Chun Lin, our CEO and Director, has verbally agreed to loan the
company funds to complete the registration process. Also, these loans would be
necessary if the proceeds from this offering will not be sufficient to implement
our business plan and maintain reporting status and quotation on the OTC
MarketPlace or OTCBB when/if our common stock becomes eligible for trading on
the OTC MarketPlace and or OTCBB. Mu Chun Lin, our director will not be repaid
from the proceeds of this offering by the Company. There is no due date for the
repayment of the funds advanced by Mu Chun Lin. Mu Chun Lin will be repaid from
revenues of operations if and when we generate revenues to pay the obligation.


We compete in the advertising technology and mobile marketing business and in 
all other facets of our business against small, medium and large companies 
throughout the United States. Although we can give no assurance that our 
business will be able to compete against other companies with greater resources,
we believe we have a competitive advantage with our software application. We 
plan on developing our mobile website technology in North America. We believe 
this will give us the ability to compete with these other companies because we 
can provide vendors with almost instant mobile advertising campaigns due to our 
mobile integrated high bandwith technology.


Company Description
We currently own intellectual property to utilize, market, further develop and
sell in North America a software application called (“MIMA”) to entrepreneurs
and small businesses whereas any merchant can easily create a WEB/WAP e-commerce
website or cell phone client and enterprise mobile management


 information system
by themselves. Merchants will not have to rent network hardware operation
system, entrust software development and recruit professional management.
Instead, we can offer the required network infrastructure and software and
hardware platform for the merchant with a low monthly fee. MIMA was created and
developed by our director, Mu Chun Lin over the course of ten years.

Our Licensee

Zhengzhou Xiangtian Information Technology Company Limited was established by
our director Mu Chun Lin in December, 2005. Since inception, the Company has
been concentrated on the research and development of software and hardware in
the mobile internet industry and has achieved many technology achievements in
the application field of big data. Over the five years, the Company has built an
efficient project team, integrated mobile internet technology and self-developed
mobile internet application platform; developing several products types and
conducts users’ test. China’s Central Government is giving supporting policy to
“Internet Plus” Industries which will allow ZXITC to develop their products to
provide mobile internet communication application system to users for the rapid
development of mobile internet application in China.

In 2012, ZXITC had the advantage to work with China’s internet network
information center, (CNNIC), the Issuer of internet content provider (ICP) of
all the websites hosted in China on mobile URL, General URL and Trusted URL to
integrate with their mobile Internet cloud application system . The joint
development will expedite the construction of CNNIC public supporting service
system with 10% of the original cost. Subsequently, the Company began to develop
a website which allow their users to create and manage their own mobile
application with minimal technical knowledge. The website developed exclusively
for the Chinese market, is named “MOYUN”. Currently, MOYUN Internet Mobile
Application (MIMA) cloud platform is the most comprehensive cloud infrastructure
in the China’s Corporate Mobile Application systems. Since the free public test
inception at January, 2012, MIMA has been one of the Chinese leading
cross-platform mobile application developing tools. We believe that the market
in North America is ripe for such an application notwithstanding that we will
have to make definitive changes to utilize and maximize the mobile application
system in North America.

ZXITC is the first company to utilize a “Drag and Drop” design interface for the
Mobile Application development in order to provide a user friendly interface.
The system reduces the cost of mobile application development, compatibility
issues and other technical complication so that users can focus more on the
product interface and business profile design.

The company is equipped with high performance server group and large bandwidth
network to facilitate a stable and speedy access for their clients, so that they
can enjoy an internet vendor class infrastructure through subscribing their
services. The cloud system is implemented at a software as a service level,
(SaaS) whereas users can minimize their cost of establishing as e-commerce and
for mobile application deployment.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2016, found in this report. In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Where possible, we have tried to identify these forward looking statements by using words such as "anticipate," "believe," "intends," or similar expressions. Our actual results could differ materially  from those anticipated by the forward-looking statements due to important factors and risks including, but not limited to, those set forth under "Risk Factors" as described in in Part I, Item 1A of this report.  Our cash balance is $159 as of July 31, 2016. Our cash balance is not sufficient to fund our limited levels of operations for any period of time. We have been utilizing and may utilize funds from Mu Chun Lin, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Director, who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for offering costs, filing fees, and professional fees. Mu Chun Lin, however, has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company. In order to implement our plan of operations for the next twelve-month period, we require a minimum of $750,000 of funding. Therefore, we have filed an S-1 registration on September 3, 2015. Being a startup stage company, we have a very limited operating history. After a twelve-month period we may need additional financing but currently do not have any arrangements for such financing.  Long term financing beyond the maximum aggregate amount of this offering will be required to fully implement our business plan. The exact amount of funding will depend on funding required for full implementation of our business plan. Our expansion may include expanding our office facilities, hiring sales personnel and developing a customer base.  If we do not receive any proceeds from the offering or the minimum amount of $750,000 that we require to operate for the next 12 months Mu Chun Lin has informally agreed to advance us funds, however, he has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company.  If we need additional cash and cannot raise it, we will either have to suspend operations until we do raise the cash we need, or cease operations entirely. Even if we raise $750,000 from this offering, it will most likely only last one year. We may need more funds for business operations in the next year, and we will have to revert to obtaining additional money.  Company Overview  Corporate History  China Soar Information Technology, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("the Company") fka Go Public II, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on July 22, 2013. We changed our name from Go Public II, Inc. to China Soar Information Technology with the Delaware Secretary of State on June 16, 2015.  On May 26, 2015, our former director, Thomas DeNunzio resigned and Mu Chun Lin was appointed as our sole President, CEO, CFO and Director.  Business Information  Introduction  We currently own intellectual property to utilize, market, further develop and sell in North America a software application called ("MIMA") to entrepreneurs and small businesses whereas any merchant can easily create a WEB/WAP e-commerce website or cell phone client and enterprise mobile management information system by themselves. Merchants will not have to rent network hardware operation system, entrust software development and recruit professional management. Instead, we can offer the required network infrastructure and software and hardware platform for the merchant with a low monthly fee. MIMA was created and developed by our director, Mu Chun Lin over the course of ten years.  OUR LICENSEE  Zhengzhou Xiangtian Information Technology Company Limited was established by our director Mu Chun Lin in December, 2005. Since inception, the Company has been concentrated on the research and development of software and hardware in the mobile internet industry and has achieved many technology achievements in the application field of big data. Over the five years, the Company has built an efficient project team, integrated mobile internet technology and self-developed mobile internet application platform; developing several products types and conducts  users' test . China's Central Government is giving supporting policy to "Internet Plus" Industries which will allow ZXITC to develop their products to provide mobile internet communication application system to users for the rapid development of mobile internet application in China.  In 2012, ZXITC had the advantage to work with China's internet network information center, (CNNIC), the Issuer of internet content provider (ICP) of all the websites hosted in China on mobile URL, General URL and Trusted URL to integrate with their mobile Internet cloud application system. The joint development will expedite the construction of CNNIC public supporting service system with 10% of the original cost. Subsequently, the Company began to develop a website which allows their users to create and manage their own mobile application with minimal technical knowledge. The website developed exclusively for the Chinese market, is named "MOYUN". Currently, MOYUN Internet Mobile Application (MIMA) cloud platform is the most comprehensive cloud infrastructure in the China's Corporate Mobile Application systems. Since the free public test inception at January, 2012, MIMA has been one of the Chinese leading cross-platform mobile application developing tools. We believe that the market in North America is ripe for such an application notwithstanding that we will have to make definitive changes to utilize and maximize the mobile application system in North America.  ZXITC is the first company to utilize a "Drag and Drop" design interface for the Mobile Application development in order to provide a user friendly interface. The system reduces the cost of mobile application development, compatibility issues and other technical complication so that users can focus more on the product interface and business profile design.  The company is equipped with high performance server group and large bandwidth network to facilitate a stable and speedy access for their clients, so that they can enjoy an internet vendor class infrastructure through subscribing their services. The cloud system is implemented at software as a service level, (SaaS) whereas users can minimize their cost of establishing as e-commerce and for mobile application deployment.  PRODUCTS AND PROJECTS  The functions and features of MIMA (including services in-operation and not in- operation)  1. Mobile website - for Corporate Mobile website, including contents management, and design interface.  2. Mobile client application (APP) development - content management and design interface.  3. Internet website - content management and design interface.  4. Business Mobile integrated information system(Customized) - develops comprehensive mobile system with Attendance, ERP, CRM functions with highly flexible design features to meet majority SME's information technology demands.  PLAN OF OPERATIONS  We plan to operate as a business to consumer, (B2C) to provide services to retailers that enable them to access, build, change, monitor and manage their e-commerce website from the convenience of their mobile telephone. We will have a full range of services and resources to work with customers towards achieving our customers' mobile website and marketing goals. We will provide access to our services that are intended to be tailored to each customers' marketing and website needs. We are not currently in any discussions with businesses or individuals but we do plan on it in order to maximize our business potential and distribution reach. No assurances can be provided that any agreement will be reached. We believe we are in a unique position to capitalize on the North American, European, South American market and gain a first move advantage to deliver a transparent and customer focused mobile marketing solution. Our primary focus will be small, middle and large businesses as well as individuals within North America. There are approximately 469.58 (according to Google) million people in North America, which makes it one of the most populous continents in the world and this represents our initial target market. We  plan to offer mobile website and marketing solutions for a monthly fee to customers in North America. At the initial stages of our business plan all of our customers will have access to the standard MIMA features, including, free mobile-optimized templates, Premium industry-specific templates, Premium customized templates, Free web address(domain name), Premium customized web address(domain name), SEO-friendly domain name suggestions, instant, easy search engine optimization, (SEO), Social apps, reach your audience instantly ability, with all features having the ability to build, promote and market a customer's website either online or from the convenience of your mobile phone or tablet, free software upgrades. In addition, we will also offer as standard MIMA features, add maps and directions, daily deals promotion, add photos and videos instantly, secure cloud storage, automatic data back-up, analytics and reports, mobile editing and updating, fast loading pages, E-commerce tools, easy-to-use dashboard, and click to call. A material challenge to our business operations will be getting enough customers. In order to achieve this goal we will have to create incentives through advertising and other marketing venues, also, through a referral program for our customers to inform others of our services. We will encourage customers to share news about their services through email, Facebook, and Twitter, and other social media websites. If we are unable to attract customers it may have a material impact on our revenues or income or may result in our liquidity decreasing.  INDUSTRY OVERVIEW  This Form 10-K includes market and industry data that we have developed from publicly available information; various industry publications and other published industry sources and our internal data and estimates. Although we believe the publications and reports are reliable, we have not independently verified the data. Our internal data, estimates and forecasts are based upon information obtained from trade and business organizations and other contacts in the market in which we operate and our management's understanding of industry conditions.  As of the date of the preparation of this Prospectus, these and other independent government and trade publications cited herein are publicly available on the Internet without charge. Upon request, the Company will also provide copies of such sources cited herein.  THE MOBILE MARKETING INDUSTRY  Overview  Management contends that some perceive mobile advertising as closely related to online or internet advertising, though we believe its reach is far greater - currently, most mobile advertising is targeted at mobile phones, that came estimably to a global total of 6.9 billion as of 2014 (Source:  It is probable, in our management's opinion, that advertisers and media industry will increasingly take account of a bigger and fast-growing mobile market, though it remains at around 2.7% of global advertising spending and is estimated to increase to 7.6% by 2016 (source:statisa.com). Mobile media is evolving rapidly, and while we believe mobile phones will continue to be the mainstay, it is not clear whether mobile phones based on cellular backhaul, or smart phones based on WiFi hot spot, or WiMAX hot zone, will also strengthen. However, as an illustration of the emergence of this form of advertising, that there is now a dedicated global advertising awards ceremony organized every year by Vision gain , a business information portal.  In information provided by the research firm Berg Insight, as mobile phones out number Television sets by over 3 to 1, and PC based internet users by over 4 to 1, and the total laptop and desktop PC population by nearly 5 to 1, advertisers in many markets, we contend, have recently rushed to this media. In Spain 75% of mobile phone owners receive ads, in France 62% and in Japan 54%.More remarkably as mobile advertising matures, like in the most advanced markets, the user involvement also matures. In Japan today, already 44% of mobile phone owners click on ads they receive on their phones. Mobile advertising was worth 900 million dollars in Japan alone. According to the research firm Berg Insight, the global mobile advertising market that was estimated to ? 1 billion in 2008 Furthermore, Berg Insight forecasts the global mobile advertising market to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 43 percent to ? 8.7 billion in 2014.  In the Q2 2013 "State of Mobile Advertising Report" by Opera Mediaworks, it is reported that mobile advertising is growing globally at a rapid rate. Opera Mediaworks reports that rich media ads are now averaging a 1.53 percentage click rate among users. App large banner ads are still the most popular, but they are on the decline.  In China, A study by iResearch finds no indication of a slowdown in mobile growth as mobile devices become more popular and e-retailers invest in making mobile sites easier to use.  Chinese consumers spent 929.71 billion yuan ($148.16 billion) on shopping from their smartphones and tablets in 2014, up 239% from 274.00 billion yuan ($43.66 billion) in 2013, according to Chinese research firm iResearch.  That is a significant leap in one year for mobile shopping, given that online shopping grew only 49.8% to 2.814 trillion yuan ($448.47 billion) in China in 2014, according to iResearch, a Beijing-based firm that tracks e-commerce. IResearch attributes the uptick in mobile shopping mainly to the growing popularity of mobile devices and leading e-retailers' investments in better serving mobile shoppers.  Mobile commerce seems likely to keep growing: iResearch forecasts mobile shopping will grow more than fourfold to 4.504 trillion yuan ($717. 75 billion) in sales in 2018.  Purchases on mobile devices accounted for 33% of online sales in China in 2014, compared with 14.5% in the prior year, according to iResearch.  The Chinese research company also predicts that mobile sales will surpass sales on personal computers in 2016 and reach 61.7% of online sales in 2018.  Using a mobile phone to browse the internet in China has considerably taken off towards the end of 2012, with an ever increasing amount of the public deciding to choose their mobile phones to browse the internet rather than traditionally sitting in front of a desktop. The mobile internet now is the biggest new growth engine for e-commerce in China. Online shopping is booming because of its convenience and cost effectiveness. And it's not only young affluent urban dwellers who are purchasing luxury items online at cheaper prices than shopping malls rather residents in less developed regions are buying products that are not available in their home towns as noted in the Wall Street Journal on August 31, 2015.  Some interesting statistics according to China's internet network information center, ("CNNIC"), the Issuer of internet content provider (ICP) of all the websites hosted in China on mobile URL, General URL and Trusted URL to integrate with their mobile Internet cloud application system.   At the end of 2012 there were 564 million internet users in China which calculates as 42.1% of the total population   Out of 564 million internet users, 420 million decides to use their mobile to surf the internet which accounts for 74.5% of the total internet browsing population   The level of mobile browsing in China has become significantly higher than in the West.  The stats indicate the significance of mobile internet browsing in China. Therefore, in order for a company to have a significant brand image standing in the competitive Chinese market, a well- designed mobile website is what a company should be looking to build.  About three-quarters of Chinese in first-tier cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chongqing are already online, but in rural areas it's 19 percent, according to a survey by McKinsey Digital of Hong Kong, which helps companies shape their digital strategies. Even so, rural Chinese have an affinity for e-commerce. Close to two-thirds of rural Chinese who do use the Internet say they have purchased items online; that compares with 72 percent of users in the cities.  Types of Mobile Ads  In some markets, this type of advertising is most commonly seen as a Mobile Web Banner (top of page) or Mobile Web Poster (bottom of page banner), while in others, it is dominated by SMS advertising Other forms include MMS advertising, advertising within mobile games and mobile videos, during mobile TV receipt, full-screen interstitials,  which appear while a requested item of mobile content or mobile web page is loading up, and audio advertisements that can take the form of a jingle before a voicemail recording, or an audio recording played while interacting with a telephone-based service such as movie ticketing or directory assistance.  The Mobile Marketing Association and the IAB (Interactive Advertising Bureau) has published mobile advertising guidelines, but we contend that it is difficult to keep such guidelines current in such a fast-developing area.  The effectiveness of a mobile media ad campaign, in our estimation, can be measured in a variety of ways. The main measurements are impressions (views) and click-through rates  They are also sold to advertisers by views (Cost Per Impression) or by click-through (Cost Per Click). Additional measurements include conversion rates, such as click-to-call rates and other degrees of interactive measurement.  Mobile media can run on a mobile web page or within a mobile application, often referred to as in-App.  One of the popular models in mobile advertising, in our estimation, is Cost Per Install (CPI) where there the pricing model is based on the user installing an App on their mobile phone. CPI Mobile Advertising Networks work either as incent or non-incent. In the incent model the user is given virtual points or rewards to install the game or App.  Mobile Rich Media  In addition to standard mobile display banners, our management has observed a growing trend to include rich media execution within the banner ads. This includes banners that would expand to a larger size, offering advertisers a larger display to communicate their message. Games within the banner to make the experience more interactive or a video within the banner space.  There are limitations to rich media on mobile because all of the coding must be done in HTML5, since the iOS does not support flash.  COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE  Customer Website creation  Website creation is a competitively open market focus on design level, the degree of grasping customers' requirements and service ability. We have significant competitive advantages among other providers. Whereas our website system mainly includes WAP/WEB and SaaS.  FUTURE DEVELOPMENT AND PLANS  As part of our development plan to face the ever challenging mobile B2C software market in North America, Europe and South America, we plan to further develop a MIMA Professional version of its enterprise application and constantly perfect core technology to form a comprehensive service for basic informatization application of businesses. Through constant evaluation of end user's requirements, we plan to focus on development of a leading cloud operation platform for mobile internet enterprise website which will gradually attract an increasing number of users. We also plan to establish a cloud operation platform which fully covers smart mobile client by strengthening the cooperation with application products provider, content service provider, E-commerce hosting provider and Wireless network address licensors.  Recent Developments:  We filed an S-1/A registration statement on October 14, 2015. The registration was deemed effective as of December 9, 2015.  Critical Accounting Policies  We prepare our financial statements in conformity with GAAP, which requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions and apply judgments. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be important at the time the financial statements are prepared and actual results could differ from our estimates and such differences could be material. We have identified below the critical accounting policies which are assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain and that are of critical importance in the presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. On a regular basis, we review our accounting policies and how they are applied and disclosed in our financial statements.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. Estimates are based on historical experience, management expectations for future performance, and other assumptions as appropriate. Key areas affected by estimates include the assessment of the recoverability of long-lived assets, which is based on such factors as estimated future cash flows. We re-evaluate estimates on an ongoing basis; therefore, actual results may vary from those estimates.  Fair Values of Financial Instruments  The carrying values of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate the fair values of these instruments due to their short-term nature. The carrying amount for borrowings under the financing agreement approximates fair value because of the variable market interest rates charged for these borrowings.  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  There are no off balance sheet arrangements.  Capital Resources.  We had no material commitments for capital expenditures as of July 31, 2016 and 2015.  Results of Operations for the years ended July 31, 2016 and 2015  For the fiscal year ended July 31, 2016 as compared to the fiscal year ended July 31, 2015, total revenues were $0 and $0, respectively; and net losses were $64,811 and $19,358 respectively. The net losses were attributable to operating expenses. The operating expenses for the year ended July 31, 2016 included, but were not limited to, professional, audit and bank fees. The operating expenses for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2015 included, but were not limited to, professional and audit fees.  Liquidity  As of July 31, 2016 and 2015 we had cash and cash equivalents of $159 and $0, respectively, and had working capital deficits of $9,262 and $0, respectively.  As of July 31, 2016 and 2015, we had zero cash used in and provided by investing activities.  As of July 31, 2016 and 2015, we had $7,958 and $5,500 cash provided by financing activities.

PART
I

 


Item 1.
Business.

 

China Soar
Information Technology, Inc. fka Go Public II, Inc. (the
“Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the State
of Delaware on July 22, 2013 as a Form 10 blank check shell company
with an objective to acquire, or merge with, an operating business.
On August 24, 2015 the Company completed a transaction (the
“Transaction”) in the form of a software license and
royalty agreement, (the “License” or the “License
Agreement”) with a foreign company organized under the laws
of the Peoples Republic of China, known as “Zhengzhou
Xiangtian Information Technology Company Limited,” ("ZXITC").
The president of ZXITC is our sole director, Mu Chun Lin. The
License Agreement allows us to receive a revenue stream equal to
45% of the gross revenue of ZXITC in exchange for licensing our
intellectual property which is a mobile phone internet marketing
application program that we purchased from our CEO.

 

Therefore
we have ceased to be a blank check shell company and have adopted a
new business plan to provide mobile phone internet marketing
services to business owners in China and Hong Kong. We plan on
offering similar services in the U.S, Europe and South America. On
May 26, 2015, Mu Chun Lin was appointed as sole Officer and sole
Director of China Soar Information Technology, Inc., making Mu Chun
Lin a related party as he is also the president and CEO of
Zhengzhou Xiangtian Information Technology Company.

 

The
License includes the right to enter into certain agreements and use
our intellectual property. The Company did not acquire any plant
and equipment, and any other business and operational assets of
ZXITC as part of the License, and the Company did not hire any
employees of ZXITC except for Mu Chun Lin. ZXITC will continue as
an independent company, operating in the Peoples Republic of China
after the Transaction. The License relates to the development and
operation of an Internet and Mobile Marketing Platform in China and
Hong Kong. ZXITC plans to utilize the License to provide unique
online and mobile marketing services in China and Hong Kong. Our
principal executive offices are located at 12 Harcourt Road, Bank
of America Tower, Suite 1308, Central, Hong Kong.

 

Our
activities have been limited to developing our business and
financial plans. We will not have the necessary capital to develop
or execute our business plan until we are able to secure financing.
On June 6, 2015, the Company determined that it was
in the best interests of the Company to issue
20,000,000 shares of common stock with a
par value of $ .0001 to Mu Chun Lin, our sole officer and
director as compensation for services rendered including but not
limited to furthering the Company’s business plan. On June
12, 2015, the Company determined that it
was in the best interests of the Company to offer
for sale 55,000,000 shares of its
restricted common stock with a par value of $.0001
to be used for general corporate purposes as determined by our sole
officer and director, Mu Chun Lin. Proxy Management Consultants LTD
of Hong Kong acted as the Company’s escrow agent. The
foregoing shares were sold pursuant to Regulation S of the Act. We
believe we need to raise $750,000 to execute our business plan over
the next 12 months.

 

In their
audit report dated November 15, 2016, our auditor has expressed an
opinion that substantial doubt exists as to whether we can continue
as an ongoing business. Because our President, Chief Executive
Officer and sole Director Mu Chun Lin may be unwilling or unable to
loan or advance any additional capital to us, we believe that if we
do not raise additional capital within 12 months of the effective
date of this registration statement, we may be required to suspend
or cease the implementation of our business plan.

Item 1A.
Risk Factors.

Risks
Relating to the Company’s Securities

 

We may
never have a public market for our common stock or may never trade
on a recognized exchange. Therefore, you may be unable to liquidate
your investment in our stock.

 

There is
no established public trading market for our securities. Our shares
are not and have not been listed or quoted on any exchange or
quotation system.

 

In order
for our shares to be quoted, a market maker must agree to file the
necessary documents with FINRA. In addition, it is possible that
such application for quotation may not be approved and even if
approved it is possible that a regular trading market will not
develop or that if it did develop, will be sustained. In the
absence of a trading market, an investor may be unable to liquidate
their investment.

 

We may in
the future issue additional shares of our common stock, which may
have a dilutive effect on our stockholders.

 

Our
Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of 500,000,000
shares of common stock, of which 75,000,000 shares are issued and
outstanding as of October 31, 2015. The future issuance of our
common shares may result in substantial dilution in the percentage
of our common shares held by our then existing stockholders. We may
value any common stock issued in the future on an arbitrary basis.
The issuance of common stock for future services or acquisitions or
other corporate actions may have the effect of diluting the value
of the shares held by our investors, and might have an adverse
effect on any trading market for our common stock.

 

We may
issue shares of preferred stock in the future that may adversely
impact your rights as holders of our common stock.

 

Our
Certificate of Incorporation authorizes us to issue up to
20,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Accordingly, our board of
directors will have the authority to fix and determine the relative
rights and preferences of preferred shares, as well as the
authority to issue such shares, without further stockholder
approval.

 

Our
preferred stock does not have any dividend, conversion,
liquidation, or other rights or preferences, including redemption
or sinking fund provisions. However, our board of directors could
authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would
grant to holders preferred rights to our assets upon liquidation,
the right to receive dividends before dividends are declared to
holders of our common stock, and the right to the redemption of
such preferred shares, together with a premium, prior to the
redemption of the common stock. To the extent that we do issue such
additional shares of preferred stock, your rights as holders of
common stock could be impaired thereby, including, without
limitation, dilution of your ownership interests in us. In
addition, shares of preferred stock could be issued with terms
calculated to delay or prevent a change in control or make removal
of management more difficult, which may not be in your interest as
holders of common stock.

 

We do not
currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock and
consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment
will depend on appreciation in the price of our common
stock.

 

We have
never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and
do not currently intend to do so for the foreseeable future. We
currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our
growth. Therefore, you are not likely to receive any dividends on
your common stock for the foreseeable future and the success of an
investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon any
future appreciation in its value. There is no guarantee that shares
of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the
price at which our stockholders have purchased their
shares.

Item 1B.
Unresolved Staff Comments.

 

None.

 


Item 2.
Properties.

 

We neither
rent nor own any properties. Until we pursue a viable business
opportunity and recognize income, we will not seek office space. We
currently have no policy with respect to investments or interests
in real estate, real estate mortgages or securities of, or
interests in, persons primarily engaged in real estate
activities.

  


Item 3.
Legal Proceedings.

 

From time
to time, we may become party to litigation or other legal
proceedings that we consider to be a part of the ordinary course of
our business. We are not currently involved in legal proceedings
that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect
on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of
operations. We may become involved in material legal proceedings in
the future.

  


Item 4.
Mine Safety Disclosures.

 

Not
applicable.

 


PART
II

 


Item 5.
Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder
Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.

 

Market
Information

 

ADMISSION
TO QUOTATION ON THE OTC BULLETIN BOARD

 

We intend
to have our common stock be quoted on the OTCQB operated by OTC
Markets Group, Inc. and or Over the Counter Bulletin Board,
“OTCBB”. There is no assurance that the shares will
ever be quoted on the OTCQB or OTCBB.  To be quoted on the
OTCQB or OTCBB, a market maker must apply to make a market in our
common stock. If our securities are not quoted on the OTC Bulletin
Board, a security holder may find it more difficult to dispose of,
or to obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our
securities. The OTCQB and OTC Bulletin Board differs from national
and regional stock exchanges in that it:

 

(1) is not
situated in a single location but operates through communication of
bids, offers and confirmations between broker-dealers, and (2)
securities admitted to quotation are offered by one or more
Broker-dealers rather than the “specialist” common to
stock exchanges.

 

To qualify
for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board, an equity security must
have one registered broker-dealer, known as the market maker,
willing to list bid or sale quotations and to sponsor the company
listing. We do not yet have an agreement with a registered
broker-dealer, as the market maker, willing to list bid or sale
quotations and to sponsor the Company listing. If the Company meets
the qualifications for trading securities on the OTC Bulletin Board
our securities will trade on the OTC Bulletin Board until a future
time, if at all. We may not now and it may never qualify for
quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board.

  

Holders

 

As of
November 15, 2016, there were approximately 41 shareholders of
record of our common stock and 75,000,000  
shares of
common stock deemed outstanding.

 

Dividends
and Share Repurchases

 

We have
not paid any dividends to our shareholder.  There are no
restrictions which would limit our ability to pay dividends on
common equity or that are likely to do so in the future.

 

Issuer
Purchases of Equity Securities

 

None.

 

Equity
Compensation Plan Information

Item 6.
Selected Financial Data.

 

Not
applicable because the Company is a smaller reporting
company.

 


Item 7.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations.

 

The
following discussion of our financial condition and results of
operations should be read in conjunction with the audited financial
statements and notes thereto for the fiscal year ended July 31,
2016, found in this report. In addition to historical information,
the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that
involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Where possible, we
have tried to identify these forward looking statements by using
words such as “anticipate,” “believe,”
“intends,” or similar expressions. Our actual results
could differ materially

from those
anticipated by the forward-looking statements due to important
factors and risks including, but not limited to, those set forth
under “Risk Factors” as described in in Part I, Item 1A
of this report.

 

Our cash
balance is $159 as of July 31, 2016. Our cash balance is not
sufficient to fund our limited levels of operations for any period
of time. We have been utilizing and may utilize funds from Mu Chun
Lin, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Director, who has
informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for offering
costs, filing fees, and professional fees. Mu Chun Lin, however,
has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to
advance or loan funds to the company. In order to implement our
plan of operations for the next twelve-month period, we require a
minimum of $750,000 of funding. Therefore, we have filed an S-1
registration on September 3, 2015. Being a startup stage company,
we have a very limited operating history. After a twelve-month
period we may need additional financing but currently do not have
any arrangements for such financing.

 

Long term
financing beyond the maximum aggregate amount of this offering will
be required to fully implement our business plan. The exact amount
of funding will depend on funding required for full implementation
of our business plan. Our expansion may include expanding our
office facilities, hiring sales personnel and developing a customer
base.

 

If we do
not receive any proceeds from the offering or the minimum amount of
$750,000 that we require to operate for the next 12 months Mu Chun
Lin has informally agreed to advance us funds, however, he has no
formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or
loan funds to the company.

 

If we need
additional cash and cannot raise it, we will either have to suspend
operations until we do raise the cash we need, or cease operations
entirely. Even if we raise $750,000 from this offering, it will
most likely only last one year. We may need more funds for business
operations in the next year, and we will have to revert to
obtaining additional money.

Business
Information


Introduction


 


We currently own intellectual property to utilize, market, further
develop and sell in North America a software application called
(“MIMA”) to entrepreneurs and small businesses whereas
any merchant can easily create a WEB/WAP e-commerce website or cell
phone client and enterprise mobile management information system by
themselves. Merchants will not have to rent network hardware
operation system, entrust software development and recruit
professional management. Instead, we can offer the required network
infrastructure and software and hardware platform for the merchant
with a low monthly fee. MIMA was created and developed by our
director, Mu Chun Lin over the course of ten years.


 


OUR LICENSEE


 


Zhengzhou Xiangtian Information Technology Company Limited was
established by our director Mu Chun Lin in December, 2005. Since
inception, the Company has been concentrated on the research and
development of software and hardware in the mobile internet
industry and has achieved many technology achievements in the
application field of big data. Over the five years, the Company has
built an efficient project team, integrated mobile internet
technology and self-developed mobile internet application platform;
developing several products types and conducts


users’ test . China’s Central Government is giving
supporting policy to “Internet Plus” Industries which
will allow ZXITC to develop their products to provide mobile
internet communication application system to users for the rapid
development of mobile internet application in China.


 

In 2012,
ZXITC had the advantage to work with China’s internet network
information center, (CNNIC), the Issuer of internet content
provider (ICP) of all the websites hosted in China on mobile URL,
General URL and Trusted URL to integrate with their mobile Internet
cloud application system. The joint development will expedite the
construction of CNNIC public supporting service system with 10% of
the original cost. Subsequently, the Company began to develop a
website which allows their users to create and manage their own
mobile application with minimal technical knowledge. The website
developed exclusively for the Chinese market, is named
“MOYUN”. Currently, MOYUN Internet Mobile Application
(MIMA) cloud platform is the most comprehensive cloud
infrastructure in the China’s Corporate Mobile Application
systems. Since the free public test inception at January, 2012,
MIMA has been one of the Chinese leading cross-platform mobile
application developing tools. We believe that the market in North
America is ripe for such an application notwithstanding that we
will have to make definitive changes to utilize and maximize the
mobile application system in North America.

 

ZXITC is
the first company to utilize a “Drag and Drop” design
interface for the Mobile Application development in order to
provide a user friendly interface. The system reduces the cost of
mobile application development, compatibility issues and other
technical complication so that users can focus more on the product
interface and business profile design.

 

The
company is equipped with high performance server group and large
bandwidth network to facilitate a stable and speedy access for
their clients, so that they can enjoy an internet vendor class
infrastructure through subscribing their services. The cloud system
is implemented at software as a service level, (SaaS) whereas users
can minimize their cost of establishing as e-commerce and for
mobile application deployment.

THE MOBILE
MARKETING INDUSTRY

 

 

Overview

Management
contends that some perceive mobile advertising as closely related
to online or internet advertising, though we believe its reach is
far greater - currently, most mobile advertising is targeted at
mobile phones, that came estimably to a global total of 6.9 billion
as of 2014 (Source: mobithinking.com). Notably computers, including
desktops and laptops, are currently estimated at approximately 1.9
billion globally (Source: ask.com).

It is
probable, in our management’s opinion, that advertisers and
media industry will increasingly take account of a bigger and
fast-growing mobile market, though it remains at around 2.7% of
global advertising spending and is estimated to increase to 7.6% by
2016 ( Source: statisa.com ). Mobile media is evolving rapidly, and
while we believe mobile phones will continue to be the mainstay, it
is not clear whether mobile phones based on cellular backhaul, or
smart phones based on WiFi hot spot, or WiMAX hot zone, will also
strengthen. However, as an illustration of the emergence of this
form of advertising, that there is now a dedicated global
advertising awards ceremony organized every year by Vision gain , a
business information portal.

In
information provided by the research firm Berg Insight, as mobile
phones out number Television sets by over 3 to 1, and PC based
internet users by over 4 to 1, and the total laptop and desktop PC
population by nearly 5 to 1, advertisers in many markets, we
contend, have recently rushed to this media. In Spain 75% of mobile
phone owners receive ads, in France 62% and in Japan 54%.More
remarkably as mobile advertising matures, like in the most advanced
markets, the user involvement also matures. In Japan today, already
44% of mobile phone owners click on ads they receive on their
phones. Mobile advertising was worth 900 million dollars in Japan
alone. According to the research firm Berg Insight, the global
mobile advertising market that was estimated to € 1 billion in
2008 Furthermore, Berg Insight forecasts the global mobile
advertising market to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 43
percent to € 8.7 billion in 2014.

In the Q2
2013 "State of Mobile Advertising Report" by Opera Mediaworks, it
is reported that mobile advertising is growing globally at a rapid
rate. Opera Mediaworks reports that rich media ads are now
averaging a 1.53 percentage click rate among users. App large
banner ads are still the most popular, but they are on the
decline.

In China,
A study by iResearch finds no indication of a slowdown in mobile
growth as mobile devices become more popular and e-retailers invest
in making mobile sites easier to use.

Chinese
consumers spent 929.71 billion yuan ($148.16 billion) on shopping
from their smartphones and tablets in 2014, up 239% from 274.00
billion yuan ($43.66 billion) in 2013, according to Chinese
research firm iResearch.

That is a
significant leap in one year for mobile shopping, given that online
shopping grew only 49.8% to 2.814 trillion yuan ($448.47 billion)
in China in 2014, according to iResearch, a Beijing-based firm that
tracks e-commerce. IResearch attributes the uptick in mobile
shopping mainly to the growing popularity of mobile devices and
leading e-retailers’ investments in better serving mobile
shoppers.

Mobile
commerce seems likely to keep growing: iResearch forecasts mobile
shopping will grow more than fourfold to 4.504 trillion yuan ($717.
75 billion) in sales in 2018.

Purchases
on mobile devices accounted for 33% of online sales in China in
2014, compared with 14.5% in the prior year, according to
iResearch.

The
Chinese research company also predicts that mobile sales will
surpass sales on personal computers in 2016 and reach 61.7% of
online sales in 2018.

Using a
mobile phone to browse the internet in China has considerably taken
off towards the end of 2012, with an ever increasing amount of the
public deciding to choose their mobile phones to browse the
internet rather than traditionally sitting in front of a desktop.
The mobile internet now is the biggest new growth engine for
e-commerce in China. Online shopping is booming because of its
convenience and cost effectiveness. And it’s not only young
affluent urban dwellers who are purchasing luxury items online at
cheaper prices than shopping malls rather residents in less
developed regions are buying products that are not available in
their home towns as noted in the Wall Street Journal on August 31,
2015.

Some
interesting statistics according to China’s internet network
information center, (“CNNIC”), the Issuer of internet
content provider (ICP) of all the websites hosted in China on
mobile URL, General URL and Trusted URL to integrate with their
mobile Internet cloud application system.

•At
the end of 2012 there were 564 million internet users in China
which calculates as 42.1% of the total population

•Out
of 564 million internet users, 420 million decides to use their
mobile to surf the internet which accounts for 74.5% of the total
internet browsing population

•The
level of mobile browsing in China has become significantly higher
than in the West.

The stats
indicate the significance of mobile internet browsing in China.
Therefore, in order for a company to have a significant brand image
standing in the competitive Chinese market, a well- designed mobile
website is what a company should be looking to build.

About
three-quarters of Chinese in first-tier cities such as Beijing,
Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chongqing are already online, but in rural
areas it’s 19 percent, according to a survey by McKinsey
Digital of Hong Kong, which helps companies shape their digital
strategies. Even so, rural Chinese have an affinity for e-commerce.
Close to two-thirds of rural Chinese who do use the Internet say
they have purchased items online; that compares with 72 percent of
users in the cities.

Types of
Mobile Ads

In some
markets, this type of advertising is most commonly seen as a Mobile
Web Banner (top of page) or Mobile Web Poster (bottom of page
banner), while in others, it is dominated by SMS advertising Other
forms include MMS advertising, advertising within mobile games and
mobile videos, during mobile TV receipt, full-screen
interstitials,

which
appear while a requested item of mobile content or mobile web page
is loading up, and audio advertisements that can take the form of a
jingle before a voicemail recording, or an audio recording played
while interacting with a telephone-based service such as movie
ticketing or directory assistance.

The Mobile
Marketing Association and the IAB (Interactive Advertising Bureau)
has published mobile advertising guidelines, but we contend that it
is difficult to keep such guidelines current in such a
fast-developing area.

The
effectiveness of a mobile media ad campaign, in our estimation, can
be measured in a variety of ways. The main measurements are
impressions (views) and click-through rates

They are
also sold to advertisers by views (Cost Per Impression) or by
click-through (Cost Per Click). Additional measurements include
conversion rates, such as click-to-call rates and other degrees of
interactive measurement.

Mobile
media can run on a mobile web page or within a mobile application,
often referred to as in-App.

One of the
popular models in mobile advertising, in our estimation, is Cost
Per Install (CPI) where there the pricing model is based on the
user installing an App on their mobile phone. CPI Mobile
Advertising Networks work either as incent or non-incent. In the
incent model the user is given virtual points or rewards to install
the game or App.

Mobile
Rich Media

In
addition to standard mobile display banners, our management has
observed a growing trend to include rich media execution within the
banner ads. This includes banners that would expand to a larger
size, offering advertisers a larger display to communicate their
message. Games within the banner to make the experience more
interactive or a video within the banner space.

There are
limitations to rich media on mobile because all of the coding must
be done in HTML5, since the iOS does not support flash.

 

COMPETITIVE
ADVANTAGE  


 


Customer 
  Website creation

 

Website
creation is a competitively open market focus on design level, the
degree of grasping customers’ requirements and service
ability. We have significant competitive advantages among other
providers. Whereas our website system mainly includes WAP/WEB and
SaaS.

 

 
 

FUTURE
DEVELOPMENT AND PLANS

 

As part of
our development plan to face the ever challenging mobile B2C
software market in North America, Europe and South America, we plan
to further develop a MIMA Professional version of its enterprise
application and constantly perfect core technology to form a
comprehensive service for basic informatization application of
businesses. Through constant evaluation of end user’s
requirements, we plan to focus on development of a leading cloud
operation platform for mobile internet enterprise website which
will gradually attract an increasing number of users. We also plan
to establish a cloud operation platform which fully covers smart
mobile client by strengthening the cooperation with application
products provider, content service provider, E-commerce hosting
provider and Wireless network address licensors.

 

Recent
Developments:

 

We filed
an S-1/A registration statement on October 14, 2015. 
 
The
registration was deemed effective as of December 9, 2015.
 

 

Critical
Accounting Policies

 

We prepare
our financial statements in conformity with GAAP, which requires
management to make certain estimates and assumptions and apply
judgments. We base our estimates and judgments on historical
experience, current trends and other factors that management
believes to be important at the time the financial statements are
prepared and actual results could differ from our estimates and
such differences could be material. We have identified below the
critical accounting policies which are assumptions made by
management about matters that are highly uncertain and that are of
critical importance in the presentation of our financial position,
results of operations and cash flows.  On a regular basis, we
review our accounting policies and how they are applied and
disclosed in our financial statements.

 

Use of
Estimates

 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported
in the financial statements. Estimates are based on historical
experience, management expectations for future performance, and
other assumptio

PART I
 
Item 1. Business.
 
China Soar Information Technology, Inc. fka
Go Public II, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on July 22, 2013 as a Form
10 blank check shell company with an objective to acquire, or merge with, an operating business. On August 24, 2015 the Company
completed a transaction (the “Transaction”) in the form of a software license and royalty agreement, (the “ License”
or the “License Agreement”) with a foreign company organized under the laws of the Peoples Republic of China, known
as “Zhengzhou Xiangtian Information Technology Company Limited,” ("ZXITC"). The president of ZXITC is our
sole director, Mu Chun Lin. The License Agreement allows us to receive a revenue stream equal to 45% of the gross revenue of ZXITC
in exchange for licensing our intellectual property which is a mobile phone internet marketing application program that we purchased
from our CEO.
 
Therefore we have ceased to be a blank check
shell company and have adopted a new business plan to provide mobile phone internet marketing services to business owners in China
and Hong Kong. We plan on offering similar services in the U.S, Europe and South America. On May 26, 2015, Mu Chun Lin was appointed
as sole Officer and sole Director of China Soar Information Technology, Inc., making Mu Chun Lin a related party as he is also
the president and CEO of Zhengzhou Xiangtian Information Technology Company.
 
The License includes the right to enter into
certain agreements and use our intellectual property. The Company did not acquire any plant and equipment, and any other business
and operational assets of ZXITC as part of the License, and the Company did not hire any employees of ZXITC except for Mu Chun
Lin. ZXITC will continue as an independent company, operating in the Peoples Republic of China after the Transaction. The License
relates to the development and operation of a Internet and Mobile Marketing Platform in China and Hong Kong. ZXITC plans to utilize
the License to provide unique online and mobile marketing services in China and Hong Kong. Our principal executive offices are
located at 12 Harcourt Road, Bank of America Tower, Suite 1308, Central, Hong Kong.
 
Our activities have been limited to developing
our business and financial plans. We will not have the necessary capital to develop or execute our business plan until we are able
to secure financing. On June 6, 2015, the Company determined
that it was in the
best interests of
the Company to
issue 20,000,000 shares of
common stock with a par value of
$ .0001 to Mu Chun Lin, our sole officer and director as compensation for services
rendered including but not limited to furthering the Company’s business plan. On June 12, 2015, the
Company determined that
it was in the
best interests of
the Company to
offer for sale 55,000,000 shares of its restricted
common stock with a par value of
$.0001 to be used for general corporate purposes as determined by our sole officer and director, Mu Chun Lin. Proxy Management
Consultants LTD of Hong Kong acted as the Company’s escrow agent. The foregoing shares were sold pursuant to Regulation S
of the Act. We believe we need to raise $750,000 to execute our business plan over the next 12 months.
In their audit report dated November
11, 2015, our auditor has expressed an opinion that substantial doubt exists as to whether we can continue as an ongoing
business. Because our President, Chief Executive Officer and sole Director Mu Chun Lin may be unwilling or unable to loan or
advance any additional capital to us, we believe that if we do not raise additional capital within 12 months of the effective
date of this registration statement, we may be required to suspend or cease the implementation of our business plan.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Risks
Relating to the Company’s Securities
 
We may never have a public market for our
common stock or may never trade on a recognized exchange. Therefore, you may be unable to liquidate your investment in our stock.

 
There is no established public trading market
for our securities. Our shares are not and have not been listed or quoted on any exchange or quotation system.
 
In order for our shares to be quoted, a market
maker must agree to file the necessary documents with FINRA. In addition, it is possible that such application for quotation may
not be approved and even if approved it is possible that a regular trading market will not develop or that if it did develop, will
be sustained. In the absence of a trading market, an investor may be unable to liquidate their investment.
 
We may in the future issue additional shares
of our common stock, which may have a dilutive effect on our stockholders.
 
Our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes
the issuance of 500,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 75,000,000 shares are issued and outstanding as of October 31, 2015.
The future issuance of our common shares may result in substantial dilution in the percentage of our common shares held by our
then existing stockholders. We may value any common stock issued in the future on an arbitrary basis. The issuance of common stock
for future services or acquisitions or other corporate actions may have the effect of diluting the value of the shares held by
our investors, and might have an adverse effect on any trading market for our common stock.
 
We may issue shares of preferred stock in
the future that may adversely impact your rights as holders of our common stock.
 
Our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes
us to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Accordingly, our board of directors will have the authority to fix and
determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred shares, as well as the authority to issue such shares, without further
stockholder approval.
 
Our preferred stock does not have any dividend,
conversion, liquidation, or other rights or preferences, including redemption or sinking fund provisions. However, our board of
directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to holders preferred rights to our assets
upon liquidation, the right to receive dividends before dividends are declared to holders of our common stock, and the right to
the redemption of such preferred shares, together with a premium, prior to the redemption of the common stock. To the extent that
we do issue such additional shares of preferred stock, your rights as holders of common stock could be impaired thereby, including,
without limitation, dilution of your ownership interests in us. In addition, shares of preferred stock could be issued with terms
calculated to delay or prevent a change in control or make removal of management more difficult, which may not be in your interest
as holders of common stock.
 
We do not currently intend to pay dividends
on our common stock and consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price
of our common stock. 
 
We have never declared or paid any cash dividends
on our common stock and do not currently intend to do so for the foreseeable future. We currently intend to invest our future earnings,
if any, to fund our growth. Therefore, you are not likely to receive any dividends on your common stock for the foreseeable future
and the success of an investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in its value. There is
no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders have
purchased their shares.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings.
 
From time to time, we may become party to litigation
or other legal proceedings that we consider to be a part of the ordinary course of our business. We are not currently involved
in legal proceedings that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial
condition or results of operations. We may become involved in material legal proceedings in the future.

Market Information
 
ADMISSION TO QUOTATION ON THE OTC BULLETIN BOARD
 
We intend to have our common stock be quoted on the OTCQB operated
by OTC Markets Group, Inc. and or Over the Counter Bulletin Board, “OTCBB”. There is no assurance that the shares will
ever be quoted on the OTCQB or OTCBB.  To be quoted on the OTCQB or OTCBB, a market maker must apply to make a market in our
common stock. If our securities are not quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, a security holder may find it more difficult to dispose
of, or to obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our securities. The OTCQB and OTC Bulletin Board differs from national
and regional stock exchanges in that it:
 
(1) is not situated in a single location but operates through communication
of bids, offers and confirmations between broker-dealers, and (2) securities admitted to quotation are offered by one or more Broker-dealers
rather than the “specialist” common to stock exchanges.
 
To qualify for quotation on the OTC Bulletin
Board, an equity security must have one registered broker-dealer, known as the market maker, willing to list bid or sale quotations
and to sponsor the company listing. We do not yet have an agreement with a registered broker-dealer, as the market maker, willing
to list bid or sale quotations and to sponsor the Company listing. If the Company meets the qualifications for trading securities
on the OTC Bulletin Board our securities will trade on the OTC Bulletin Board until a future time, if at all. We may not now and
it may never qualify for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board.
  
Holders
 
As of October 27, 2015, there were approximately
41 shareholders of record of our common stock and 75,000,000 shares of common stock deemed outstanding.
 
Dividends and Share Repurchases
 
We have not paid any dividends to our shareholder.
 There are no restrictions which would limit our ability to pay dividends on common equity or that are likely to do so in
the future.
 
Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
 
None.

Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities;
Uses of Proceeds from Registered Securities
 
On April 2, 2015, Thomas DeNunzio of 780 Reservoir
Avenue, #123, Cranston, RI 02910, the sole shareholder of Go Public II, Inc. (the “Registrant” or “Company”),
entered into a Share Cancellation Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Mr. Mu Chun Lin with an address at 81 Hao Lou, Zong
Bu Qi Ye Ji Di, Gao Xin Qu, Ying Chun Ji. Zheng Zhou City, Henan Province PRC, China. Pursuant to the Agreement, on May 26, 2015
Mr. DeNunzio cancelled 20,000,000 shares of our common stock which represented all of our issued and outstanding shares in consideration
of $34,900. The cancelled shares were returned to treasury resulting in Mr. DeNunzio owning after the share cancellation no shares
of common stock or any other securities of the Company. Concurrently, after the cancellation of Mr. DeNunzio’s shares, on
or about June 6, 2015 the Company issued Mr. Mu Chun Lin 20,000,000 shares of our common stock to carry out our business plan.
 
On June 12, 2015, we entered into subscription
agreements with 40 Chinese shareholders. Pursuant to those agreements, we sold 55,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company
to these individuals at a par value of $.0001. Each selling stockholder listed in the caption “Selling Shareholders”,
excluding Mu Chun Lin, our sole director paid $.0001 per share of common stock in cash on June 12, 2015 pursuant to a Regulation
S offering.
The shares of common stock owned prior to
this offering by each shareholder listed in the caption “Selling Shareholders”, excluding Mu Chun Lin represents the
same number of shares purchased and subscribed for pursuant to the Regulation S offering.
We claim an exemption from registration afforded
by Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended ("Regulation S") for the above sales of the stock since the
sales of the stock were made to all non-U.S. persons (as defined under Rule 902 section (k)(2)(i) of Regulation S), pursuant to
offshore transactions, and no directed selling efforts were made in the United States by the issuer, a distributor, any of their
respective affiliates, or any person acting on behalf of any of the foregoing.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
 
The following discussion of our financial condition and results
of operations should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto for the fiscal year ended July
31, 2015, found in this report. In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements
that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Where possible, we have tried to identify these forward looking statements by
using words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “intends,” or similar expressions. Our actual
results could differ materially
from those anticipated by the forward-looking statements due to
important factors and risks including, but not limited to, those set forth under “Risk Factors” as described in in
Part I, Item 1A of this report.
 
 Our cash balance is $0 as of July
31, 2015. Our cash balance is not sufficient to fund our limited levels of operations for any period of time. We have been utilizing
and may utilize funds from Mu Chun Lin, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Director, who has informally agreed to advance
funds to allow us to pay for offering costs, filing fees, and professional fees. Mu Chun Lin, however, has no formal commitment,
arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company. In order to implement our plan of operations for the next
twelve-month period, we require a minimum of $750,000 of funding. Therefore, we have filed an S-1 registration on September 3,
2015. Being a start up stage company, we have a very limited operating history. After a twelve-month period we may need additional
financing but currently do not have any arrangements for such financing.
 
Long term financing beyond the maximum aggregate
amount of this offering will be required to fully implement our business plan. The exact amount of funding will depend on funding
required for full implementation of our business plan. Our expansion may include expanding our office facilities, hiring sales
personnel and developing a customer base.
 
If we do not receive any proceeds from the
offering or the minimum amount of $750,000 that we require to operate for the next 12 months Mu Chun Lin has informally agreed
to advance us funds, however, he has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company.
 
If we need additional cash and cannot raise
it, we will either have to suspend operations until we do raise the cash we need, or cease operations entirely. Even if we raise
$750,000 from this offering, it will most likely only last one year. We may need more funds for business operations in the next
year, and we will have to revert to obtaining additional money.

Business Information
Introduction
 
We currently own intellectual
property to utilize, market, further develop and sell in North America a software application called (“MIMA”) to entrepreneurs
and small businesses whereas any merchant can easily create a WEB/WAP e-commerce website or cell phone client and enterprise mobile
management information system by themselves. Merchants will not have to rent network hardware operation system, entrust software
development and recruit professional management. Instead, we can offer the required network infrastructure and software and hardware
platform for the merchant with a low monthly fee. MIMA was created and developed by our director, Mu Chun Lin over the course of
ten years.
 
Our
LicensEE
 
Zhengzhou Xiangtian Information
Technology Company Limited was established by our director Mu Chun Lin in December, 2005. Since inception, the Company has been
concentrated on the research and development of software and hardware in the mobile internet industry and has achieved many technology
achievements in the application field of big data. Over the five years, the Company has built an efficient project team, integrated
mobile internet technology and self-developed mobile internet application platform; developing several products types and conducts
users’ test . China’s
Central Government is giving supporting policy to “Internet Plus” Industries which will allow ZXITC to develop their
products to provide mobile internet communication application system to users for the rapid development of mobile internet application
in China.
 
In 2012, ZXITC had the advantage to work with China’s
internet network information center, (CNNIC), the Issuer of internet content provider (ICP) of all the websites hosted in China
on mobile URL, General URL and Trusted URL to integrate with their mobile Internet cloud application system. The joint development
will expedite the construction of CNNIC public supporting service system with 10% of the original cost. Subsequently, the Company
began to develop a website which allows their users to create and manage their own mobile application with minimal technical knowledge.
The website developed exclusively for the Chinese market, is named “MOYUN”. Currently, MOYUN Internet Mobile Application
(MIMA) cloud platform is the most comprehensive cloud infrastructure in the China’s Corporate Mobile Application systems.
Since the free public test inception at January, 2012, MIMA has been one of the Chinese leading cross-platform mobile application
developing tools. We believe that the market in North America is ripe for such an application notwithstanding that we will have
to make definitive changes to utilize and maximize the mobile application system in North America.
 
ZXITC is the first company to utilize a “Drag and
Drop” design interface for the Mobile Application development in order to provide a user friendly interface. The system reduces
the cost of mobile application development, compatibility issues and other technical complication so that users can focus more
on the product interface and business profile design.
 
The company is equipped with high performance server group
and large bandwidth network to facilitate a stable and speedy access for their clients, so that they can enjoy an internet vendor
class infrastructure through subscribing their services. The cloud system is implemented at software as a service level, (SaaS)
whereas users can minimize their cost of establishing as e-commerce and for mobile application deployment.

The
Mobile Marketing Industry 
 
 
Overview
Management contends that some perceive mobile advertising
as closely related to online or internet advertising, though we believe its reach is far greater - currently, most mobile advertising
is targeted at mobile phones, that came estimably to a global total of 6.9 billion as of 2014 (Source: mobithinking.com). Notably
computers, including desktops and laptops, are currently estimated at approximately 1.9 billion globally (Source: ask.com).
It is probable, in our management’s opinion, that
advertisers and media industry will increasingly take account of a bigger and fast-growing mobile market, though it remains at
around 2.7% of global advertising spending and is estimated to increase to 7.6% by 2016 ( Source: statisa.com ). Mobile media is
evolving rapidly, and while we believe mobile phones will continue to be the mainstay, it is not clear whether mobile phones based
on cellular backhaul, or smart phones based on WiFi hot spot, or WiMAX hot zone, will also strengthen. However, as an illustration
of the emergence of this form of advertising, that there is now a dedicated global advertising awards ceremony organized every
year by Vision gain , a business information portal.
In information provided by the research firm Berg Insight,
as mobile phones out number Television sets by over 3 to 1, and PC based internet users by over 4 to 1, and the total laptop and
desktop PC population by nearly 5 to 1, advertisers in many markets, we contend, have recently rushed to this media. In Spain 75%
of mobile phone owners receive ads, in France 62% and in Japan 54%.More remarkably as mobile advertising matures, like in the most
advanced markets, the user involvement also matures. In Japan today, already 44% of mobile phone owners click on ads they receive
on their phones. Mobile advertising was worth 900 million dollars in Japan alone. According to the research firm Berg Insight,
the global mobile advertising market that was estimated to € 1 billion in 2008 Furthermore, Berg Insight forecasts the global
mobile advertising market to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 43 percent to € 8.7 billion in 2014.
In the Q2 2013 "State of Mobile Advertising Report"
by Opera Mediaworks, it is reported that mobile advertising is growing globally at a rapid rate. Opera Mediaworks reports that
rich media ads are now averaging a 1.53 percentage click rate among users. App large banner ads are still the most popular, but
they are on the decline.
 In China, A study by iResearch
finds no indication of a slowdown in mobile growth as mobile devices become more popular and e-retailers invest in making mobile
sites easier to use.
Chinese consumers spent 929.71 billion yuan ($148.16
billion) on shopping from their smartphones and tablets in 2014, up 239% from 274.00 billion yuan ($43.66 billion) in 2013, according
to Chinese research firm iResearch.
That is a significant leap in one year for mobile shopping,
given that online shopping grew only 49.8% to 2.814 trillion yuan ($448.47 billion) in China in 2014, according to iResearch, a
Beijing-based firm that tracks e-commerce. IResearch attributes the uptick in mobile shopping mainly to the growing popularity
of mobile devices and leading e-retailers’ investments in better serving mobile shoppers.
Mobile commerce seems likely to keep growing: iResearch
forecasts mobile shopping will grow more than fourfold to 4.504 trillion yuan ($717. 75 billion) in sales in 2018.
Purchases on mobile devices accounted for 33% of online
sales in China in 2014, compared with 14.5% in the prior year, according to iResearch.
The Chinese research company also predicts that mobile
sales will surpass sales on personal computers in 2016 and reach 61.7% of online sales in 2018.
Using a mobile phone to browse the internet in China
has considerably taken off towards the end of 2012, with an ever increasing amount of the public deciding to choose their mobile
phones to browse the internet rather than traditionally sitting in front of a desktop. The mobile internet now is the biggest new
growth engine for e-commerce in China. Online shopping is booming because of its convenience and cost effectiveness. And it’s
not only young affluent urban dwellers who are purchasing luxury items online at cheaper prices than shopping malls rather residents
in less developed regions are buying products that are not available in their home towns as noted in the Wall Street Journal on
August 31, 2015.
Some interesting statistics according to China’s
internet network information center, (“CNNIC”), the Issuer of internet content provider (ICP) of all the websites hosted
in China on mobile URL, General URL and Trusted URL to integrate with their mobile Internet cloud application system.
•At the end of 2012 there were 564 million internet
users in China which calculates as 42.1% of the total population
•Out of 564 million internet users, 420 million
decides to use their mobile to surf the internet which accounts for 74.5% of the total internet browsing population
•The level of mobile browsing in China has become
significantly higher than in the West.
The stats indicate the significance of mobile internet
browsing in China. Therefore, in order for a company to have a significant brand image standing in the competitive Chinese market,
a well- designed mobile website is what a company should be looking to build.
About three-quarters of Chinese in first-tier cities
such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chongqing are already online, but in rural areas it’s 19 percent, according
to a survey by McKinsey Digital of Hong Kong, which helps companies shape their digital strategies. Even so, rural Chinese have
an affinity for e-commerce. Close to two-thirds of rural Chinese who do use the Internet say they have purchased items online;
that compares with 72 percent of users in the cities.
Types of Mobile Ads
In some markets, this type of advertising is most commonly
seen as a Mobile Web Banner (top of page) or Mobile Web Poster (bottom of page banner), while in others, it is dominated by SMS
advertising Other forms include MMS advertising, advertising within mobile games and mobile videos, during mobile TV receipt, full-screen
interstitials,
which appear while a requested item of mobile content
or mobile web page is loading up, and audio advertisements that can take the form of a jingle before a voicemail recording, or
an audio recording played while interacting with a telephone-based service such as movie ticketing or directory assistance.
The Mobile Marketing Association and the IAB (Interactive
Advertising Bureau) has published mobile advertising guidelines, but we contend that it is difficult to keep such guidelines current
in such a fast-developing area.
The effectiveness of a mobile media ad campaign, in our
estimation, can be measured in a variety of ways. The main measurements are impressions (views) and click-through rates
They are also sold to advertisers by views (Cost Per
Impression) or by click-through (Cost Per Click). Additional measurements include conversion rates, such as click-to-call rates
and other degrees of interactive measurement.
Mobile media can run on a mobile web page or within a
mobile application, often referred to as in-App.
One of the popular models in mobile advertising, in our
estimation, is Cost Per Install (CPI) where there the pricing model is based on the user installing an App on their mobile phone.
CPI Mobile Advertising Networks work either as incent or non-incent. In the incent model the user is given virtual points or rewards
to install the game or App.
Mobile Rich Media
In addition to standard mobile display banners, our management
has observed a growing trend to include rich media execution within the banner ads. This includes banners that would expand to
a larger size, offering advertisers a larger display to communicate their message. Games within the banner to make the experience
more interactive or a video within the banner space.
There are limitations to rich media on mobile because
all of the coding must be done in HTML5, since the iOS does not support flash.
 
COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE 
 
Customer Website
creation
 
Website creation is a competitively open market focus on design
level, the degree of grasping customers’ requirements and service ability. We have significant competitive advantages among
other providers. whereas our website system mainly includes WAP/WEB and SaaS.
 
  
FUTURE DEVELOPMENT AND PLANS
 
As part of our development plan to face the ever challenging mobile
B2C software market in North America, Europe and South America, we plan to further develop a MIMA Professional version of its enterprise
application and constantly perfect core technology to form a comprehensive service for basic informatization application of businesses.
Through constant evaluation of end user’s requirements, we plan to focus on development of a leading cloud operation platform
for mobile internet enterprise website which will gradually attract an increasing number of users. We also plan to establish a
cloud operation platform which fully covers smart mobile client by strengthening the cooperation with application products provider,
content service provider, E-commerce hosting provider and Wireless network address licensors.

We filed an S-1/A registration

Critical Accounting Policies
 
We prepare our financial statements in conformity with GAAP, which
requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions and apply judgments. We base our estimates and judgments on historical
experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be important at the time the financial statements are
prepared and actual results could differ from our estimates and such differences could be material. We have identified below the
critical accounting policies which are assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain and that are of critical
importance in the presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  On a regular basis, we review
our accounting policies and how they are applied and disclosed in our financial statements.
 
Use of Estimates
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported
in the financial statements. Estimates are based on historical experience, management expectations for future performance, and
other assumptions as appropriate. Key areas affected by estimates include the assessment of the recoverability of long-lived assets,
which is based on such factors as estimated future cash flows.  We re-evaluate estimates on an ongoing basis; therefore, actual
results may vary from those estimates.
 
Fair Values of Financial Instruments
 
The carrying values of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable
and accrued expenses approximate the fair values of these instruments due to their short-term nature. The carrying amount for borrowings
under the financing agreement approximates fair value because of the variable market interest rates charged for these borrowings.
 
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
 
There are no off balance sheet arrangements.
 
Capital Resources.
 
We had no material commitments for capital expenditures as of July
31, 2015 and 2014.
 
Results of Operations for the years ended July 31, 2015 and 2014
 
For the fiscal year ended July 31, 2015 as compared to the fiscal
year ended July 31, 2014, total revenues were $0 and $0, respectively; and net losses were $19,358 and $3,300 respectively. The
net losses were attributable to operating expenses. The operating expenses for the year ended July 31, 2015 included but not limited
to professional and audit fees.  The operating expenses for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2014 were share-based compensation
for our founder and sole officer and audit fees.
 
Liquidity
 
As of July 31, 2015 and 2014 we had cash and cash equivalents of
$0 for both year and had working capital deficits of $0 and $2,000, respectively.  We have incurred no cash flows from operations
since we started our business. We have spent and expect to continue to spend only those expenses and amounts necessary to maintain
public company registration status. Based on our current plans, our sole officer and director will continue to fund operating expenses.
 
As of July 31, 2015 and 2014, we had zero cash used in and provided
by investing activities.
 
As of July 31, 2015 and 2014, we had $5,500 and $0 cash provided
by financing activities.
 
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
about Market Risk.
 
As a “smaller reporting company”,
we are not required to provide the information required by this Item.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  MALONE-BAILEY
 
To the Board of Directors of
China Soar Information Technology, Inc.
Hong Kong
 
We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of China Soar Information
Technology, Inc. (the "Company") as of July 31, 2015 and the related statements of operations, stockholders' deficit
and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.
 
We conducted our audit in accordance with standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required
to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration
of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances,
but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made
by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.
 
In our opinion, the financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company, as of July 31, 2015 and the results of
its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.
 
The accompanying financial statements have
been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the
Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and negative operating cash flows which raise substantial doubt about its
ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans regarding those matters also are described in Note 3. The financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM
 
To the Board of Directors of:
Go Public II, INC.
780 Reservoir Avenue
Cranston, RI 02910
 
I have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Go
Public II, Inc. as of July 31, 2014 and the related statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for the
year then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. My responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit. The July 31, 2013 financial statements were audited by a predecessor
independent registered accounting firm that issued an unqualified opinion on August 21, 2013.
 
I conducted my audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that I plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  I believe that my audit provides a reasonable basis for my opinion.
 
In my opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Go Public II, Inc. as
of July 31, 2014, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.
 
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming
that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, planned principal operations
have not commenced and the Company has an accumulated deficit and negative cash flows from operating activities. These conditions
raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are
also described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Go Public II, INC. 
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR YEARS ENDED JULY 31, 2015 AND 2014
 
NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 
 
China Soar Information Technology, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (“the Company”) formerly known as Go Public II, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State
of Delaware on July 22, 2013. On May 26, 2015, our former director, Thomas DeNunzio resigned and Mu Chun Lin was appointed as our
sole president, CEO, CFO and director. Mu Chun Lin also became our sole shareholder. We changed our name from Go Public II, Inc.
to China Soar Information Technology with the Delaware Secretary of State on June 16, 2015.
 
We currently own a piece
of intellectual property to utilize, market, further develop and sell in North America, South America and Europe a software application
called (“MIMA”) to entrepreneurs and small businesses whereas any merchant can easily create a WEB/WAP e-commerce website
or cell phone client and enterprise mobile management information system by themselves. Merchants will not have to rent network
hardware operation system, entrust software development and recruit professional management. Instead, we can offer the required
network infrastructure, software and hardware platform for the merchant with a low monthly fee. MIMA was created, owned and developed
by our director, Mu Chun Lin over the course of ten years.
 
Note
2 - Significant Accounting Policies 
Use of estimates.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements as well as the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
these estimates. Due to the limited level of operations, the Company has not had to make material assumptions or estimates other
than the assumption that the Company is a going concern.
Fiscal year end.
The Company elected July 31st as its fiscal year ending
date.
Cash AND CASH equivalents.
For the purpose of the financial statements cash equivalents
include all highly liquid investments with original maturity of three months or less. Cash and cash equivalents were $0 as of July
31, 2015 and 2014.
 
 
COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES.
 
The Company follows ASC 450-20, Loss Contingencies,
to report accounting for contingencies. Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines
and penalties and other sources are recorded when it
is probable that a liability has been incurred
and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated. There were neither commitments nor contingencies as of July 31, 2015
and July 31, 2014.
EARNINGS (LOSS)
PER SHARE. 
The Company computes basic and diluted earnings per share amounts
in accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share. Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted
average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing net
loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially outstanding shares of common stock during each period.
There were no potentially dilutive shares outstanding as of July 31, 2015.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. 
The Company’s balance sheet includes certain financial instruments.
The carrying amounts of current assets and current liabilities approximate their fair value because of the relatively short period
of time between the origination of these instruments and their expected realization.
 
ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, defines
fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal
or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement
date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between (1) market participant assumptions developed
based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2) an entity’s own assumptions about
market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The
fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets
for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the
fair value hierarchy are described below:
 


 
·
Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities

 


 
·
Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates); and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.

 


 
·
Level 3 - Inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.

 
Fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market
assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of July 31, 2015. The respective carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet
financial instruments approximated their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments.
Income taxes.
The Company accounts for income taxes under ASC 740, Income Taxes.
Under the asset and liability method of ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective
tax bases.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in
the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  The effect on deferred tax assets
and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period the enactment occurs.  A valuation allowance
is provided for certain deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize tax assets through
future operations.  No deferred tax assets or liabilities were recognized at July 31, 2015 and 2014.
 
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS.
 
The Company follows ASC 850, Related Party Disclosures, for
the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions. During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2015,
expenses of $15,858 were paid by the current and former directors and are considered as contributions to capital. Our current sole
director, Mr. Mu and the former sole director contributed $9,694 and $6,164 to the Company, respectively. During the fiscal year
ended July 31, 2014, the former sole director contributed $3,544 to capital.
 
 
 
SHARE-BASED EXPENSE.
 
ASC 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation, prescribes
accounting and reporting standards for all share-based payment transactions in which employee services are acquired. Transactions
include incurring liabilities, or issuing or offering to issue shares, options, and other equity instruments such as employee stock
ownership plans and stock appreciation rights. Share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, are
recognized as compensation expense in the financial statements based on their fair values. That expense is recognized over the
period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award, known as the requisite service period
(usually the vesting period).
 
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation issued to non-employees
and consultants in accordance with the provisions of ASC 505-50, Equity – Based Payments to Non-Employees.  Measurement
of share-based payment transactions with non-employees is based on the fair value of whichever is more reliably measurable:  (a)
the goods or services received; or (b) the equity instruments issued.  The fair value of the share-based payment transaction
is determined at the earlier of performance commitment date or performance completion date.  
 
Share-based expense for the twelve months ended July 31, 2015 and
2014 was $0 and $0, respectively.
-F8-

  

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS.
 
Except for rules and interpretive releases of the SEC under authority
of federal securities laws and a limited number of grandfathered standards, the FASB Accounting Standards Codification™
(“ASC”) is the sole source of authoritative GAAP literature recognized by the FASB and applicable to the Company.
 
We have reviewed the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”)
accounting pronouncements and interpretations thereof that have effectiveness dates during the periods reported and in future periods.
The Company has carefully considered the new pronouncements that alter previous generally accepted accounting principles and does
not believe that any new or modified principles will have a material impact on the corporation’s reported financial position
or operations in the near term. The applicability of any standard is subject to the formal review of our financial management and
certain standards are under consideration.
 
In August 2014, FASB issued (ASU) No. 2014-15, Presentation of
Financial Statements – Going Concern; Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going
Concern. The amendments in this update provide guidance in GAAP about management’s responsibility to evaluate whether
there is substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures.
In doing so, the amendments should reduce diversity in the timing and content of footnote disclosures. The guidance is effective
for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is
permitted but not required; at this time we are not early adopting. As the objective of this accounting standard is to provide
guidance on the disclosure of uncertainties about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, the adoption of this
standard is not expected to impact our financial position or results of operations.
 
In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU
2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment
to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation. The amendments in this update remove all incremental financial
reporting requirements from U.S. GAAP for development stage entities and also eliminate an
exception provided to development stage entities in Topic 810, Consolidation, for determining whether an entity is a variable interest
entity on the basis of the amount of investment equity that is at risk. These amendments are
effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014, and interim periods therein, with early application permitted.
Early application of each of the amendments is permitted for any annual reporting period or interim period for which the entity’s
financial statements have not yet been issued (public business entities) or made available for issuance (other entities). We early
adopted this pronouncement in July 2014. As the objective of the amendments in this update is to improve financial reporting by
reducing the cost and complexity associated with the incremental reporting requirements for development stage entities our early
adoption of this guidance has not impacted our financial position or results of operations. 
 
NOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN 
The accompanying financial statements
are prepared on a basis of accounting assuming that the Company is a going concern that contemplates realization of assets and
satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has no current revenue sources. This condition raises
substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company’s management plans to engage
in very limited activities without incurring any liabilities that must be satisfied in cash until a source of funding is secured.
The Company will offer noncash consideration and seek equity lines as a means of financing its operations. If the Company is unable
to obtain revenue - producing contracts or financing or if the revenue or financing it does obtain is insufficient to cover any
operating losses it may incur, it may substantially curtail or terminate its operations or seek other business opportunities through
strategic alliances, acquisitions or other arrangements that may dilute the interests of existing stockholders. 
NOTE 4 - INCOME
TAXES 
 
The Company has not recognized an income tax
benefit for its operating losses generated based on uncertainties concerning its ability to generate taxable income in future periods.
The tax benefit for the periods presented is offset by a valuation allowance established against deferred tax assets arising from
the net operating losses and other temporary differences, the realization of which could not be considered more likely than not.
In future periods, tax benefits and related deferred tax assets will be recognized when management considers realization of such
amounts to be more likely than not. Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code generally requires us to limit the amount of its income
in future years that can be offset by historic losses, i.e. net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards and certain built-in losses,
after a corporation has undergone an ownership change. As of July 31, 2015, the Company has incurred net losses of $(26,902) resulting
in a net operating loss for income tax purposes. NOLs begin expiring in 2033. The loss results in a deferred tax asset of approximately
$9,415 at the effective statutory rate of 35%. The deferred tax asset has been off-set by an equal valuation allowance.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with
Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.
 
(1) Previous Independent Auditors:
 


 
a.
On August 3, 2015, RLB Certified Public Accountant PLLC “RLB” declined to stand for reappointment as our Company’s independent auditor.

 


 
b.
RLB’s report on the financial statements for the year ended July 31, 2014 and for the period July 22, 2013 (inception) through July 31, 2013 contained no adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and was not qualified or modified as to audit scope or accounting, except that the report contained an explanatory paragraph stating that there was substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

 
 


 
c.
Through the period covered by the financial audit for the year ended July 31, 2014, the period July 22 2013 (inception) through July 31, 2013 and through the current date, there have been no disagreements with RLB on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements if not resolved to the satisfaction of RLB would have caused her to make reference thereto in the report on the financial statements. Through the interim period August 3, 2015, there have been no disagreements with RLB on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements if not resolved to the satisfaction of RLB would have caused them to make reference thereto in the report on the financial statements. 

 


 
d.
We have authorized RLB to respond fully to the inquiries of the successor accountant.

 


 
e.
During the year ended July 31, 2014, the period July 22 2013 (inception) through July 31, 2013 and the interim period through August 3, 2015, there have been no reportable events with us as set forth in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K.

 


 
f.
The Company provided a copy of the foregoing disclosures to RLB prior to the date of the filing of this Report and requested that RLB furnish it with a letter addressed to the Securities & Exchange Commission stating whether or not the firm agrees with the statements in this Report. A copy of such letter is filed as Exhibit 16.1 to this Form 10-K.

 
(2) New Independent Accountants:
 
a.     On August
3, 2015, the Company engaged MaloneBailey, LLP (“MB”) of Houston, Texas, as its new registered independent public accountant.
During the year ended July 31, 2014, the period July 22 2013 (inception) through July 31, 2013 and prior to August 3, 2015, (the
date of the new engagement), we did not consult with MB regarding (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction,
(ii) the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company’s financial statements by MB, in either case where  written
or oral advice provided by MB would be an important factor considered by us in reaching a decision as to any accounting, auditing
or financial reporting issues or (iii) any other matter that was the subject of a disagreement between us and our former auditor
or was a reportable event (as described in Items 304(a)(1)(iv) or Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K, respectively).
 
 
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.
 
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
 
The Company has adopted and maintains disclosure
controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports
filed under the Exchange Act, such as this annual report, is collected, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the rules of the SEC.  The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are also designed
to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
 As required under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15, the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer who also
serves as our Principal Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures
as of the end of the period covered by this report.   Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Office who also serves
as our Principal Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are ineffective.
 
 
The matters involving internal controls and
procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the   Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board were: domination of management by a single individual without adequate compensating controls, lack of a majority
of outside directors on board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required
internal controls and procedures; inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives, and lack of an audit committee. These
material weaknesses were identified by our Chief Executive Officer who also serves as our Chief Financial Officer in connection
with the above annual evaluation.
 
Management believes that the material weaknesses
did not have an effect on our financial results. However, management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and
inadequate segregation of duties results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls
and procedures, which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods.
 
Management recognizes that its controls and
procedures would be substantially improved if we had an audit committee and two individuals serving as officers and as such is
actively seeking to remediate this issue. 
 
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting
 
The Company’s management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).
 The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s
management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.  Management
conducted an assessment of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control – Integrated Framework.  Based
on the assessment, management concluded that, as of July 31, 2014, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
is ineffective based on those criteria.
 
The Company’s management, including its
Chief Executive Officer who also serves as our Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company’s disclosure controls
and procedures and its internal control processes will prevent all error and all fraud.  A control system, no matter how well
conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
 Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls
must be considered relative to their costs.  Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of
controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of error or fraud, if any, within the Company have
been detected.  These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that
the breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.  Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual
acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control.  The design of any system
of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance
that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.  Over time, controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
 Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and
may not be detected.  However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process.  Therefore,
it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.
 
Management’s Remediation Initiatives
 
In an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and
other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls, we have initiated, or plan to initiate, the following series of measures:
 
We will create a position to segregate duties consistent with control
objectives and will increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function when funds
are available to us. And, we plan to appoint one or more outside directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to
an audit committee resulting in a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring
of required internal controls and procedures such as reviewing and approving estimates and assumptions made by management when
funds are available to us.
 
Management believes that the appointment of one or more outside
directors, who shall be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee, will remedy the lack of a functioning audit committee
and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our Board.
 
We will work as quickly as possible to implement these initiatives;
however, the lack of adequate working capital and positive cash flow from operations will likely slow this implementation.
 
Changes in Internal Control
 
There have been no changes in internal controls over the financial
reporting that occurred during the period ending July 31, 2014,  that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting.
 
This annual report does not include an attestation report of the
Company’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.  Management’s
report was not subject to attestation by the Company’s registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the
SEC that permit the Company to provide only management’s report in this annual report.

Mu Chun Lin

President, CEO, Secretary, Treasurer and Director 

 
 
 
 
 

Mu Chun Lin, President, Secretary, Treasurer and Director
 
Mu Chun Lin
 
Mu Chun Lin has been the CEO of Zhengzhou Xiangtian Information
Technology Company Limited since September 2006. He was responsible for the start up and development of the company into a high
growth, e-commerce company. Also of note is the fact that he created procedures for hiring, training as well as management of sales
team for business development with local state, government agencies which from company start-up has brought tremendous growth.
Additionally, Mu Chun Lin has been responsible for developing internet mobile technology since 2006. Mu Chun Lin was assistant
to the general manager and technical director of Henan Xinfeijinxin Computer Information Technolgy Co., LTD. Mu Chun Lin received
a bachelor’s degree in journalism from Communication University of China in 2009.
Corporate Governance
 
The Company promotes accountability for adherence
to honest and ethical conduct; endeavors to provide full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents
that the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and in other public communications made
by the Company; and strives to be compliant with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations. The Company has not formally
adopted a written code of business conduct and ethics that governs the Company’s employees, officers and Directors as the
Company is not required to do so.
 
In lieu of an Audit Committee, the Company’s
Board of Directors, is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations concerning the selection of outside auditors, reviewing
the scope, results and effectiveness of the annual audit of the Company's financial statements and other services provided by the
Company’s independent public accountants. The Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer
of the Company review the Company's internal accounting controls, practices and policies.
 
Employees
 
At July 31, 2015 we had no employees.
 
Directors’ Term of Office
 
Directors will hold office until the next annual
meeting of stockholders and the election and qualification of their successors.  Officers are elected annually by our board
of directors and serve at the discretion of the board of directors. Presently, we have a single director, Mu Chun Lin.
 
Director Independence
 
Although our securities do not trade on any national securities
exchange, for purposes of independence we use the NASDAQ definition of independence. Our director, Mu Chun Lin, is not independent
because of his position as an executive officer of the Company.
 
Audit Committee and Audit Committee Financial Expert
 
Our sole director acts as our audit committee and compensation committee.
We do not have an “audit committee financial expert,” as that term is defined in Item 407(d) of Regulation S-K promulgated
under the Securities Act. The sole director believes that he is financially literate and experienced in business matters and are
capable of (1) understanding generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and financial statements, (2) assessing
the general application of GAAP principles in connection with our accounting for estimates, accruals and reserves, (3) analyzing
and evaluating our financial statements, (4) understanding internal controls and procedures for financial reporting, and (5) understanding
audit committee functions, all of which are attributes of an audit committee financial expert. However, the sole director believes
that no audit committee member has obtained these attributes through the experience specified in the SEC's definition of “audit
committee financial expert.” Further, as is the case with many small companies, it would be difficult for us to attract and
retain board members who qualify as “audit committee financial experts,” and competition for such individuals is significant.
The sole director believes that its current audit committee is able to fulfill its role under SEC regulations despite not having
a designated “audit committee financial expert.”
 
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company’s executive
officers, directors and persons who beneficially own more than ten percent of a registered class of the Company’s equity
securities, to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of the Company’s common
stock.  Such officers, directors and persons are required by SEC regulation to furnish the Company with copies of all Section
16(a) forms that they file with the SEC.
 
Based solely on a review of the copies of such
forms that were received by the Company, or written representations from certain reporting persons that no Form 5s were required
for those persons, the Company is not aware of any failures to file reports or report transactions in a timely manner during the
Company’s fiscal year ended July 31, 2015.
 
Code of Ethics
 
We have not established a Code of Ethics applicable
to our officers and directors.
 
Procedure for Nominating Directors
 
In 2015, we have not made any material changes
to the procedures by which security holders may recommend nominees to our Board of Directors.
 
Family Relationships
 
There are no family relationships among our
directors, executive officers or persons nominated to become executive officers or directors.
 
Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings
 
During the past ten (10) years, none of our
directors, persons nominated to become directors, executive officers, promoters or control persons was involved in any of the legal
proceedings listen in Item 401 (f) of Regulation S-K.
 
Arrangements
 
There are no arrangements or understandings
between an executive officer, director or nominee and any other person pursuant to which he was or is to be selected as an executive
officer or director.

The following table sets forth certain information regarding beneficial
ownership of our common stock and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock as of October 31, 2015 by (i) each person (or

each of our directors and executive officers, and (iii) all of our directors and executive officers as a group.  As of October
31, 2015, there were 75,000,000 shares of common stock outstanding.
 
Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with SEC rules
and generally includes voting or investment power with respect to securities. The principal address of each of the stockholders
listed below is c/o 12 Harcourt Road, Bank of America Tower, Suite 1308 Central, Hong Kong.  We believe that all persons
named in the table have sole voting and investment power with respect to shares beneficially owned by them.

Buyer's Feedback


Easy Sourcing helps me trade easily!
As a new member to Made-in-China.com, I posted my first request on Easy Sourcing one month ago. Fortunately, I received the first quality quotation from supplier - Changzhou Ji****Co., Ltd. within 2 hours after submission! Finally I ordered Electronic Transformer from the supplier. In the past I had to spend several days to find a satisfied supplier. Now, I only need a few hours!

I have found several qualified suppliers through Easy Sourcing!
I have been a premium buyer with Made-in-China.com for many years. Since the first time posting sourcing request on Easy Sourcing, I have found several reliable suppliers, it's convenient for me to receive rapid quotations and compare the suppliers. Easy Sourcing has provided tremendous value to me. Now it's my favorite way to find Chinese suppliers.
