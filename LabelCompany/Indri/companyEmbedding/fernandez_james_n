			James N. Fernandez, age 61, has served as a director of Dun & Bradstreet since December 2004, and is Chairman of the Audit Committee and a member of the Nominating & Governance Committee. Prior to his retirement in July 2014, Mr. Fernandez served with Tiffany & Co., a specialty retailer, designer, manufacturer and distributor of fine jewelry, timepieces, sterling silverware, china, crystal, stationery, fragrances and accessories, since October 1983. He held numerous positions with Tiffany & Co., including Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer from April 1989 until January 1998, when he was promoted to Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In June 2011, Mr. Fernandez was promoted to Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer with overall responsibility for finance, distribution, information technology, manufacturing and Tiffany's Diamond and Gemstone Division. Mr. Fernandez does not serve, nor has he served in the last five years, on the board of any other public company. 

In assessing Mr. Fernandez's skills and qualifications to serve on the Dun & Bradstreet Board, our directors considered Mr. Fernandez's financial expertise (including investor relations oversight), and marketing/brand management and operations experience (including information technology and human resources oversight) gained at Tiffany & Co. for over 30 years, including in his role as the Chief Financial Officer for 22 years and Chief Operating Officer for three years. The Board also values his risk management, compliance and mergers and acquisitions experience, his global business insight and strategic planning experience, and his general corporate governance background. Additionally, the Board values Mr. Fernandez's qualification as an "audit committee financial expert," as that term has been defined by the rules of the SEC, and his "accounting or related financial management expertise" within the meaning of NYSE listing standards.
