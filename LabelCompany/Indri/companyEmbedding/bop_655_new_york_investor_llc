Victor Zaraya, President of KIDZ BOP, said, "The Best Time Ever tour is our biggest show yet. We're excited to travel the country again in 2017, and continue to bring our annual tour to the hometowns of families who listen to our music every day. KIDZ BOP's Best Time Ever tour provides returning fans with many fun surprises and new fans with their very first concert experience."
Juicy Juice Splashers has been named an official sponsor for the KIDZ BOP Best Time Ever tour. A better-for-you beverage, Juicy Juice Splashers* features fruity flavors and 50% less sugar vs. the leading juice, an option both parents and kids love. Fans can have fun at the Juicy Juice tent before the concert and will receive a free sample of the product after the performance. The partnership is supported by an exciting national sweepstakes which will be announced later this year. "We're thrilled to be the official sponsor of this year's Best Time Ever tour," said Ilene Bergenfeld, Chief Marketing Officer for Harvest Hill Beverage Company, owner of the Juicy Juice brand. "Just like Juicy Juice Splashers, KIDZ BOP offers parents and kids an experience that both will enjoy, making the partnership a natural fit. We can't wait to share in the concert fun with fans!"

Save on Business Liability Insurance Costs with the Business Owners Policy
A business owner’s policy, or BOP, is a type of pre-packaged insurance designed for certain types of small-business owners. The BOP allows business owners to save on liability insurance costs by bundling multiple insurance policies together for a single affordable premium.
What Is a Business Owners Policy?

A Business Owners Policy is simply bundled insurance designed to provide essential coverage to certain business owners at a competitive price. Most often, the insurance coverage offered by a Business Owner’s Policy includes…

Commercial General Liability Insurance coverage (protection from claims of property damage or bodily injury)
Property Insurance (to protect physical assets)
Insurance for several other types of loss, including lost income, advertising damage, and more

General Liability Insurance for Less with a Business Owners Policy
A BOP’s General Liability Insurance (sometimes called Commercial General Liability Insurance) protects you from the cost of defending yourself or paying the damages if an employee, contractor, customer, or other business-related third party claims that your business caused them bodily injury or harmed their property.
Your BOP may also offer a variety of other types of coverage, including Personal and Advertising Liability, Completed Operations Liability, Contract Liability, and Liquor Liability.
Property Liability Insurance for Less with a Business Owners Policy
The BOP’s Property Insurance typically insures damaged or lost property for its replacement value. This means that your reimbursement would cover the cost of replacing the property, without any deduction for depreciation based on the age of the property. It also acknowledges that your business might be held legally responsible for damage to someone else’s property while it is in your possession. When your customer’s property is in your “care, custody, or control,” it is normally covered as if it were your property.
Business Interruption Coverage for Less with a Business Owners Policy
Depending on its terms, your BOP might cover income you lose or expenses you incur as a direct result of a property loss covered by the policy. For instance, if you’re forced to close shop and move to a new office because of a fire, you may be eligible for reimbursement on the revenue you lose during the time you can’t conduct business in addition to reimbursement for moving costs.
Additional Liability Insurance with a Business Owners Policy
Business owners interested in increasing their insurance coverage limits can buy additional coverage to supplement their Business Owners Policy. Known as Business Umbrella Insurance, this type of coverage may make a BOP even more effective.
Qualifying for a Business Owner’s Policy
In order to qualify for the discount business insurance a Business Owner’s Policy offers, your business must meet certain criteria. Generally speaking, a business does not qualify for a BOP if it…

Is involved in highly specialized or high-risk operations
Occupies large premises
Needs business interruption coverage lasting longer than 12 months
Needs higher limits of liability than a BOP package offers

While a BOP can help many businesses save money, it generally isn’t a good fit for businesses with higher liability risks. For high-risk companies, the coverage limits offered by a standard BOP are usually insufficient. Even if a BOP is a good fit for your business, keep in mind that not all BOPs offer uniform coverage; be sure to check with your agent whether your BOP meets your business’s needs.
To discover whether a BOP is an option for your business, complete this short application. We usually respond via email within 24 hours. If you’d like to discuss your options sooner, feel free to call us at (800) 655-1714.
