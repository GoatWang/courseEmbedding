The Industry’s Take on Conversation Rate Optimization
                                     
                                        The Industry’s Take on Conversation Rate Optimization: What Works, What to Expect, and How to Maximize your Testing Efforts
Earlier this year Econsultancy conducted a survey related to conversion rate optimization (CRO), which we at 6D Global took part in, and which was published in the Econsultancy Conversion Rate Optimization 2016 Report.

Firstly, if you’re not familiar with conversion rate optimization (CRO), here’s a brief overview; alternatively, if you are already familiar with CRO, skip this paragraph. CRO has many names – A/B testing, website experimentation and so on – all with the same concept - to run controlled experiments on your website with actual website visitor participants, tracking the differences between original and variation(s) to determine if those change you’ve made have a statistically significant impact on site performance.

Below are some insights and findings from the Econsultancy Conversion Rate Optimization 2016 Report with our ow

Magical Mystery Script
                                     
                                        It may be strange that a person who makes their living adding tracking scripts to web sites (me) is asking you to limit adding tracking scripts to your sites. Analytics provides fantastic insights into how your digital marketing and website are working. What I am asking you to do is be careful in putting magical mystery scripts on your site that claim to be doing limited tracking. You should be the only one benefiting from your site data!You know the scripts I am talking about, Marketing, by request of your consulting partner, working with a third-party ad company, getting a script off a service provider’s site, has handed you a small piece of code they call a “pixel”. This will, according to someone in the email thread, enable you to optimize your ad spend while significantly increase conversions. They may even throw in a few more buzz works about synergizing the ROI of the collaboration."Pixel" - a cute term that makes you think of a pixie, what could be evil abo

Here's 10 things you need to know to help you survive.Vendors and Suppliers will always have their “A Game” on.

Google Penguin 4.0 Update - The Good, The Bad, The Penguiny | ˈpeNGɡwinē/
                                     
                                        

  
Last Friday (September 23rd) Google announced the release of their latest Penguin algorithm update, Penguin 4.0. Read on for 6D’s overview and POV on what the change means for you, our clients, and the SEO industry at large. 

What Is The Penguin Algorithm?

Add Optimizely with Google Tag Manager
                                     
                                        This is an update of the article “Add Optimizely with Universal Analytics via Tag Manager” previously from our organization.  Some things have changed with improvements to code from both Optimizely and Google Tag Manager (GTM).  Some issues remain and we’ll expand on the issues.
First, let’s cover some basics of how site testing tools like Optimizely work with your site content. The tools work with your site code to swap out content elements.  You identify the elements and Optimizely makes that dynamic content.
For example, let’s say your site has a button element:

Defined by this html and CSS:
<div class=pink>
<a href="/solution.html" class="solid-button">Find a solution<

Good Code: Promises in JavaScript
                                     
                                        
	
		Good Code is inspired by the television program Good Eats where the host covers a particular food subject in detail--often covering the history, usage, advice, and personal opinions about a particular ingredient, cuisine, or dish.

		Humans value synchronicity--in dance, music, cooking, business, transportation, and more. Being in sync with others is valuable, and when we build systems for computers, they need to be in sync as well. Devices interacting with the CPU, the kernel with programs, and programs with various APIs--computers are always operating as orchestras. Imagine though, if no more than one section of an orchestra could play at once. The violins would play, then stop, and then the horns would play. The violins would not be able to play again until the horns stopped. That wouldn't make for the best use

Tracking Conversation Sites - Messy but Important
                                     
                                        
	
		
			Many sites have a community section to facilitate conversations between your customers, with you, or even internal communication in your company. It may be a forum, wiki, or just comment section on your blog. They are messy—as direct unstructured human communications tends to be.
			
			These sites are sometimes not tracked by your site analytics—often because trying to visualize tracking multiple different conversations seems overwhelming. Think of the largest forum type site, Reddit, with over 300,000 sub-categories and uncountable number of subject threads. Visualize trying to track something like that.

Analytics - Track Everything! Not.
                                     
                                        
	
		
			
		
		
			More data is usually better. But sometimes you get so much random data that what really matters gets lost in the noise. Badly formatted data can be worse than too little data − you have it but can’t figure out what it means.
			
			Modern digital analytics can track almost any action on a web site or app. Basic tracking is easily done by following simple instructions on a wide variety of tools. Going further, skilled analytics developers − such as the technical analysts at 6D − can implement code to track just about anything.
			
			Let’s talk about how the way in which you implement analytics affects the data quality.

Fragile Analytics
                                     
                                        
	
		
			In the early days of digital analytics we chipped custom tracking code into stone pages using flint JavaScript knives. As long as you had the code on the page the tracking worked. Analytics carved in stone--unbreakable. Then developers forgot to put the code on pages so it failed anyway.
		
			
				
					
					Tag managers simplified the task of getting more complex code on every page. But as tracking gets even more complex it becomes more fragile. Our stone tablet is now a thin sheet of glass.
			Ok, I’ve stretched this analogy as far as I should. I could go further but for the sake of humanity I won’t.

		    Google is cool, let’s get that out of the way. I love that Google shares all these beautifully-designed, well-documented resources for free. But wait, are they really free? The answer is no — Google is constantly collecting data. They have become the Federal Reserve of digital data. They have created their own ecosystem and all they ask for is data — which in turn is used to develop targeted advertising and build out applications to corner the market from email to navigation. All that being said, without that data I couldn’t do my job — nor could many businesses. There’s nothing more exciting than unveiling the power of data to a business and showing them how they can not only discover the type of users on their site, but target them across digital media, and even properly credit sales or le

Do Branded PPC Ads Cannibalize Organic Search?
                                     
                                         
“Should we be bidding on our branded terms?”
 

	– Every client ever
	It is the most common question I get asked as a PPC manager, and one that I have always had to rely on anecdotal evidence, and case studies from major data providers to answer. “Of course you should,” I’d say, “synergy and all that. The sum of the parts is greater than the whole. Bidding on your Branded terms should bring a 40% lift in clicks from those branded keywords.”
	Truth be told, it’s a widely accepted truth among those managing PPC campaigns that bidding on branded keywords is the right thing to do, and a widely questioned practice by those skeptical brands that pa

	Got an eCommerce site? If you do, I’m willing to bet you sell more than a few products. If you’re anything like the hundreds of eCom operations I’ve had the pleasure of working with over the years, you likely have some products that are pretty similar to each other. Depending on how similar those products are you could be setting yourself back in organic search. So, I’d like to take the time to show you how to avoid being hamstrung by duplicate content on eCommerce sites.

	It’s almost that time again. In just a few short months, I will have to retake the Google Analytics Individual Qualification (GAIQ) test to renew my certification. While I feel overly confident I won’t need to do much preparation this time around, I will want to be sure to give myself a quick refresh, just to be absolutely sure I can fly through the test and continue to be Google Analytics IQ certified. A lot has changed in Google Analytics since I took the test almost 18 months ago, including the recent release of the new Analytics Academy, so let me walk you through how to prepare for this test and some best practices I can give having taken the exam before.

	Introduction
	One of the more important decisions for a CMO or CTO is deciding what type of content management system (CMS) to use for the web. The last decade has brought about a wave of changes to the complexity, capabilities and expectations of web content management (WCM). 
WCM has now transformed into the backbone and front end technology to interact with customers online. Recent evolutions have required WCM to integrate and work with many other systems: commerce, analytics, customer relationship management, lead nurture, reputation management, enterprise search and more.

CSS Vertical Center with Bootstrap & Slick Slider
                                     
                                        
	
		After working with Bootstrap for the last year I’ve come across a common problem: vertical alignment. In responsive design it would be nice to vertically center an element inside its parent, even if the height of the element or its parent varies across screen sizes. 

This seems like it should be straightforward with the CSS vertical-alignment property. However, if you try to use the vertical-alignment property in Bootstrap you will find that it has no effect. This has to do with the floats and positioning that Bootstrap uses for its grid system. 

In the past I’ve gotten around the vertical alignment issue with padding. But the results are imperfect, especially if you want text to center vertically no matter how many lines it takes up.

For the OKC Thunder Plus app we needed to implement a

Part 3 of 3: Quick Rules for Mobile Design

Whenever I hear rules, I can’t help it, I want to break them. So I hesitate calling these rules. However, in our office, these are known as “Kat’s rules”

Buttons: the actual touchable area must be 100 pixels by 100 pixels or larger. You can design it to be as small as you want, as long as the active button is 100 x 100.

Type size: never smaller than 18pt.

Consistency: Don’t use an arrow that means swipe on one page, but means tap on another page. Use icons and other visual cues to mean the same thing each time

Part 2 of 3: The Process

After discovery with the client, the design process begins when Scott Landis and I sit down together. Our combo of designer and developer is key. Not because either one of us couldn’t do it solo, but because it is always stronger when we do it together. 

By mapping out the navigation together (wire framing), the designer/developer combo is a great way to have checks and balances. It is always helpful to have multiple points of view. In our case, we have very different perspectives. His is more as a digital native, and I am more of an immigrant. We are constantly battling/discussing how not to dumb down the app which insults the natives, while being

Part 1 of 3: Starting a Mobile Design Project

I love publication design.
I love the short timelines, small budgets, and all the elements that have to come together.
I hate a blank canvas—too many possibilities.
But the more restrictions, the more obvious the solution becomes.
And when I do my job well, I can prove it.
I can show my value, because there are measurable results.
Proof.
More magazines are sold, more readers, more advertisers. Even the velocity of pick up points to the success of the design.
Designing for mobile is a publication designer’s dream.

All the things I love are there:

Using your iPad to deliver content to Adobe DPS
                                     
                                        
    

        I’ve been at Adobe MAX meeting with clients and working with Adobe’s new Digital Publishing Solution (DPS). One of my favorite features of the new DPS is the special attention that has been given to mobile use-cases for publishing content and maintaining application content. This is just a really fancy way of saying that you can now use your iPad to deliver content to DPS, publish in DPS, edit cards and layouts, and even manage users. No longer does app content have to be delivered by someone sitting at a powerful desktop computer.
 You can do all of the content management for an app right from your tablet anywhere there is WiFi.

Enterprise Digital Analytics: Partner Expertise Extends the Value of Data
                                     
                                        
    

We often are introduced to stakeholders at organizations that are deciding between working directly with an enterprise analytics vendor (Google or Adobe usually) to handle their implementation or consulting needs. Or maybe they’ve been working directly with the vendor and are wondering if continuing that relationship is the best option for them as they attempt to take their analytics program to a higher level. I thought it’d be good to outline what we see as the core benefits of working with a partner like 6D for implementation and consulting needs, versus working solely with your digital analytics vendor’s services team.

If you aren’t aware already, 6D is a Google Analytics Premiu

Proof of Concept and Success Criteria Agreements
                                     
                                        
	Why do deals hit the skids after a POC is delivered? Shouldn’t a POC generate more traction, excite the business decision makers and accelerate a close?
	We have some tips to handle these situations when we’ve made all the right moves, but the deal stalls.
		 
	

	Tip 1: Who controls the deal?
	Typically, proof of concepts are delivered to influencers, and in the case of DPS deals, this means creatives. We call them “sirens of the sea,” because they’ll lure you in with genuine interest, but let you crash on the rocks when it comes to representing the value to business decision makers. Ultimately, you want to ask yourself the question, “Who is in control of this deal?” Influencers love and appreciate the platform

Code Corner: Spice Up DPS with HTML Overlays
                                     
                                        

The typical Adobe DPS app workflow involves having a designer create beautiful, largely static layouts in InDesign, which get packaged up into folios to distribute through Adobe’s publication system. This allows us to produce new content for apps without necessarily needing to submit a new version of the app to stores.
InDesign has some pretty impressive tools for animating, transitioning between and laying out your content, but it assumes you have all your content at the time you’re creating your layouts. If you want to have new content in the app every day, someone is going to need to spend time in InDesign laying it all out and publishing new folios each day.  Then when users

Can’t get your DPS app to talk to your Entitlement Server? Check your SSL Config
                                     
                                        

When verifying your Entitlement setup during the whitelist process, Adobe does NOT verify that your SSL configuration is functioning properly. If SSL is misconfigured, authorization requests from within the app will fail, saying that the connection could not be established.
If you’ve gotten through the whole Entitlement setup process, yet your app is displaying an error like ‘problem establishing connection to host,’ checking out your SSL configuration should be the first place you look. Most web browsers are a lot more forgiving of ‘partially configured’ SSL setups than DPS is, so it’s likely that your config has been wro

Code Corner: Example Technique for Randomizing Ads in a DPS HTML Overlay
                                     
                                        

One of the DPS apps we’ve worked on recently was a digitally reimagined take on a print magazine.
At the 11th hour, the client decided that they needed to include the ads they’d already sold for the print edition into the app version of the magazine, but didn’t really provide any requirements for how they should display. Ordinarily, we’d design the experience of the app around the fact that there’d be ads in it, but because the app had already been architected and laid out without ads in mind — and there wasn’t any time to rethink everything — we had to get a little bit creative to get these print ads into the app.

It first showed up in Fast Company’s March 2012 iPad edition and designers everywhere salivated. The scratch off, or what many call the “wipe away effect,” because of it’s widely recognized use by Fast Company. But as much as designers and developers love the effect, how many truly good uses are there for the effect? After three years of looking at the Fast Company cover, we found one. A word search.
As a general rule, we at Storycode have found that instead of forcing an effect into a folio where it might not fit, or where it might just be a little bit of sparkle without much usefulness, we hold on to these effects until a use-case appears.

7 Steps to Pushing JSON Structured Data using Google Tag Manager
                                     
                                        Semantic markup and structured data, tools that were once a secret weapon of cutting edge marketers, are fast becoming requirements for modern SEO. Algorithm updates like Hummingbird and ever-evolving features like the Knowledge Graph have made this stuff mission critical for many of SwellPath’s clients.
Yet, if that’s the case, why do so few of my clients actually have functional structured data on their sites? One simple reason: implementing inline microdata is hard!
The few who have been able to execute have had plenty of guidance and multiple rounds of QA to get things in ship shape. Unfortunately, most marketers don’t have the time for that!
Thank goodness that’s all changed.
Earlier this year, Google announced that it was going to start to support JSON-LD as

Stop Swiping
                                     
                                        

The Digital Publishing Suite (DPS) was first created as a way for magazine publishers to get their content onto the iPad. So it’s not a surprise, that swiping was built in as a way to get from article to article. Whether it was done to mimic flipping a page, or because it made it easy for publications to take their existing pages and port them over to the iPad, the end result is the same: bad user experience.
The examples are everywhere. Arrows pointing down, pointing right. Don’t swipe back or you’ll find yourself at the end of an article, instead of the beginning. Or worse, you will find yourself in the middle of an article, making it difficult to know where you are.
No

                                        By Gerard Casazza, Senior Analyst of Corp Development and Strategy for 6D
I’ve recently heard many times that the mobile (apps and app development) industry is a dying sector, but through observing the industry I could not see to be even close to a true statement. After hearing this I had no choice but to do some research and put some facts to paper to support that mobile is actually hitting new highs every day.

Using the Adobe DPS (Digital Publishing Suite) to make a phone or tablet app is just like using any other product, it’s a tool. Strong creatives will be successful regardless of the tool they use. It is about how you use the tool.

Designing in Different Languages
                                     
                                        

I am not a multilingual designing professional. In fact I would call myself a neophyte when it comes to designing for languages other than my native english. However, In the time I have spent designing across multiple languages I have observed some interesting challenges and solutions that brought up discussions around the office.
While working on the Sotheby’s Anthology app we created an overview section for the entire app in seven different languages. We initially laid out each page in English, utilizing the majority of the page space with lots of breathing room for the text and images. This was all great until we started dropping in the text in different languages. Some languag

Background: Trying to put Louise Durocher’s incredibly powerful work into words does not do it justice, yet the way she begins each sculpture is by doing just that. She writes a poem, the story of the piece, and then she begins.
On the surface her work seems so varied, from marble to steel to plexiglass to pencil and paper. However, each piece, large or small, shares a deep emotion that is undeniable. Louise is much like that too.

As I mentioned in the “Kicking Off a BI Project – Who is involved?” post, some of the key personnel of a BI project are: Data Architect, ETL engineers, Business Analysts, Report Developers, Application Developers, Data Governance, and a Project Manager, which all have the common goal of providing stakeholders with the right information at the right time. The goal of this blog post is to get you thinking about the strategies that can provide the best Data Solutions for your company at the best price.

6 Core Competencies You Need When Starting a Business Intelligence (BI) Solution
                                     
                                        Author: Nicholas Varner, Big Data Senior Solution Architect
If your company stores large amounts of data, it surely would benefit from implementing a BI solution. BI solutions, when implemented properly, provide your business with meaningful and accurate insights by retrieving the data you want in a timely manner. That is all fine and good in theory, but where should your business begin? Can you report off of your current billing source, ad server, or any other source of data? What is the best way to store data and what tools should we use to produce reports? How do we know the data we are getting is accurate? Does our solution scale? The questions can

What we learned at PePcon
                                     
                                        

Last month Scott and I spoke at PePcon in Chicago. It was our first time attending this Publishing and e-Publishing conference. Anne-Marie Concepción and David Blatner have done an amazing job creating this completely sold out InDesign specific conference.
A constant theme we heard was how many creatives have been charged with turning their print material into engaging and interactive digital publications.
It was exciting to see just how wide the use cases are spreading. We saw many examples of corporate communication, catalogues, presentation tools, programs and portfolios from all sizes of businesses. However, seeing how many creatives were expe

Adobe Ink & Slide: Workplace Toys
                                     
                                        

A little over a year ago the Storycode team was at the Adobe MAX conference when Adobe announced their first foray into hardware development with Project Mighty and Napoleon. Now, after waiting over a year for the public release, a name change, and an excruciating week waiting for delivery, I finally received a well designed package with Ink and Slide inside.
Unboxing the package is a treat. It really feels like you are being presented with an exclusive piece of technology. The stylus (Ink) and the ruler (slide) are on top when you open the box. Below are the charging case, charging cable, getting started book and a little Creative Cloud branded screen cleaning cloth (reminding the owner t

What to do with all your paper prototypes?
                                     
                                        
When we first started Storycode, we decided our time would always be split into three buckets:

	 
	
		 
		Agency - Digital publishing projects (client work)
		Studio - Original content and products (our own pet projects)
		Lab - Pushing the frontier (transmedia solutions) the next thing coming, multi-screen publishing
		We knew that to be really effective, we needed to be constantly exploring, playing, making mistakes. And that why the Studio and Lab buckets were so important to us.

4 Things to Think About Before Building an App
                                     
                                        

Determine Your Goals
The very first thing you need to do is determine your goals for your app. Do you want to increase brand awareness? Increase sales? Train your sales team? Create a more effective presentation tool?
Narrow your list down to one primary goal and one secondary goal. Keep this within reach at all times. Maybe print it out and put it on the wall. Or even consider a tattoo. Whatever it is, you need to constantly refer back to these goals throughout the entire development process.
Having a goal in mind is going to help you narrow your expectations, organize your content, and measure success. Whenever you come across a tough decision to make on

V31 was recently released and we are pretty excited about the new changes. With each release comes new functionality and features that improve the overall platform. We are very lucky to work on a platform that is consistently improving.
Here are some of the new features that have been added in v31:
Scheduled background downloads
Until now, background downloads had to be triggered manually. But now, you can schedule your background downloads. Giving your users new content while their device is asleep. This is going to help your workflow because now you will be able to schedule your folio publish, background download and notification to readers.

The One Quality that Will Make or Break your Mobile Apps: Empathy
                                     
                                        

At Storycode, much of the work we do with our clients and the Adobe DPS Enterprise platform is changing their mindset from print and web to mobile. Often, we find that of all the experiential possibilities the Adobe DPS platform enables, most fall back on a reflexive strategy to reuse print collateral, add some interactive elements and call it a day.
This approach does follow the path of least resistance, but it results in the app of least engagement. As I’ve mentioned in

New Title Tag and Meta Description Character Lengths
                                     
                                        For SEOs, its rare to see best practices remain the same year over year. Desktop title tag and meta description best practices have somewhat remained steady over the past five years. Not anymore! We’re seeing that Google is starting to decrease the number of characters being shown in desktop SERPs, preparing for the convergence of the desktop and mobile experience. Back in January, 6D Global's SEO Team Manager, Mike Arnesen, wrote a post on Optimizing Mobile Page Title and Meta Description Length, and we’re seeing these character limit recommendations for mobile also be true for desktop.
Based on what we’re seeing in Google SERPs, title tag and meta description character limits have decreased 21% and 23%, respectively. You n

What does Applinks mean for your app?
                                     
                                        

On Wednesday at Facebook’s yearly F8 conference, they announced Applinks, a new initiative to make deep-linking between apps easier for developers and a better experience for users.
Unlike on the web, there is not an easy way to navigate and link between applications. For example, if a friend sends you an awesome show they just found on Hulu it will open in a browser instead of opening the app. Most likely you will not be signed-in so to view the show you have to find the Hulu app and search for the recommended show.  How frustrating.

Q&A with Kat Topaz
                                     
                                        

Excerpts from PNCA design students asking Kat Topaz how she made the transition from Print to Mobile, March 2014
 
Describe your change from print design to mobile?
I wasn’t looking to change. I love publication design. My entire career has been about publication design one way or another – either as an art director, or creating/redesigning magazines, newspapers, annual reports or setting up templates and production processes to be successful.
I love working with writers, photographers, illustrators and printers. Some of it is the rush of the short deadlines and small budgets which can produce some of the most creative solutions. But a big part is

Making the Most of your Analytics
                                     
                                        

Adobe analytics tracks users while they are interacting with your app. This includes both on and offline usage. Adobe provides base-line analytic that will allow you to view important data such issues downloaded, total viewing time, article views, and more. This data will help to paint a picture of the way your users are interacting with your app.
Analytics look a little intimidating when you first open it and start diving in. Sure you can easily see how many times the app has been downloaded and how long a user is spending with the app but to really understand the metrics, start by asking yourself a few important questions.
Not all of these will be relevant to your app. It will depend o

                                        New HR and Financial OBIEE Dashboards and metrics allow State of Minnesota staff to have visibility into KPIs, insights in near real-time.
Real-World Challenge:
The State of Minnesota government is the gateway for providing direct government-to-citizen public service provision and interaction. The State needed assistance in replacing a legacy data warehouse built in the early 1990′s. This project operated out of Minnesota’s Management and Budget office. Many agencies depended on the data from MMB office —over five thousand users. The State of Minnesota decided to implement PeopleSoft Financial Supply Chain Management (FSCM) v9.1 and also do an upgrade of their PeopleSoft HCM ERP systems. While implementing these solutions, the data warehouse was also being replaced with PeopleSoft EPM v9.1 and OBI

Universal Analytics: When You Should Be Using hitCallback
                                     
                                        How do you know that your tracking beacon i.e. your event, virtual pageview, social interaction, is making it into Universal Analytics? You can look at real-time reports, and/or use a tool like HTTPFox (Firefox) or Google Analytics Debugger (Chrome) to monitor the request. In this blog post, I want to show you what the errors look like when a request doesn’t have enough time to make it to Universal Analytics and how we can GUARANTEE the request makes it to Universal Analytics every time.
The Issue
Once upon a time, I would see the request getting sent with NS_BINDING_ABORTED:

Limitations to Video on Android Devices
                                     
                                        

While most things are possible and supported on Android devices, there are some major limitations to video within an app. These limitations include:
Inline videos
An inline video is a video that plays within your app and does not open to full screen. These are very useful and we have used them to add interactive elements without acting like a full video. However, currently this is not possible for Android devices.
	Consider using a still image or an animation in Edge Animate instead.
Stop video on last image
Because the video will play full screen instead of inline, the image within your page will always show the im

	Ever since I’ve started speaking about SEO, I’ve always put up a blog post version of my talk so that people who were there can go back and reference it later and get a bit more detail than they would with just the slide deck alone. Today I’m keeping this tradition going with the blog post version of my SMX East 2013 talk on “Why Structured Data & Semantic SEO Are Important”. Sure it’s about a month late, but it was a crazy October. Enjoy!

                                        At the Google Analytics Summit 2013, Google announced that Google Tag Manager can now track event automatically. Whoop, my work here is done!

Power of Design
                                     
                                        

Today there was a lot of talk around our office about the look of iOS7.  It leaves me with the same feeling of overstimulation as I feel in a mall  —  with too many bright colors, too many sounds, too many flashing lights, all fighting for you attention. As we debated iOS7′s design success, I kept hearing the argument that I’d “get used to it”.
In contrast, tonight I treated myself to reading the latest issue of National Geographic on the iPad. It was a treat to enjoy a magazine when I wasn’t distracted. As I went through the issue (from front to back, something else I don’t do often) a tear ran down my face.

Google Analytics Virtual Pageviews a la Google Tag Manager
                                     
                                        It seems that everybody has an itch to jump on the Google Tag Manager bandwagon lately, which means learning yet another way to implement Google Analytic. We’ve been doing lots of Google Tag Manager analytics implementations, and although they are fun (yes I’m sick) and challenging, GTM is still relatively new, and documentation is sparse. So in an effort to increase the available resources for developers and implementors, I’ve put together a quick post on implementing Google Analytics Virtual Pageviews through Google Tag Manager. It’s a piece of cake.

                                        Over the past few years, external threats have increased significantly through the birth of hacktivism, a rise in Cyberwarfare activities, increases in computer theft, and spread of malicious software.  In the same span of time, we have experienced a boom in new technologies like social media, mobile devices, and cloud services.  Although these technologies provide great promise for reduced costs, increased productivity, and new business functionality, they also introduce serious vulnerabilities that must be mitigated.  All of these threats, and the security controls used to mitigate these threats, must be managed through an Information Security Management Program (ISMP); otherwise, the impact of security controls to the overall security posture of the organization may be diminished.  A good ISMP ensures the most optimum use

Reinventing the Retail Experience
                                     
                                        


	We’ve all used iPads to sign our credit card receipts. And most of us have ordered food on an iPad in a restaurant as well. But this week Nike is rolling out the first of two new in-store apps on the iPad. This is a significant event, similar to the installation of that first ATM — which forever changed our habits.
	 
	Now when you walk into a Nike flagship store, you will find an iPad mounted to the wall among a dozen sports bra choices. Tap its screen and it will help you determine exactly which sports bra will fit and support you best. And while this seems like a natural use for the iPad, it signals the beginning of a new retail experience that will rev

Top Five Reasons to Rethink the Mobile Experience of Your Corporate Magazines
                                     
                                        

Content consumption habits have radically shifted in the last few years, as well as content strategies for corporate publications. Magazine editors must keep in lock-step with how readers prefer to engage with content in print, online and on mobile devices. Preferences can be further differentiated for readers who consume content on smartphones vs. tablets that also must be taken into consideration.
As readers shift from one medium to another, they expect more than the availability of content on their devices. They also expect the experience of that content to be contextually relevant to the medium.
In our analysis of Fortune 500 companies that publish B2B and B2C corporate magazines, over 75% have ch

Future-Proof Your Google Analytics Implementation with Google Tag Manager
                                     
                                        There has been a lot of talk about Google Tag Manager (GTM) lately, Google even said that Google Tag Manager is serving twice the amount of traffic since April 2013, so I think it’s safe to say that GTM isn’t going anywhere.
If you don’t know what Google Tag Manager is, I’ll let Google explain what it does: “Google Tag Manager lets you add or update your website tags and mobile applications, easily and for free, whenever you want, without bugging the IT folks.” Yes, that’s right, without bugging the IT folks.
There are plenty of excellent resources for describing the functionality and features of

7 Strategies For Remarketing Lists for Search Ads (RLSA)
                                     
                                        Google AdWords has recently released out of beta their newest product feature, Remarketing Lists for Search Ads (RLSA). RLSA allows advertisers to combine their current Remarketing lists with search ads to bring intent, context, and audience together.

What exactly does that mean?

Building Brands with DPS
                                     
                                        

Recently Storycode attended Adobe’s Digital Publishing Summit in New York City. The first day focused on publications, the second on brands. What really struck a cord with me, was how in the course of a year, a platform that had been designed to help publications create digital editions was almost overshadowed by companies seeking an edge against their competition.
Fortune 500 companies have embraced tablets in staggering numbers, with 94 percent having deployed or in the process of deploying a tablet strategy. And the majority of those companies have identified that they need to have separate strategies for mobile and web. While publications continue to have what every brand wants (content and an

Chinese HACKERS attack U.S
                                     
                                        By now everyone has read the news about Chinese Hackers infiltrating U.S government websites. Unfortunately this has been happening for years.  Prior to these attacks there were instances where Chinese hackers attacked the U.S for fun and profit and U.S hackers have targeted China in the past due to their political stances on varying agendas primarily their views on human rights or lack there of. Why is this such news now?  The main reason is it seems that the attacks are more military targeted than any previous attacks.  The Chinese seem to blame the U.S for instigating these attacks because of the established United States Cyber Command Center.  They see this as an open invite it’s the you spy we spy mentality obviously whats good for us must also be good for the Chinese.  Ultimately what all this comes down to

I’ve been speaking a lot lately about what’s possible with DPS.

And it has left me with a rather dramatic realization.

Some of the most fevered chatter in SEO circles these days concerns semantic markup, specifically the newish toolkit called “schemas” that leverages a structured data vocabulary in order to deliver unprecedentedly rich and informative search results on results pages. This is universally considered one of the great emerging frontiers in search.

Tutorial: Google Analytics Core Reporting API using Magic Script
                                     
                                        Recently, I’ve had the opportunity to use the Google Analytics Core Reporting API, Nick Mihailovsk’s Google Analytics Report Automation (Magic) script, and Google Spreadsheets to automate a few of our clients’ monthly reports. Wow. What a time saver. Sure, the initial setup and configuration of the queries takes a little time, but it’s time that is recouped instantly when you go to run the report for the first time, and subsequent times, thereafter.
In this blog tutorial, I’m going to cover the configuration of the Google Analytics Core API Report Automation Script, and how to run a query using it.

Google Analytics – Universal Analytics Cheat Sheet
                                     
                                        
	If you couldn’t tell by now, I’m a big fan of simplifying and automating processes. As we’ve been starting to implement Universal Analytics alongside our clients’ current ga.js implementations, I’ve been spending a lot of time looking at Google’s analytics.js Dev Guide and Reference pages. Naturally, I wanted to have the analytics.js methods and fields closer and easier to find, so I thought it’d be helpful to create a Google spreadsheet cheat sheet for Universal Analytics.

How to Conduct a Social Media Competitive Analysis
                                     
                                        
As marketers, we are now living in a world where social media is fully integrated in our brand strategy and communication plan. We’re all using social and have a presence on the various social sites; it’s now time to start really analyzing what type of social communication is effective and what’s not. Because of its low cost, many times brands jump into social media without setting tactical goals or developing a strategic plan. This can be extremely harmful as social media is at its core, one of the most effective media vehicles to influence and engage with your customers. It’s also a valuable source of information for brands as it’s

AuthorRank for Brands
                                     
                                        AuthorRank is one of the hottest topics in SEO for 2013. The potential is huge and the advent of AuthorRank as a major factor in Google search ranking seems imminent. There’s one big unanswered question here, though. What about AuthorRank for brands? I wrote an extensive post about How to Prepare for AuthorRank on SEOmoz last year and, by far, the most common question was “can my business or brand get AuthorRank?”. In this post, we’ll explore the idea of AuthorRank for brands, whether it’s real, what we can expect in the near future, and what we can or can’t do to prepare for something like it.

DPS Publishing Tips: Fighting Android Fragmentation
                                     
                                        

A growing challenge for any tablet app, but especially for a magazine apps, is delivering the same quality content to a variety of devices. Android tablets presents the greatest challenge, having multiple screen dimensions, including three different sizes in the Kindle Fire family alone.
This problem is compounded by the differing system bars device manufactures bake into their customized versions of the Android OS. System bars vary as large as 75 pixels down to as small as zero pixels, meaning two devices with 1280×800 dimensions (the most popular Android tablet screen dimension) from different manufactures can actually require different renditions of an app. This can equate to dozens of different renditions.

Tablet Ownership Growing, Not Stopping
                                     
                                        

A survey by the Pew Internet and American Life Project, conducted in November 2012 and released in late December 2012, reports that 33 percent of Americans over the age of 16 now own a tablet or e-reader. This represents a 15 point jump from the December 2011 survey. While the overall statistics are interesting, it is the breakdown between tablet and e-reader ownership increases that are most important.

A Storycode Experiment: How to treat book-length copy in an app
                                     
                                        

Here at Storycode, we take pride in re-imagining narratives with our apps. Our goal is to produce apps for mobile devices that truly live in the intersection of content and dynamic user experience. Sometimes this means thinking about the components of our stories in new ways.
Since image-driven navigation is king on mobile devices, finding the right balance between a visual narrative and the written word is vital. While text is absolutely primary to the story, especially when adapting our apps from printed books, it can be secondary to the user experience, even when working within iBooks Author or InDesign DPS.

5 Tips for Successful App Design
                                     
                                        

1. Choosing the right platform - 
It comes down to one simple question: how much utility vs. design interactivity are you shooting for? Unless you answer that, you’re letting the platform dictate what is possible.
 
2. It’s not a website - 
The focus of an app is most successful when it is clear and narrow (think a pair of shoes, not a whole wardrobe). Recreating a website or trying to be all-inclusive makes no sense.
 
 3. Leverage your site -
In many cases a website/app combo can be the perfect compliment. For example, we recently created an app for an artist. Her work included both sculpture and print

Approaching the Mobile Experience in a CMS Project (CQ5)
                                     
                                        
	Two main points:

	It’s not about what the CMS is capable of doing; its more about what the business wants to achieve. A good CMS Technical Architect (TA) can draw that out early.
	If you don’t plan for mobile delivery upfront you might pay for it in the long run.

Commentary:
I have had several project managers and in-house technical architects ask mobile objective questions relatively late in the project life-cycle.
First off, it is difficult to retroactively adhere to some of these mobile techniques in CQ5 that are outlined by Adobe in their documentation and presentations. The key word is retroactively. Typically these are foundational business objectives to “mobilize the CQ site”. There are 2 dominant

RIM's Blackberry Isn't Dead Yet
                                     
                                        By Scott Anthony  Asian Operations Leader, Innosight. Via Harvard Business Review
It has been a rough few years for Research in Motion, the maker of the Blackberry line of mobile devices. Since Apple entered the mobile phone market, RIM’s financial situation has deteriorated and its market capitalization has plummeted by almost 95 percent since its mid-2008 peak of more than $100 billion. The company has brought in new leaders, but most pundits assume that the game is already over, and that it’s just a matter of time before we write RIM’s obituary.
Yet in September RIM reported that its subscriber base had grown to 80 million from 78 million. The company’s market share is still decreasing, but companies on death’s d

Hackers obtain 3.6 million Social Security numbers & Unencrypted Credit Cards
                                     
                                        Hackers were not only able to steal 3.6 million social security numbers, but they managed to steal an additional 16000 unencrypted credit card numbers. The hacker first attacked the system in August. This goes to show that many enterprises out there can be compromised for months and not even know it yet. This is why we always recommend a full recognizance of an enterprises network, and resources including all applications, and 3rd party connections. The fact that the credit card numbers on the server were in the clear shows a huge lack of security insight and potentially means that there are many other major security issues within that particular environment. Encrypting sensitive data properly is application security 101 and the fact that these things happen all the time shows exactly why enterprises like these need to proactively monitor

                                        Wells Fargo was reportedly attacked in the efforts of making a political statement these attacks amounted to the average DDoS(Distributed Denial of Service) attack that have been going on for years. The attack usually originates from outside the country of the attacking systems and are carried on by a botnet. A botnet is hundreds, and some times thousands of systems configured to carry out the same trivial routines in hopes that the distributed efforts of these systems would disrupt access to the victims servers in the form of over utilized bandwidth or a concentrated attack to a particular server function or service.  Properly programmed firewalls typically play the first role of defense in these types of attacks, but now new problems arise that carry old consequences and this is due to the ever changing landscape of online self ser

The ability to get your picture in Google search results was the big thing last year. With the rollout of Google+, the world’s leading search engine started promoting a simple(r) way for people to link their online identity to their digital content. This lead to the rise of Author Rich Snippets!
A Wild Rich Snippet Appears!

They have managed to avoid the security conference for 15 years and when they finally decided to attend their briefings seemed to be nothing more than regurgitated snip-lets from old documents and RFC’s the talk itself compared to the other Blackhat talks like “Owning bad guys {and mafia} with javascript botnets” was uninspired and did not go into any real deep detail on iOS security, and the future of how iOs will handle different security issues with that being said the Apple security team did not even stay for the after lecture Q&A session they side shuffled out a side door n

Yahoo Passwords Hacked
                                     
                                        Yahoo fails to perform proper Application Security Auditing which leads to Yahoo Email being Hacked
Yahoo email services was hacked by a group calling itself “D33D” over 450,000 emails were compromised. The hackers used an SQL injection attack to gain access an older password file on Yahoo’s system. The passwords in this file apparently were not salted just like Linked-In. SQL injection exploits the ability for an attacker to input SQL commands into a query and have them execute because there is no validation. I noticed no other content about this hack really shows how it was done so consider the following SQL query within the following URL http://mail.hackedsite.com/index.asp?id=10 UNION SELECT TOP 1 password FROM admin_login where login_name=’y@hoogle’— This will attempt to use an

Sales Reps Should Avoid Customers Who Are Ready to Buy
                                     
                                        The phone rings at your desk — it’s a big potential customer and they want you to come in and make a presentation. They have budget approval and consensus, up to the highest levels of the organization, to move forward on a major purchase. Their specs line up perfectly with what your company can deliver.  And, you’re on the customer’s shortlist — they’ve narrowed it down to you and two of your biggest competitors.
Sounds great, right? The customer’s put the ball on the tee and all you need to do is make a good swing.
But ask a star-performing salesperson what she thinks of this and you’ll find that she doesn’t see it as a good opportunity at all.  As we discuss in our recent

Dealing with DNS Changer
                                     
                                        DNS Changer is a malware that attackers use to modify a users DNS settings to a separate set of rouge DNS servers this is critical because an attacker that controls your DNS server also controls the content that is served to the user this makes it possible for attackers to use your sessions to unintentionally surf sites that contain other malicious content. One major issue that can occur is web-masking which could potentially allow an attacker to route websites that you browse on a daily basis to their own mock sites for example online banking sites, email, social network sites. Prior to this being used for malicious use it was primarily used by attackers to control the ad settings for search sessions. Controlling your search session would allow an attacker to embed ad network affiliate id’s that would allow them to earn money off o

Military enlists Invincea to beef up Android security
                                     
                                        The military is beefing up security on Android based smart devices and has even issued a grant for $21 million dollars this enhances security around data as it sits at rest on these devices. A few things that need to be considered that I have not seen mentioned in these efforts is how the integrity of data from these devices will be managed in transit. It’s one thing to secure data once it’s on a device it’s another thing to ensure and validate data once it leaves the device. One must consider the critical nature of this content especially as it is being used in a military setting. Are the proper protocols in place to secure encrypt and encapsulate data as it being delivered from one device to another? Other things to consider is what if these devices are lost in battle or perhaps during a trip home by a military personal to v

Using XMLBeans in Adobe CQ
                                     
                                        Apache XMLBeans is a powerful tool for reading, writing and updating XML files.  XMLBeans dynamically creates Java classes based on an XSD Schema.  This makes it powerful and easy to use, however can make it more complicated to integrate into OSGi based applications, such as Adobe CQ, as the XML Element to Java Class mapping uses the Java Classloader.
This guide shows you how to integrate XMLBeans in your Adobe CQ application.
 
Step 1: Install XMLBeans Bundle

Creating a Column Control in Adobe CQ
                                     
                                        Column Controls in Adobe CQ allow authors to easily create and configure column-based layouts.  This guide shows advanced users and developers how to create and configure a column control.
 
Step 1: Add a Parsys to a Component JSP
Include a Paragraph System into the page’s component JSP.  You can use any node name for the path, the resource type is ‘foundation/components/parsys’
&lt;cq:includepath="par"resourceType="foundation/components/parsys "/>
Step 2: Configure the Paragraph System
To add a Column Control to the Paragraph System, you will first need to update the design.  Select design mode on the sidekick.
Design mode allows you to configure the Paragraph System for all pages with the same template.  Onc

CQ Project Planning: Development Strategy
                                     
                                        Several questions come up to me consistently while I move from client to client as a technical PM or solution architect. I felt compelled to list my responses to these questions so that you ask yourself the same questions every time you approach a new CQ5 project. MY response questions often lead to longer brainstorming sessions. Here are a few situations.

	Components
		
			Initial Topic:
				
					What gets “componentized” versus consumed, integrated or remain separated with regard to CQ5?
				
			
			My Response:
				
					How reusable is this functionality?
					What is the current life-cycle of this development? How frequently is it changed?
					How modular does this need to be?
					Will this functionality be replaced by another

CQ Scheduling Basics
                                     
                                        In CQ there are a few ways to perform a scheduled action.  I will go over basics for the easiest way to achieve this, a custom class running a cron expressions to fire off a run() method.
An alternative to this tutorial would be to create a scheduled or event workflow that is triggered at a specific time, I won’t go over this but as with most things there is usually more than one way to reach your goal.
Scheduling in CQ uses the open source Quartz library, part Sling Commons:‘org.apache.sling.commons.scheduler.Scheduler’.  The scheduler can be used in two ways, by registering a job method or even more simply by using the scheduler’s whiteboard pattern supported by scheduler’s API.
Let’s begin, we will start with the more simple of the two ways to use scheduler in a

	6 Core Competencies You Need When Starting a Business Intelligence (BI) Solution
Varner, Big Data Senior Solution Architect
If your company stores large amounts of data, it surely would benefit from implementing a BI solution. BI solutions, when implemented properly, provide your business with meaningful and accurate insights by retrieving the data you want in a timely manner. That is all fine and good in theory, but where should your business begin? Can you report off of your current billing source, ad server, or any other source of data? What is the best way to store data and what tools should we use to produce reports? How do we know the data we are getting is accurate? Does our solution scale? The questions can and will go on and on.
One of the main goals of a BI project is

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Forward-Looking Statements  This section and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as "future," "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "expects," "intends," "plans," "predicts," "will," "would," "could," "can," "may," and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company's actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading "Risk Factors," which are incorporated herein by reference. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Overview  6D Global Technologies, Inc. is a digital business solutions company serving the digital marketing and technology needs of global organizations. 6D Global's services and products enable clients to create, measure, and optimize digital experiences for their audiences across marketing channels and devices. These solutions help clients reduce the cost of content delivery and increase the return on their investments in digital communication. 6D Global's digital technology services include consulting, web experience and content management, analytics, creative interfaces, mobile solutions, managed marketing services, and IT infrastructure staffing.  Strategically, 6D Global is focused primarily on becoming a deep subject matter expert across multiple touchpoints in the digital marketing and technology ecosystem, helping Chief Marketing Officers and Chief Information Officers drive critical change and growth for their organizations. Expanding our geographical operations including a new office in Dublin, Ireland opened in 2015 to facilitate twenty-four hour seven days a week support for our clients.  6D Global offers holistic information technology ("IT") solutions for almost every aspect of its clients' operations from supply chain, to analytics, to content management, and information security. 6D Global began as an IT consultancy serving the enterprise resource planning, or ERP, market - specializing primarily in the market-leading software applications vendor at that time, PeopleSoft. We have since evolved into new focus areas, particularly since 2012, increasing the breadth of our offerings to include other essential information technology needs of today's enterprises. Each new practice we have launched is in a growing or emerging technology sector. Currently, 6D Global's business units provide business-to-business IT solutions in the form of professional services and managed services in the IT solutions industry. 6D Global's present portfolio of service offerings includes: Mobile Application Development; Digital & Content Management; Marketing Data Analysis; Marketing and Creative Solutions; and IT Infrastructure Staffing. We predominantly provide our services under time-and-material contracts and recognize revenues as services are provided.  Our market today includes predominantly mid-sized to Fortune 500 commercial, nonprofit, and public sector enterprises across virtually all industries, including, but not limited to, healthcare, consumer, education, government, manufacturing, and high tech. Because organizations in virtually every sector of the economy perform or need the functions we support, we pursue opportunities across nearly all sectors. Our contractual arrangements can vary in length of time based on our client's requirements and our services are extended on a regular basis as client's needs change and grow. We continually recruit to increase our workforce and enhance our ability to staff existing and new contracts. The effectiveness of our utilization of the workforce and continued investment in future growth may impact overall results.  On September 29, 2014, CleanTech consummated a share exchange (the "Exchange") with Six Dimensions, Inc. pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Share Exchange, dated as of June 13, 2013 between CleanTech, Six Dimensions and the shareholders of Six Dimensions. The Exchange is being treated as a reverse recapitalization effected by a share exchange for financial accounting and reporting purposes, since substantially all of CleanTech's operations were disposed of prior to the consummation of the transaction. 6D Global is treated as the accounting acquirer as its stockholders control 6D Global after the Exchange Agreement, even though CleanTech was the legal acquirer. As a result, the assets and liabilities and the historical operations that are reflected in these financial statements are those of 6D Global as if 6D Global had always been the reporting company and, on the date of the Exchange Agreement, changed its name and reorganized its capital stock. Since CleanTech had no operations upon the Exchange Agreement taking place, the transaction was treated as a reverse recapitalization for accounting purposes and no goodwill or other intangible assets were recorded by us as a result of the Exchange Agreement.  Table of Contents  On September 29, 2014, in connection with the Exchange, we completed a private placement equity offering to accredited investors from which we received $4,556,100 in gross proceeds and issued 2,201,031 shares of Common Stock. On November 21, 2014, 6D Global completed an additional private placement equity offering to accredited investors from which we raised $1,052,498 in gross proceeds, and issued 508,453 shares of Common Stock.  On August 10, 2015, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement ("SPA") with a single institutional investor pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell 1,088 shares of the Company's newly designated Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company, par value $0.00001 per share (the "Redeemable Preferred Stock"), convertible into shares of the Company's Common Stock, at a fixed conversion price of $5.25 per share, at a purchase price of $10,000 per share with an 8% original issue discount, for total gross proceeds of $10.0 million, or the sale of approximately $10.88 million. The agreement carries a dividend rate that amounts to 8.5% per annum subject to certain upward or downward adjustments based upon the market value of the Company's Common Stock, with a maximum dividend rate of 17.0% and a minimum dividend rate of 0.0%. In addition, the dividend increased by 10 percentage points as a result of the suspension and delisting of our common stock. Upon conversion, the Company shall pay the holders of the Redeemable Preferred Stock being converted a conversion premium equal to the amount of dividends that such shares would have otherwise received if they had been held through the dividend maturity date. The Redeemable Preferred Stock will mature seven years following the issuance date, at which time such shares will automatically convert into shares of Common Stock.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP, and our discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require our management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 4, "Significant and Critical Accounting Policies and Practices" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material.  Management believes our critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, allowances, leases and income taxes, complex financial instruments, business combinations and related goodwill and intangible assets.  Revenue Recognition  We provide our services primarily under time-and-materials contracts. Revenues earned under time-and-material arrangements are recognized as services are provided. We recognize revenue from the provision of professional services when it is realized or realizable and earned. We consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. Appropriate allowances for returns and discounts are recorded concurrent with revenue recognition.  In accordance with U.S. GAAP guidance, Income Statement Characterization of Reimbursement Received for Out-of-Pocket Expenses, we classify reimbursed expenses as revenue and the related expense within cost of revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.  For fixed price service arrangements, we apply the proportional performance model or a ratable model to recognize revenue. When customer acceptance provisions exist, we are generally able to reliably demonstrate that the service meets, or will meet upon completion, the customer acceptance criteria. If circumstances exist which prevent us from verifying compliance with the acceptance provisions until the service has been completed, revenue is not recognized until compliance can be verified.  Revenues recognized in excess of the amounts invoiced to clients are classified as unbilled revenues in our consolidated balance sheets.  We may record deferred revenue in circumstances where the customer's contract calls for pre-billing of services. Amounts in deferred revenue are realized when the services are performed and the criteria noted above are met.  Table of Contents  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  Management's estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on historical sales, historical loss levels, and an analysis of the collectability of individual accounts, and general economic conditions that may affect a client's ability to pay. We evaluated the key factors and assumptions used to develop the allowance in determining that it is reasonable in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole. Although we believe the estimates we have made are reasonable, because they are based on estimates and judgment, they are inherently uncertain. We have not experienced any significant adjustments; however, unknown factors or changes in the economy may affect our client's ability to process payments timely in the future.  Leases  Lease agreements are evaluated to determine if they are capital leases meeting any of the following criteria at inception: (a) transfer of ownership; (b) bargain purchase option; (c) lease term is equal to 75 percent or more of the estimated economic life of the leased property; or (d) present value at the beginning of the lease term of the minimum lease payments, excluding that portion of the payments representing executory costs such as insurance, maintenance, and taxes to be paid by the lessor, including any profit thereon, equals or exceeds 90 percent of the excess of the fair value of the leased property to the lessor at lease inception over any related investment tax credit retained by the lessor and expected to be realized by the lessor.  If at its inception a lease meets any of the four lease criteria above, the lease is classified by the lessee as a capital lease; and if none of the four criteria are met, the lease is classified by the lessee as an operating lease.  Income Taxes  We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. This approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities of the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. The U.S. GAAP guidance for income taxes prescribes a two-step approach for the financial statement recognition and measurement of income tax positions taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. The first step evaluates an income tax position in order to determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. The second step measures the benefit to be recognized in the financial statements for those income tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold. U.S. GAAP also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, recognition and classification of interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosers and transition. Under U.S. GAAP, we may recognize a previously unrecognized tax benefits if the tax position is effectively (rather than "ultimately") settled through examination, negotiation or litigation. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts and circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues, and new audit activity. Any changes in these factors could result in changes to a tax benefit or tax provision.  Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock  We account for our Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock ("Redeemable Preferred Stock") under the provisions of Accounting Series Release 268, SEC Comments and Interpretations ("ASR 268"), ASC 505 - Equity, ASC 480 - Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity and ASC 815 - Derivatives and Hedging. Accordingly, these shares along with the embedded conversion feature, the redemption feature, and the conversion feature are all part of temporary equity ("mezzanine equity") in our Consolidated Balance Sheets based upon the terms and conditions of the Stock Purchase Agreement ("SPA"). In accordance with ASC 480 the initial carrying amount of Redeemable Preferred Stock is equal to the amount of proceeds received upon issuance, as reduced for the derivative liability associated with the dividend anti-dilution protection and a conversion premium which has been bifurcated.  Business Combinations  We account for business combinations under the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 805-10, Business Combinations ("ASC 805-10"), which requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including non-controlling interests, are recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. ASC 805-10 also specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of the tangible net assets and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combinations and are expensed as incurred. If the business combination provides for contingent consideration, we record the contingent consideration at fair value at the acquisition date and any changes in fair value after the acquisition date are accounted for as measurement-period adjustments. Changes in fair value of contingent consideration resulting from events after the acquisition date, such as earn-outs, are recognized as follows:  Table of Contents  The multi-period excess earnings method used to value customer relationships requires the use of assumptions, the most significant of which include: the remaining useful life, expected revenue, survivor curve, earnings before interest and tax margins, marginal tax rate, contributory asset charges, discount rate and tax amortization benefit.  The most significant assumptions under the relief of royalty method used to value trade names include: estimated remaining useful life, expected revenue, royalty rate, tax rate, discount rate and tax amortization benefit. The discounted cash flow method used to value non-compete agreements includes assumptions such as: expected revenue, term of the non-compete agreements, probability and ability to compete, operating margin, tax rate and discount rate. Management has developed these assumptions on the basis of historical knowledge of the business and projected financial information of the Company. These assumptions may vary based on future events, perceptions of different market participants and other factors outside the control of management, and such variations may be significant to estimated values.  The discounted cash flow valuation method requires the use of assumptions, the most significant of which include: future revenue growth, future earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, estimated synergies to be achieved by a market participant as a result of the business combination, marginal tax rate, terminal value growth rate, weighted average cost of capital and discount rate.  Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets  Goodwill, which represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, is carried at cost. Goodwill is not amortized; rather, it is subject to a periodic assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test. Goodwill is assessed for impairment on an annual basis as of October 1st of each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. When conducting its annual goodwill impairment assessment, Management initially performs a qualitative evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired. If it is determined by a qualitative evaluation that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, we then apply a two-step impairment test. In the first step, we determine the fair value of the Company's reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis. If the net book values of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we would then perform the second step of the impairment test which requires allocation of the reporting unit's fair value to all of its assets and liabilities using the acquisition method prescribed under authoritative guidance for business combinations. Any residual fair value is being allocated to goodwill.  An impairment charge is recognized only when the implied fair value of the Company's reporting unit's goodwill is less than its carrying amount.  Long-Lived Assets, Including Definite-Lived Intangible Assets  Long-lived assets, other than goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows derived from such assets.  Definite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of trade names, non-compete agreements and customer relationships. Definite-lived assets are principally amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. For long-lived assets used in operations, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset's carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted, probability-weighted future cash flows. Management measures the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value. When an impairment exists, the related assets are written down to fair value.  Results of Operations  The following paragraphs set forth our results of operations for the periods presented. The period-to-period comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of future results.  Table of Contents  Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 The following table sets forth the summary statements of operations for the periods indicated: Years Ended December 31, Dollar Percentage 2015 2014 Increase/(Decrease) Increase/(Decrease) Revenues $ 12,789,892 $ 11,797,813 $ 992,079 8 % Cost of revenues 7,728,244 7,425,857 302,387 4 % Gross margin 5,061,648 4,371,956 689,692 16 % Operating expenses 13,056,284 3,878,075 9,178,209 237 % Other expense, net 9,568,512 184,571 9,383,941 5,084 % Income tax benefit 451,858 161,255 290,603 180 % Net (loss) income $ (17,111,290 ) $ 470,565 $ (17,581,855 ) (3,736 )%  Revenues  Our revenue increased by approximately 8% to $12,789,892 during the year December 31, 2015, from $11,797,813 during the year ended December 31, 2014. Revenues generated by two major segments of our business, Content Management Systems ("CMS") and Information Technology Staffing ("IT Staffing"), were 88% and 12% respectively. The increase in revenue was primarily due to an increase in the number of professional service projects and contracts with newly added clients as well as clients of the acquired businesses of 28% offset by the decrease in revenues from existing clients of 20% predominately related to the decrease of IT Staffing clients as we focus on the digital marketing service offerings. We continue to expand our services being offered in multiple areas of the digital marketing segment through organic efforts and acquisitions and our sales and marketing efforts continue to lend to our ability to win more business. 6D Global is primarily focused on digital technology solutions and becoming a one stop provider to Chief Marketing Officers. We anticipate these digital marketing service offerings will continue to drive growth in our client base and sales results.  Cost of revenues  Our cost of revenues increased by approximately 4% to $7,728,244 during the year ended December 31, 2015, from $7,425,857 during the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in cost of revenues was primarily a result of additional consultative staff hired through recruiting efforts and acquired companies to increase our ability to provide service to our clients reflected by increase in sales and share based compensation related to employee stock option grants. We continually monitor the utilization of our salaried billable consultants.  The cost of revenues for the CMS and IT staffing segment were $6,492,446 and $1,235,798, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015. The cost of revenues for the CMS and IT staffing segment were $3,620,396 and $3,805,461, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014.  Gross Margin  Our gross profit margin was 40% and 37% during the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our gross margin increased due to a change in the mix of professional services in the project-based work provided to our clients in digital market space that realize higher gross margins, versus staffing solutions and service in other markets, partially offset by additional expense related to share based compensation from employee stock option grants. We continually monitor the utilization of our salaried billable consultants as changes will directly affect the number of billable hours in a billing cycle, therefore causing fluctuations in gross margin percentages.  The gross margin for the CMS and IT staffing segment were $4,737,208 and $324,440, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015. The cost of revenues for the CMS and IT staffing segment were $3,243,563 and $1,128,393, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014.  Operating Expenses  Our operating expenses encompass selling general and administrative expenses consisting primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel and costs related to our facilities, finance, human resources, information technology and fees for professional services. Professional services are principally comprised of outside legal, audit, information technology consulting, marketing and outsourcing services as well as the costs related to being a publicly traded company.  Table of Contents  � An increase in compensation and related expenses of $2,981,000, related to additional executive, management, and sales positions to provide proper infrastructure and foster growth as well as additional staff from the acquired companies. Also additional compensation expense associated with the acquisitions to the principals for remaining employed for the first year.  � An increase of selling general and administrative expenses due to an increase of $929,558 in costs relating to travel, sales activity, and marketing associated with efforts to grow our business.  � An increase in insurance costs and fees for services related to preparing public filings and other activities associated with being a publicly traded company of $169,235.  � An increase of stock based compensation of $1,424,672 related to stock grants and stock options under the Company's Omnibus Incentive Plan implemented in 2015.  � An increase in costs related to rent from acquisitions and office expansions of $618,496.  � An increase in costs related to office expenditures from the acquisitions and office expansions, employee training, and software systems used by us associated with efforts to grow the business.  . . .
