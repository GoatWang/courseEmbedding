Pritzker, Duchossois families do a deal


Renewing a business relationship they've had for decades, the wealthy Chicago Pritzker and Duchossois families are doing a deal that will make them joint owners of a company.Elmhurst-based Duchossois Group Inc. sold a controlling stake in Eden Prairie, Minn.-based flat-screen mount company Milestone AV Technologies to Chicago-based Pritzker Group, led by brothers J.B. and Tony Pritzker. Duchossois Group retains a “significant interest” and representatives on Milestone's board, according to a news release from Pritzker Group Private Capital, that company's private-equity investment arm. For the Duchossois family, the sale comes just two days after it announced it would seek to diversify its investments by moving some capital away from its wholly owned business operations, which include Milestone, and inject more money into other types of assets, such as real estate or startups. CONSIDERING THIRD GENERATIONIt's all part of the family taking into consideration the interests of its third generation, said CEO Craig Duchossois, 69, whose father, Richard Duchossois, 92, founded the family business. At Pritzker Group, the transaction is in keeping with J.B. and Tony's plans to do more private-equity deals and build up their corporate portfolio.While the two companies aren't announcing the price paid, Pritzker Group typically makes investments of between $100 million and $500 million, and this purchase is toward the higher end of that range, said Pritzker Group Private Capital Investment Partner Michael Nelson.The two families have known each other for some 40 years, with Richard Duchossois, Robert Pritzker and Jay Pritzker — who are J.B. and Tony's uncles — socializing years ago in the Young Presidents' Organization. Then in the 1980s and 1990s, Duchossois Group, as owners of the Thrall Car Manufacturing Co., sold some $1 billion in rail freight cars to Marmon Group, which the Pritzkers formerly owned.“To do this deal, everyone understood that there was a longer personal relationship between the two families, as well as J.B. and me,” Craig Duchossois said in an interview, noting that both sides knew there would be “no surprises” and that they would “negotiate very hard.” 'A HANDSHAKE IS SOLID'“That's one of the things that J.B. and I are proud of, is that a handshake is solid,” he said.  As part of its investment diversification plan, Duchossois Group, best-known for its horse racetrack holdings such as Churchill Downs, created a new investment arm, Duchossois Capital Management LLC.In recent years, Craig and his father “decided we had too much of the company tied up in illiquid operating companies” and preferred to have more access to cash in more diverse strategies, Craig Duchossois said. The company has five members of the next generation involved in the business and they are 20-plus years younger, he said. “It just made sense to reduce our level of risk and broaden our investment strategies,” Mr. Duchossois said.POTENTIAL PORTFOLIO DOUBLINGPritzker Group hired Paul Carbone from Robert W. Baird & Co. last year to lead the charge in what they expect will potentially be a doubling of their corporate portfolio in the next few years. Since then, the group has hired a cadre of advisers and, in January, it bought Omaha, Neb.-based agriculture equipment company Intersystems.Milestone makes mounted platforms that hold flat-screen panels in business settings, such as the menu displays at some fast-food restaurants, and also for consumers through big-box retailers such as Target and Sears and even home theater dealers. The products are sold under the Chief, Da-Lite and Sanus brands.Duchossois Group Chief Operating Officer Bob Fealy, who has overseen Milestone and other Duchossois businesses, said the sale was a means to help Milestone “grow more aggressively.” The new owners group already has some potential acquisitions in mind, he said. Duchossois Group bought Milestone in 2008 and expanded it in 2011 by buying Da-Lite for about $200 million, he said. Currently, it has manufacturing operations in the U.S., Europe and China and sells products mainly in the U.S. to commercial users. While Mr. Nelson, who leads Pritzker's manufactured products division, wouldn't disclose Milestone's annual revenue or headcount, he said Pritzker Group has no plans to cut jobs. “We certainly expect to grow the business,” said Mr. Nelson, who joined Pritzker Group Private Capital a year ago. The new owners also plan to keep the Milestone management team led by CEO Scott Gill, who is also part of a management owner group.
