http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170622005270/en/
Diluted earnings per share were $1.05, including the impact of a pension 
      settlement charge of $510 million, pre-tax, or $0.47 per share, in 
      connection with the companys previously disclosed termination of its 
      U.S. pension plan. Excluding this charge, diluted earnings per share 
      were $1.52, compared with $1.41 for the third quarter last year.
Operating income for the quarter was $865 million, or 9.8 percent of net 
      revenues, including the $510 million pension settlement charge. 
      Excluding this charge, operating income was $1.38 billion, or 15.5 
      percent of net revenues, compared with $1.31 billion, or 15.5 percent of 
      net revenues for the third quarter last year.
New bookings for the quarter were $9.8 billion, with record consulting 
      bookings of $5.2 billion and outsourcing bookings of $4.6 billion.
Pierre Nanterme, Accentures chairman and CEO, said, "We are pleased 
      with our strong third-quarter financial results. We delivered 7 percent 
      revenue growth in local currency and gained significant market share, 
      with broad-based growth across most dimensions of our business. I am 
      particularly pleased with our new bookings of $9.8 billion, which 
      demonstrate that our services and capabilities continue to be highly 
      differentiated in the marketplace.
"We are clearly benefiting from the diversity of our business - from an 
      industry, geographic and capability standpoint - which drives durability 
      in our financial performance. At the same time, our focused investments 
      in high-growth areas, such as digital, cloud and security services, are 
      further differentiating Accenture and enabling us to grow ahead of the 
      market. We remain very well-positioned to continue driving profitable 
      growth and delivering value for our clients and shareholders."
Financial Review
Revenues before reimbursements ("net revenues") for the third quarter of 
      fiscal 2017 were $8.87 billion, compared with $8.43 billion for the 
      third quarter of fiscal 2016, an increase of 5 percent in U.S. dollars 
      and 7 percent in local currency. Net revenues for the quarter reflect a 
      foreign-exchange impact of approximately negative 2 percent, compared 
      with the negative 2.5 percent impact we had previously assumed. 
      Adjusting for the actual foreign-exchange impact, the companys guided 
      range for quarterly net revenues was approximately $8.70 billion to 
      $8.95 billion. Accentures third quarter fiscal 2017 net revenues were 
      in the upper end of this adjusted range.
•
        Consulting net revenues for the quarter were $4.82 billion, an 
        increase of 4 percent in U.S. dollars and 6 percent in local currency 
        compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2016.
•
        Outsourcing net revenues were $4.05 billion, an increase of 6 percent 
        in U.S. dollars and 7 percent in local currency over the third quarter 
        of fiscal 2016.
Diluted EPS for the quarter were $1.05, compared with $1.41 for the 
      third quarter last year. The pension settlement charge had a negative 
      $0.47 impact on EPS in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Excluding this 
      charge, EPS for the quarter were $1.52, an increase of $0.11 from the 
      third quarter last year. The $0.11 increase in EPS on an adjusted basis 
      reflects:
--
        a $0.07 increase from higher revenue and operating results;
--
        a $0.02 increase from higher non-operating income; and
--
        a $0.02 increase from a lower share count.
Gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of net revenues) for the 
      quarter was 32.8 percent, compared with 31.9 percent for the third 
      quarter last year. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses 
      for the quarter were $1.53 billion, or 17.3 percent of net revenues,

Returning Cash to Shareholders
Accenture continues to return cash to shareholders through cash 
      dividends and share repurchases.
Dividend
On May 15, 2017, a semi-annual cash dividend of $1.21 per share was paid 
      on Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares to shareholders of record at 
      the close of business on April 13, 2017 and on Accenture Holdings plc 
      ordinary shares to shareholders of record at the close of business on 
      April 10, 2017.
Combined with the semi-annual cash dividend of $1.21 per share paid on 
      Nov. 15, 2016, this brings the total dividend payments for the fiscal 
      year to $2.42 per share, for total cash dividend payments of 
      approximately $1.57 billion.
Share Repurchase Activity
During the third quarter of fiscal 2017, Accenture repurchased or 
      redeemed 4.9 million shares, including 4.6 million shares repurchased in 
      the open market, for a total of $589 million. This brings Accentures 
      total share repurchases and redemptions for the first three quarters of 
      fiscal 2017 to 16.9 million shares, including 13.7 million shares 
      repurchased in the open market, for a total of $1.99 billion.
Accentures total remaining share repurchase authority at May 31, 2017 
      was approximately $3.7 billion.
At May 31, 2017, Accenture had approximately 646 million total shares 
      outstanding, including 618 million Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares 
      and minority holdings of 28 million shares (Accenture Holdings plc

Business Outlook
Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2017
Accenture expects net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 to 
      be in the range of $8.85 billion to $9.10 billion, 5 percent to 8 
      percent growth in local currency, reflecting the companys assumption of 
      a negative 0.5 percent foreign-exchange impact compared with the fourth 
      quarter of fiscal 2016.
Fiscal Year 2017
Accentures business outlook for the full 2017 fiscal year now assumes 
      that the foreign-exchange impact on its results in U.S. dollars will be 
      negative 1 percent compared with fiscal 2016; the previous 
      foreign-exchange assumption was negative 2 percent.
For fiscal 2017, the company now expects net revenue growth to be in the 
      range of 6 percent to 7 percent in local currency, compared with 6 
      percent to 8 percent previously.
In May 2017, the company recorded a settlement charge of approximately 
      $510 million, pre-tax, in connection with the termination of its U.S. 
      pension plan. This settlement charge will reduce the companys fiscal 
      2017 diluted GAAP EPS by approximately $0.47 and its full-year GAAP 
      operating margin by approximately 150 basis points. The company 
      previously expected the settlement charge to be approximately $425 
      million, pre-tax; to reduce its fiscal 2017 diluted GAAP EPS by 
      approximately $0.39; and to reduce its full-year GAAP operating margin 
      by approximately 120 basis points.
Accenture now expects diluted GAAP EPS to be in the range of $5.37 to 
      $5.44, including the $0.47 impact of the pension settlement charge. 
      Excluding the settlement charge, the company now expects EPS to be in 
      the range of $5.84 to $5.91. The company previously expected diluted EPS 
      to be in the range of $5.31 to $5.48 on a GAAP basis and $5.70 to $5.87 
      on an adjusted basis.
Accenture now expects GAAP operating margin for the full fiscal year to 
      be approximately 13.3 percent, including the estimated 150 basis-point 
      impact of the pension settlement charge. Excluding the settlement 
      charge, the company now expects operating margin to be approximately 
      14.8 percent - an expansion of 20 basis points from fiscal 2016. The 
      company previously expected operating margin to be in the range of 13.5 
      percent to 13.7 percent on a GAAP basis and 14.7 percent to 14.9 percent 
      on an adjusted basis.
For fiscal 2017, the company continues to expect operating cash flow to 
      be in the range of $4.6 billion to $4.9 billion; property and equipment 
      additions to be $600 million; and free cash flow to be in the range of 
      $4.0 billion to $4.3 billion.
Accenture now expects the GAAP annual effective tax rate to be in the 
      range of 20.5 percent to 21.5 percent. Excluding the impact of the 
      settlement charge, the company now expects its annual effective tax rate 
      to be in the range of 22.5 percent to 23.5 percent. The company 
      previously expected its annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 
      21 percent to 23 percent on a GAAP basis and 22 percent to 24 percent on 
      an adjusted basis.

      include, without limitation, risks that: the companys results of 
      operations could be adversely affected by volatile, negative or 
      uncertain economic conditions and the effects of these conditions on the 
      companys clients businesses and levels of business activity; the 
      companys business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing, 
      profitable client demand for the companys services and solutions, 
      including through the adaptation and expansion of its services and 
      solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings, 
      and a significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to 
      the changing technological environment could materially affect the 
      companys results of operations; if the company is unable to keep its 
      supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the 
      world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership 
      skills, the companys business, the utilization rate of the companys

      adversely affected; the markets in which the company competes are highly 
      competitive, and the company might not be able to compete effectively; 
      the company could have liability or the companys reputation could be 
      damaged if the company fails to protect client and/or company data from 
      security breaches or cyberattacks; the companys profitability could 
      materially suffer if the company is unable to obtain favorable pricing 
      for its services and solutions, if the company is unable to remain 
      competitive, if its cost-management strategies are unsuccessful or if it 
      experiences delivery inefficiencies; changes in the companys level of 
      taxes, as well as audits, investigations and tax proceedings, or changes 
      in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, could have a 
      material adverse effect on the companys effective tax rate, results of 
      operations, cash flows and financial condition; the companys results of 
      operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in 
      foreign currency exchange rates; the companys business could be

      companys work with government clients exposes the company to additional 
      risks inherent in the government contracting environment; the company 
      might not be successful at identifying, acquiring, investing in or 
      integrating businesses, entering into joint ventures or divesting 
      businesses; the companys Global Delivery Network is increasingly 
      concentrated in India and the Philippines, which may expose it to 
      operational risks; as a result of the companys geographically diverse 
      operations and its growth strategy to continue geographic expansion, the 
      company is more susceptible to certain risks; adverse changes to the 
      companys relationships with key alliance partners or in the business of 
      its key alliance partners could adversely affect the companys results 
      of operations; the companys services or solutions could infringe upon 
      the intellectual property rights of others or the company might lose its 
      ability to utilize the intellectual property of others; if the company

      use or infringement by third parties, its business could be adversely 
      affected; the companys ability to attract and retain business and 
      employees may depend on its reputation in the marketplace; if the 
      company is unable to manage the organizational challenges associated

      objectives; any changes to the estimates and assumptions that the 
      company makes in connection with the preparation of its consolidated 
      financial statements could adversely affect its financial results; many 
      of the companys contracts include payments that link some of its fees

      company to meet specific service levels, which could increase the 
      variability of the companys revenues and impact its margins; the 
      companys results of operations and share price could be adversely 
      affected if it is unable to maintain effective internal controls; the

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Accenture (NYSE:ACN) reported financial results for the third quarter of 
      fiscal 2017, ended May 31, 2017, with net revenues of $8.9 billion, an 
      increase of 5 percent in U.S. dollars and 7 percent in local currency 
      over the same period last year.
    


      Diluted earnings per share were $1.05, including the impact of a pension 
      settlement charge of $510 million, pre-tax, or $0.47 per share, in 
      connection with the company’s previously disclosed termination of its 
      U.S. pension plan. Excluding this charge, diluted earnings per share 
      were $1.52, compared with $1.41 for the third quarter last year.
    

      Operating income for the quarter was $865 million, or 9.8 percent of net 
      revenues, including the $510 million pension settlement charge. 
      Excluding this charge, operating income was $1.38 billion, or 15.5 
      percent of net revenues, compared with $1.31 billion, or 15.5 percent of 
      net revenues for the third quarter last year.
    

      New bookings for the quarter were $9.8 billion, with record consulting 
      bookings of $5.2 billion and outsourcing bookings of $4.6 billion.
    

      Pierre Nanterme, Accenture’s chairman and CEO, said, “We are pleased 
      with our strong third-quarter financial results. We delivered 7 percent 
      revenue growth in local currency and gained significant market share, 
      with broad-based growth across most dimensions of our business. I am 
      particularly pleased with our new bookings of $9.8 billion, which 
      demonstrate that our services and capabilities continue to be highly 
      differentiated in the marketplace.
    

      “We are clearly benefiting from the diversity of our business – from an 
      industry, geographic and capability standpoint – which drives durability 
      in our financial performance. At the same time, our focused investments 
      in high-growth areas, such as digital, cloud and security services, are 
      further differentiating Accenture and enabling us to grow ahead of the 
      market. We remain very well-positioned to continue driving profitable 
      growth and delivering value for our clients and shareholders.”
    

Financial Review


      Revenues before reimbursements (“net revenues”) for the third quarter of 
      fiscal 2017 were $8.87 billion, compared with $8.43 billion for the 
      third quarter of fiscal 2016, an increase of 5 percent in U.S. dollars 
      and 7 percent in local currency. Net revenues for the quarter reflect a 
      foreign-exchange impact of approximately negative 2 percent, compared 
      with the negative 2.5 percent impact we had previously assumed. 
      Adjusting for the actual foreign-exchange impact, the company’s guided 
      range for quarterly net revenues was approximately $8.70 billion to 
      $8.95 billion. Accenture’s third quarter fiscal 2017 net revenues were 
      in the upper end of this adjusted range.
    


        Consulting net revenues for the quarter were $4.82 billion, an 
        increase of 4 percent in U.S. dollars and 6 percent in local currency 
        compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2016.
      

        Outsourcing net revenues were $4.05 billion, an increase of 6 percent 
        in U.S. dollars and 7 percent in local currency over the third quarter 
        of fiscal 2016.
      


      Diluted EPS for the quarter were $1.05, compared with $1.41 for the 
      third quarter last year. The pension settlement charge had a negative 
      $0.47 impact on EPS in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Excluding this 
      charge, EPS for the quarter were $1.52, an increase of $0.11 from the 
      third quarter last year. The $0.11 increase in EPS on an adjusted basis 
      reflects:
    


        a $0.07 increase from higher revenue and operating results;
      

        a $0.02 increase from higher non-operating income; and
      

        a $0.02 increase from a lower share count.
      


      Gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of net revenues) for the 
      quarter was 32.8 percent, compared with 31.9 percent for the third 
      quarter last year. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses 
      for the quarter were $1.53 billion, or 17.3 percent of net revenues, 
      compared with $1.38 billion, or 16.4 percent of net revenues, for the 
      third quarter last year.
    

      Operating income for the quarter was $865 million, or 9.8 percent of net 
      revenues, compared with $1.31 billion, or 15.5 percent of net revenues, 
      for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Excluding the $510 million pension 
      settlement charge, operating income for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 
      was $1.38 billion, or 15.5 percent of net revenues.
    

      The company’s effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.4 percent, 
      compared with 26.5 percent for the third quarter last year. Excluding 
      the impact of the pension settlement charge, the effective tax rate for 
      the third quarter of fiscal 2017 was 26.6 percent.
    

      Net income for the quarter was $705 million, compared with $950 million 
      for the third quarter last year. Excluding the after-tax impact of the 
      pension settlement charge, net income for the third quarter of fiscal 
      2017 was $1.02 billion.
    

      Operating cash flow for the quarter was $1.79 billion, and property and 
      equipment additions were $136 million. Free cash flow, defined as 
      operating cash flow net of property and equipment additions, was 
      $1.66 billion. For the same period last year, operating cash flow was 
      $1.59 billion; property and equipment additions were $94 million; and 
      free cash flow was $1.50 billion.
    

      Days services outstanding, or DSOs, were 41 days at May 31, 2017, 
      compared with 39 days at Aug. 31, 2016 and 41 days at May 31, 2016.
    

      Accenture’s total cash balance at May 31, 2017 was $3.4 billion, 
      compared with $4.9 billion at Aug. 31, 2016.
    

New Bookings


      New bookings for the third quarter were $9.8 billion and reflect a 
      negative 1 percent foreign-currency impact compared with new bookings in 
      the third quarter last year.
    


        Consulting new bookings were $5.2 billion, or 53 percent of total new 
        bookings.
      

        Outsourcing new bookings were $4.6 billion, or 47 percent of total new 
        bookings.

      were as follows:
    


        North America: $4.12 billion, compared with $4.02 billion for the 
        third quarter of fiscal 2016, an increase of 3 percent in both U.S. 
        dollars and local currency.
      

        Europe: $3.04 billion, compared with $2.95 billion for the third

      services – were approximately $4.7 billion, a significant increase over 
      the third quarter of fiscal 2016. In the third quarter, “the New” 
      accounted for approximately 50 percent of total net revenues for the 
      first time – a key milestone for Accenture.
    

Returning Cash to Shareholders


      Accenture continues to return cash to shareholders through cash 
      dividends and share repurchases.
    

Dividend


      On May 15, 2017, a semi-annual cash dividend of $1.21 per share was paid 
      on Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares to shareholders of record at 
      the close of business on April 13, 2017 and on Accenture Holdings plc 
      ordinary shares to shareholders of record at the close of business on 
      April 10, 2017.
    

      Combined with the semi-annual cash dividend of $1.21 per share paid on 
      Nov. 15, 2016, this brings the total dividend payments for the fiscal 
      year to $2.42 per share, for total cash dividend payments of 
      approximately $1.57 billion.
    

Share Repurchase Activity


      During the third quarter of fiscal 2017, Accenture repurchased or 
      redeemed 4.9 million shares, including 4.6 million shares repurchased in 
      the open market, for a total of $589 million. This brings Accenture’s 
      total share repurchases and redemptions for the first three quarters of 
      fiscal 2017 to 16.9 million shares, including 13.7 million shares 
      repurchased in the open market, for a total of $1.99 billion.
    

      Accenture’s total remaining share repurchase authority at May 31, 2017 
      was approximately $3.7 billion.
    

      At May 31, 2017, Accenture had approximately 646 million total shares 
      outstanding, including 618 million Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares 
      and minority holdings of 28 million shares (Accenture Holdings plc 
      ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares).
    

Business Outlook


Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2017


      Accenture expects net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 to 
      be in the range of $8.85 billion to $9.10 billion, 5 percent to 8 
      percent growth in local currency, reflecting the company’s assumption of 
      a negative 0.5 percent foreign-exchange impact compared with the fourth 
      quarter of fiscal 2016.
    

Fiscal Year 2017


      Accenture’s business outlook for the full 2017 fiscal year now assumes 
      that the foreign-exchange impact on its results in U.S. dollars will be 
      negative 1 percent compared with fiscal 2016; the previous 
      foreign-exchange assumption was negative 2 percent.
    

      For fiscal 2017, the company now expects net revenue growth to be in the 
      range of 6 percent to 7 percent in local currency, compared with 6 
      percent to 8 percent previously.
    

      In May 2017, the company recorded a settlement charge of approximately 
      $510 million, pre-tax, in connection with the termination of its U.S. 
      pension plan. This settlement charge will reduce the company’s fiscal 
      2017 diluted GAAP EPS by approximately $0.47 and its full-year GAAP 
      operating margin by approximately 150 basis points. The company 
      previously expected the settlement charge to be approximately $425 
      million, pre-tax; to reduce its fiscal 2017 diluted GAAP EPS by 
      approximately $0.39; and to reduce its full-year GAAP operating margin 
      by approximately 120 basis points.
    

      Accenture now expects diluted GAAP EPS to be in the range of $5.37 to 
      $5.44, including the $0.47 impact of the pension settlement charge. 
      Excluding the settlement charge, the company now expects EPS to be in 
      the range of $5.84 to $5.91. The company previously expected diluted EPS 
      to be in the range of $5.31 to $5.48 on a GAAP basis and $5.70 to $5.87 
      on an adjusted basis.
    

      Accenture now expects GAAP operating margin for the full fiscal year to 
      be approximately 13.3 percent, including the estimated 150 basis-point 
      impact of the pension settlement charge. Excluding the settlement 
      charge, the company now expects operating margin to be approximately 
      14.8 percent – an expansion of 20 basis points from fiscal 2016. The 
      company previously expected operating margin to be in the range of 13.5 
      percent to 13.7 percent on a GAAP basis and 14.7 percent to 14.9 percent 
      on an adjusted basis.
    

      For fiscal 2017, the company continues to expect operating cash flow to 
      be in the range of $4.6 billion to $4.9 billion; property and equipment 
      additions to be $600 million; and free cash flow to be in the range of 
      $4.0 billion to $4.3 billion.
    

      Accenture now expects the GAAP annual effective tax rate to be in the 
      range of 20.5 percent to 21.5 percent. Excluding the impact of the 
      settlement charge, the company now expects its annual effective tax rate 
      to be in the range of 22.5 percent to 23.5 percent. The company 
      previously expected its annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 
      21 percent to 23 percent on a GAAP basis and 22 percent to 24 percent on 
      an adjusted basis.

Non-GAAP Financial Information


      This news release includes certain non-GAAP financial information as 
      defined by Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation G. Pursuant to 
      the requirements of this regulation, reconciliations of this non-GAAP 
      financial information to Accenture’s financial statements as prepared 
      under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) are included in 
      this press release. Financial results “in local currency” are calculated

      financial measures herein are useful in evaluating Accenture’s 
      operations, this information should be considered as supplemental in

Forward-Looking Statements


      Except for the historical information and discussions contained herein, 
      statements in this news release may constitute forward-looking 
      statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation 
      Reform Act of 1995. Words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “likely,” 
      “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “projects,” “believes,” 
      “estimates,” “positioned,” “outlook” and similar expressions are used to 
      identify these forward-looking statements. These statements involve a 
      number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual 
      results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. These 
      include, without limitation, risks that: the company’s results of 
      operations could be adversely affected by volatile, negative or 
      uncertain economic conditions and the effects of these conditions on the 
      company’s clients’ businesses and levels of business activity; the 
      company’s business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing, 
      profitable client demand for the company’s services and solutions, 
      including through the adaptation and expansion of its services and 
      solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings, 
      and a significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to 
      the changing technological environment could materially affect the 
      company’s results of operations; if the company is unable to keep its 
      supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the 
      world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership 
      skills, the company’s business, the utilization rate of the company’s 
      professionals and the company’s results of operations may be materially 
      adversely affected; the markets in which the company competes are highly 
      competitive, and the company might not be able to compete effectively; 
      the company could have liability or the company’s reputation could be 
      damaged if the company fails to protect client and/or company data from 
      security breaches or cyberattacks; the company’s profitability could 
      materially suffer if the company is unable to obtain favorable pricing 
      for its services and solutions, if the company is unable to remain 
      competitive, if its cost-management strategies are unsuccessful or if it 
      experiences delivery inefficiencies; changes in the company’s level of 
      taxes, as well as audits, investigations and tax proceedings, or changes 
      in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, could have a 
      material adverse effect on the company’s effective tax rate, results of 
      operations, cash flows and financial condition; the company’s results of 
      operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in 
      foreign currency exchange rates; the company’s business could be 
      materially adversely affected if the company incurs legal liability; the 
      company’s work with government clients exposes the company to additional 
      risks inherent in the government contracting environment; the company 
      might not be successful at identifying, acquiring, investing in or 
      integrating businesses, entering into joint ventures or divesting 
      businesses; the company’s Global Delivery Network is increasingly 
      concentrated in India and the Philippines, which may expose it to 
      operational risks; as a result of the company’s geographically diverse 
      operations and its growth strategy to continue geographic expansion, the 
      company is more susceptible to certain risks; adverse changes to the 
      company’s relationships with key alliance partners or in the business of 
      its key alliance partners could adversely affect the company’s results 
      of operations; the company’s services or solutions could infringe upon 
      the intellectual property rights of others or the company might lose its 
      ability to utilize the intellectual property of others; if the company 
      is unable to protect its intellectual property rights from unauthorized 
      use or infringement by third parties, its business could be adversely 
      affected; the company’s ability to attract and retain business and 
      employees may depend on its reputation in the marketplace; if the 
      company is unable to manage the organizational challenges associated 
      with its size, the company might be unable to achieve its business 
      objectives; any changes to the estimates and assumptions that the 
      company makes in connection with the preparation of its consolidated 
      financial statements could adversely affect its financial results; many 
      of the company’s contracts include payments that link some of its fees 
      to the attainment of performance or business targets and/or require the 
      company to meet specific service levels, which could increase the 
      variability of the company’s revenues and impact its margins; the 
      company’s results of operations and share price could be adversely 
      affected if it is unable to maintain effective internal controls; the 
      company may be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to 
      its incorporation in Ireland; as well as the risks, uncertainties and 
      other factors discussed under the “Risk Factors” heading in Accenture 
      plc’s most recent annual report on Form 10-K and other documents filed 
      with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Statements 
      in this news release speak only as of the date they were made, and 
      Accenture undertakes no duty to update any forward-looking statements 
      made in this news release or to conform such statements to actual 
      results or changes in Accenture’s expectations.

          Diluted earnings per share assumes the redemption of all Accenture

          exchangeable shares for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares on a 
          one-for-one basis. The income effect does not take into account “Net 
          income attributable to noncontrolling interests — other,” since 
          those shares are not redeemable or exchangeable for Accenture plc 
          Class A ordinary shares.
