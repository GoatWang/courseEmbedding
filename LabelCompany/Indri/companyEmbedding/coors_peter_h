THE BANQUET BACKSTORY
The history of Coors stretches back more than 140 years, with generations of the family overseeing the brewery. Through thick and thin, we’ve never wavered on our values of hard work, dedication and the stubborn resolve to brew the best beer we know how.





		Early Days	










THE LONG ROAD
In 1868, German brewing apprentice Adolph Coors headed to America. He made his way across the country working a series of odd jobs from bricklayer to gardener. Within five years, he founded the Golden Brewery where it still stands today.















FIRST THINGS FIRST
Mr. Coors headed west and refused to rest until he found the perfect water for his beer. Water he discovered flowing through the mining town of Golden, Colorado at the base of the Rockies.
 
 















A LEGEND IS BORN
As the story goes, it was the hardworking miners of Golden who gave our beer its name. In the coming years, “The Banquet Beer” would become synonymous with Coors.
 









 



		The 20th Century 	










DRAINED BUT NOT DEPLETED
When prohibition hit Colorado in 1916, the brewery was ordered to drain 561 barrels of beer. Undaunted, Mr. Coors leaned on new business ventures, such as manufacturing porcelain and producing malted milk for candy companies until April 7, 1933 when the beer flowed again.















A SYMBOL OF RESOLVE
By the 1930s, Banquet’s distribution was limited to just a handful of states in the western US. The brewery unveiled the Stubby Bottle in 1936, and after 17 dry years, the iconic bottle became a symbol of standing tall in the face of adversity.















A PACKAGING PIONEER
After years of development, Bill Coors scrapped the traditional tin can and introduced a more environmentally friendly aluminum container. This sparked a recycling revolution, and the aluminum can soon became industry standard.















BUILDING THE MYSTIQUE
Despite its limited distribution, thirst for Coors was booming by the 1970s. Legends abound of presidents, celebrities and everyday folks stocking up to haul the precious beer back east.
 









 



		This Day And Age	










BEER FOR ALL
For decades, Banquet was only available in 11 states, all west of the Mississippi River. The beer wouldn’t find its way east until 1976. But demand continued to grow and it was in 1991 that Coors finally showed up in all 50 states.















HERITAGE YOU CAN HOLD
The Banquet Beer’s rich heritage is something to be celebrated. So we wanted to do it as authentically as possible. Inspired by our history, the Banquet Heritage cans are our annual toast to the Banquet spirit, past and present.















STUBBY MAKES A COMEBACK
After more than 70 years in the vault, the 1936 Stubby Bottle made its triumphant return to stores and watering holes all over the country.

Early life[edit]
Coors was born in Golden, Colorado. He is the great-grandson of Adolph Coors, the brewing entrepreneur, and the son of Holly Coors (born Edith Holland Hanson)[2] and Joseph Coors. He graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy and then from Cornell University with a degree in engineering. A member of the Psi Upsilon Fraternity, Coors was elected to the Sphinx Head Society during his final year at Cornell. He also received his MBA from the University of Denver in 1970.
Career[edit]
Coors has worked all of his life in various positions at his family's Coors Brewing Company.
In 1993, Coors became vice chairman and CEO of the company, and in 2002, he was named Chairman of Coors Brewing Company and Adolph Coors Company. In 2004, Pete Coors "made $332,402 in salary and a $296,917 bonus as chairman of Adolph Coors. He also received 125,000 stock options with a potential value of $13 million," according to the Rocky Mountain News.[3] However, he stepped down temporarily from these positions in 2004 to run for the US Senate. After the 2005 merger with Molson, Coors became a Class A Director in the newly formed Molson Coors Brewing Company.[4] In October 2006, he was appointed by the University of Colorado Hospital Board of Directors as chairman of the board for the new University of Colorado Hospital Foundation.
He has served on the boards of U.S. Bancorp, H. J. Heinz Company, HOBY (Hugh O'Brian Youth Leadership) Colorado, and Energy Corp. of America. He is also involved in civic organizations such as the Denver Area Council of the Boy Scouts of America and the National Western Stock Show Association. He is also part of the ownership group of the Colorado Rockies.[5] He is a member at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia.[6] In 1997, Coors was granted an Honorary Doctorate from Johnson & Wales University, where he is a trustee. He sits on the Board of Trustees of the American Enterprise Institute.[7]
Senate run[edit]
When U.S. Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell declared in 2004 that he was retiring, Coors announced his candidacy. His opponent in the primary election was another conservative, former congressman Bob Schaffer. In their primary, the two candidates got into an ideological battle, as Schaffer attacked Coors because his company had provided benefits to the partners of its gay and lesbian employees, in addition to promoting its beer in gay bars. Coors defended himself by saying that he was opposed to same-sex marriage, and supported a constitutional amendment to ban it, although he noted that he supported civil unions for gay couples. According to the Rocky Mountain News, Coors described his company's pro-LGBT practices as "good business, separate from politics."[8] He defeated Schaffer with 61% of the vote in the primary, with many analysts citing his high name recognition in the state as a primary factor.
Coors faced Democrat and Colorado Attorney General Ken Salazar in the November 2004 election, but Coors was defeated by a margin of 51% to 47%.[9]
According to the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics (CPS), Coors gave his own campaign $1,213,657 and received individual donations of $60,550 from other Coors family members. He was mentioned as a possible contender in the 2008 Senate election.[3]

On May 28, 2006, Coors was arrested by the Colorado State Patrol on suspicion of driving under the influence and registering a blood alcohol level higher than the legal limit (0.088).[10] Coors commented on the incident, saying, "I should have planned ahead for a ride. For years, I've advocated the responsible use of our company's products. That's still my message, and our company's message. I am sorry that I didn't follow it myself."
On August 25, 2006, Coors pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of driving while impaired. A judge sentenced Coors to 24 hours of community service, a suspended fine and ordered him to undergo alcohol education courses.

After the 2005 merger with Molson, Coors became a Class A Director in the newly formed Molson Coors Brewing Company.[4] In October 2006, he was appointed by the University of Colorado Hospital Board of Directors as chairman of the board for the new University of Colorado Hospital Foundation.
He has served on the boards of U.S. Bancorp, H. J. Heinz Company, HOBY (Hugh O'Brian Youth Leadership) Colorado, and Energy Corp. of America. He is also involved in civic organizations such as the Denver Area Council of the Boy Scouts of America and the National Western Stock Show Association. He is also part of the ownership group of the Colorado Rockies.[5] He is a member at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia.[6] In 1997, Coors was granted an Honorary Doctorate from Johnson & Wales University, where he is a trustee. He sits on the Board of Trustees of the American Enterprise Institute.[7]
Senate run[edit]
When U.S. Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell declared in 2004 that he was retiring, Coors announced his candidacy. His opponent in the primary election was another conservative, former congressman Bob Schaffer. In their primary, the two candidates got into an ideological battle, as Schaffer attacked Coors because his company had provided benefits to the partners of its gay and lesbian employees, in addition to promoting its beer in gay bars. Coors defended himself by saying that he was opposed to same-sex marriage, and supported a constitutional amendment to ban it, although he noted that he supported civil unions for gay couples. According to the Rocky Mountain News, Coors described his company's pro-LGBT practices as "good business, separate from politics."[8] He defeated Schaffer with 61% of the vote in the primary, with many analysts citing his high name recognition in the state as a primary factor.
Coors faced Democrat and Colorado Attorney General Ken Salazar in the November 2004 election, but Coors was defeated by a margin of 51% to 47%.[9]
According to the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics (CPS), Coors gave his own campaign $1,213,657 and received individual donations of $60,550 from other Coors family members. He was mentioned as a possible contender in the 2008 Senate election.[3]

Personal life[edit]
Coors is married to Marilyn Coors (born Grosso) and has six children.
On May 28, 2006, Coors was arrested by the Colorado State Patrol on suspicion of driving under the influence and registering a blood alcohol level higher than the legal limit (0.088).[10] Coors commented on the incident, saying, "I should have planned ahead for a ride. For years, I've advocated the responsible use of our company's products. That's still my message, and our company's message. I am sorry that I didn't follow it myself."
On August 25, 2006, Coors pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of driving while impaired. A judge sentenced Coors to 24 hours of community service, a suspended fine and ordered him to undergo alcohol education courses.

The Beer and The Boycott


By Jonathan Tasini; Jonathan Tasini is a writer who specializes in labor issues.


Published: January 31, 1988









                    LAURENCE GOLD, THE A.F.L.-C.I.O.'S GEN-eral counsel, was up to his elbows in work one day in November 1984 when his phone rang.        

                    Calling was Robert H. Chanin, his counterpart at the National Education Association, the nation's largest labor union. Chanin was on a secret diplomatic mission. He told Gold that his union had been informally contacted by the Adolph Coors Company, which was seeking an end to the labor federation's seven-year boycott of Coors beer; the N.E.A. had just voted to support that ban. Chanin asked what it would take for the A.F.L.-C.I.O. to end the boycott, but, to his surprise, Gold didn't know.        

                    ''The A.F.L.-C.I.O. had been caught up in implementing the boycott, not ending it,'' Chanin says today.        

                    The fight against the Adolph Coors Company was one of the most bitter labor-management struggles of the last 30 years. After 1,472 brewery workers struck Coors in 1977, unions poured millions of dollars into a consumer boycott that effectively helped stunt the company's growth. Coors, ferociously antiunion, is the company political liberals love to hate, and the boycott became a cause celebre of the 1980's. Millions of people shunned Coors beer, just as sympathizers with migrant workers had banished grapes from their refrigerators in the 1960's and 1970's.        

                    Chanin's phone call, however, sparked three years of negotiations that last fall produced what many thought impossible - an agreement between the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and Coors that ended the boycott. It is a classic tale of labor-management relations - of two enemies slinging arrows at each other for years, until, battered by a changing economy, they needed each other badly enough to compromise.        

                    The agreement was largely the work of two men - Peter H. Coors, great-grandson of the company's founder and president of its brewery division since 1985, and Thomas R. Donahue, secretary-treasurer of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. - both of whom are trying to steer their organizations into the future.        

                    Under the guidance of Peter Coors and his older brother Jeffrey, president of the Adolph Coors Company, the brewery is attempting to double, within five years, its current 8 percent share of the American market, in order to contend in a troubled industry that everyone expects to be dominated by three or four breweries by the end of the century. ''Coors and the whole beer industry are under siege,'' says Frank Walters, research director for M. Shanken Communications, publishers of several alcoholic-beverage industry periodicals. ''The beer market will not grow because of the trend in moderation, the older population and the higher drinking age.''        

                    On the other side, Donahue has been trying to halt organized labor's slide toward irrelevancy. Since President Reagan's celebrated dismissal of striking air-traffic controllers in 1981, American companies have become more skillful and more determined in resisting or breaking unions. Union membership dropped from 22.4 million in 1980 to slightly less than 17 million in 1986. Organized labor has been in such desperate straits that the Coors settlement has been perceived as a victory - even though the workers at Coors are still without a union.        

                    AGAINST THE FOOTHILLS OF THE ROCKIES, IN the small town of Golden, Colo., the Adolph Coors Company sits on 3,300 acres. For Peter Coors, the brewery holds childhood memories. Born in 1946, Peter used to build forts out of towering stacks of empty bottles and cans. Once he turned 14, his summer vacations were spent working at the brewery. After receiving an industrial engineering degree from Cornell University and graduating from the University of Denver's business school, Peter came back to the company as a production trainee.        

                    Imbued with his business-school training, he poked around the company's financial systems and found a $350 million corporation in which department heads were oblivious to their budget, he says, and seven people ran the company's financial arm using the double-entry accounting method. Peter, young and cocky, revamped the procedures and worked hard on the public stock offering the company was forced into to pay off estate taxes for Adolph Coors Jr., Peter's grandfather. In 1975, he turned his attention to his true calling - sales and marketing.        

                    From the 1950's until Peter took charge, the brewery was run by Joseph and William Coors, Peter's father and uncle; by the early 70's, their product had an almost cultlike following. College kids, believing the beer brewed with Rocky Mountain spring water was special, raved about its taste. The problem for Coors wasn't selling beer; it was making enough beer to meet demand, which only reinforced Joe and Bill Coors's disdain for marketing.        

                    But times were changing. The clubby nature of the beer business had turned into a bruising battle. In the early 70's, the Miller Brewing Company, the nation's No. 2 brewer. embarked on a massive ad campaign. Anheuser-Busch, No. 1, countered with its own onslaught, spending tens of millions of dollars on television and radio spots as well as promotions. Initially, Coors was caught flat-footed; it was spending $3 million annually on advertising. ''We didn't have marketing research,'' Peter Coors says. ''Our sales people had been with us for 30 years.'' In 1979, at Peter's insistence, the company boosted its ad budget to $46 million.

THE BANQUET BACKSTORY
The history of Coors stretches back more than 140 years, with generations of the family overseeing the brewery. Through thick and thin, we’ve never wavered on our values of hard work, dedication and the stubborn resolve to brew the best beer we know how.





		Early Days	










THE LONG ROAD
In 1868, German brewing apprentice Adolph Coors headed to America. He made his way across the country working a series of odd jobs from bricklayer to gardener. Within five years, he founded the Golden Brewery where it still stands today.















FIRST THINGS FIRST
Mr. Coors headed west and refused to rest until he found the perfect water for his beer. Water he discovered flowing through the mining town of Golden, Colorado at the base of the Rockies.
 
 















A LEGEND IS BORN
As the story goes, it was the hardworking miners of Golden who gave our beer its name. In the coming years, “The Banquet Beer” would become synonymous with Coors.
 









 



		The 20th Century 	










DRAINED BUT NOT DEPLETED
When prohibition hit Colorado in 1916, the brewery was ordered to drain 561 barrels of beer. Undaunted, Mr. Coors leaned on new business ventures, such as manufacturing porcelain and producing malted milk for candy companies until April 7, 1933 when the beer flowed again.















A SYMBOL OF RESOLVE
By the 1930s, Banquet’s distribution was limited to just a handful of states in the western US. The brewery unveiled the Stubby Bottle in 1936, and after 17 dry years, the iconic bottle became a symbol of standing tall in the face of adversity.















A PACKAGING PIONEER
After years of development, Bill Coors scrapped the traditional tin can and introduced a more environmentally friendly aluminum container. This sparked a recycling revolution, and the aluminum can soon became industry standard.















BUILDING THE MYSTIQUE
Despite its limited distribution, thirst for Coors was booming by the 1970s. Legends abound of presidents, celebrities and everyday folks stocking up to haul the precious beer back east.
 









 



		This Day And Age	










BEER FOR ALL
For decades, Banquet was only available in 11 states, all west of the Mississippi River. The beer wouldn’t find its way east until 1976. But demand continued to grow and it was in 1991 that Coors finally showed up in all 50 states.















HERITAGE YOU CAN HOLD
The Banquet Beer’s rich heritage is something to be celebrated. So we wanted to do it as authentically as possible. Inspired by our history, the Banquet Heritage cans are our annual toast to the Banquet spirit, past and present.















STUBBY MAKES A COMEBACK
After more than 70 years in the vault, the 1936 Stubby Bottle made its triumphant return to stores and watering holes all over the country.
