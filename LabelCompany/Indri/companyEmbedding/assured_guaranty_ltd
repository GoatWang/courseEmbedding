About Assured Guaranty
Assured Guaranty is the leading provider of financial guaranty insurance. We guarantee scheduled principal and interest payments when due on municipal, public infrastructure and structured financings.   FFF
We have four principal operating subsidiaries:


Assured Guaranty Municipal Corp. (AGM) guarantees only U.S. municipal bonds and international infrastructure financings. It was named Financial Security Assurance Inc. (FSA) before becoming an Assured Guaranty company in July 2009. AGM is domiciled in New York.



Municipal Assurance Corp. (MAC) guarantees only select categories of U.S. municipal bonds. MAC is owned jointly by AGM and AGC and is domiciled in New York.



Assured Guaranty Corp. (AGC) is a diversified financial guarantor insuring both public finance and structured finance obligations, including asset-backed securities. Operating since 1988, AGC is domiciled in Maryland with headquarters in New York.


Assured Guaranty Re Ltd. (AG Re) is a Bermuda insurance company specializing in financial guaranty reinsurance.  It is the world's largest financial guaranty reinsurer and serves both affiliated and non-affiliated insurance companies. Additionally, it owns, indirectly, 100% of Assured Guaranty Re Overseas Ltd. (AGRO), a Bermuda insurance company specializing in the reinsurance of non-financial guaranty business lines that fit within the Assured Guaranty Group’s overall risk appetite.

 
In the United States and a number of selected countries, we have long been committed to protecting debt holders from payment defaults and to helping issuers obtain cost-efficient access to capital. We also provide reinsurance to the financial guaranty industry.
Our value proposition goes beyond our promise to pay principal and interest to investors in guaranteed financings. We also provide credit underwriting, negotiated terms, surveillance and, if necessary, remediation of the bonds we insure. These benefits create greater value and liquidity for investors.
Issuers use our financial guarantees to lower their cost of funds, broaden distribution and diversify funding sources.
Assured Guaranty’s proven business model, disciplined risk management and successful surveillance, loss mitigation and acquisition strategies, along with our access to capital in debt and equity markets, enabled us to maintain a strong financial position during and since the Great Recession.  From January 2008 through September 2016, there was an increase in the claims-paying resources of the Assured Guaranty Group (including AGM before Assured Guaranty acquired it) even though during that time we paid out $8.7 billion in gross direct policyholder claims, including $7.3 billion for residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS, a sector in which Assured Guaranty no longer participates) and $0.6 billion for U.S. municipal bonds. Net of reinsurance and all other recoveries, these claims totaled $4.2 billion, of which $3.3 billion were for RMBS and $0.4 billion were for U.S. municipal bonds.  Assured Guaranty is the only bond insurer that has paid claims and continued to write policies without interruption for three decades.
Assured Guaranty Ltd. is a Bermuda-based insurance holding company that trades on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol AGO. Together with its subsidiaries, we refer to it as Assured Guaranty.

U.S. Public Finance
Assured Guaranty is the leading provider of municipal bond insurance in the United States.
Our municipal credit enhancement products include:

Municipal bond insurance policies covering principal and interest, for both new issues and those already trading in the secondary market
Surety policies that take the place of cash-funded reserves in municipal bond transactions
Specialized financial guaranty policies, such as swap sureties guaranteeing a municipal issuer’s obligations under a swap agreement with a broker-dealer

We guarantee a wide range of municipal bond types supported either by tax revenues or revenues from essential public projects or services. We insure both tax-exempt and taxable municipal bonds.
While we have three platforms – AGM, insuring only public finance transactions; MAC, insuring only U.S. municipal bonds in select categories; and AGC, a diversified provider – we are one team, applying a uniform underwriting standard and dedicated to the highest level of customer service. In addition to our large municipal bond insurance department in our New York headquarters, we maintain a fully staffed western regional office in San Francisco.
During 2016, Assured Guaranty led the municipal bond insurance market in terms of both par and the number of transactions insured during the year, capturing 56% of all insured new-issue par and 48% of the insured transactions.  Our 902 primary-market transactions represented $14.2 billion of insured par – over $3 billion more than the combined total for the rest of the industry. Counting secondary market activity, our total 2016 U.S. public finance par insured was $16 billion.
Indicating increased institutional demand, 58 primary-market transactions in 2016 utilized $50 million or more of Assured Guaranty insurance, and reflecting the value of our guaranty, more than $1.6 billion of our insured volume involved credits with S&P or Moody's underlying ratings in the AA category. Additionally, our MAC platform had a record year with 223 transactions.
For the first half of 2017, Assured Guaranty insured $7.0 billion of primary-market par volume and 438 small, medium and large transactions in the U.S. public finance market. This included second-quarter insured par sold of $4.1 billion, 1.9 times that of our nearest competitor and representing 257 small, medium and large transactions           
Demand has increased for our guaranty on larger transactions, which typically interest institutional investors.  We insured  12 primary-market transactions with insured amounts of $100 million or more in the first half of 2017, more than in any first half since 2011. 
Secondary-market activity for the first half of 2017 was strong, as we issued 241 policies for a total of $1.2 billion of par, up 62% from par insured in the previous year’s comparable period. In aggregate, our primary and secondary market activity totaled an industry-leading $8.2 billion for the first half, including $4.6 billion for the second quarter.

The Company guarantees obligations issued principally in the United States and the United Kingdom and also guarantees obligations issued in other countries and regions, including Australia and Western Europe.

The healthcare bonds are obligations of healthcare facilities, including community-based hospitals and systems, as well as of health maintenance organizations and long-term care facilities.The Company's higher education bonds are obligations secured by revenue collected by either public or private secondary schools, colleges and universities. The infrastructure bonds include obligations issued by a range of entities engaged in the financing of infrastructure projects, such as roads, airports, ports, social infrastructure and other physical assets delivering services supported by long-term concession arrangements with a public sector entity. The housing revenue bonds are obligations relating to both single and multi-family housing, issued by states and localities, and in some cases, insurance from entities, such as the federal housing administration.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
