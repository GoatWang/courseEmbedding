  Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq:AIMT), today announced the appointment of Eric Bjerkholt as Chief Financial Officer.  Mr. Bjerkholt joins Aimmune from Sunesis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., where, over 13 years with the company, his role as CFO expanded to oversee multiple aspects of governance, corporate relations, and other functions. In addition to taking Sunesis through its initial public offering in 2005, he raised more than $400 million for the company in other financings. Prior to Sunesis, Mr. Bjerkholt was CFO at IntraBiotics Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and LifeSpring Nutrition, Inc. He began his healthcare career at J.P. Morgan & Co. as an investment banker in New York and then launched the company's Western U.S. healthcare practice. Mr. Bjerkholt holds a Cand. Oecon. (master's) degree in economics from the University of Oslo and an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School. He has served on the boards of directors of several publicly traded companies and is currently a member of the board of directors and chair of the audit committee for Corium International, Inc.  "I am delighted to further strengthen our executive team with the addition of Eric Bjerkholt," said Aimmune CEO Stephen Dilly, M.B.B.S., Ph.D. "Eric's deep understanding and direct experience of multiple facets of corporate finance and other related activities will be key assets in the years ahead."  "This is a very exciting time to join Aimmune," said Mr. Bjerkholt. "The lead product, AR101, is very promising, peanut allergy is a significant unmet need, and Aimmune is in a very strong financial position. The company plans to report pivotal Phase 3 data around the end of 2017, file a BLA and MAA in 2018, and make first commercial launches in 2019. Although there is much to be done, Aimmune has a highly experienced management team in place and is well-equipped to meet the challenges ahead. I am enthusiastic to get started at the end of April."
