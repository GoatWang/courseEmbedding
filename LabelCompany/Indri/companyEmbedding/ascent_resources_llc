Ascent Resources























EXPLORE - ACQUIRE - DEVELOP - PRODUCE

Harnessing American energy requires the right combination of experience and ingenuity





OPERATIONS





Our primary focus has been in the exploration and production of prominent Appalachian oil and gas shale plays. Ascent has established a leading position in the Appalachian Basin, with ownership in approximately 300,000 net acres purchased or under contract. Our acreage position spans multiple phases of the Utica and Marcellus plays, providing diversified exposure to dry gas, oil and natural gas liquids (NGL).
Our midstream strategy is supported by strong industry relationships with gathering and processing providers that continue to benefit us as we develop our asset base. Our diversified transportation portfolio that delivers to several markets, helps diversify pricing points and mitigate the impact of depressed in-basin pricing. In addition, with gathering and processing agreements already in place, the vast majority of our leasehold is covered with minimal producer commitments, creating a favorable fee structure.
                        

                            Our experienced management team consists of leaders with a proven track record in oil and gas development. They prefer a “hands on” approach, and have overseen the drilling of thousands of horizontal wells across the U.S. including over 800 wells in the Utica and Marcellus, and more than 30 rigs in various unconventional plays. Their experience and management practices led to zero employee injuries in 2015, with top quartile performance in employee, contractor and vehicle-driving safety.

OKLAHOMA CITY, March 14, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Ascent Resources, LLC ("Ascent"), announced today that on March 10, 2016 it entered into agreements to sell approximately 2.2 billion common units ("Common Units") in a private placement transaction, which is expected to result in net proceeds to Ascent of approximately $500 million bringing the total amount of equity raised by Ascent so far in 2016 to $712 million. The Common Units will be sold to the investors at a purchase price of $0.224 per Common Unit.  The proceeds of the sale are expected to be funded on or about March 24, 2016 (the "Funding Date"), and Ascent is expected to contribute $500 million in net cash proceeds to Ascent Resources – Utica, LLC ("ARU") within three business days of the Funding Date (the "Contribution").  


Upon the completion of the Contribution, ARU and ARU Finance Corporation ("Finco" and together with ARU, the "Issuers") will have satisfied the conditions necessary to exercise their right to redeem their outstanding 3.50% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2021 issued on February 24, 2016 (the "New Convertible Notes") for incremental junior secured loans due 2019 (the "New Junior Secured Loans") and Common Units and/or the Class A Shares of a newly formed entity ("Class A Shares"). The redemption is expected to take place no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days following the Funding Date.
Upon redemption, in exchange for every $950 principal amount of the New Convertible Notes redeemed, each holder of New Convertible Notes will receive a redemption price consisting of (a) $200 principal amount of the New Junior Secured Loans plus an additional principal amount of New Junior Secured Loans corresponding to the difference between (i) the paid-in-kind interest to the Funding Date on the New Junior Secured Loans as if such $200 principal amount of New Junior Secured Loans had been issued to such holder on February 24, 2016 and (ii) the interest from February 24, 2016 to the Funding Date on such holder's New Convertible Notes, (b) 1,562 Common Units plus cash in lieu of any fractional Common Units and (c) accrued and unpaid interest on the New Convertible Notes to the Funding Date, less any applicable withholding taxes; provided that each holder will have the option to receive Class A Shares in lieu of its Common Units, on the same economic terms as described above.  The Common Units and Class A Shares issued pursuant to the above redemption right will be subject to certain terms and conditions, including lock-up periods, as set forth in the indenture governing the New Convertible Notes.
Ascent considers the Contribution to be an important milestone to effect significant deleveraging through the redemption of its New Convertible Notes. In addition, Ascent will continue to evaluate liquidity options in the context of a dynamic commodity price and service cost environment and will opportunistically execute financial and operating transactions to further enhance its liquidity and optimize its capital structure and balance sheet.
The Common Units have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or under any state securities laws. The Common Units may not be offered or sold within the United States or to or for the account or benefit of any U.S. persons except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act.

American Energy Appalachia Holdings, LLC Announces Name Change To Ascent Resources, LLC; American Energy - Utica, LLC Announces $407 Million Asset Sale And $977 Million Equity And Debt Financing

Jun 09, 2015, 17:28 ET
		  		  							
						 from   American Energy Partners, LP 











 
















































 

 




















 


OKLAHOMA CITY, June 9, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- American Energy Appalachia Holdings, LLC announced today that it is changing its name to Ascent Resources, LLC (Ascent) and is transitioning to a standalone operating company, fully independent of the broader American Energy Partners, LP (AELP) platform, a process that has been contemplated since the company's founding in September 2013 and that it expects to complete by year-end 2015.  The primary equity owners of Ascent will be unchanged.  Further, one of Ascent's two operating subsidiaries, American Energy - Utica, LLC (AEU), announced it has agreed to sell approximately 35,000 net acres and certain associated gathering assets to Gulfport Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:   GPOR) for approximately $407 million cash (subject to customary purchase price adjustments) and has completed a combined equity and debt financing of approximately $977 million.  The combined proceeds of $1.4 billion will provide the company with $700 million of immediate liquidity after repaying certain existing debt.  Ascent plans to efficiently deploy this capital for ongoing development of its world-class assets. 
Jeffrey A. Fisher, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "Today marks an extremely important day in the life of our company.  These transactions place Ascent on strong footing from a liquidity standpoint and allow the company to continue to develop its tremendous asset base.  We have what I believe are some of the very best assets in the Appalachian Basin and, therefore, the entire country.  We are also pleased to announce the start of our long-anticipated migration to a standalone company, as Ascent Resources, LLC.  We have worked diligently over the last two years to create a leading asset position and build a team with the operational talent to grow our production, reserves, and cash flow into the future.  We appreciate the support that we received from our sponsors and AELP and look forward to taking Ascent to the next level."  
The $977 million financing consists of $250 million of equity invested by affiliates of The Energy & Minerals Group (EMG), First Reserve, and Aubrey K. McClendon, as well as $250 million of senior secured debt, $200 million of which will be used to retire AEU's revolving credit facility, and $477 million of junior secured debt, $277 million of which will be used to retire an equal amount of AEU's existing convertible notes.  The asset sale consists of approximately 35,000 net acres in Belmont, Monroe, and Jefferson Counties, Ohio that were not scheduled for near-term development by the company and are a better fit for Gulfport's planned development activities.
Pro forma for the asset sale, Ascent had estimated proved reserves of approximately 1.8 trillion cubic feet equivalent (73% natural gas) as of March 31, 2015, and approximately 235,000 net acres in the Utica and Marcellus shale plays in Ohio and West Virginia.  Ascent's current estimated daily production is approximately 280 million cubic feet equivalent.    
Created in December 2014 through the combination of the holding companies of AEU and American Energy – Marcellus, LLC (AEM), Ascent is one of the largest pure-play Appalachian E&P companies with approximately 235,000 net acres in the Utica and Marcellus shale plays, including 190,000 net acres in eastern Ohio and 45,000 net acres in northern West Virginia.   
This press release contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements express views regarding future plans and expectations. They include statements that include words such as "may," "could," "would," "should," "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "plan," "estimate," "target," "project," "intend" and similar words or expressions, although not all forward-looking statements contain such identifying words.
Forward-looking statements in this press release include, but are not limited to, statements regarding dispositions, future operations and operating costs, business strategy, future values of anticipated reserves and future production. These statements are based on numerous assumptions and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. These risks include, but are not limited to, commodity price volatility, inflation, lack of availability of drilling and production equipment and services, environmental risks, drilling and other operating risks, regulatory changes and the uncertainty inherent in estimating oil and natural gas reserves and in projecting future rates of production, cash flow and access to capital. Actual future results may vary materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements, and Ascent's business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by numerous factors, including such known and unknown risks and uncertainties. As a result, forward-looking statements should be understood to be only predictions and statements of our current beliefs, and not as guarantees of performance.
All of the forward-looking statements in this press release are qualified by risks, including those risks related to our ability to: complete our acquisitions and dispositions; access the capital markets on terms acceptable to us or at all; execute on future drilling plans; hold our leasehold by production and convert reserves into production on an economic basis; manage rapid growth; to realize attractive oil, NGLs and natural gas prices; develop a successful marketing plan for the oil, NGLs and natural gas produced by Ascent and its subsidiaries; successfully identify and acquire additional productive leasehold; recruit and retain appropriately qualified personnel; effectively utilize technology, to execute our drilling program; mitigate credit risk posed by significant customers; respond to intense competition in the onshore E&P industry; respond to shifting and increasing government regulatory requirements with respect to unconventional resource recovery, including hydraulic fracture stimulation; accurately predict the timing of infrastructure development (including longhaul pipelines) and tie-in of wells; accurately predict the timing and amount of future production of oil, NGLs and natural gas; access water, sourcing, distribution and disposal systems; generate sufficient cash flow to pay fixed charges; control our operating expenses and other costs; execute on our financial strategy and access the capital required for our development program; implement our hedging strategy and deliver expected results; navigate through general credit market and economic conditions; and to avoid material legal or environmental liabilities.
This press release provides disclosure of the proved reserves of Ascent that is derived from third-party and internally developed reserve reports. Proved reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible—from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations—prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. Quantities that may be ultimately recovered from the interests of Ascent may differ substantially. There is no commitment by Ascent to drill all of the drilling locations that have been attributed to these quantities. Factors affecting ultimate recovery include the scope of the ongoing drilling program, which will be directly affected by the availability of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, drilling results, lease expirations, transportation constraints, regulatory approvals and other factors, and actual drilling results, including geological and mechanical factors affecting recovery rates. The production expectations for future periods are dependent upon many assumptions, including estimates of production decline rates from existing wells and the undertaking and outcome of future drilling activity, which may be affected by significant commodity price declines or drilling cost increases.

Ascent Resources begins $500M equity raise 








March 15, 2016



































Ascent Resources LLC has entered into agreements to sell 2.2 billion common units in a private placement transaction, which is expected to result in net proceeds to Ascent of $500 million, bringing the total amount of equity raised by Ascent so far in 2016 to $712 million.  The common units will be sold to the investors at a purchase price of $0.224 per common unit. The proceeds of the sale are expected to be funded on or about March 24, and Ascent is expected to contribute $500 million in net cash proceeds to Ascent Resources – Utica LLC (ARU) within three business days of the funding date. 
Upon the completion of the contribution, ARU and ARU Finance Corp. will have satisfied the conditions necessary to exercise their right to redeem their outstanding 3.50% convertible subordinated notes due 2021 issued on Feb. 24 for incremental junior secured loans due 2019 and common units and/or the Class A shares of a newly formed entity. The redemption is expected to take place no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days following the funding date.
Ascent Resources was created in December 2014 through the combination of Ascent Resources Utica Holdings LLC (formerly known as American Energy Ohio Holdings LLC) and Ascent Resources Marcellus Holdings LLC (formerly known as American Energy Marcellus Holdings LLC), which respectively own Ascent Resources – Utica LLC  and Ascent Resources – Marcellus LLC (formerly known as American Energy – Marcellus LLC). Since its inception, Ascent Resources LLC has established a leading position in the Appalachian Basin, with approximately 280,000 net acres purchased or under contract.
