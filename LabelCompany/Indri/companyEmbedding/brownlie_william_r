                              In recent years attempts have been made to develop numerical models for unsteady flows in channels with sediment transport.
                                 This work was conducted to analyze two essential ingredients of any numerical model: the relationship between the hydraulic
                                 variables (slope, depth, and velocity), and the predictor of sediment concentration. A data base containing 7027 records (5263
                                 laboratory records and 1764 field records) in 77 data files was assembled and is provided (Appendix B). The data base was
                                 used to examine existing relationships and to develop new ones. Six existing hydraulic relationships are reworked and examined.
                                 Detailed statistical analyses are provided for 13 existing techniques for predicting sediment concentration. Relying heavily
                                 on statistical analysis of dimensionless groups, new relationships have been developed. The new hydraulic relationship solves
                                 for flow depth for upper and lower regime flow separately and then provides a method for determining which flow regime one
                                 might expect. The new method for predicting sediment transport, which is easy to use, appears to be more accurate than the
                                 13 existing methods, and suggests that complex procedures for calculating concentration are not warranted. A four-point implicit
                                 finite difference scheme has been presented to demonstrate the feasibility of applying the new hydraulic and sediment relationships
                                 to a numerical solution of the differential equations

in Illinois:

However, if your business is providing home improvement services in IL, you may be required to obtain a Home Improvement Contractor License at the local level or comply with other licensing laws at the state or local level.
William R Brownlie currently holds license 062050997 (Professional Engineer), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Illinois?



Although Illinois does not require contractors to be licensed, check local regulations as certain jurisdictions may require licensing on a local level. 











Your liability risk when hiring William R Brownlie



General Contractors in Illinois are not required to carry general liability insurance. It is always a good practice to only hire contractors with active liability and workers' compensation insurance policies. Request a copy of each certificate for your records before the project starts. 











Financial recourse when hiring William R Brownlie



Illinois requires roofing contractors to obtain a surety bond. Home owners may file a claim to recoup money in the event of faulty work, or damages to their property incurred during a roof project. 











What else should I know before hiring William R Brownlie



Illinois on the state level, has minimal regulations governing contractor licensing, in turn, consumers should be vigilant when hiring contractors, check on BuildZoom for customer reviews, and permit history as indicators of quality businesses. Check with local licensing authorities as some jurisdictions will require contractors to be licensed. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Illinois, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
