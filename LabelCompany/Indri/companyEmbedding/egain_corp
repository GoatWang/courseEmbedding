Web Self-Service
One size doesn't fit all in web self-service! The same approach to self-service will not work for every type of customer, every type of inquiry, or every stage of the customer life cycle.
            
            eGain SelfService enables organizations to provide distinctive, productive, and brand-aligned self-service experiences that enable breakthrough improvements in customer self-service effectiveness and adoption, while allowing seamless, context-aware escalations to live customer service or sales agents.

Artificial Intelligence for Customer Service
The business benefits of Artificial Intelligence in customer engagement are real and game-changing. eGain uses AI technology-enabled reasoning capability to guide customers, contact center advisors, and field experts to the right answers, diagnosis, and process.

In today’s ever-changing economic climate, it is imperative that companies understand how they can use eService as a competitive differentiator. Moreover, technology spending is being closely guarded and it is crucial that potential new solutions are supported by a solid business case to justify the cost of deploying and maintaining any technology solution.
Our business consultants can help. By conducting detailed assessments of business processes within your customer service organizations with the participation of primary stakeholders, we can identify key opportunities to generate value from an eService solution, assess operational readiness for eService solutions, and provide a clear articulation of the ROI.
Whether the assessment shows strong business practices are already in place, or identifies opportunities for improvement, our consultants provide you with the strategy and an executable plan to optimize enterprise profitability, improve customer satisfaction, and reduce costs. eGain consultants achieve this through their industry specific domain expertise, extensive technical experience, leveraging best practices, and the knowledge gained from deploying eService solutions for over 700 customers.
Our business consulting services include:

Students will enjoy the opportunity to interact with instructors and fellow students in an enriched, interactive environment.

At the end of this assessment, you will clearly understand how your customer service model measures up to others within your industry. In addition, you will have a strategy for transforming your customer service model into competitive advantage, as well as a complete roadmap for successful deployment of an enterprise level eService solution.

Artificial Intelligence-powered Virtual Assistant Software
eGain Virtual Assistant is a lifelike, conversational virtual agent providing a unique, interactive, and personal way for users to get answers and assistance on your website, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It provides the frontline support so your customer service staff can concentrate on more complex tasks.
A visitor to your website simply chats with the virtual assistant (also called VA, virtual agent, or chatbot). The natural language processing technology embedded in the chat bot enables it to not only understand the words, but also the customer intent. The VA acts like a guide taking customers on a tour of the website, providing answers, and even helping in their shopping decisions.
An awarded chatbot, the eGain VA is smart enough to know when to escalate to a human agent. By providing timely and context-aware escalation to agents, it stops your customers from having to repeat their query, greatly reducing customer frustration and agent anxiety. Quite like what happens in this video.

eGain Virtual Assistant includes out-of-the-box avatars, multilingual support, knowledge base (KB), and analytics for continuous improvement. Besides answering questions, the chatbot can push relevant web pages and take customers on website tours. It supports text-to-text, text-to-speech, speech-to-text, and speech-to-speech communications. Businesses can also expand its reach by embedding it in apps and social networks.

Enhance customer experience, acquisition, and retention. Increase self-service adoption. Improve contact center agent productivity. Increase revenue through upsell and  cross-sell at the point of service. Ensure compliance and security in customer interactions. Reduce unwarranted field visits, product returns, and associated costs. Build customer loyalty through brand-aligned customer service.


Knowledge Management
Serve knowledge everywhere! Use the same knowledge base, and a range of access methods (search, browse, guided help, chatbot), for social, mobile, web, and contact center use.


Web Self-Service
One size doesn't fit all in web self-service! The same approach to self-service will not work for every type of customer, every type of inquiry, or every stage of the customer life cycle.
            
            eGain SelfService enables organizations to provide distinctive, productive, and brand-aligned self-service experiences that enable breakthrough improvements in customer self-service effectiveness and adoption, while allowing seamless, context-aware escalations to live customer service or sales agents.


Video Chat, Text Chat, Cobrowsing
Are you looking for efficient ways of providing better experiences to your website visitors? Studies show that chat and cobrowsing are the most effective channels for engaging, selling to, and serving online customers. Reach out to customers, proactively or reactively, right when they need help and avoid abandoned shopping carts and half-filled forms. Offer distinctive mobile customer service.


Artificial Intelligence for Customer Service
The business benefits of Artificial Intelligence in customer engagement are real and game-changing. eGain uses AI technology-enabled reasoning capability to guide customers, contact center advisors, and field experts to the right answers, diagnosis, and process. This capability improves first contact resolution, customer satisfaction, agent confidence and productivity, and reduces truck rolls saving millions for the business.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Get an eGain-powered customer engagement hub today!
Enhance customer experience, acquisition, and retention. Increase self-service adoption. Improve contact center agent productivity. Increase revenue through upsell and  cross-sell at the point of service. Ensure compliance and security in customer interactions. Reduce unwarranted field visits, product returns, and associated costs. Build customer loyalty through brand-aligned customer service.


Knowledge Management
Serve knowledge everywhere! Use the same knowledge base, and a range of access methods (search, browse, guided help, chatbot), for social, mobile, web, and contact center use.


Web Self-Service
One size doesn't fit all in web self-service! The same approach to self-service will not work for every type of customer, every type of inquiry, or every stage of the customer life cycle.
            
            eGain SelfService enables organizations to provide distinctive, productive, and brand-aligned self-service experiences that enable breakthrough improvements in customer self-service effectiveness and adoption, while allowing seamless, context-aware escalations to live customer service or sales agents.


Video Chat, Text Chat, Cobrowsing
Are you looking for efficient ways of providing better experiences to your website visitors? Studies show that chat and cobrowsing are the most effective channels for engaging, selling to, and serving online customers. Reach out to customers, proactively or reactively, right when they need help and avoid abandoned shopping carts and half-filled forms. Offer distinctive mobile customer service.


Artificial Intelligence for Customer Service
The business benefits of Artificial Intelligence in customer engagement are real and game-changing. eGain uses AI technology-enabled reasoning capability to guide customers, contact center advisors, and field experts to the right answers, diagnosis, and process. This capability improves first contact resolution, customer satisfaction, agent confidence and productivity, and reduces truck rolls saving millions for the business.

History[edit]
eGain Corporation was founded as eGain Communications Corporation by Ashutosh Roy and Gunjan Sinha.[5][6] It began in 1997 when both were part of WhoWhere?, an internet search company they founded which was purchased by Lycos in 1998.[7] Prior to the purchase by Lycos, Roy served as the company's CEO and Chairman and Sinha served as its President.[6]
eGain filed for its initial IPO with the Securities and Exchange Commission in July 1999.[8] At the time of the filing, it employed 114 people with plans to trade on the NASDAQ.[8] The company's stock began trading on the NASDAQ in September of that same year, going from $12 to $23 per share within its first few days of trading.[9] eGain filed for a secondary offering of common stock in February 2013.[10]
The company changed its name to eGain Corporation in November 2012.
eGain acquired Exony Ltd, a multichannel analytics and contact centre management company, in August 2014.
Products and services[edit]
eGain provides customer engagement cloud software for B2C companies.[4] eGains' product suite includes applications that deliver unified multichannel customer service via mobile, social, email, chat, cobrowse, and digital self-service, built on a single platform for customer interaction management, knowledge management, analytics, and administration.[4]
Awards and recognition[edit]
eGain has received numeorus awards and been recognized for its software, including as a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for web customer service, as well as by Information Today's KMWorld Magazine. In 2016 it made KMWorld's list of 100 Companies That Matter In Knowledge Management,[11] a list it has made every year since 2007.[12][13] It has also received inclusion on Software Magazine's Software 500 list of the top 500 software companies.

Web Self-Service
One size doesn't fit all in web self-service! The same approach to self-service will not work for every type of customer, every type of inquiry, or every stage of the customer life cycle.
            
            eGain SelfService enables organizations to provide distinctive, productive, and brand-aligned self-service experiences that enable breakthrough improvements in customer self-service effectiveness and adoption, while allowing seamless, context-aware escalations to live customer service or sales agents.


Video Chat, Text Chat, Cobrowsing
Are you looking for efficient ways of providing better experiences to your website visitors? Studies show that chat and cobrowsing are the most effective channels for engaging, selling to, and serving online customers. Reach out to customers, proactively or reactively, right when they need help and avoid abandoned shopping carts and half-filled forms. Offer distinctive mobile customer service.


Artificial Intelligence for Customer Service
The business benefits of Artificial Intelligence in customer engagement are real and game-changing. eGain uses AI technology-enabled reasoning capability to guide customers, contact center advisors, and field experts to the right answers, diagnosis, and process. This capability improves first contact resolution, customer satisfaction, agent confidence and productivity, and reduces truck rolls saving millions for the business.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
