We have established major partnerships such as Novo Nordisk and the US cancer hospital MD Anderson.

Dr Chiswell has over 30 years’ experience in the biotechnology industry having co-founded Cambridge Antibody Technology (CAT) in 1990, serving as CEO from 1996 to 2002.

Notes to Editors

About Kymab
Kymab is a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of fully human monoclonal antibody drugs using its proprietary Kymouse antibody platform.

Kymouse has been designed to maximise the diversity of human antibodies produced in response to immunisation with antigens. Selecting from a broad diversity of fully human antibodies assures the highest probability of finding that rare drug candidate with best-in-class characteristics. The Kymouse naturally matures these molecules to highly potent drugs obviating the need for further time-consuming modifications. Kymab is using the platform for its internal drug discovery programmes and in partnership with pharmaceutical companies. Kymab commenced operations in 2010 and has raised over US$120m of equity financing which includes $90m Series B financing. It was founded by Prof. Allan Bradley, who is the Chief Technology Officer and has an experienced management team with a successful track record in drug discovery and development and has numerous therapeutic antibody programmes in immune-oncology, auto-immunity; hematology, infectious disease and other areas.
