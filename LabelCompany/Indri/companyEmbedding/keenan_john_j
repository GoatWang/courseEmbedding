Loyola University Maryland


                  Loyola University Maryland is a Jesuit, Catholic university committed to the educational and spiritual traditions of the Society of Jesus and the development of the whole person. Accordingly, the University inspires students to learn, lead, and serve in a diverse and changing world.

At Loyola, this means that the curriculum is rigorous and faculty expectations are high. In addition to academic coursework, the Jesuit mission is carried out through a variety of programs and events sponsored by various University departments, including Campus Ministry and the Center for Community Service and Justice. Loyola aims to lead students, faculty, staff, alumni, and friends forward to pursue an examined life of intellectual, social, and spiritual discernment. In pursuing these goals, Loyola asserts a bold vision: that Loyola University Maryland will be the nation's leading Catholic, comprehensive university. The standards by which we measure that achievement include the enrollment of outstanding students; the creation of a diverse and supportive community; the cultivation of a rigorous intellectual climate which distinctly prepares graduates to succeed in any endeavor they choose to pursue; the scholarly achievements of the faculty; the recognition of academic peers; the intellectual and professional attainments and generosity of spirit of the alumni.

The Keenan Connection





The Keenan Connection
 
John Keenan and his wife Ellen Birmingham were
both born in Ireland, around 1832 - 1834. 
They were married in Columbus, Ohio, at St. Patrick's Church, on October
27, 1854 (see letter from St. Patrick's). 
They then moved to Dayton, where John became a U.S. citizen on October
6, 1857 at about the age of 25 (see attached document). Their oldest child Mary
was also presumably born in Dayton, since neither Mary nor their next child
George were baptized at St. Patrick's.
 
By 1860 they had returned to Columbus, since in
the 1860 Census they show up in Ohio, Franklin Co., Montgomery Twp., on sheet
357 as:
                  John Keenan             age 25(?)       Laborer          born
in  Ireland
                        Ellen
B                                  26                                               Ireland
                        Mary
E                                   4                                                Ohio
                        George                                  2                                                Ohio
 
The earliest record of John Keenan in a Columbus
city directory appears in 1862, with subsequent reports in 1864 (as John
Kenan), 1866-7, and 1867-8. All list him as a laborer.  During this same time period he and
Ellen had three children baptized at St. Patrick's:
                        Peter                           born
Dec. 22, 1860              baptized
Mar. 25, 1861
                        John
J.                        born
Aug. 19, 1862              baptized
Aug. 24, 1862
                        William
P.                   born
Mar. 16, 1867              baptized
Mar. 24, 1867
 
They appear to be gone from Columbus from about
1868 to around 1873, during which time a daughter Bridget is born.  John's name then reappears in the 1873
Columbus city directory, again as a laborer.  The following years report:
1874               Keenan,
John                     laborer                                res
257 E Naughten
1875               Keenen,
John (sic)             lamp

Payne & Naughten
1876               Keenan,
John Jacob          upholsterer                        res
Payne & Naughten
1878               Keenan,
John Jacob          city

Payne & Naughten
1879, 80        Keenan,
John J.                 upholsterer                        res
206 E Naughten
1881 to 86     Keenan,
John J.                 uphlstr,
12 E Chestnut     res
206 E Naughten
 
Apparently then, he began his own business at
about age 49, as an upholsterer, in 1881. 
The 1880 Federal Census reports the family living at 57 Payne Street,
thusly [Columbus OH, Vol. 22, Enum. Dist. 40, Sheet 36]:
                        John
Keenan                        48         IRE                      Upholsterer
                        Ellen
B                                  46         IRE                      Keeps

                        Peter
W.                               16         OH                      Wks-

                        William
P.                             13         OH                      School
                        Bridget                                   7          OH                      School
Mary is no longer living at home -- she's likely
either married or a live-in housekeeper, a common employment for young women in
that era.  Also, note that Peter W.
is listed as only 16 years old. 
That's perhaps just a recording error on the census taker's part, but it
may be that a nephew or other relative was staying with the Keenans, or the
Peter born in 1860 died, and a younger brother, also named Peter, was born and
baptized in Dayton.
                        
In 1883, at age 16, William Keenan also appears
in the city directory, listed as an upholsterer, presumably working for his
father.  By 1886 he had been
promoted:
1886-7           Keenan,
John J., of Keenan and Son                          res
22 Wayne
                        Keenan,
William P., of Keenan and Son                     res
22 Wayne
                        Keenan
and Son, furniture repairers                             3rd
and Naughten
 
By the following year they seem to have expanded
beyond just furniture repair, possibly because on Nov. 10, 1887, William
married Mary A. Meehan:
1887-8           Keenan
and Son, (John J. and Wm. P), furniture,      525
N. High
 
Then for the next six years William disappears;
John Keenan is again listed as an upholsterer, with no mention of his son or of
the business' name.  Finally in
1894 and 1895 William reappears under this listing:
1894, 5          Keenan,
John J.,                                                                     h.
292 Wayne
                        Keenan,
William P., mgr Keenan Bros. Mfg Co.                 h.
843 Penna.
                        Keenan
Bros. Mfg Co, Wm P. Keenan, mgr, office fixtures        67 E Gay
 
In 1896 William was no longer self employed:
1896               Keenan,
John J., uphlr.                                                           h.
1051 Summit
                        Keenan,
William P. (James Hayden & Co.) saloon fixtures, 67 E Gay
                                                                     and
saloon, 218 S. High, h. 843 Penna.
 
The change was however only temporary:
1897               Keenan,
John J., uphlr.                                                           h.
1051 Summit
                        Keenan,
Wm P. pres & treas, The Wm P Keenan Co.     h.
843 Penna.
                        The
Wm P Keenan Co., Keenan, Wm P. pres & treas,
                                                                     Maurice
Langen sec, saloon fixtures, 67 E Gay
 
Incidentally, in Mr. Langen was listed as a
plumber, boarding at 843 Penna.  In
1897 he was still boarding there. 
By 1898 he was listed as a clerk, boarding elsewhere.  So goes business.  From 1898 through 1900 the Wm P Keenan
Co. continued to be listed in the city directory, without Mr. Langen.  
 
The 1900 Census showed both William's growing
family, as well as John's.  Mary,
John and Ellen's eldest, was once again living with them, presumably caring for
her aged parents.  Note that
Ellen's birthdate seems to be in error, since it's inconsistent with her ages
in 1860 and 1880.  William's entry
suggests where he had been between 1888 and 1894 [Columbus OH, Vol 53, Enum
Dist 120, sheet 7]:
                  John Keenan             b June 1832    IRE               citizenship

                        Ellen

                        Catherine                       Sept
1897    OH
                        Alice                               June
1900    OH
 
The census also records that Ellen had 10
children, of who 6 still survived in 1900; that John was a retired upholsterer;
that they owned their own home; and that both John and Ellen could speak and
read English but neither could write (which was pretty common back then).
 
By 1901 William's business had folded, perhaps
due to William's ill health.  He is
listed in the city directory as
1901               Keenan,
Wm P., billiards                                          285
N. High.
 
William P. Keenan died on March 11 or 12, 1903,
of tuberculosis.  He was 36 years
old.  Four years later, on Feb. 20,
1907, at about the age of 73, his mother Ellen died.  John J. Keenan passed away a year on two later, age 76 or
77.
 
In the 1910 Census, the Keenan family appear as
follows [Columbus OH, Vol 67, Enum Dist 164, p 237]:
                  Mary A Keenan         Age 40
                        Mary
E                                20             
                        Edmund                              19
                        William
P.                            14
                        Catherine
C.                       12
                        Lucille
M                                6
                        
Alice had apparently died; Lucille may have been
born after her father's death.  The
census further reports that Mrs. Mary Keenan had borne a total of 7 children,
of whom only 5 were surviving in 1910.
 
It is also interesting to note that daughter Mary
E Keenan, who had been a full 24 months older than Edmund in 1900, was only one
year older than her brother a decade later.  This trait she undoubtedly inherited from her mother, who
aged only 7 years during that same decade.
 


From roughly 1888 to 1894, there's no record of William in Columbus.  He left in 1888 as an upholsterer, and
reappeared 6 years later selling office and saloon fixtures.  Where did he go and why the
occupational change?  The 1900
Census gives us a clue where he was: 
his son Edmund was born in Illinois.  The more complete answer lies with his three older brothers:
George, John, and Peter.
 
George first appeared in the Columbus city
directory in 1874, at the age of 16, as a bartender.  By 1878 he was listed as a plumber, which he remained until
1884, at which time he disappears from the Columbus city directory.
 
John also began as a bartender according to the
Columbus city directory, in 1880, at the age of 17 (although the census lists
him that year as working in a buggy factory).  He is not again listed until 1883 and 1884, as a telegraph
operator, at which time he too disappears.  Peter first appears as a plumber in 1881 (and so is probably
a year younger than John, as shown in the 1880 Census but not in the baptismal
record).  In 1881 he's a plumber,
in '83 a "rubber", in '84 a laborer, and in '85 also gone.  Where did they go?
 
[Note: the Columbus city directory lists a Peter
M. Keenan as residing with the family from 1883-1887, and a George in
1879.  These were likely relatives,
newly immigrated, perhaps John's brothers, nephews, or even his aged father!]
 
George (in 1884) and his brothers John and Peter
(in 1885) went to Chicago.  The
earliest record of them appears in the Chicago Architects, Contractors and
material Dealers Directory of 1889, which lists:
1889               Keenan
Bros., store and office fittings.
 
Two years later the Lakeside Annual Business
Directory lists:
1891               Keenan
Bros. (George J.  John J.  Peter M.), beer pumps  
                                                                                       202
Washington       tel
263
                        Keenan
Bros. Mnfg Co., George J. Keenan pres, John J.  Keenan sec,
                                                            office
fixtures    200 Washington 
 
Apparently their joint bartending and plumbing
backgrounds had paid off.  The 1891
Lakeside Directory listed Keenan Bros. Mnfg Co. under both "store and office
fixtures" and "beer pumps" (much like our modern yellow pages).
 
The 1899 Lakeside Directory lists, in the
alphabetical section
1899               Keenan
Bros. Mnfg Co.                     saloon
fixtures           184
Washington 
                                                                                                                          702
S Central Ave
In the business-groupings section, under "store
and office fixtures", Keenan Bros. Mnfg is again listed, but they no longer
appear under "beer pumps". However, there is a H. T. Shannon Mfg Co. listed
under that heading that advertized itself as the maker of the "Keenan Hydraulic
Air Compressor".  My guess is that
one of the brothers, probably George, had invented an improved beer pump back
around 1884, and about 10 years later sold the rights to it to Mr. Shannon
after diversifying into other product lines.
 
In the meantime though William had joined his
brothers in the family venture around 1888, learned the trade, and then
returned to Columbus in 1894 to open up his own branch of the Keenan Bros.
Mnfg. Co.  He too may have
gradually moved away from the beer pump end of the business to a broader line
of merchandise, since my mother always described him as having run a furniture
store.  But then again, maybe that
was just an editing of the oral family history, as handed down to me through
Mary Meehan Keenan, Catherine Keenan Cummins, and Elizabeth Cummins McGee.
 
Incidentally, my last business listing of the
Keenans appeared in 1903, in the Directory of Directors, City of Chicago:
1903               Keenan,
George J.       167
Randolph St.                           
                                                                        Union
Showcase Co.             Sec
& Dir 
                  Keenan, John J.            184
Washington                             
                                                                        Keenan
& Hyland Mfg Co.    Pres
& Dir
                                                                        Keenan
Bros. Mnfg Co.         Pres,
Sec, & Dir
                        Keenan,
Peter M.          184
Washington                             
                                                                        Keenan
Bros. Mnfg Co.         VP,
Treas, & Dir
 
George was on his own; John and Peter were still
running the family company together. 
No Keenans appear in the 1906 Lakeside Directory.  The Chicago Blue Book of 1912 lists two
Keenans, with the same listing for John appearing again in 1916:
1912               Keenan,
Mr. and Mrs. John J.                      3518
W Adams St         
                        Keenan,
Mr. and Mrs. G. J.                          209
S Central Pk Ave
 
[These two residential addresses are very near
each other, on intersecting streets; George's home faces Garfield Park, about 4
miles west of the Loop in Chicago.] 
These are the last records of the brothers I've been able to locate.
