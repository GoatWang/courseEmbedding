Fox Factory CEO Larry Enterline(In a FOX-equipped Ford F-150 SVT Raptor.)
Last autumn, the CEO of the newly-public company FOX Factory mentioned in an earnings call the planned shift of bicycle suspension component production from the company’s long-time California facility to Taiwan, prompting Singletrack to get in touch for additional details.  The result was a telephone conversation with CEO Larry L. Enterline describing the rationale for the move and its expected benefits.  Our conversation was wide-ranging and open, providing insight into not only the products themselves, but the many ways in which they reach the end user.  Below is a description of the rationale behind the move and some of the company’s future plans- with only a handful of details withheld at FOX’s request.
While it is not unusual for companies to shift production from the United States or Europe to Asia in order to reduce labour costs, Enterline stressed that FOX’s decision to establish and shift production to a facility in Taichung was not driven by dollars.  Though FOX has recently become a public company, issuing an IPO (initial public offering) last August, “going public has not impacted how we run our business” or created additional pressure to show profits, according to its head.  Given Taiwan’s rising cost of labour, savings in that area alone would not be sufficient to justify what has been a costly move.
FOX’s mountain bike offerings
The location of FOX’s current manufacturing facility in Watsonville, CA creates a number of challenges from logistics and supply chain perspectives. Today, Asian-sourced piece parts make their way across the pacific, pause in US customs, are assembled into forks and shocks, and then take a second cruise and customs break before being delivered to Taiwan-based OEMs.  The result is that most FOX products are extremely well traveled before ever seeing a trail.  This situation creates long lead times, adds transportation costs, and makes it difficult for FOX to respond to the bicycle manufacturers that purchase some 80% of their forks, shocks, and dropper posts.
Taichung facility
The establishment of a FOX-owned factory in Taichung is “all about shortening the supply chain,” reducing the time from order to delivery by as much as eight weeks.  This reduces the amount of capital that is tied up in seagoing product while allowing production to be adjusted as bicycle companies’ and distributors’ needs change.
As well as it has served the company, the Watsonville facility has gradually evolved into its current state, and “the way we’re doing things today is not the way you’d design it.”  Staffed by FOX employees, the Taiwanese production line uses the same tooling and equipment as is in California- but arranged on a blank sheet for improved efficiency.  With 700,000 suspension subassemblies (and every single DOSS dropper post) delivered to date, FOX Factory is confident in the quality of work emerging from the new plant.  Last month saw the first complete suspension fork deliveries from Taiwan- full scale fork production should be reached by this August.  Taiwanese rear shock production will trail forks by approximately one year.



Decal application in Watsonville
Meanwhile, the Watsonville plant will retain fork production capability, building forks and shocks to US-based boutique brands as well as for aftermarket sales.  Process development and manufacturability studies will also be performed Stateside, providing the company’s engineers with critical insight into and information about how their products can best be built.  While most quality control functions will be duplicated between the sites, samples from each line will be evaluated and tested at FOX headquarters.  With the shift of much bicycle production overseas, the California facility will be reconfigured to better serve the company’s powersports and motor vehicle customers, which represent roughly one third of sales and who largely take delivery in the USA.
While anything wearing the FOX badge will remain a premium product, the company also sees greater efficiencies bringing the opportunity to extend the fork range down a notch, for eventual spec on complete bicycles in the $1,500 – $2,000 range.  Establishing the Taichung facility has taken a good deal of work on FOX’s part- but the company now has a template (if not immediate plans) for establishing satellite production facilities in other locations as needed.  With US and EU sales strong, the company is now looking towards South American and mainland Chinese markets for future growth.

He can dress it up however he likes, but the upshot of the move is a cost saving for the company and improved profitability for the new share holders. Same as it ever was and will be. I wonder to what extent the removal of a tax incentive to SMEs in Watsonville was a factor?

Q: are you worried that rockshox have overtaken Fox in quality, price and function?

With the Pike forks and Monarch Plus Rock Shox is at level with fox in quality and function and well ahead in price.

There’s a pretty damning article (by their standards) about Fox in this month’s WMB, which essentially says too expensive, too poor performance.

Getting rid of the double shipping thing = save money.
New factory new layout for improved effiencicy as well =  save money.
The forks are gonne be cheaper then, right?

“The forks are gonne be cheaper then, right?”
Ha ha ha, of course they are, in the corporate world it’s all about the customer…… it is? isn’t it?

To OEMs building bikes in Taiwan? Yes.
After market to the UK? Doubt it.
On the grey market? Possibly.

Please pace/hope/cotic, make some uk forks please.









 





Northwind said on February 14, 2014 


Hah, yeah Pace, make some more forks- the only people in the world who could tell you that your rigid fork broke because you didn’t service it.









 





AlexSimon said on February 14, 2014 


Interesting how much negativity there is for Fox at the moment. On the STW Facebook, there’s about 20 negative comments and no positive ones.
Yet probably 80% of FS bikes still come with a Fox rear shock.

I guessing Fox has lost their Mojo (geddit???? 😉

FOX Racing Shox CEO Bob Kaswen Retiring, Larry L. Enterline Named Successor
Larry L. Enterline has been appointed CEO of FOX Racing Shox effective
March 22, 2011 replacing retiring CEO, Bob Kaswen—Mr. Kaswen will
remain active with the company as a consultant.
Watsonville, CA (PRWEB) March 11, 2011 – FOX Racing Shox announced
today that Larry L. Enterline has been appointed Chief Executive
Officer of the company following the planned retirement of Bob Kaswen.
Mr. Kaswen, who was the Chief Operating Officer from 2003 to 2008 and
Chief Executive Officer since 2008, will remain active with the
Company as a consultant.
“I have thoroughly enjoyed helping FOX Racing Shox achieve so much
over the last eight years. It has been a pleasure to work with such a
dedicated team of professionals and I look forward to continuing with
the company in an advisory capacity going forward,” said Kaswen. “The
appointment of Larry Enterline represents the culmination of a year of
planning with our board of directors and senior management team as I
have sought to take a step back and spend more time in support of my
family. In Larry we have found a strong leader and manager who will
build upon our historic successes,” Bob went on to say.
Most recently, Larry L. Enterline served as Chief Executive Officer of
COMSYS Holdings, Inc. from which he retired in April 2010 after the
sale of the company to Manpower, Inc. Prior to joining COMSYS, Mr.
Enterline served in a number of senior management roles with
Scientific-Atlanta, Inc. from 1989 to 2000, the last of which was
corporate senior vice president for Worldwide Sales and Service.
“I am excited to be able to join such a dynamic and growing company.
Bob Kaswen and the FOX team have built an industry leader and I look
forward to working with them and taking the company to the next
level,” said Enterline on his appointment to the role.
