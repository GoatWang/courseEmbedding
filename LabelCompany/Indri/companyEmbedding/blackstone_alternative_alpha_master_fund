Blackstone Alternative Alpha Funds Announce Estimated Year-End 
      Distribution of $30.00 to $55.00 per Share






October 29, 2015 12:47 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Blackstone (NYSE:BX) today announced that the Blackstone Alternative 
      Alpha Fund and the Blackstone Alternative Alpha Fund II (each a “Fund”, 
      and collectively, the “Funds”) they expect to pay a year-end 
      distribution to their shareholders of record on or about December 30, 
      2015. The Funds estimate that the distribution will be in the range of 
      $30.00 to $55.00 per share.
    

      Based on the most recent share price of Blackstone Alternative Alpha 
      Fund ($1,191.06 as of September 30, 2015), the estimated amount 
      represents a distribution in the range of approximately 2.5% to 4.6% of 
      the value of each share of that Fund.
    

      Based on the most recent share price of Blackstone Alternative Alpha 
      Fund II, Advisor Class II Shares ($994.79 as of September 30, 2015), the 
      estimated amount represents a distribution in the range of approximately 
      3.0% to 5.5% of the value of each share of that Fund.
    

      Based on the most recent share price of Blackstone Alternative Alpha 
      Fund II, Advisor Class III Shares ($1,107.07 as of September 30, 2015), 
      the estimated amount represents a distribution in the range of 
      approximately 2.7% to 5.0% of the value of each share of that Fund.
    

      Note that the estimated distribution amount is being provided for 
      informational purposes only; the estimated distribution amount is subject 
      to change and should not be used for tax reporting purposes. Actual 
      distribution amounts are subject to approval by the Funds’ Board of 
      Trustees and will be posted on the Funds’ website (www.blackstone.com/blackstone-alternative-alpha-funds) 
      in December 2015 after the ex-dividend date.
    

      When a Fund makes a distribution, there will be a corresponding decrease 
      in the net asset value of the Fund. However, investors will receive 
      either a cash payment or additional shares of the Fund corresponding to 
      the amount of the distribution depending on an investor’s dividend 
      reinvestment election. All taxable investors of record as of December 
      31, 2015 will have to include the distribution in 2015 taxable income.
    

Important Information


      The information contained herein is based on a number of broad 
      assumptions; actual distribution amounts will be announced after the 
      record date and may vary substantially from the above estimate. 
      Variations between the estimated and actual distribution amounts may 
      arise as a result of portfolio, market, and shareholder activity or tax 
      adjustments. Moreover, since the Funds make investments in underlying 
      domestic and foreign hedge funds, the actual distribution will be based 
      in part on tax information provided by underlying hedge funds, which is 
      not available at this time.
    

      Neither the Funds nor Blackstone Alternative Asset Management L.P., the 
      investment adviser of the Funds, provide tax, accounting or legal 
      advice. Any tax statements contained herein are not intended or written 
      to be used, and cannot be used, for the purpose of avoiding U.S., 
      federal, state or local tax penalties. Investors should consult their 
      advisor as to any tax, accounting or legal statements made herein. 
      Specific questions regarding an investor’s personal income tax situation 
      should be referred to a tax advisor.
    

About Blackstone Alternative Alpha Funds


      Each of the Funds is a non-diversified, closed-end management investment 
      company that is managed by Blackstone Alternative Asset Management L.P., 
      a subsidiary of The Blackstone Group L.P. (NYSE:BX). Each Fund’s 
      investment objective is to seek to earn long-term risk-adjusted returns 
      that are attractive as compared to those of traditional public equity 
      and fixed income markets. The Funds pursue their investment objective by 
      investing, indirectly through a master fund, in domestic and foreign 
      hedge funds that employ primarily equity-based investment strategies. 
      There can be no assurance that either Fund will achieve its investment 
      objective. Additional information is available at www.blackstone.com/blackstone-alternative-alpha-funds.
    

This press release is not an offer to sell the Funds’ securities and 
      is not soliciting an offer to buy the Funds’ securities in any state 
      where the offer or sale is not permitted. All investors should 
      consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the 
      Funds before investing. The prospectus contains this and other 
      information about the Funds. You can obtain a prospectus from 
      your financial professional or from the Funds’ website (www.blackstone.com/blackstone-alternative-alpha-funds).

      entirety before investing. Interests in the Funds are offered 
      through Blackstone Advisory Partners L.P., a member of FINRA and an

Performance data quoted above represents past performance and is no

      an investor’s shares, if repurchased in a tender offer, may be worth 
      more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be higher 
      or lower than performance data quoted. Performance does not include a 
      deduction of the maximum sales charge (up to 3.00%), which would lower 
      the performance shown. Information about BAAF, including current 
      month‐end performance, is available at www.blackstone.com/blackstone-alternative-alpha-funds/.

Blackstone Alternative Multi-Strategy Fund, Blackstone Diversified Multi-Strategy Fund, etc.).�Please refer to the Compliance Manuals for these funds for a summary of their proxy voting policies and procedures. 
�


I.
Policy  When BAAM, BSAA, BAS, BSCA, or
BSA (each an �Advisor�) has discretion to vote the proxies of its clients, including, without limitation, the private investment funds managed by the Advisor (the �Clients�), the Advisor will vote these proxies in the best
interest of the Clients and in accordance with these policies and procedures.  These policies and procedures are a supplement to, and form a
part of, the Advisor�s Supplemental Policies and Procedures Manual.  �


II.
Proxy Voting Procedures  For the Advisor,
proxies typically arise in the context of requests for consent or other votes requested by underlying hedge fund managers. All proxies received by the Advisor will be sent to the Legal and Product Structuring (�LaPS�) Team, which is
responsible for monitoring and documenting the proxy voting process. The LaPS Team will:  (1) Deliver a summary of the proposed changes to the
relevant Manager Team members, who will determine the appropriate course of action.  (2) Provide the relevant Manager Team members with a list
of Clients that invest in the underlying fund in question and the date by which the Advisor must vote the proxy.  (3) Complete the consent
form provided by the underlying manager and prepare it for execution by the appropriate authorized signatory. All proxies will be returned by the LaPS Team either to the custodian, if the Client utilizes a custodian, or directly to the underlying
manager.  (4) Update HedgeHog (proprietary software) with the appropriate information. 
�


*�
 Includes relying adviser BSCA Advisors L.L.C. (�BSCAA�). 


(5) Maintain records relating to each proxy, including (i)�a copy of the proxy; (ii)�the voting
decision with regard to the proxy; (iii)�any documents created by the Advisor, or others, that were material to the voting decision; (iv)�a record of each written request from an investor for proxy voting information; and (v)�the
Advisor�s written response to any such request (oral or written). Such records shall be maintained by the LaPS Team in its offices for two years and for an additional three years in an easily accessible place. 
(6) Maintain a copy of these policies and procedures and all amendments thereto.  Where a Client holds publicly traded securities, the Client�s securities may be borrowed, hypothecated, rehypothecated or pledged by the Client�s custodian on the record date for determining
eligibility to vote a proxy. In such case, the Client typically will not be eligible to vote the securities. The Advisor does not believe it is necessary or practical to insist that the custodians �lock up� the Client�s securities at
all times (i.e., not allow the Client�s securities to be borrowed, hypothecated, rehypothecated or pledged). However, the Advisor will request that the custodian �lock up� the Client�s securities on a record date if the
vote in question is material to the Client�s investments.  �


III.
Voting Guidelines  In the absence of
specific voting guidelines from a Client, the Advisor will vote proxies in the best interests of the Client as determined in the Advisor�s reasonable discretion. The Advisor may elect not to vote certain routine proxies where the Advisor
determines that doing so would be unduly burdensome.  �


IV.
Conflicts of Interest  The LaPS Team will
identify any conflicts that exist between the interests of the Advisor and its Clients. This examination will include a review of the relationship of the Advisor and its affiliates with the underlying manager or the issuer of the security to
determine if the manager or issuer has any relationship with the Advisor or an affiliate of the Advisor. If a material conflict exists, the Advisor will determine the appropriate course of action. 
�


V.
Disclosure  The Advisor will disclose in
each Client�s Confidential Offering Memorandum (or other applicable offering document) that investors, by written request, may obtain a copy of these policies and procedures and may review in the Advisor�s offices information on how the
Advisor voted proxies relating to the Client�s portfolio. Such information will include, with respect to each voted proxy, (1)�the name of the issuer; (2)�the proposal voted upon; and (3)�how the Advisor voted the proxy. Similar
disclosures and practices will be followed for Clients which are not funds.  �


VI.
Class Actions  When a recovery is
achieved in a class action, investors who owned shares in the company subject to the action have the option to either: (1)�opt out of the class action and pursue their own remedy; or (2)�participate in the recovery achieved via the class
action. If class action documents are received by the Advisor on behalf of a Client, the LaPS Team and relevant Manager Team members together will determine if it is in the best interests of the Client to participate in, or opt out of, the class
action. The LaPS Team will maintain appropriate documentation.

VII.
BSA  BSA has engaged the services of
Institutional Shareholder Services, Inc. (�ISS�) to make recommendations to BSA on the voting of proxies related to securities held by BSA Clients. The third-party portfolio managers retained by BSA generally also will retain ISS. ISS
provides voting recommendations based on established guidelines and practices.  BSA will review ISS recommendations and generally will vote
proxies in accordance with such recommendations. However, BSA may decide not vote in accordance with the ISS recommendations if it believes that the specific ISS recommendation is not in the best interests of the BSA Clients. In addition, if a
conflict of interest arises between ISS and a company subject to a proxy vote, the Adviser generally will vote the proxy without considering the analyses of ISS and will consider the recommendation of the company and what the Adviser believes to be
in the best interests of the Client.  BSA will rely upon ISS to maintain records of the following with respect to each proxy vote: 
�


�
�
�
 The Issuer�s name;  �


�
�
�
 The security�s ticker symbol or CUSIP, as applicable; 
�


�
�
�
 The shareholder meeting date;  �


�
�
�
 The number of shares that XYZ voted;  �


�
�
�
 A brief identification of the matter voted on;  �


�
�
�
 Whether the matter was proposed by the Issuer or a security-holder; 
�


�
�
�
 Whether BSA cast a vote;  �


�
�
�
 How BSA cast its vote (for the proposal, against the proposal, or abstain); and 
�


�
�
�
 Whether BSA cast its vote with or against management.
