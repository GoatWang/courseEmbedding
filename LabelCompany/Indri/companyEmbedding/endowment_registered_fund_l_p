��Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures��

THE ENDOWMENT REGISTERED FUND, L.P.  THE ENDOWMENT TEI FUND, L.P.  (each, a �Feeder Fund�)
 THE ENDOWMENT MASTER FUND, L.P.  (the �Master Fund�)  (collectively, the �Funds�)  PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES  �


 I.
 Statement of Principle  The
Funds seek to assure that proxies received by the Funds are voted in the best interests of the Funds� stockholders and have accordingly adopted these procedures.  �


 II.
 Delegation of Proxy Voting/Adoption of Adviser and Sub-Adviser Policies  Except as provided in Section III below, each Fund delegates the authority to vote proxies related to portfolio securities to Endowment Advisers, L.P. (the �Adviser�), as investment
adviser to each Fund. For each portion of the Fund�s portfolio managed by a sub-adviser retained to provide day-to-day portfolio management for that portion of the Fund�s portfolio (each, a �Sub-Adviser�), the Adviser in turn may
delegate its proxy voting authority to the Sub-Adviser responsible for that portion of the Fund�s portfolio. The Board of Directors of each Fund adopts the proxy voting policies and procedures of the Adviser and Sub-Advisers as the proxy voting
policies and procedures that will be used by each of these respective entities when exercising voting authority on behalf of the Fund. These policies and procedures are attached hereto.  �


 III.
 Retention of Proxy Voting Authority  With respect to proxies issued by the Master Fund, the Feeder Funds do not delegate to the Adviser, but instead retain, their proxy voting authority. After receiving a proxy issued by the Master Fund, the Feeder Fund will hold a meeting of
its Partners at which the Partners will vote their Interests to instruct the Feeder Fund to vote for or against the matter presented by the Master Fund. The Feeder Fund will then calculate the proportion of Interests voted for to those voted against
(ignoring for purposes of this calculation the Interests for which it receives no voting instructions) and will subsequently vote its Interests in the Master Fund for or against the matter in the same proportion.  �


 IV.
 Consent in the Event of a Conflict of Interest  If for a particular proxy vote the Adviser or Sub-Adviser seeks a Fund�s consent to vote because of a conflict of interest or for other reasons, any two independent directors of the Fund may provide the
Fund�s consent to vote.  �


 V.
 Annual Review of Proxy Voting Policies of Adviser and Sub-Advisers  The Board of Directors of each Fund will review on an annual basis the proxy voting policies of the Adviser and Sub-Advisers applicable to the Fund.  Dated: March�10, 2004, as amended March�17, 2005.  ENDOWMENT ADVISERS, L.P.  PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES  The following are proxy voting policies and procedures
(�Policies and Procedures�) adopted by Endowment Advisers, LP (�Endowment
Advisers�), an investment adviser registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (�SEC�) under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (�Advisers Act�), with respect to voting securities held by client
portfolios. Clients include The Endowment Registered Fund, L.P., The Endowment TEI Fund, L.P. and The Endowment Registered Master Fund, L.P. (the �Funds�) each of which is an investment company registered with the SEC under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended (�1940 Act�), and may include in the future other registered investment companies as well as individuals, partnerships and corporations. These Policies and Procedures are adopted to ensure compliance by
Endowment Advisers with Rule 206(4)-6 under the Advisers Act and other applicable fiduciary obligations under rules and regulations of the SEC and interpretations of its staff. Endowment Advisers follows these Policies and Procedures for each of its
clients as required under the Advisers Act and other applicable law, unless expressly directed by a client in writing to refrain from voting that client�s proxies or to vote in accordance with the client�s proxy voting policies and
procedures. With respect to the Funds, Endowment Advisers follows both these Policies and Procedures and the proxy voting policies and procedures adopted by the Funds and their Boards of Directors. 




 I.
 Definitions  A. �Best interest of clients�. In the view of Endowment Advisers, this means clients� best economic interest over the long term � that is, the common interest that all clients share in seeing the value of a common
investment increase over time. Clients may have differing political or social interests, but their best economic interest is generally uniform.  B. �Material conflict of interest�. Circumstances when Endowment Advisers, or any member of its senior management or any of its portfolio managers or portfolio analysts, knowingly does business with a
particular proxy issuer or closely affiliated entity which may appear to create a material conflict between the interests of Endowment Advisers and the interests of its clients in how proxies of that issuer are voted.  �


 II.
 General Policy  Where
Endowment Advisers is given responsibility for voting proxies, we must take reasonable steps under the circumstances to ensure that proxies are received and voted with a view to enhancing the value of the shares of stock held in client accounts.
 These Policies and Procedures expressly address the voting of proxies or securities with respect to which the issuers solicit proxies to
vote on proposals that are put to a vote of shareholders. Each Fund may invest all or some portion of its assets in the securities of privately placed investment vehicles (�Private Investment Funds�), which do not typically convey
traditional voting rights to the holder, and the occurrence of corporate governance or other notices for this type of investment is substantially less that encountered in connection with registered equity securities. On occasion, however, each Fund
or its general partner(s) may receive notices from the Private Investment Funds seeking the consent of holders in order to materially change certain rights within the structure of the security issued by the Private Investment Fund or change material
terms of the Private Investment Fund�s constituent documents. Endowment Advisers shall follow these Policies and Procedures, to the extent applicable, in exercising the rights of the Funds to vote or consent in connection with its investments
in Private Investment Funds. The Advisor shall take such action as may be necessary to enable the Funds to comply with all disclosure and recordkeeping obligations imposed by applicable rules and regulations.  The financial interest of our clients is the primary consideration in determining how proxies should be voted. In the case of social and political
responsibility issues that in our view do not primarily involve financial considerations, the diversity of our clients means that we are unable to represent each such view in each instance. Thus, Endowment Advisers exercises its vote on these issues
in what it believes to be the best economic interests of its clients unless a private account client has provided specific instructions otherwise for its voting securities. When making specific proxy decisions, Endowment Advisers generally adheres
to its specific voting policies contained in Section VI herein. The guidelines set forth positions of Endowment Advisers on recurring issues and criteria for addressing non-recurring issues. The general voting policies of Endowment Advisers are
described below.  �


 III.
 General Voting Policies  A. Client�s Best Interest. These Policies and Procedures are designed and implemented in a way that is reasonably expected to ensure that proxies are voted in the best interest of clients. Proxies
will be voted with the aim of furthering the best economic interests of clients, promoting high levels of corporate governance and adequate disclosure of company policies, activities and returns, including fair and equal treatment of shareholders.
 B. Shareholder Activism. Endowment Advisers seeks to develop relationships with the management of portfolio
companies to encourage transparency and improvements in the treatment owners and stakeholders. Thus, Endowment Advisers may engage in dialogue with the management of portfolio companies with respect to pending proxy voting issues.  C. Case-by-Case Basis. While these Policies and Procedures guide our decisions, each proxy vote is ultimately cast on a
case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the contractual obligations under the advisory agreement or comparable document, and all other relevant facts and circumstances at the time of the vote. Endowment Advisers may cast proxy votes in favor
of management proposals or seek to change the views of management, considering specific issues as they arise on their merits. Endowment Advisers may also join with other investment managers in seeking to submit a shareholder proposal to a company or
to oppose a proposal submitted by the company. Any such action is primarily based on grounds of fundamental share value.  D. Individualized. These Policies and Procedures are tailored to suit the advisory business of Endowment Advisers and the types of securities portfolios it manages. To the extent that clients have adopted their own procedures,
Endowment Advisers may vote the same securities differently depending upon clients� directions.  E. Material
Conflicts of Interest. Material conflicts are resolved in the best interest of clients. When a material conflict of interest between Endowment Advisers and its respective client(s) is identified, Endowment Advisers will choose among the
procedures set forth in Section IV.B.3.b., below, to resolve such conflict.  �
2 


F. Limitations. The circumstances under which Endowment Advisers may take a
limited role in voting proxies, include the following.  1. No Responsibility. Endowment Advisers will not vote proxies for
client accounts in which the client contract specifies that Endowment Advisers will not vote. Under such circumstances, the clients� custodians (�Custodians�) are instructed to mail proxy material directly to such clients. 
2. Limited Value. Endowment Advisers may abstain from voting a client proxy if the effect on shareholders� economic interests or
the value of the portfolio holding is indeterminable or insignificant.  3. Unjustifiable Costs. Endowment Advisers may
abstain from voting a client proxy for cost reasons.  4. Securities Lending Arrangements. If voting securities are part of
a securities lending program, Endowment Advisers may be unable to vote while the securities are on loan.  5. Special
Considerations. The responsibilities of Endowment Advisers for voting proxies are determined generally by its obligations under each advisory contract or similar document. If a client requests in writing that Endowment Advisers vote its proxy in a
manner inconsistent with these Policies and Procedures, Endowment Advisers may follow the client�s direction or may request that the client vote the proxy directly. As a courtesy to certain clients, Endowment Advisers may, from time to time,
agree to vote proxies on securities over which Endowment Advisers holds no discretionary management authority. Endowment Advisers is under no obligation to vote these securities as they are not part of the clients� managed accounts, Endowment
Advisers exercises no discretion over such securities, and they are not generally included in the securities which Endowment Advisers follows as an investment adviser. To the extent that Endowment Advisers has agreed to perform the courtesy service
of mechanically casting the vote on any such securities and no specific voting instructions are provided by the client(s), Endowment Advisers will not research the companies and will either vote with management or abstain unless the security being
voted happens to be covered by Endowment Advisers in its capacity as investment adviser.  G. Sources of
Information. Endowment Advisers may conduct research internally and/or use the resources of an independent research consultant. Endowment Advisers may consider legislative materials, studies of corporate governance and other proxy voting issues,
and/or analyses of shareholder and management proposals by a certain sector of companies, e.g. small cap companies.  H. Availability of Policies and Procedures. Endowment Advisers will provide clients with a copy of these Policies and Procedures, as revised from time to time, upon request.  I. Disclosure of Vote. A client may obtain information on how its proxies were voted by requesting such information from
Endowment Advisers. Endowment Advisers does not generally disclose client proxy votes to third parties, other than as required for the Funds, unless specifically requested, in writing, by the client.  �


 IV.
 Proxy Voting Procedures  A. General  1. Accounts for Which Endowment Advisers Has Proxy Voting
Responsibility  Endowment Advisers is generally responsible for voting proxies with respect to securities held in client accounts unless the
investment management agreement explicitly states that Endowment Advisers will not vote proxies for the account. Endowment Advisers is not responsible for voting client securities which are not part of the managed account. However, Endowment
Advisers may, as a courtesy, vote certain client securities which are not part of the managed account at the request of its clients subject to the limitations described in Section III.F.6., above.  2. Adherence to Client Proxy Voting Policies  If a client has its own proxy voting policy, Endowment Advisers and the client will agree in writing on whether Endowment Advisers will vote in accordance with its own policy, whether Endowment Advisers will vote that
client�s securities in accordance with the client�s policy or whether the client will vote its own securities.  �
3 


3. Disclosure of Proxy Voting Intentions  Endowment Advisers personnel should not discuss with members of the public how Endowment Advisers intends to vote on any particular proxy proposal. This
does not restrict communications in the ordinary course of business with other clients for which Endowment Advisers votes proxies. Disclosure of Endowment Advisers� proxy voting intentions � especially where done with the purpose or effect
of influencing the management or control of a company � could trigger various restrictions under the federal securities laws, including under the proxy solicitation, beneficial ownership and short-swing profit liability provisions of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In the event that Endowment Advisers wishes to discuss its voting intentions outside the firm, Endowment Advisers should consult with its counsel before any such discussions.  B. Operational Procedures  1. Role of the Proxy Administrator  Once a client account is established and the proxy voting responsibility
is determined, the Proxy Administrator (�PA�), is responsible for receiving and processing proxies for securities held in the portfolios of our clients and ensuring that votes are cast. The PA is responsible for ensuring that the
registered owners of record, e.g. the client, trustee or custodian bank, that receive proxy materials from the issuer or its information agent, forward proxy materials to Endowment Advisers. Proxies may also be delivered electronically
through a proxy service. The PA logs in any proxy materials received, matches them to the securities to be voted and confirms that the correct amount of shares, as of the record date, is reflected on the proxy. Once the proxy statement is logged in,
the PA gives it to a research analyst (�Analyst�) for consideration.  The PA also compiles and maintains information, for each
client for which Endowment Advisers votes proxies, showing the issuer�s name, meeting date and manner in which it voted on each proxy proposal. The PA is also responsible for monitoring compliance with client proxy voting policies. A copy of
each proxy statement is kept. Endowment Advisers generally seeks to vote proxies at least one (1)�week prior to the deadline. Unfortunately, proxy materials are often received with less than a week�s time before the deadline, and in such
cases, Endowment Advisers uses reasonable efforts to exercise its vote.  2. Material Conflicts of Interest  a. Endowment Advisers will take steps to identify the existence of any material conflicts of interest relating to the securities to be
voted or the issue at hand. Senior management, portfolio managers and Analysts of Endowment Advisers are expected to disclose to the PA any personal conflicts such as officer or director positions held by them, their spouses or close relatives in
the portfolio company. Conflicts based on business relationships or dealings of affiliates of Endowment Advisers will only be considered to the extent that the Endowment Advisers has actual knowledge of such business relationships.  b. When a material conflict of interest between Endowment Advisers� interests and its clients� interests appears to exist,
Endowment Advisers may choose among the following options to eliminate such conflict: (1)�vote in accordance with these Policies and Procedures if it involves little or no discretion; (2)�vote as recommended by a third-party service if
Endowment Advisers utilizes such a service; (3)��echo vote� or �mirror vote� the proxies in the same proportion as the votes of other proxy holders that are not clients of Endowment Advisers; (4)�if possible, erect
information barriers around the person or persons making voting decisions sufficient to insulate the decision from the conflict; (5)�if practical, notify affected clients of the conflict of interest and seek a waiver of the conflict; or
(6)�if agreed upon in writing with the client, forward the proxies to affected clients allowing them to vote their own proxies.  3. Role of the Research Analysts  The PA ensures that each proxy statement is directed to the Analyst
responsible for following the particular security or industry. The Analysts are responsible for considering the substantive issues relating to any vote, deciding how the shares will be voted, and instructing the PA how to vote the proxies. In
determining how to vote a given proxy, Analysts will adhere to these Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures, as revised from time to time, except to the extent superseded by client proxy voting policies or to the extent that a material conflict of
interest is identified. In the event of a personal material conflict of interest, the Analyst will refer the decision to another Endowment Advisers Analyst who has no such conflict. In the event of an organizational conflict, Endowment Advisers will
follow the procedures outlined in Section IV.B.3.b., above. If there is no material conflict of interest, the vote recommendation will be forwarded to the PA to be cast. The Analyst may consult with the PA and/or Senior Management as necessary to
identify and resolve conflicts. Analysts are responsible for documenting the rationale for any vote recommendation.  4.
Role of the Third-Party Service Provider(s)  Endowment Advisers may engage a third-party service provider to provide notification of
impending votes, including shareholder resolutions, which may be viewed on-line. In addition, Endowment Advisers may engage a third-party service provider to provide web-based proxy voting and recordkeeping services.  �

 V.
 Documentation, Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements  A. Documentation. The PA is responsible for:  1.

 C. Guidelines for Specific Proxy Voting Issues.  1. The Board of Directors  a. Voting on Director Nominees in Uncontested Elections  Votes on director nominees are made on a
case-by-case basis, examining the following factors:  �


 �
�
 Long-term corporate performance record relative to a market index;  �


 �
�
 Composition of board and key board committees;  �


 �
�
 Nominee�s attendance at meetings (past two years);  �


 �
�
 Nominee�s investment in the company;  �


 �
�
 Whether a retired CEO sits on the board; and  �


 �
�
 Whether the chairman is also serving as CEO.  In cases of significant votes and when information is readily available, we also review:  �


 �
�
 Corporate governance provisions and takeover activity;  �


 �
�
 Board decisions regarding executive pay;  �


 �
�
 Director compensation;  �


 �
�
 Number of other board seats held by nominee; and  �


 �
�
 Interlocking directorships.  b. Chairman and CEO are the Same Person  We vote on a case-by-case basis on shareholder proposals
that would require the positions of chairman and CEO to be held by different persons.  c. Majority of Independent
Directors  Shareholder proposals that request that the board be comprised of a majority of independent directors are evaluated on a
case-by-case basis.  We vote for shareholder proposals that request that the board audit, compensation and/or nominating
committees include independent directors exclusively.  d. Stock Ownership Requirements  We generally vote against shareholder proposals requiring directors to own a minimum amount of company stock in order to qualify as a director, or
to remain on the board.  e. Term of Office  We generally vote against shareholder proposals to limit the tenure of outside directors.  �
6 


f. Director and Officer Indemnification and Liability Protection  Proposals concerning director and officer indemnification and liability protection are evaluated on a case-by-case basis.  We generally vote against proposals to limit or eliminate entirely director and officer liability for monetary damages for violating the duty of
care.  We generally vote against indemnification proposals that would expand coverage beyond just legal expenses to acts, such as
negligence, that are more serious violations of fiduciary obligations than mere carelessness.  We generally vote for only those
proposals that provide such expanded coverage in cases when a director�s or officer�s legal defense was unsuccessful if: (1)�the director was found to have acted in good faith and in a manner that he reasonably believed was in the
best interests of the company, and (2)�only if the director�s legal expenses would be covered.  2.
Charitable Contributions  We generally vote against shareholder proposals to eliminate, direct or otherwise restrict charitable
contributions.  3. Proxy Contests  a. Voting for Director Nominees in Contested Elections  Votes in a contested election
of directors are evaluated on a case-by-case basis, considering the following factors:  �


 �
�
 Long-term financial performance of the target company relative to its industry;  �


 �
�
 Management�s track record;  �


 �
�
 Background to the proxy contest;  �


 �
�
 Qualifications of director nominees (both slates);  �


 �
�
 Evaluation of what each side is offering shareholders as well as the likelihood that the proposed objectives and goals can be met; and
 �


 �
�
 Stock ownership positions.  b. Reimburse Proxy Solicitation Expenses  Decisions to provide full reimbursement for dissidents waging a
proxy contest are made on a case-by-case basis.  4. Auditors  We generally vote for proposals to ratify auditors, unless: an auditor has a financial interest in or association with the company, and is therefore not independent; or there is reason to
believe that the independent auditor has rendered an opinion which is neither accurate nor indicative of the company�s financial position.  5. Proxy Contest Defenses  a. Board Structure: Staggered vs. Annual Elections 
We generally vote against proposals to classify the board.  We vote for proposals to repeal classified boards and to elect all directors annually.  b. Shareholder Ability to Remove Directors  We vote against proposals that provide that directors may be removed only
for cause.  We vote for proposals to restore shareholder ability to remove directors with or without cause.  We vote against proposals that provide that only continuing directors may elect replacements to fill board vacancies.  We vote for proposals that permit shareholders to elect directors to fill board vacancies.  �
7 


c. Cumulative Voting  We vote against proposals to eliminate cumulative voting.  We vote for
proposals to permit cumulative voting.  d. Shareholder Ability to Call Special Meetings  We vote against proposals to restrict or prohibit shareholder ability to call special meetings.  We vote for proposals that remove restrictions on the right of shareholders to act independently of management.  e. Shareholder Ability to Act by Written Consent  We vote against proposals to restrict or prohibit shareholder ability to take action by written consent.  We vote for proposals to allow or make easier shareholder
action by written consent.  f. Shareholder
Ability to Alter the Size of the Board  We review on a case-by-case basis proposals that seek to fix the size of the board.
 We vote against proposals that give management the ability to alter the size of the board without shareholder approval. 
6. Tender Offer Defenses  a. Poison Pills  We vote for shareholder proposals that ask a company to submit its poison pill for
shareholder ratification.  We review on a case-by-case basis shareholder proposals to redeem a company�s poison pill.
 We review on a case-by-case basis management proposals to ratify a poison pill.  b. Fair Price Provisions  We vote case-by-case on fair price proposals, taking into consideration whether the shareholder vote requirement embedded in the provision is no more than a majority of disinterested shares.  We vote for shareholder proposals to lower the shareholder vote requirement in existing fair price provisions.  c. Greenmail  We vote
for proposals to adopt anti-greenmail charter or bylaw amendments or otherwise restrict a company�s ability to make greenmail payments.  We review on a case-by-case basis anti-greenmail proposals when they are bundled with other charter or bylaw amendments.  d. Pale Greenmail  We review on a case-by-case basis restructuring plans that involve the payment of
pale greenmail.  e. Unequal Voting Rights  We vote against dual class exchange offers.  We vote against dual class recapitalizations.
 f. Supermajority Shareholder Vote Requirement to Amend the Charter or Bylaws  We vote against management proposals to require a supermajority shareholder vote to approve charter and bylaw amendments.  We vote for shareholder proposals to lower supermajority shareholder vote requirements for charter and bylaw amendments.  �
8 


g. Supermajority Shareholder Vote Requirement to Approve Mergers  We vote against management proposals to require a supermajority shareholder vote to approve mergers and other significant business combinations.
 We vote for shareholder proposals to lower supermajority shareholder vote requirements for mergers and other significant business
combinations.  h. White Squire Placements  We vote for shareholder proposals to require approval of blank check preferred stock issues for other than general corporate purposes.  7. Miscellaneous Governance Provisions  a. Confidential Voting
 We vote for shareholder proposals that request corporations to adopt confidential voting, use independent tabulators and use
independent inspectors of election as long as the proposals include clauses for proxy contests as follows: in the case of a contested election, management is permitted to request that the dissident group honor its confidential voting policy. If the
dissidents agree, the policy remains in place. If the dissidents do not agree, the confidential voting policy is waived.  We vote
for management proposals to adopt confidential voting.  b. Equal Access  We vote for shareholder proposals that would allow significant company shareholders equal access to management�s proxy material in order to
evaluate and propose voting recommendations on proxy proposals and director nominees, and in order to nominate their own candidates to the board.  c. Bundled Proposals  We review on a case-by-case basis bundled or �conditioned� proxy
proposals. In the case of items that are conditioned upon each other, we examine the benefits and costs of the packaged items. In instances when the joint effect of the conditioned items is not in shareholders� best interest, we vote against
the proposals. If the combined effect is positive, we support such proposals.  d. Shareholder Advisory Committees
 We review on a case-by-case basis proposals to establish a shareholder advisory committee.  8. Capital Structure  a. Common Stock Authorization  We review on a case-by-case basis proposals to increase the number of
shares of common stock authorized for issue.  We vote against proposed common stock authorizations that increase the existing
authorization by more than 100 percent unless a clear need for the excess shares is presented by the company.  b. Stock
Distributions: Splits and Dividends  We vote for management proposals to increase common share authorization for a stock split,
provided that the split does not result in an increase of authorized but unissued shares of more than 100% after giving effect to the shares needed for the split.  c. Reverse Stock Splits  We vote for management proposals to implement a
reverse stock split, provided that the reverse split does not result in an increase of authorized but unissued shares of more than 100% after giving effect to the shares needed for the reverse split.  d. Blank Check Preferred Authorization  We vote for proposals to create blank check preferred stock in cases when the company expressly states that the stock will not be used as a takeover defense or carry superior voting rights.  We review on a case-by-case basis proposals that would authorize the creation of new classes of preferred stock with unspecified voting,
conversion, dividend and distribution, and other rights.  �
9 


We review on a case-by-case basis proposals to increase the number of authorized blank check
preferred shares.  e. Shareholder Proposals Regarding Blank Check Preferred Stock  We vote for shareholder proposals to have blank check preferred stock placements, other than those shares issued for the purpose of raising capital
or making acquisitions in the normal course of business, submitted for shareholder ratification.  f. Adjust Par Value of
Common Stock  We vote for management proposals to reduce the par value of common stock.  g. Pre-emptive Rights  We
review on a case-by-case basis proposals to create or abolish pre-emptive rights. In evaluating proposals on preemptive rights, we look at the size of a company and the characteristics of its shareholder base.  h. Debt Restructurings  We
review on a case-by-case basis proposals to increase common and/or preferred shares and to issue shares as part of a debt-restructuring plan. We consider the following issues:  Dilution � How much will ownership interest of existing shareholders be reduced, and how extreme will dilution to any future earnings be?  Change in Control � Will the transaction result in a change in control of the company?  Bankruptcy � Is the threat of bankruptcy, which would result in severe losses in shareholder value, the main factor driving the debt
restructuring?  Generally, we approve proposals that facilitate debt restructurings unless there are clear signs of self-dealing or other
abuses.  i. Share Repurchase Programs  We vote for management proposals to institute open-market share repurchase plans in which all shareholders may participate on equal terms.  9. Executive and Director Compensation  In general, we vote on a case-by-case basis on executive and director compensation plans, with the view that viable compensation programs reward the creation of shareholder wealth by having a high payout
sensitivity to increases in shareholder value.  Other factors, such as repricing underwater stock options without shareholder approval,
would cause us to vote against a plan. Additionally, in some cases we would vote against a plan deemed unnecessary.  a.
OBRA-Related Compensation Proposals  �


 �
�
 Amendments that Place a Cap on Annual Grant or Amend Administrative Features  Vote for plans that simply amend shareholder-approved plans to include administrative features or place a cap on the annual grants any one

 �
�
