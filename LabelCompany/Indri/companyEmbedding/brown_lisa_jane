This isn't second pair of apex. They are effective.  Not too heavy. 




Lisa style






			Posted by Unknown on 17th Mar 2015
		
Pretty leatherwork pattern on toe box combined with good fit and comfort. Would like to see Lisa offered in more colors. 




Good fit

They are attractive,all the family members think they are "cute and they are comfortable.  I do like them as I have artheritis in my feet and have a hard time finding shoes that are comfortable.

Investigators probing the disappearance of 23-year-old Jennifer Jean Wilby, a mother and massage parlour worker, say it is unconnected to the disappearance last November of prostitute Lisa Jane Brown. Still at-large in Perth is the Claremont Killer who in 1996 kidnapped three women outside a popular nightspot south-west of Perth. Sergeant Tony Potts, spokesman for Operation Storm, the task force formed to search for the missing women, stressed that there was no second serial killer, nor had the Claremont killer struck again. http://www.mayhem.net/Crime/morg9906.htmlIs this the same woman??_________________________________________________________________________________________________\'Those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves.\' Abraham LincolnSusanAdministrator Number of posts :  11477Age :  57Location :  Spain.
