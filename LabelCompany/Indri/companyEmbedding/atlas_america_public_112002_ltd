         10-Q: ATLAS AMERICA PUBLIC #11-2002 LTD.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (UNAUDITED)  Forward-Looking Statements  When used in this Form 10-Q, the words "believes", "anticipates," "expects" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from the results stated or implied in this document. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to forward-looking statements which we may make to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Form 10-Q or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.  General  Atlas America Public #11-2002 LTD. ("we", "us", or the "Partnership") is a Delaware limited partnership, formed on June 5, 2002 with Atlas Resources, LLC serving as its Managing General Partner and Operator ("Atlas Resources" or "MGP"). Atlas Resources is an indirect subsidiary of Atlas Resource Partners, L.P. ("ARP") 

                            
                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                  
                                    ARP, +0.00%
 We have drilled and currently operate wells located in Pennsylvania and Ohio. We have no employees and rely on our MGP for management, which in turn, relies on its parent company, Atlas Energy L.P. ("Atlas Energy"), for administrative services.  We do not plan to sell any of our wells and intend to continue to produce them until they are depleted or become uneconomical to produce, at which time they will be plugged and abandoned or sold. We expect that no other wells will be drilled and no additional funds will be required for drilling.  Overview  The following discussion provides information to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations. Our operating cash flows are generated from our wells, which produce primarily natural gas, but also some oil. Our produced natural gas and oil is then delivered to market through affiliated or third-party gas gathering systems. Our ongoing operating and maintenance costs have been and are expected to be fulfilled through revenues from the sale of our natural gas and oil production. We pay our MGP, as operator, a monthly well supervision fee, which covers all normal and regularly recurring operating expenses for the production and sale of natural gas and oil such as:  · well tending, routine maintenance and adjustment;  · reading meters, recording production, pumping, maintaining appropriate books and records; and  · preparation of reports for us and government agencies.  The well supervision fees, however, do not include costs and expenses related to the purchase of certain equipment, materials, and brine disposal. If these expenses are incurred, we pay cost for third-party services, materials, and a competitive charge for services performed directly by our MGP or its affiliates. Also, beginning one year after each of our wells has been placed into production, our MGP, as operator, may retain $200 per month, per well to cover the estimated future plugging and abandonment costs of the well. As of June 30, 2014, our MGP withheld $11,000 of net production revenue for this purpose.  Markets and Competition  The availability of a ready market for natural gas and oil produced by us, and the price obtained, depends on numerous factors beyond our control, including the extent of domestic production, imports of foreign natural gas and oil, political instability or terrorist acts in oil and gas producing countries and regions, market demand, competition from other energy sources, the effect of federal regulation on the sale of natural gas and oil in interstate commerce, other governmental regulation of the production and transportation of natural gas and oil and the proximity, availability and capacity of pipelines and other required facilities. Our MGP is responsible for selling our production. During 2014 and 2013, we experienced no problems in selling our natural gas and oil. Product availability and price are the principal means of competition in selling natural gas and oil production. While it is impossible to accurately determine our comparative position in the industry, we do not consider our operations to be a significant factor in the industry.  Results of Operations The following table sets forth information relating to our production revenues, volumes, sales prices, production costs and depletion during the periods indicated: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, June 30, 2014 2013 2014 2013 Production revenues (in thousands): Gas $ 312 $ 274 $ 552 $ 471 Oil 28 50 48 92 Liquids 1 - 2 - Total $ 341 $ 324 $ 602 $ 563 Production volumes: Gas (mcf/day) (1) 735 714 630 671 Oil (bbl/day) (1) 3 6 3 6 Liquids (bbl/day) (1) - - - - Total (mcfe/day) (1) 753 750 648 707 Average sales prices: (2) Gas (per mcf) (1) (3) $ 4.71 $ 4.67 $ 4.91 $ 4.05 Oil (per bbl) (1) $ 96.54 $ 90.91 $ 94.78 $ 91.89 Liquids (per bbl) (1) $ 56.65 $ 62.28 $ 54.90 $ 60.39 Production costs: As a percent of revenues 57 % 60 % 60 % 67 % Per mcfe (1) $ 2.84 $ 2.84 $ 3.07 $ 2.98 Depletion per mcfe $ 0.17 $ 2.70 $ 0.18 $ 2.71  (1) "Mcf" represents thousand cubic feet, "mcfe" represents thousand cubic feet equivalent and "bbl" represents barrels. Bbl is converted to mcfe using the ratio of six mcfs to one bbl.  (2) Average sales prices represent accrual basis pricing after adjusting for the effect of previously recognized gains resulting from prior period impairment charges.  (3) Average gas prices are calculated by including in total revenue derivative gains previously recognized into income in connection with prior period impairment charges and dividing by the total volume for the period. Previously recognized derivative gains were $3,500 and $29,600 for the three months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Previously recognized derivative gains were $7,600 and $20,700 for the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively.  Natural Gas Revenues. Our natural gas revenues were $311,600 and $273,700 for the three months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, an increase of $37,900 (14%). The $37,900 increase in natural gas revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2014 as compared to the prior year similar period was attributable to a $29,700 increase in our natural gas sales prices after the effect of financial hedges, which was driven by market conditions, and an $8,200 increase in production volumes. Our production volumes increased to 735 mcf per day for the three months ended June 30, 2014 from 714 mcf per day for the three months ended June 30, 2013, an increase of 21 mcf per day (3%).  Our natural gas revenues were $552,100 and $471,200 for the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, an increase of $80,900 (17%). The $80,900 increase in natural gas revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2014 as compared to the prior year similar period was attributable to a $109,700 increase in our natural gas sales prices after the effect of financial hedges, which was driven by market conditions, partially offset by a $28,800 decrease in production volumes. Our production volumes decreased to 630 mcf per day for the six months ended June 30, 2014 from 671 mcf per day for the six months ended June 30, 2013, a decrease of 41 mcf per day (6%). The overall decrease in natural gas production volumes for the six months ended June 30, 2014 as compared to the prior year similar period resulted primarily from the normal decline inherent in the life of a well.  Oil Revenues. We drill wells primarily to produce natural gas, rather than oil, but some wells have limited oil production. Our oil revenues were $27,800 and $50,300 for the three months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, a decrease of $22,500 (45%). The $22,500 decrease in oil revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2014 as compared to the prior year similar period was attributable to a $24,100 decrease in production volumes, partially offset by a $1,600 increase in oil prices after the effect of financial hedges. Our production volumes decreased to 3.17 bbls per day for the three months ended June 30, 2014 from 6.08 bbls per day for the three months ended June 30, 2013, a decrease of 2.91 bbls per day (48%).  Our oil revenues were $47,700 and $91,800 for the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, a decrease of $44,100 (48%). The $44,100 decrease in oil revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2014 as compared to the prior year similar period was attributable to a $45,600 decrease in production volumes, partially offset by a $1,500 increase in oil prices after the effect of financial hedges. Our production volumes decreased to 2.78 bbls per day for the six months ended June 30, 2014 from 5.52 bbls per day for the six months ended June 30, 2013, a decrease of 2.74 bbls per day (50%).  Natural Gas Liquids Revenue. The majority of our wells produce "dry gas", which is composed primarily of methane and requires no additional processing before being transported and sold to the purchaser. Some wells, however, produce "wet gas", which contains larger amounts of ethane and other associated hydrocarbons (i.e. "natural gas liquids") that must be removed prior to transporting the gas. Once removed, these natural gas liquids are sold to various purchasers. Our natural gas liquids revenues were $1,600 and $300 for the three months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Our natural gas liquids revenues were $2,600 and $400 for the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively.  Costs and Expenses. Production expenses were $195,300 and $194,200 for the three months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, an increase of $1,100 (1%). Production expenses were $360,500 and $379,200 for the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, a decrease of $18,700 (5%). The increase for the three months ended June 30, 2014 was partially due to an increase in repairs and maintenance. The decrease for the six months ended June 30, 2014 was mostly due to a decrease in supervision fees and water hauling expenses. Supervision fees decreased for the six months ended June 30, 2014 due to the decline in the number of productive wells.  Depletion of oil and gas properties as a percentage of oil and gas revenues was 3% and 57% for the three months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and 3% and 61% for the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. These percentage changes are directly attributable to changes in revenues, oil and gas reserve quantities, product prices and production volumes and changes in the depletable cost basis of oil and gas properties.  General and administrative expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013 were $32,100 and $37,700, respectively, a decrease of $5,600 (15%). For the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, these expenses were $70,300 and $83,000, respectively, a decrease of $12,700 (15%). These expenses include third-party costs for services as well as the monthly administrative fees charged by our MGP. The decreases for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 are primarily due to third-party costs as compared to the prior year similar period.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Cash provided by operating activities decreased $22,800 in the six months ended June 30, 2014 to $95,300 as compared to $118,100 for the six months ended June 30, 2013. This decrease was mostly due to a decrease in the change in accounts receivable trade-affiliate of $43,200, a decrease in the change in a net non-cash loss on hedge instruments of $33,400, and a decrease in the change in asset retirement receivable of $11,000. In addition, there was a decrease in the change in accrued liabilities of $5,300 and asset liabilities settled of $300. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in net income before depletion and accretion of $70,400 for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2013.  Cash used in financing activities increased $1,800 during the six months ended June 30, 2014 to $112,900 from $111,100 for the six months ended June 30, 2013. This increase was due to an increase in cash distributions to partners.  Any additional funds, if required, will be obtained from production revenues or borrowings from our MGP or its affiliates, which are not contractually committed to make loans to us. The amount that we may borrow may not at any time exceed 5% of our total subscriptions and we will not borrow from third-parties.  The Partnership is generally limited to the amount of funds generated by the cash flows from our operations, which we believe is adequate to fund future operations and distributions to our partners. Historically, there has been no need to borrow funds from our MGP to fund operations.  Critical Accounting Policies  The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to our asset retirement obligations, depletion and certain accrued receivables and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A discussion of significant accounting policies we have adopted and followed in the preparation of our financial statements is included within "Notes to Financial Statements" in Part I, Item 1, "Financial Statements" in this quarterly report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013.

	NOTES
	TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS






	March
	31, 2006






	(Unaudited)









	NOTE
	1 -




	NATURE
	OF OPERATIONS








	The
	financial statements of Atlas America Public #11-2002 Ltd. (“the Partnership”)
	as of March 31, 2006 and for the three months ended March 31, 2006 and 2005
	are
	unaudited. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included
	in
	financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
	accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted in
	this
	Form 10-QSB pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
	Commission. However, in the opinion of management, these interim financial
	statements include all the necessary adjustments to fairly present the results
	of the interim periods presented. The unaudited interim financial statements
	should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements included
	in
	the Partnership’s Form 10-KSB for the year ended December 31, 2005. The results
	of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2006 may not necessarily
	be
	indicative of the results of operations for the year ending December 31,
	2006.







	Atlas
	America, Inc. recently announced that it intends to transfer into a wholly-owned
	limited liability company or limited partnership subsidiary of Atlas America,
	Inc. substantially all of its natural gas and oil exploration and production
	assets. As part of that transaction, in March 2006, Atlas Resources, Inc.
	was
	merged into a newly-formed limited liability company, Atlas Resources, LLC,
	(“Atlas”) which Atlas America, Inc. anticipates will become an indirect
	subsidiary of Atlas America’s newly-formed subsidiary. Atlas Resources, LLC,
	however, will continue to serve as the Partnership’s managing general partner,
	and does not expect that any of these transactions will have a material effect
	on the Partnership’s financial position or results of operations. Atlas America,
	Inc. further intends to make a registered initial public offering of a minority
	interest, estimated to be 20%, in its newly-formed subsidiary.








	NOTE
	2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES








	In
	addition to matters discussed further in this note, the Partnership’s
	significant accounting policies are detailed in its audited financial statements
	and notes thereto in the Partnership’s annual report on Form 10-KSB for the year
	ended December 31, 2005 filed with the Securities and Exchange
	Commission.








	Receivables








	In
	evaluating the need for an allowance for possible losses, Atlas as our managing
	general partner, performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and
	adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer’s current
	creditworthiness, as determined by Atlas’ review of its customers’ credit
	information. Atlas extends credit on an unsecured basis to many of its energy
	customers. At March 31, 2006 Atlas’ credit evaluation indicated that the
	Partnership had no need for an allowance for possible losses.








	Revenue
	Recognition








	Because
	there are timing differences between the delivery of the Partnership’s natural
	gas and oil and the Partnership’s receipt of a delivery statement, the
	Partnership has  unbilled revenues. These revenues are accrued based upon
	volumetric data from the Partnership’s records and estimates of the related
	transportation and compression fees which are, in turn, based upon applicable
	product prices. The Partnership had unbilled trade receivables of $1,177,900
	at
	March 31, 2006 and $1,342,500 at December 31, 2005, respectively, which are
	included in “Accounts receivable-affiliate” line item on its' Balance
	Sheets.

	NOTE
	2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES




	(CONTINUED)









	Recently
	Issued Financial Accounting Standards








	In
	May
	2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, (“FASB”) issued Statement No.
	154,



	Accounting
	Changes and Error Corrections



	(“SFAS
	154”). SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods’ financial
	statements of changes in accounting principle. It also requires that the
	new
	accounting principle be applied to the balances of assets and liabilities
	as of
	the beginning of the earliest period for which retrospective application
	is
	practicable and that a corresponding adjustment be made to the opening balance
	of retained earnings for that period rather than being reported in an income
	statement. The statement became effective for accounting changes and correction
	of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. SFAS 154
	did
	not have a material impact on the Partnership’s financial position or results of
	operations.








	Fair
	Value of Financial Instruments








	For
	cash,
	receivables and payables, the carrying amounts approximate fair value because
	of
	the short maturity of these instruments.







	For
	derivatives the carrying value approximates fair value because they have
	been
	marked to market.










	Asset
	Retirement Obligation








	The
	Partnership accounts for the estimated plugging and abandonment costs of
	the oil
	and gas properties in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
	Standards No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.”







	A
	reconciliation of the Partnership’s liability for plugging and abandonment costs
	for the three months ending March 31, 2006 and 2005 is as follows:

	Supplemental
	Cash Flow Information








	The
	Partnership considers temporary investments with a maturity at the date of
	acquisition of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. No cash was paid by
	the
	Partnership for interest or income taxes for the three months ended March
	31,
	2006 and 2005.

	NOTE
	2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)









	Concentration
	of Credit Risk








	Financial
	instruments, which potentially subject the Partnership to concentrations
	of
	credit risk, consist principally of periodic temporary investments of cash
	and
	cash equivalents. The Partnership places its temporary cash investments in
	deposits with high-quality financial institutions. At March 31, 2006, the
	Partnership had $1,300,500 in deposits at one bank of which $1,200,500 was
	over
	the insurance limit of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and at December
	31, 2005 the Partnership had $1,155,400 in deposits at one bank of which
	$1,055,400 was over the insurance limit of the Federal Deposit Insurance
	Corporation. No losses have been experienced on such investments.








	Comprehensive
	Income








	The
	Partnership is subject to the provisions of SFAS No. 130, “Reporting
	Comprehensive Income,” which requires disclosure of comprehensive income and its
	components. Comprehensive income includes net income and all other changes
	in
	equity of a business during a period from non-owner sources. These changes,
	other than net income, are referred to as “other comprehensive
	income”.










	Property
	and Equipment








	Property
	and equipment are stated at cost. Depletion is based on cost less estimated
	salvage value primarily using the unit-of-production method over the assets’
	estimated useful lives. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.
	Major
	renewals and improvements that extend the useful lives of property are
	capitalized.

	NOTE

	Oil
	and Gas Properties








	The
	Partnership uses the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and
	gas
	producing activities. Costs to acquire mineral interests in oil and gas
	properties and to drill and equip wells are capitalized. Oil is converted
	to gas
	equivalent basis (“mcfe”) at the rate of one barrel equals 6 mcf. Depletion is
	provided on the units of production method.







	The
	Partnership’s long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment annually for events
	or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount of an
	asset
	may not be recoverable. Long-lived assets are reviewed for potential impairments
	at the lowest levels for which there are identifiable cash flows that are
	largely independent of other groups of assets. The review is done by determining
	if the historical cost of proved properties less the applicable accumulated
	depreciation, depletion and amortization and abandonment is less than the
	estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows. The expected future cash
	flows are estimated based on the Partnership’s plans to continue to produce and
	develop proved reserves. Expected future cash flow from the sale of production
	of reserves is calculated based on estimated future prices. The Partnership
	estimates prices based upon market related information including published
	futures prices. The estimated future level of production is based on assumptions
	surrounding future levels of prices and costs, field decline rates, market
	demand and supply, and the economic and regulatory climates. If the carrying
	value exceeds such cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the
	difference between the estimated fair market value (as determined by discounted
	future cash flows), and the carrying value of the assets.  The Partnerhip's
	oil and gas properties had no indication of impairment as of March 31,
	2006.







	Upon
	the
	sale or retirement of a complete or partial unit of a proved property, the
	cost
	is eliminated from the property accounts, and the resultant gain or loss
	is
	reclassified to accumulated depletion. Upon the sale of an entire interest
	in an
	unproved property where the property had been assessed for impairment
	individually, a gain or loss is recognized in the statements of operations.
	If a
	partial interest in an unproved property is sold, any funds received are
	accounted for as a reduction of the cost in the interest retained.

	up to
	50% of its share of production revenues of the Partnership, net of related
	operating costs, administrative costs and well supervision fees to the receipt
	by the limited partners of cash distributions from the Partnership equal
	to at
	least 10% of their agreed subscriptions, determined on a cumulative basis,
	in
	each of the first five years of Partnership operations, commencing with the
	first distribution of revenues to the limited partners.  Since inception of
	the program, the Partnership has not been required to subordinate any of
	it's
	revenues to the limited partners.



	 




	NOTE
	4 - DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS








	Atlas
	America, Inc. on behalf of the Partnership from time to time enters into
	natural
	gas futures and option contracts to hedge exposure to changes in natural
	gas
	prices. At any point in time, such contracts may include regulated New York
	Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”) futures and options contracts and non-regulated
	over-the-counter futures contracts with qualified counterparties. NYMEX
	contracts are generally settled with offsetting positions, but may be settled
	by
	the delivery of natural gas.

	NOTES

	March

	(Unaudited)









	NOTE




	4
	- DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)








	Atlas
	America, Inc. formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments
	and the items being hedged, including Atlas America, Inc.’s risk management
	objective and strategy for undertaking the hedging transactions. This includes
	matching the natural gas futures and options contracts to the forecasted
	transactions. Atlas America, Inc. assesses, both at the inception of the
	hedge
	and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives are highly effective in
	offsetting changes in the fair value of hedged items. Historically these
	contracts have qualified and been designated as cash flow hedges and recorded
	at
	their fair values. Gains or losses on future contracts are determined as
	the
	difference between the contract price and a reference price, generally prices
	on
	NYMEX. Changes in fair value are recognized in Partners’ Capital as Accumulated
	Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) and recognized within the statement of
	operations in the month the hedged gas is sold. If it is determined that
	a
	derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or it has ceased to be a highly
	effective hedge, due to the loss of correlation between changes in gas reference
	prices under a hedging instrument and actual gas prices, Atlas America, Inc.,
	will discontinue hedge accounting for the derivative and subsequent changes
	in
	fair value for the derivative will be recognized immediately into
	earnings.







	At
	March
	31, 2006, Atlas America, Inc. had 108 open natural gas futures contracts
	on
	behalf of the Partnership related to natural gas sales covering 1,186,100
	dekatherms (“Dth”) (net to the Partnership) of natural gas, maturing through
	December 31, 2009 at a combined average settlement price of $8.94 per Dth.
	At
	March 31, 2006, the Partnership reflected net hedging liabilities on its
	balance
	sheet of $72,100. Of the $72,100 net loss in accumulated other comprehensive
	income (loss) at March 31, 2006, if the fair values of the instruments remain
	at
	current market values, the Partnership will reclassify $284,300 of net gains
	to
	its statement of operations over the next twelve month period as these contracts
	expire, and $356,400 of net losses will be reclassified in later periods.
	Actual
	amounts that will be reclassified will vary as a result of future price changes.
	Ineffective hedge gains or losses are recorded within the statement of
	operations while the hedge contract is open and may increase or decrease
	until
	settlement of the contract. The Partnership realized gains of $109,800 for
	the
	period ended March 31, 2006 within its statement of operations related to
	the
	settlement of qualifying hedge instruments.







	As
	of
	March 31, 2006, Atlas America, Inc. on behalf of the Partnership, had the
	following natural gas volumes hedged:

ATLAS AMERICA PUBLIC #11-2002 LTD. - S-1 - 20020621 - NOTES_TO_FINANCIAL_STATEMENT





NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENT



June 11, 2002


1.       ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS


Atlas America Public #11-2002, Ltd. (the "Partnership") is a Delaware
Limited Partnership in which Atlas Resources, Inc. ("Atlas") of
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (a second-tier wholly-owned subsidiary of
Atlas America, Inc., which is a second-tier wholly-owned subsidiary of
Resource America, Inc., a publicly traded company) will be Managing
General Partner and Operator, and subscribers to Units will be either
Limited Partners or Investor General Partners depending upon their
election.


The Partnership will be funded to drill development wells which are
proposed to be located primarily in the Clinton/Medina geological
formation in Western Pennsylvania and Southern Ohio, the
Mississippian/Upper Devonian Sandstone reservoir in Fayette County,
Pennsylvania, and the Upper Devonian Sandstone Reservoirs in Armstrong
County, Pennsylvania. The Managing General Partner has reserved the
right to drill wells in other areas of the Appalachian Basin.


Subscriptions at a cost of $10,000 per unit will be sold through
wholesalers and broker-dealers including Anthem Securities, Inc., an
affiliated company, which will receive, on each unit sold to an
investor, a 2.5% dealer-manager fee, a 7% sales commission, a .5%
nonaccountable marketing expense reimbursement, and a .5%
nonaccountable due diligence fee. Commencement of Partnership
operations is subject to the receipt of minimum Partnership
subscriptions of $1,000,000 (to a maximum of $40,000,000) by December
31, 2002.


2.       SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES



Basis of Accounting



The Partnership will prepare its financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles.


The Partnership will use the successful efforts method of accounting
for oil and gas producing activities. Costs to acquire mineral
interests in oil and gas properties and to drill and equip wells will
be capitalized. Depreciation and depletion will be computed on a
field-by-field basis by the unit-of-production method based on periodic
estimates of oil and gas reserves.


Undeveloped leaseholds and proved properties will be assessed
periodically or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. Proved
properties will be assessed based on estimates of future cash flows.


The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial
statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.

(A Delaware Limited Partnership)



NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENT - CONTINUED


June 11, 2002


3.       FEDERAL INCOME TAXES


The Partnership will not be treated as a taxable entity for federal
income tax purposes. Any item of income, gain, loss, deduction or
credit would flow through to the partners as though each partner has
incurred such item directly. As a result, each partner must take into
account his pro rata share of all items of partnership income and
deductions in computing his federal income tax liability.




4.       PARTICIPATION IN REVENUES AND COSTS


Atlas and the other partners will participate in revenues and costs in
the following manner:







                                                                                        Other
                                                                     Atlas             Partners
                                                               -------------------------------------
Partnership costs:
    Organization and offering costs                                   100%                   0%

(1)    These costs will be charged to the partners in the same ratio as
the related production revenues are credited.


(2)    These percentages may vary. If the total equipment costs for all
of the partnership's wells that would be charged to the other
partners exceeds an amount equal to 10% of the subscription
proceeds of the other partners in the partnership, then the
excess will be charged to the Managing General Partner.


(3)    Interest earned on subscription proceeds before the offering
closes will be credited to the investor's capital account. After
the offering closes and until proceeds from the offering are
invested in the partnership's operations any interest income
from temporary investments will be allocated pro rata to the
investors providing the subscription proceeds. All other
interest income, including interest earned on the deposit of
operating revenues, will be credited as production revenues are
credited.


(4)    The Managing General Partner and the investors will share in all
of the partnership's other revenues in the same percentage as
their respective capital contributions bears to the

partnership capital contributions except that the Managing
General Partner will receive an additional 7.0% of the
partnership revenues. However, the Managing General Partner's
total revenue share may not exceed 35% of partnership revenues.


(5)    The actual allocation of partnership revenues between the
Managing General Partner and the investors will vary from the
allocation described in (4) above if a portion of the Managing
General Partner's partnership net production revenues is
subordinated.


(6)    The sharing of the percentage depletion allowance will be in the
same percentages as the sharing of the production revenues.


5.       TRANSACTIONS WITH ATLAS AND ITS AFFILIATES


The Partnership intends to enter into the following significant
transactions with Atlas and its affiliates as provided under the
Partnership agreement:


The partnership will enter into a drilling and operating
agreement with Atlas to drill and complete all of the
Partnership wells at cost plus 15%.


Atlas will receive an unaccountable, fixed payment
reimbursement for their administrative costs at $75 per well
per month, which will be proportionately reduced if the
partnership's working interest in a well is less than 100%.


Atlas will receive well supervision fees for operating and
maintaining the wells during producing operations at a
competitive rate (currently the competitive rate is $275 per
well per month). The well supervision fees will be
proportionately reduced if the partnership's working interest
in a well is less than 100%.


An Atlas affiliate will charge the partnership a fee for
gathering and transportation at a competitive rate (currently
in the range of $.29 to $.35 per MCF).


As the Managing General Partner, Atlas will perform all administrative
and management functions for the partnership including billing revenues
and paying expenses. Atlas will be reimbursed for all direct costs
expended on behalf of the partnership.


6.       PURCHASE COMMITMENT


Subject to certain conditions, investor partners may present their
interests beginning in 2007 for purchase by Atlas. Atlas is not
obligated to purchase more than 5% of the units in any calendar year.
In the event that Atlas is unable to obtain the necessary funds, Atlas
may suspend its repurchase obligation.


7.       SUBORDINATION OF MANAGING GENERAL PARTNER'S
REVENUE SHARE


Atlas will subordinate up to 50% of its share of production revenues of
the Partnership, net of related operating costs, administrative costs
and well supervision fees to the receipt by participants of cash
distributions from the Partnership equal to at least 10% of their
agreed subscriptions, determined on a cumulative basis, in each of the
first five 12-month periods beginning with Partnership's first cash
distributions from operations.


8.       INDEMNIFICATION


In order to limit the potential liability of the investor general
partners, Atlas has agreed to indemnify each investor general partner
from any liability incurred which exceeds such partner's share of
Partnership assets.
