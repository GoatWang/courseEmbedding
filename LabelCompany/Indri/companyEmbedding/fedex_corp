Importer Security Filing
Importer Security Filing and Additional Carrier Requirements (commonly referred to as ISF or "10+2") is now a critical regulatory prerequisite for your vessel imports. The rule mandates that ISF importers or their authorized agents supply CBP with 10 additional data elements and that ocean carriers supply an additional 2 data sets for ocean cargo other than foreign cargo remaining on board (FROB), immediate exportation (IE), transportation and exportation (T&E) or foreign trade zone (FTZ). This information must be submitted 24 hours prior to vessel loading in the foreign port and must be filed by the Automated Broker Interface (ABI) or AMS (Automated Manifest System). Established importers can use our web-based system to self file.

Importer Security Filing
Importer Security Filing and Additional Carrier Requirements (commonly referred to as ISF or "10+2") is now a critical regulatory prerequisite for your vessel imports. The rule mandates that ISF importers or their authorized agents supply CBP with 10 additional data elements and that ocean carriers supply an additional 2 data sets for ocean cargo other than foreign cargo remaining on board (FROB), immediate exportation (IE), transportation and exportation (T&E) or foreign trade zone (FTZ). This information must be submitted 24 hours prior to vessel loading in the foreign port and must be filed by the Automated Broker Interface (ABI) or AMS (Automated Manifest System). Established importers can use our web-based system to self file.

Rates shown here may be different than the actual charges for your shipment. Differences may occur based on actual weight, dimensions, currency conversion rate and other factors. Consult the applicable FedEx Service Guide for details.
	While weighing your package is not required for FedEx One Rate pricing, to qualify, FedEx Envelopes must weigh 10 lbs. or less and FedEx Paks and Boxes must weigh 50 lbs. or less.  If your package exceeds these weight limits, it will be rated based on FedEx Standard List Rates or FedEx Retail Rates as applicable. Please refer to the specific packaging for recommended weight limits.  Please refer to the FedEx Service Guide at fedex.com for more information about FedEx One Rate.
	FedEx Multiweight pricing is available for multiple-piece shipments to one destination on the same day totaling 100 lbs or more for Express and 200 lbs or more for Ground Ground Multiweight pricing available via a contract only.
	You can obtain rates for FedEx Ground shipments to destinations within the US and Canada.  If you are in a FedEx discount program, contact your FedEx account executive for an exact rate quote.

	FedEx does not deliver to Post Office Box addresses in the U.S. Please enter a Zip Code to find the transit time for your shipment or click on Find Zip/Postal code.
	Packages picked up from a residence may have one additional transit day. For faster returns please drop off at a staffed FedEx location

Shipping FAQs

Does FedEx offer weekend delivery?

FedEx Express® offers Saturday delivery options to most metropolitan postal codes. Select the Saturday delivery option and then select FedEx Priority Overnight® service if you will ship the package on Friday or FedEx 2Day® if you will ship the package on Thursday. The shipper must select the Saturday Delivery special handling option at the time of shipment.
FedEx Home Delivery® offers standard Saturday delivery to residential addresses and may deliver on Saturdays depending on the transit time from origin to destination.
A Saturday delivery surcharge will apply to FedEx Express® shipments.
FedEx Freight® does not offer regular weekend delivery, but if a weekend delivery is needed, contact customer service at 1.866.393.4585 for available options. Using one of our online tools is the best way to determine transit times for your shipments. Follow one of our links to find the service that best fits your needs.

FedEx SameDay® and FedEx® International Next Flight provide same-day service in the shortest time possible. Call 1.800.GoFedEx 1.800.463.3339 for availability and rate.
If the Saturday Delivery special handling option is not selected, a shipment sent overnight on Friday will be delivered the next business day: Monday. If the Saturday Delivery special handling option is not selected, a shipment sent via FedEx 2Day on Thursday will be delivered the second business day: Monday.
Guide to Services



What are my choices for overnight delivery?

Recognizing your deadlines can vary day to day, FedEx provides three overnight delivery options: FedEx First Overnight® by 8, 8:30, 9 or 10 a.m. the next business day; FedEx Priority Overnight® by 10:30 a.m. the next business day; and FedEx Standard Overnight® by 3 p.m. to most areas and by 4:30 p.m. to some rural areas (by 8 p.m. to residences) the next business day. The latter is a cost-effective choice if you can wait for afternoon delivery.
In some cases, FedEx Ground®, FedEx Home Delivery® and FedEx Freight® may provide overnight service depending on locations and distances involved. For specific delivery commitments based on your shipment's origin and destination, please see our Get Rates & Transit Times application.



How do I determine the address my package was delivered to?

If you have the package tracking number, you can access delivery city information and signature information if a signature was obtained.
If you need the detailed delivery information (includes address), you can obtain a Signature Proof of Delivery online by using your tracking number and the shipper's or payer’s account number.



Is it possible to change the service type or delivery speed of a package once I have already sent it?

Generally, it is not possible to change the service commitment of the shipment once it has been shipped.



How I cancel a shipment I created online?

Shipments can be cancelled in FedEx Ship Manager® at fedex.com’s Ship History. Log into FedEx Ship Manager® at fedex.com and click on the Ship History tab. Select the shipment and click on the Cancel button.



I lost the label I printed. Can I reprint it?

FedEx Ship Manager® at fedex.com allows you to reprint shipping labels and/or international documentation. FedEx labels and documents may be reprinted up to 12 hours after they are processed, or until midnight local time (whichever comes first). Click on the Ship History tab, select the shipment, and click on the Reprint button.



Can I get a copy of the delivery signature?

You can get a copy of the recipient's signature on your FedEx Express® or FedEx Ground® shipment by using our Signature Proof of Delivery tool. Proof of delivery is offered for most packages shipped within the U.S., to Canada and to Puerto Rico. Shipment delivery signatures from other international locations are not available at this time.



How do I change the delivery address on my shipment?

If you are the shipper, you may contact FedEx Customer Service at 1.800.GoFedEx 1.800.463.3339 to change the delivery address. Please see the FedEx Service Guide for more information concerning this service and applicable fees.
If you are the intended recipient of the package and you wish to provide additional information about the delivery address (example, add a suite or apartment number), you may contact FedEx Customer Service at 1.800.GoFedEx 1.800.463.3339. If you are the intended recipient and want the shipment delivered to a new address, contact the package's shipper and request the change of address.
You may request your package be held for pickup at your nearby FedEx Office location. For FedEx Express® packages, you may also request the package be held at the delivery station.

I've shipped a package, when will FedEx deliver?

Track the status of your package on fedex.com using your tracking number and look for the Estimated Delivery Date. We are unable to specify an exact delivery time. Typically deliveries occur during normal business hours and depend on service selected.
If you do not have your tracking number, contact the shipper to obtain the tracking number. Customer service may be able to find your shipment information if you are unable to get your tracking number from the shipper. Contact us at 1.800.GoFedEx 1.800.463.3339.

Freight Delivery Maps



What is the difference between FedEx Express® and FedEx Ground®?

FedEx Express® lets you choose from several different services so you can pick the delivery time that fits your degree of urgency. It's for shippers with high-value or time-critical shipments who need to plan on fast delivery on a specific day, by a specific time. FedEx Ground® service is a ground service for shipments that don't need the speed of express shipping. You receive reliable delivery for packages up to 150 lbs., with the precise date of delivery based on distance from origin to destination.



How do I ship collect or C.O.D.?

For specific C.O.D. information, go to our Guide to Services and select the Collect on Delivery (C.O.D.) Service option.



How do I specify a time window for delivery?

FedEx has a variety of shipping options:

For FedEx Express® shipments, we offer several services that provide delivery by a certain time. Select the service that delivers by your specified time. 
For FedEx Ground® shipments, we deliver by the end of business day on the scheduled delivery day. 
For FedEx Home Delivery® shipments, we deliver between 9 a.m. and 8 p.m., Monday through Saturday. If your recipient wishes to schedule a specific time frame for delivery, you can select one of our convenient delivery options: FedEx Evening Home Delivery® or FedEx Appointment Home Delivery®. 
FedEx Freight offers a range of time-definite options — for both FedEx Freight® Priority and FedEx Freight® Economy shipments. No matter which service you choose, you can ship with confidence, knowing your freight shipment will get the special attention and handling it deserves. 

Please see our Get Rates & Transit Times application to explore our delivery options.



What are your delivery hours?

Delivery days and times vary by service type:

FedEx Express®: Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. (and Saturday 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. with Saturday Delivery special handling option) 
FedEx Ground®: Monday through Friday by end of day. 
FedEx Home Delivery®: Tuesday through Saturday by end of day. 

Please note, specific delivery times may vary by location, especially for rural areas.



Are FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight shipments backed by a money-back guarantee?

Yes! You can request a refund or credit of your transportation charges for FedEx Express and FedEx Ground shipments, if your shipments within the U.S. do not arrive by the end of the scheduled delivery day, as published on this website. For more information, please visit the money-back guarantee section of the Terms and Conditions.
FedEx Freight money-back guarantee details

I don't understand the route my shipment is taking. The city where my shipment is being scanned doesn't appear to be on the correct route. Should I be concerned?

Shipments may move through regional sorting locations before arriving at the delivery destination. Often times this may not appear to be the most direct route from the pickup location to the delivery destination.

FedEx Locations



I wasn't home when FedEx tried to deliver my package, now what can I do?

For packages not requiring a signature for release, our drivers will leave the package at a recipient's door, or other secure location, if the driver believes it is reasonable to do so.
In most cases, FedEx will attempt to deliver your package three times before returning to the shipper.
When the driver is unable to leave your package, they will leave a door tag on your door, informing you of the delivery attempt. The door tag contains information that may offer you the option to sign the door tag and have the driver leave your package in a secure location on the next delivery attempt, typically the next business day.
If signing the door tag is not possible because the shipper has requested an in-person, direct signature, you may request your package be held for pickup at your nearby FedEx Office location. For FedEx Express® packages, you may also request the package be held at the delivery station.



I won't be able to sign for my package, what can I do?

For packages not requiring a signature for release, our drivers will leave the package at a recipient's door, or other secure location, if the driver believes it is reasonable to do so. If your package was shipped with the Indirect Signature Release option, you may leave a signed and dated handwritten note on the door instructing the driver to leave the package at your door.
When the driver is unable to leave your package, they will leave a door tag on your door, informing you of the delivery attempt. The door tag contains information that may offer you the option to sign the door tag and have the driver leave your package in a secure location on the next delivery attempt, typically the next business day.
If signing the door dag is not possible because the shipper has requested an in-person, direct signature, you may request your package be held for pickup at your nearby FedEx Office location. For FedEx Express® packages, you may also request the package be held at the delivery station. Click here for FedEx Locations.



How do I determine the address my package was delivered to?

If you have the package tracking number, you can access delivery city information and signature information if a signature was obtained. Track your package.
If you need the detailed delivery information (includes address), you can obtain a Signature Proof of Delivery online by using your tracking number and the shipper's or payer’s account number.



Can I get a copy of the delivery signature?

You can get a copy of the recipient's signature on your FedEx Express® or FedEx Ground® shipment by using our Signature Proof of Delivery tool.

My package was supposed to be here, but it has not arrived. What can I do?

A good first step is to track the status of your package using your FedEx tracking number. The tracking number enables us to provide you with your package's most up-to-date tracking information. If the tracking results do not answer your question, your next step can be to contact FedEx for further assistance.
If you do not have your tracking number, contact the shipper to obtain the tracking number. FedEx Customer Service may be able to find your shipment information if you are unable to get your tracking number from the shipper. Contact us at 1.800.GoFedEx 1.800.463.3339.
Information about your package 
The tracking detail page provides detailed information about your shipment, including your shipment's current status and estimated delivery date. Delivery days and times vary by service type:

FedEx Express®: Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. (and Saturday with Saturday Delivery special handling option) 
FedEx Ground®: Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. 
FedEx Home Delivery®: Tuesday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturday, 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. 

If the tracking page indicates you shipment is on time, use the estimated delivery date as a guide to when your shipment will arrive.



I tracked my shipment, and there haven't been scans on it in more than a day. What should I do?

Packages in the FedEx system receive scans at various points between pickup and delivery. It is not unusual for a package to go more than 24 hours without a scan while in transit – your package may be traveling as intended.



I tracked my shipment, and it appears there is a customs or clearance delay. What should I do?

Customs and clearance delays occur for a variety of reasons. If additional information is required from the shipper or recipient, FedEx will attempt to contact them.



I tracked my shipment, and there are no scans. What should I do?

If there are no scans for the tracking number entered, contact your shipper to verify the tracking number is correct. If you are the shipper, and it has been more than 24 hours since you dropped off the shipment or had the shipment picked up, please contact us at 1.800.GoFedEx 1.800.463.3339.



What are your delivery hours?

Delivery days and times vary by service type:

FedEx Express®: Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. (and Saturday with Saturday Delivery special handling option) 
FedEx Ground®: Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. 
FedEx Home Delivery®: Tuesday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturday, 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. 

Please note, specific delivery times may vary by location, especially for rural areas.



I don't understand the route my shipment is taking. The city where my shipment is being scanned doesn't appear to be on the correct route. Should I be concerned?

Shipments may move through regional sorting locations before arriving at the delivery destination. Often times this may not appear to be the most direct route from the pickup location to the delivery destination.



When I first tracked the package, it had an estimated delivery date, and now there isn't one. What does this mean?

We are able to provide the estimated delivery date information for many of our shipments. When the shipment encounters a delay or an exception in handling, we may not be able to accurately state when we expect the package to be delivered.



What does the "status of exception code" mean?

This is information noting that there was an exception to the traditional in-person courier delivery. For example, perhaps no one was at the destination address so the package was left with a neighbor or front desk, or it was not left and delivery will be reattempted, or it was left without a signature because we had prior approval from the sender or recipient to do so.

[Update] It appears FedEx has taken into account some feedback from yelp, and this time around it was a stellar experience. The staff helped me track down my packages, contacted the contractor, and had them delivered. Though the delivery happened two days late, the staff kept me updated on the status through out. It was a very professional and courteous exchange as well.

Come to think of it, I think the overall FedEx process is to blame than the staff - FedEx seems to have contractors handle the delivery, which introduces problems to start with. As a result, the staff at the Newark location have a tough time piecing things together if something goes wrong. In my case, the contracted driver was sick and he did check-out the packages but parked the truck in another FedEx location in San Jose, and never showed up for work.

Overall, I had a very positive experience this time around, so the five stars are for the staff of this location than FedEx.







If I could give no stars I would. Fed Ex is unprofessional, lame excuses for not delivering a package on time(do they know we can see the excuses online?), 
I hope my vendor chooses another delivery company as they are planning to do.







Terrible service FedEx ground - holding my package hostage, refusing to deliver on expected time, promising re-deliver on same day and not acting as promised. You are forcing a working mom to drag her baby to your center 20 miles out of the way, mid week, on working hours, through rush hour traffic to pick it up.I spent my entire Saturday at home waiting for this one, called you 4 times and that's the result. Here's a service I should not to use again!







As of this review, I have yet to receive my package, which is two days late. The reason for no delivery? DELIVERY EXCEPTION: LOCAL WEATHER DELAY. Are you kidding me? It's summer in NorCal. What sort of weather halts delivery this time of year in Newark?







Total incompetence. This station handles FedEx Ground shipments. FedEx Ground drivers  (different from FedEx Express) are 3rd party contractors. I would estimate 9 out of 10 FedEx Ground packages were late, misdelivered or not delivered at all. I've heard all kinds of excuses from every manager at that station- Martin Camex, Mike Pacheco, etc... they all gave me their cell numbers, which is a joke because they NEVER answer their cell. The senior manager is Roberto Ravelo. Left 5 messages for him to call me over the past 3 weeks and he's never returned my calls. Called FedEx corp. executive customer relations and  NUMEROUS times but that's whole another story (Cornishia, Beverly, Dee, etc.).  It's a total nightmare trying to get my packages from them. IF I do get a hold of one of the managers, they always blame the drivers (claiming they're new), apologize and tell me it will never happen again, give me their cell #... this has been going on for 18 years. I thought OnTrac was bad, FedEx ground is truly THE worst carrier I've ever encountered.







This Fedex location consistently fails to deliver packages.  With over four packages now they claim to put the package on their truck each day but then state no one was there to accept delivery, including in cases when I've been home all day or the packages themselves required no signature and could have been left on my doorstep.  The only conclusion I can reach from these experiences is that the drivers are in fact making no attempt to actually deliver packages. UPS, FedEx Air, USPS and even Ontrac have no trouble delivering to my location.  What gives?







This is the worst delivery experience ever.  Two days now the truck has marked that there has not been someone here to sign for the package which is not true, both days there has been someone here and the driver never showed. If I had a choice  I would never use FedEX again I hope they keep losing the contracts from retailers that I like.







The worst service ever so disappointed I lost so much money waiting for my really expensive item and can't work if I don't have it, they said they came but they don't look for my apt #







FedExodus shreds!  They are a great band and have been so since bonded by Blood.  Pioneers in the thrash metal scene and innovators in that community.  Bailoff had very unique vocals and attacked the mic.  Zetro also has very unique vocals and does a great job and writes some pretty vicious lyrics.  

Oh wait, this is for fed ex?  Well, they fkn suck!







I just got off the phone with FedEx and even though my package was marked as "On FedEx vehicle for delivery" at 3:03am this morning they are going to let it sit in that vehicle for TWO FULL DAYS before delivering it on Monday. This is absolutely unacceptable in this day and age where companies like Amazon deliver packages to your front door within a few hours for free. The competition is evolving and FedEx chooses to lag behind and stay in the past. I will not be using FedEx again.







First time saw the Door Tag on my door it said "Final Attempt", then no one tried to deliver it again the next day.  Been waiting for the package all day but no one showed up, yet, the tracking got updated to failed attempt.  Called FedEx 3+ times, and were told it'll be re-delivered "today".  When seeing no tracking updates on the web at 4pm, finally called again, and was told my package never went out and won't be delivered.  Not until someone sees the note that we called, and there's no ETA about when someone will see the note.  When I asked for the local facility #, the lady told me the facility is closed, at 4pm.  Then my husband found the # on Yelp and called, the facility is still open, and will be opened for couple more hours.  Very frustrating with all the stories being fed to me.  And, I still haven't received my package.







Worst FedEx location, ever.

They held my package at this location for almost a week!!!.....all they needed to do was ship it to the Union City location for pickup.  When I called to ask if I could just come to this location to pick it up, I was told that they couldn't locate my package so it was best to wait until they found it and delivered it to UC.

Very rude customer service.







What a mess! I was expecting an expensive delivery which costs about more than a grand coming to my house today. Then all of the sudden I got a notification saying no attempt was made then will try again the next day but didn't even show up at all or leave a tag! 

I am writing this to complain! If your packages are coming from this Newark location to your house, you're gonna have a bad time. 

PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND REQUEST YOUR PACKAGE TO BE HELD SOMEWHERE AND PICK IT UP.







This is the worst experience I have ever had with a delivery.  I paid for a specific delivery window for my package to be delivered yesterday.  I spent a lot of time on the phone with FedEx yesterday trying to understand why they didn't honor the service they provide for customized delivery. They were if not help at all.  Then I spent significant time on the phone today while FedEx customer service was speaking to the manager at the Newark shipping department and was told that my request for the customized delivery time would take 48 hours to process even though I requested it last week.  To be clear I was told that my package was still in Newark.  Exactly 15 minutes after my call the package was delivered to my house but I wasn't there to sign for it so it's back in Newark again.  Tweedle dee and tweedle dum are alive and well at Newark Fed Ex.  I have contacted the business where I made my purchase and I have let them know that I will NEVER purchase something online again if it is being sent with Fed Ex.  Let's all boycott FedEx.







I am expecting a delivery on a Thursday but my package has been sitting in this place for 2 days now. Just called customer service regarding my order and they say that they're not able to deliver it. They gave me an estimated delivery day for Monday. This is extremely inconvenient!  If only i could give a negative start.







I hate Fed Ex. They will not allow me to change the delivery time through Delivery Manager since I am not a business. The tech on the phone didn't tell me this until we talked on the phone for 30 minutes. Seems like an obvious reason if you work in tech support for Fed Ex. They deliver when I'm at work and I called them and they won't change the time or leave the package at my door. Consequently, I cannot take possession of my package. After the third delivery attempt they hold it at the Newark facility, a 30-40 min drive in traffic from my house. If you order anything, don't have it delivered by fed ex ground. They are absolutely terrible. I hate Fed Ex.







Do not trust Laurie from this location. I was sending my sister flowers for her birthday, but they never put the package on a truck the day it was supposed to be delivered. When I called, she said she would contact my sister and have a truck that evening deliver the flowers, or worst case scenario she would send it out first thing tomorrow morning. My sister was never called and the package was never attempted. Nothing was mailed the next morning because the FedEx location closed during the weekend (which she is obviously aware of). My sister has yet to receive her flowers, and when she does I am sure they will be dead.







I saw all the comments before I called the Newark FedEx station, I was very worried...But, when I called them and tell them to re-deliver it, they did really nice than I thought. Also, they called me back to report the final result, very professional. Thank you!







I have always had good experiences with FedEx in general.  The main station in Los Angeles was always very responsive and helpful.  The delivery people were reliable.  Now that I have moved to Northern California I assumed that the same would be true here.  Sadly it is not.  The delivery person who serves my neighborhood documents that he/she has attempted a delivery but there is no door tag and the video surveillance of my door does not show anyone coming to the door on the days in question (I was home as well).  After being on hold with customer service for an hour I was assured that another attempt would be made today.  I called again and was informed that the station claimed they were not aware of another delivery attempt and my only option was to drive there and pick up the items.  Looking at the other reviews it seems this is a chronic problem with this station.  I hope that the management will take a look at these reviews and make sure their drivers are held accountable.  Their customers are paying for delivery so at the very least the driver should attempt a delivery.  Unfortunately unlike other situations where the consumers can simply choose another provider we are stuck with this station.  Again it is my sincere hope that the management will take all the complaints regarding documentation of "delivery attempt" when no attempt was made into consideration and bring about some change.







HEY! FEDEX! Does anyone from your broke-dick company ever read these feedbacks? I think not!

These people can sometimes sound like disrespectful worthless scuzbags. Never trust FedEx at their word. I knew of express, ground, but did you know 'home delivery' is a separate, third party contracted group who don't work on Mondays?

 The dispatch says they do not have a way to contract drivers, which sounds like a blatant lie. In MY little town, the dispatch can contact their drivers either via 'hitting' the drivers 'board' or via cellular contact. All of their drivers anytime!
NEVER again will I use FedEx for anything other than delivering squirrel crappola or used diapers!

Updated review



[Update] It appears FedEx has taken into account some feedback from yelp, and this time around it was a stellar experience. The staff helped me track down my packages, contacted the contractor, and had them delivered. Though the delivery happened two days late, the staff kept me updated on the status through out. It was a very professional and courteous exchange as well.Come to think of it, I think the overall FedEx process is to blame than the staff - FedEx seems to have contractors handle the delivery, which introduces problems to start with. As a result, the staff at the Newark location have a tough time piecing things together if something goes wrong. In my case, the contracted driver was sick and he did check-out the packages but parked the truck in another FedEx location in San Jose, and never showed up for work.Overall, I had a very positive experience this time around, so the five stars are for the staff of this location than FedEx.

When I call up for my package trace, the FedEx guy says "It may have been left behind by the driver". Okay, so I ask if I can swing by and collect it. "During this season we have thousands of packages, and it will take us hours to locate yours". His overall tone, absolute lack of concern, playing the victim card (we are understaffed) and blatant disregard for my time was appalling and disgusting. And he refused to give me his name, when I persisted, he simply hung up. What a shining example of how customer service should NOT be.

If I could give no stars I would. Fed Ex is unprofessional, lame excuses for not delivering a package on time(do they know we can see the excuses online?), I hope my vendor chooses another delivery company as they are planning to do.

Terrible service FedEx ground - holding my package hostage, refusing to deliver on expected time, promising re-deliver on same day and not acting as promised. You are forcing a working mom to drag her baby to your center 20 miles out of the way, mid week, on working hours, through rush hour traffic to pick it up.I spent my entire Saturday at home waiting for this one, called you 4 times and that's the result. Here's a service I should not to use again!

As of this review, I have yet to receive my package, which is two days late. The reason for no delivery? DELIVERY EXCEPTION: LOCAL WEATHER DELAY. Are you kidding me? It's summer in NorCal. What sort of weather halts delivery this time of year in Newark?

Total incompetence. This station handles FedEx Ground shipments. FedEx Ground drivers  (different from FedEx Express) are 3rd party contractors. I would estimate 9 out of 10 FedEx Ground packages were late, misdelivered or not delivered at all. I've heard all kinds of excuses from every manager at that station- Martin Camex, Mike Pacheco, etc... they all gave me their cell numbers, which is a joke because they NEVER answer their cell. The senior manager is Roberto Ravelo. Left 5 messages for him to call me over the past 3 weeks and he's never returned my calls. Called FedEx corp. executive customer relations and  NUMEROUS times but that's whole another story (Cornishia, Beverly, Dee, etc.).  It's a total nightmare trying to get my packages from them. IF I do get a hold of one of the managers, they always blame the drivers (claiming they're new), apologize and tell me it will never happen again, give me their cell #... this has been going on for 18 years. I thought OnTrac was bad, FedEx ground is truly THE worst carrier I've ever encountered.

This Fedex location consistently fails to deliver packages.  With over four packages now they claim to put the package on their truck each day but then state no one was there to accept delivery, including in cases when I've been home all day or the packages themselves required no signature and could have been left on my doorstep.  The only conclusion I can reach from these experiences is that the drivers are in fact making no attempt to actually deliver packages. UPS, FedEx Air, USPS and even Ontrac have no trouble delivering to my location.  What gives?

This is the worst delivery experience ever.  Two days now the truck has marked that there has not been someone here to sign for the package which is not true, both days there has been someone here and the driver never showed. If I had a choice  I would never use FedEX again I hope they keep losing the contracts from retailers that I like.

I just got off the phone with FedEx and even though my package was marked as "On FedEx vehicle for delivery" at 3:03am this morning they are going to let it sit in that vehicle for TWO FULL DAYS before delivering it on Monday. This is absolutely unacceptable in this day and age where companies like Amazon deliver packages to your front door within a few hours for free. The competition is evolving and FedEx chooses to lag behind and stay in the past. I will not be using FedEx again.

First time saw the Door Tag on my door it said "Final Attempt", then no one tried to deliver it again the next day.  Been waiting for the package all day but no one showed up, yet, the tracking got updated to failed attempt.  Called FedEx 3+ times, and were told it'll be re-delivered "today".  When seeing no tracking updates on the web at 4pm, finally called again, and was told my package never went out and won't be delivered.  Not until someone sees the note that we called, and there's no ETA about when someone will see the note.  When I asked for the local facility #, the lady told me the facility is closed, at 4pm.  Then my husband found the # on Yelp and called, the facility is still open, and will be opened for couple more hours.  Very frustrating with all the stories being fed to me.  And, I still haven't received my package.

Worst FedEx location, ever.They held my package at this location for almost a week!!!.....all they needed to do was ship it to the Union City location for pickup.  When I called to ask if I could just come to this location to pick it up, I was told that they couldn't locate my package so it was best to wait until they found it and delivered it to UC.Very rude customer service.

If your packages are coming from this Newark location to your house, you're gonna have a bad time. PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND REQUEST YOUR PACKAGE TO BE HELD SOMEWHERE AND PICK IT UP.

This is the worst experience I have ever had with a delivery.  I paid for a specific delivery window for my package to be delivered yesterday.  I spent a lot of time on the phone with FedEx yesterday trying to understand why they didn't honor the service they provide for customized delivery. They were if not help at all.  Then I spent significant time on the phone today while FedEx customer service was speaking to the manager at the Newark shipping department and was told that my request for the customized delivery time would take 48 hours to process even though I requested it last week.  To be clear I was told that my package was still in Newark.  Exactly 15 minutes after my call the package was delivered to my house but I wasn't there to sign for it so it's back in Newark again.  Tweedle dee and tweedle dum are alive and well at Newark Fed Ex.  I have contacted the business where I made my purchase and I have let them know that I will NEVER purchase something online again if it is being sent with Fed Ex.  Let's all boycott FedEx.

I hate Fed Ex. They will not allow me to change the delivery time through Delivery Manager since I am not a business. The tech on the phone didn't tell me this until we talked on the phone for 30 minutes. Seems like an obvious reason if you work in tech support for Fed Ex. They deliver when I'm at work and I called them and they won't change the time or leave the package at my door. Consequently, I cannot take possession of my package. After the third delivery attempt they hold it at the Newark facility, a 30-40 min drive in traffic from my house. If you order anything, don't have it delivered by fed ex ground. They are absolutely terrible. I hate Fed Ex.

Ordered a rockshox from excel cycle in MN, they sent it fed ex and required a signature. I asked them not to require a signature, but they ignored that request. Fed ex has made three attempts to deliver my package but everyone is at work during the day. I signed the door tag and also created a fed ex account and modified the delivery options with directions for them to leave the package on the porch. Fed ex ignored both and took my package back to their office in Newark. They then say I have to drive out to Newark to pick up my package. I was supposed to go to the bike shop today and get the fork installed. I've been on the phone with fed ex for an hour trying to find my package and get it delivered. They then tell me they will have to call me back. They didn't. I called twice over the next few days and was told they would have to call me back. They didn't. I got a postcard telling me to call them, yet I've called them three times, they said they need to look into it and call me back, but then I don't receive a call from them. I don't recommend Fed ex. When buying on Amazon, buy from a vendor that ships UPS and Amazon Prime if you want your stuff.Fed Ex's labor practices are also a reason to boycott this company. Read money.cnn.com/2014/11/20…

Do not trust Laurie from this location. I was sending my sister flowers for her birthday, but they never put the package on a truck the day it was supposed to be delivered. When I called, she said she would contact my sister and have a truck that evening deliver the flowers, or worst case scenario she would send it out first thing tomorrow morning. My sister was never called and the package was never attempted. Nothing was mailed the next morning because the FedEx location closed during the weekend (which she is obviously aware of). My sister has yet to receive her flowers, and when she does I am sure they will be dead.

I have always had good experiences with FedEx in general.  The main station in Los Angeles was always very responsive and helpful.  The delivery people were reliable.  Now that I have moved to Northern California I assumed that the same would be true here.  Sadly it is not.  The delivery person who serves my neighborhood documents that he/she has attempted a delivery but there is no door tag and the video surveillance of my door does not show anyone coming to the door on the days in question (I was home as well).  After being on hold with customer service for an hour I was assured that another attempt would be made today.  I called again and was informed that the station claimed they were not aware of another delivery attempt and my only option was to drive there and pick up the items.  Looking at the other reviews it seems this is a chronic problem with this station.  I hope that the management will take a look at these reviews and make sure their drivers are held accountable.  Their customers are paying for delivery so at the very least the driver should attempt a delivery.  Unfortunately unlike other situations where the consumers can simply choose another provider we are stuck with this station.  Again it is my sincere hope that the management will take all the complaints regarding documentation of "delivery attempt" when no attempt was made into consideration and bring about some change.

HEY! FEDEX! Does anyone from your broke-dick company ever read these feedbacks? I think not!These people can sometimes sound like disrespectful worthless scuzbags. Never trust FedEx at their word. I knew of express, ground, but did you know 'home delivery' is a separate, third party contracted group who don't work on Mondays? The dispatch says they do not have a way to contract drivers, which sounds like a blatant lie. In MY little town, the dispatch can contact their drivers either via 'hitting' the drivers 'board' or via cellular contact. All of their drivers anytime!NEVER again will I use FedEx for anything other than delivering squirrel crappola or used diapers!

I have used this shop for years for routine printing, copying, and binding. I have never been disappointed and I have come to depend on them when I have a deadline. 

I give a 4-star because this review doesn't cover some of their primary services (shipping, special printing. etc.).







I was fending for myself with the lamination machine.

Meghan came to the rescue. She turned up the machine, fixed all of my crappy lamination and even showed me how to use the fancy cutting machine.

Without her my experience would have been bad.







Every time I come here I say it won't be horrible... and each time not to disappoint it has been equally horrible. Why does every employee at this location work at a complete snails pace, especially when you have four reps at the front and each one moving so slowly I could of done the transaction myself. I would goto the Cupertino location and try to avoid here at all costs!







I want to thank Frankie for helping me with making sure my package was mailed properly!







All FedEx offices are so slow. Why does the office have only 1 person working? It is obvious that a long line is formed for only 1 person. They should improve.







Always have to wait no matter when I come terrible system no respect for customers time very frustrating







This business remains as the worst run on the peninsula.  Most of the staff is ignorant, and really don't care about what they are doing, much less the customer.  When I questioned them about their copy policy, I was treated like I was trying to hold the store up.  Rude & insolent, avoid at all costs.







Horrible customer service !!!

It was like we were actually invisible to all employees, especially the manager who didn't even look at us each time he walked by. Never said anything like 'I'll be right with you' or 'give me a minute' ... or 'could you go away because I really don't like customers', which is basically what he said by his ignoring us. 

I wish I had read the other Yelp reviews before I went in there thinking they could help me because they definitely couldn't and didn't even want to try. 

I'm fed up with fedex...go UPS and USPS !!







I was wary after reading previous reviews but both staff who were there were super friendly and helpful and went the extra mile to help us out! Maybe they are turning it around here.







I wish I had looked at the reviews before I went in. 

I was given an estimate of $80, they wrapped the package and then informed me it would be $130. The price difference was due to the size of the box used ( twice the size of the item!). They rewrapped the item in a smaller box, but the price was still $108, well above the estimate.

Not a good experience, I will use UPS next time.







This place has the absolute slowest service. There was only one other person in the store when I came in, and I've now been waiting 15 mins to drop off a single box. They need to get more staff or just try harder.







Good parking and location. The good stuff ends with that. The service is slooooooow! Alfred who helped me would also give such an attitude. This is by far the worst FedEx I have been to. Alfred is continuously multitasking and making it slower for everyone. Don't go here. Even if it's farther go to the next FedEx.







Convenient parking in front of the store & right next to Petco

Actually printer indoor at home is not good to health. Good to outsource the air hazardous job







Way under staffed and not customer service oriented.  Unclear where to go for each service.  I would avoid this store.







This business has 124 reviews with an average of 2 stars. I guess the numbers talk for the business. I have been here a handful of times over the years and I would say that the majority of times I walked away dissatisfied by the customer service. One time I was giving direction to a guy to make sure he did what I wanted exactly and he was acting as if I was trying to teach him how to do his job. Another time I walked in and another guy helped me out but that one was rather nice and friendly. Lately, I walked into the store and I asked a lady to print some documents for me. It didn't take too long for me to figure out that she had not intention to be friendly or at least pretend to be friendly. When she asked me if I wanted black and white or color prints I said colors. However, only 10% of what I had needed to be printed in colors. Regardless, she printed everything in colors so for about 16 pages I ended up paying $19.46. If you come across Sureshni K. be aware she won't be friendly and she will rip you off (she has no common sense either - if you see a document in black and white you just don't print it in color ... unless you are an idiot). I'm not excited by this place. It's in my neighborhood and it's convenient but I guess I'll drive an extra block next time.







I had the best experience ever. Employee Frankie went out of his way to help me with something that wasn't even part of his duties. I came to pick up a package and was surprised with 150 lb huge box that I could not possibly move. Frankie brought it to my car, when the box did not fit he opened the box and loaded all the furniture piece by piece in to my car. I am super grateful. Thank you Frankie from the bottom of my heart







UGH!

I was on a deadline and needed printing of a few things for a conference I was organizing.  We needed to print some items the night before it started because information was a constantly moving target. 

It was a simple, albeit semi- large job.  

I had been happy when I walked into this location to see that they had the supplies I needed-- only they didn't work on laser printers-- only ink jet and didn't work with FedEx Kinko's printers.  I needed a solution and fast. I could have gone to an office supply place if I had known they sold products for printing that weren't compatible with their printers. 

The guy agreed to cut me postcards but didn't want to help me with reformatting the template correctly or cutting them properly.  I asked for a Kinkos template which I am sure they have, but he agreed to use what I had and cut them after printing. 

I ended up with a HUGE mess that I ended up not paying for since he cut them lopsided and didn't cut off the borders. Lazy job. Turns out that he was close to going home and just didn't want to provide me service.  He was putting on his backpack while cutting the cards-- which might explain why they didn't get done properly. 

When I complained, he scolded me openly that this was a job that required at least 24 hours (to print/cut 18 pages of cards into 4), 500 copies of a double sided flyer, and 10 pages of table tents on special paper-- all in color.   I was willing to wait for as long as it took (I walked in with at least 5 hours to closing).  I was spending well over $600 for this and ended up leaving without everything I needed. 

This location needs to provide better service.  I understand that in an ideal world there would be 24 hours notice for printing.  However, I needed a job done and they should have been willing to accommodate as long as I was reasonable.  I wasn't complaining if I had to wait.   I just wanted to walk out that night with printed materials and 3 hours should have been enough time. 

Ended up at another FedEx Kinkos at their open and that employee was more than happy to help me and do the job right.







Horrible service. Super bad attitude. They make me come back 4 times for one print out bc they have to go on lunch.







The worst. Their new "paperless" system is a huge waste of time and energy. Instead of filling out a packing slip and dropping my boxes - you have to write down the to and from addresses, wait in line (10min), wait for them to type in your info and package your box, only then can you get a tracking number. Go back to the system that Every Other fedex uses! Customers like it for a reason. 

Not to mention their super bad attitude and lack of customer service. Thanks for nothing. I'll drive further to avoid this place







I had the misfortune of visiting this Fedex center 3x this week and hope I never have to go again. Their customer service stinks!!

All FedEx offices are so slow. Why does the office have only 1 person working? It is obvious that a long line is formed for only 1 person. They should improve.

This business remains as the worst run on the peninsula.  Most of the staff is ignorant, and really don't care about what they are doing, much less the customer.  When I questioned them about their copy policy, I was treated like I was trying to hold the store up.  Rude & insolent, avoid at all costs.

I went in once to have an image transferred from my flash drive to heavy stock for a 12" x 17" bookcover.  No problem, it took about 30 min working with the guy.  The next time was a nightmare.  I had to go back eight times to finally get it done. It depends on who you get. I kept telling the guy, you did this once before, only to get, "We can only do 11 x 17", which wasn't true. On the image transfer I told them, "front cover, spine, back cover". What did I get?  Front cover, spine, front cover.  Had to start all over again. Was advised to take my business to the Fed Ex/Kinkos on California Ave in Palo Alto. Non-Neanderthols there.  The staff in MV is hopeless.

Horrible customer service !!!It was like we were actually invisible to all employees, especially the manager who didn't even look at us each time he walked by. Never said anything like 'I'll be right with you' or 'give me a minute' ... or 'could you go away because I really don't like customers', which is basically what he said by his ignoring us. I wish I had read the other Yelp reviews before I went in there thinking they could help me because they definitely couldn't and didn't even want to try. I'm fed up with fedex...go UPS and USPS !!

I wish I had looked at the reviews before I went in. I was given an estimate of $80, they wrapped the package and then informed me it would be $130. The price difference was due to the size of the box used ( twice the size of the item!). They rewrapped the item in a smaller box, but the price was still $108, well above the estimate.Not a good experience, I will use UPS next time.

This place has the absolute slowest service. There was only one other person in the store when I came in, and I've now been waiting 15 mins to drop off a single box. They need to get more staff or just try harder.

Good parking and location. The good stuff ends with that. The service is slooooooow! Alfred who helped me would also give such an attitude. This is by far the worst FedEx I have been to. Alfred is continuously multitasking and making it slower for everyone. Don't go here. Even if it's farther go to the next FedEx.

This business has 124 reviews with an average of 2 stars. I guess the numbers talk for the business. I have been here a handful of times over the years and I would say that the majority of times I walked away dissatisfied by the customer service. One time I was giving direction to a guy to make sure he did what I wanted exactly and he was acting as if I was trying to teach him how to do his job. Another time I walked in and another guy helped me out but that one was rather nice and friendly. Lately, I walked into the store and I asked a lady to print some documents for me. It didn't take too long for me to figure out that she had not intention to be friendly or at least pretend to be friendly. When she asked me if I wanted black and white or color prints I said colors. However, only 10% of what I had needed to be printed in colors. Regardless, she printed everything in colors so for about 16 pages I ended up paying $19.46. If you come across Sureshni K. be aware she won't be friendly and she will rip you off (she has no common sense either - if you see a document in black and white you just don't print it in color ... unless you are an idiot). I'm not excited by this place. It's in my neighborhood and it's convenient but I guess I'll drive an extra block next time.

I had the best experience ever. Employee Frankie went out of his way to help me with something that wasn't even part of his duties. I came to pick up a package and was surprised with 150 lb huge box that I could not possibly move. Frankie brought it to my car, when the box did not fit he opened the box and loaded all the furniture piece by piece in to my car. I am super grateful. Thank you Frankie from the bottom of my heart

UGH!I was on a deadline and needed printing of a few things for a conference I was organizing.  We needed to print some items the night before it started because information was a constantly moving target. It was a simple, albeit semi- large job.  I had been happy when I walked into this location to see that they had the supplies I needed-- only they didn't work on laser printers-- only ink jet and didn't work with FedEx Kinko's printers.  I needed a solution and fast. I could have gone to an office supply place if I had known they sold products for printing that weren't compatible with their printers. The guy agreed to cut me postcards but didn't want to help me with reformatting the template correctly or cutting them properly.  I asked for a Kinkos template which I am sure they have, but he agreed to use what I had and cut them after printing. I ended up with a HUGE mess that I ended up not paying for since he cut them lopsided and didn't cut off the borders. Lazy job. Turns out that he was close to going home and just didn't want to provide me service.  He was putting on his backpack while cutting the cards-- which might explain why they didn't get done properly. When I complained, he scolded me openly that this was a job that required at least 24 hours (to print/cut 18 pages of cards into 4), 500 copies of a double sided flyer, and 10 pages of table tents on special paper-- all in color.   I was willing to wait for as long as it took (I walked in with at least 5 hours to closing).  I was spending well over $600 for this and ended up leaving without everything I needed. This location needs to provide better service.  I understand that in an ideal world there would be 24 hours notice for printing.  However, I needed a job done and they should have been willing to accommodate as long as I was reasonable.  I wasn't complaining if I had to wait.   I just wanted to walk out that night with printed materials and 3 hours should have been enough time. Ended up at another FedEx Kinkos at their open and that employee was more than happy to help me and do the job right.

The worst. Their new "paperless" system is a huge waste of time and energy. Instead of filling out a packing slip and dropping my boxes - you have to write down the to and from addresses, wait in line (10min), wait for them to type in your info and package your box, only then can you get a tracking number. Go back to the system that Every Other fedex uses! Customers like it for a reason. Not to mention their super bad attitude and lack of customer service. Thanks for nothing. I'll drive further to avoid this place

Needed a passport picture late at night, around 10:30PM. Walked in and out in 15 minutes. The service was great and the person working there was very helpful with information. 

Will be back there when I need things done outside the business hours as it is a drive from my house but they are very professional.







I've been here a few times to pick up poster print orders that were sent in online.  The posters were always printed early and with very high quality.  The service when I had to call to check in or pick up was always professional and helpful.   It is great that I can pick up anytime.

The Fedex online website is cumbersome, but that is another story!







I come here about 3-4 times a week and I ship lots of stuff here. I usually don't have any problems with the shipping staff here but there's one person who I really don't get excited about seeing & working with. 

The past few times I've been to this location, Carol has been manning the shipping department while the other staff that I prefer to work with are at other stations.

Here's why I don't like working with Carol.
1. Carol is very rude and she is not friendly at all. 
2. She is miserable & probably hates her job and she wears it on her sleeve. 
3. Like literally 90% of the time she's grumpy, when she's friendly or says hi to me, it catches me off guard. Literally one time when she said hi to me on my walk back from the parking lot, I kinda flinched. 
4. She hates working, one time I came with like 8 boxes and she asked me how many more do I have. She also asked me to help lift a box for her...I turned her down and said that I didn't feel like a customer should have to do that. 
5. She makes a lot of mistakes and you need to correct her. Once she forgot my account number and had to do it again and so her colleague/manager? told me I can leave and they would email me a receipt. I checked my receipt and they spelled my recipient's name wrong!

Working with employees like her really puts a drab on your day. She gives me so much attitude that I can't help but get annoyed but I try my best to hide it. I always say hi to her and try not to say a word so I don't piss her off. Really sucks that I have to feel like I'm walking on egg shells every time I work with her. Today I got really annoyed with her because she kept having me repeat things and I let my annoyance slip, so I asked her for her name and here we are with this review.







Very bad experience starting from stuff. and the fact my package from palo alto to nevada were traveling 5 days and I paid 25$ for package!

Such a craapy company

NEVER AGAIN.







Use a different location. Decent firm but this location is one huge frustration 


Note to management: fire everyone and start over







One star for MYA--she is the rudest person ever to work in customer service.  M. Jeckel had to step in because she was as incompetent as a rock.  She is truly a grinchy nasty foul attitude wench. She started on our transaction and when I mentioned that we had a coupon (found on Yelp btw), she said with the most shockingly horrific attitude, "I don't know how to do that."  At that point, M. Jeckel took over and expertly handled the rest of the transaction.  Did Mya stick around to learn how to apply the coupon? No. She evaporated.  M. Jeckel completed the sale with a jovial attitude, while Mya just sat down across the room.







The staff was super helpful and professional. I had 37 pages to scan and was done in 5 minutes, but I guess that's because I paid extra for automatic scanning and BOUGHT a new flash drive for that purpose... Shiet.

So here is the price:
$.89 per page for automatic scanning, given that you bring a flash drive with you
$.45 per minute to use computer and scan page by page, then you can download the file to your email.
$9.99 for an 8GB flash drive.

Man never knew scanning could be THIS expensive. Guess I could have saved money if I scanned page per page by myself using their computer, but I had 37 pages!







I've been here a couple times, to pick up orders I'd placed online for school readings to be printed, 3-hole punched, and stapled. The staff members have been so nice and helpful, I'm sure that the beginning of spring semester/winter quarter is insane for them. Nevertheless, my print orders have been accurate and ready when I get there. Also, the parking is usually ample (at least when I get there at 9:00pm), the neighborhood is well-lit and relatively safe.







Rude lady at this counter. Disgusting. First of all she greeted everyone one else like, "how can I help you?" To me she said " yeah what's up." The young girl at the counter was just bad at customer service. She should lose that job fast. Bad bad bad for business.







Very friendly staff. Very professional service. Generally fairly low  wait times for any sort of service or to pay.







We didn't receive your email! 
Very rude customer service. Jon said: I will be right with you after 15 min and another 15 min to check the file. I can't believe they are not busy but the act like it. 
She literally throw the file for me to choose the paper. 
You don't hear here the world please or thank you. 
Make sure that you terribly need this place before you come here, other wise try vista print overnight shipping !







The only reason I go to FedEx Office is for self-service: to make copies, or print from a USB or email.  The fact that this is open 24/7 makes me a fan!  The machines were working perfectly and stocked with paper.  You would think this is a given, but I've been to many locations around the south bay, and this is not always the case.  I came here after 9pm on a Saturday night, and the staff was friendly.  I overheard them helping out another customer who needed something in a rush, and they were so helpful.







David Luna is one horrible person!! I was appalled with the experience I had with David, the manager at the FedEx Office on California Ave. in Palo Alto. 
I have been a customer for awhile and was going to introduce myself but he completely ignored me! FedEx Office should not have rude and arrogant people like David as their managers! I am pretty sure he will get nothing but bad reviews!!! Stay away from this location because of him!







The reason for most of visits to FedEx is to spend five minutes making a few photocopies. I never get out of there in less than 25 minutes. Today, I was at the FedEx on California Avenue in Palo Alto: 
1. The machine was out of paper and the employees ignored my mentioning this to them.
2. The same copying machine wouldn't log me out until I pulled the electrical plug on the console. Only then was it possible to use my debit card on a different machine.
3. The copy machine then re-formatted the 7-page document MS Word which was to be copied, thereby wasting a dollar.

Is it possible to attach photos to one's review? I attached a sign to the useless copying machine which read "DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS ONE", and I wanted to share it with the others who might be reading my review.

In all fairness, though I have had positive experiences with the evening staff; they were very helpful and accommodating.







Total waste of time & money. 

Went in to make a copy of my mom's medical reports on the way to SFO before she flew home. Stick the credit card in the machine, chose option for scan and email and the machine scanned but I didn't see an email on my phone. Twice. After wasting 20 minutes I went to the front desk and asked for help. They said the copy machines can't scan and email. You have to use the computer, and oh it charges 50c by the minute.







No notary on staff. Don't list yourself as having notaries when you don't. Got sent to 3 locations looking for a notary until finally this one said they don't carry them at all.







Terrible service. Dave the manager is very rude to customers, I've never ran into such a bad manager.







I came in a few times this week to cut and laminate some signs and to drop off a package.  The self service area was a bit messy, but I had everything there that I needed, so it didn't bother me.  I was a little confused how to use the lamination machine when I first took a look, but there's signs there to help out so that was cool.  They seem to be a little short staffed because the service for checkout was a little slow.  However, everyone working there that I was in contact with was helpful in getting my tasks done.







I came in just a few minutes ago, and Anthony helped me out. I had a small order and I'm not from a big company so I expected to be a low priority. That was not the case. He was incredibly helpful and the whole process was so straightforward and simple.







Its nice this place is opened 24/7. One stop shop! Don't know many fed ex places that are opened 24/7. It gets confusing on what machine to use, but the staff will help you.

Needed a passport picture late at night, around 10:30PM. Walked in and out in 15 minutes. The service was great and the person working there was very helpful with information. Will be back there when I need things done outside the business hours as it is a drive from my house but they are very professional.

I've been here a few times to pick up poster print orders that were sent in online.  The posters were always printed early and with very high quality.  The service when I had to call to check in or pick up was always professional and helpful.   It is great that I can pick up anytime.The Fedex online website is cumbersome, but that is another story!

            Listed in Yelp 100 challenge 2017


I come here about 3-4 times a week and I ship lots of stuff here. I usually don't have any problems with the shipping staff here but there's one person who I really don't get excited about seeing & working with. The past few times I've been to this location, Carol has been manning the shipping department while the other staff that I prefer to work with are at other stations.Here's why I don't like working with Carol.1. Carol is very rude and she is not friendly at all. 2. She is miserable & probably hates her job and she wears it on her sleeve. 3. Like literally 90% of the time she's grumpy, when she's friendly or says hi to me, it catches me off guard. Literally one time when she said hi to me on my walk back from the parking lot, I kinda flinched. 4. She hates working, one time I came with like 8 boxes and she asked me how many more do I have. She also asked me to help lift a box for her...I turned her down and said that I didn't feel like a customer should have to do that. 5. She makes a lot of mistakes and you need to correct her. Once she forgot my account number and had to do it again and so her colleague/manager? told me I can leave and they would email me a receipt. I checked my receipt and they spelled my recipient's name wrong!Working with employees like her really puts a drab on your day. She gives me so much attitude that I can't help but get annoyed but I try my best to hide it. I always say hi to her and try not to say a word so I don't piss her off. Really sucks that I have to feel like I'm walking on egg shells every time I work with her. Today I got really annoyed with her because she kept having me repeat things and I let my annoyance slip, so I asked her for her name and here we are with this review.

This place is hit or miss. They have a mix of good and bad staff.I use their shipping services almost everyday of the work week. You don't really know who you'll be working with as the staff does everything here and it's whoever is free that will man different stations. I really don't like working a specific person here because she's very sassy and she's a toss up. Sometimes she's in a good mood, sometimes she's not. I feel like I'm burdening her by making so much shipments... one time she even asked me to do the heavy lifting for her. I did a nervous chuckle and told her that I didn't think it was appropriate to ask a customer to be doing stuff like that and if one of the guys behind the counter can help instead. Anthony is great to work with and will ask you how you are. I usually get good service here and can get in and out really quickly.

One star for MYA--she is the rudest person ever to work in customer service.  M. Jeckel had to step in because she was as incompetent as a rock.  She is truly a grinchy nasty foul attitude wench. She started on our transaction and when I mentioned that we had a coupon (found on Yelp btw), she said with the most shockingly horrific attitude, "I don't know how to do that."  At that point, M. Jeckel took over and expertly handled the rest of the transaction.  Did Mya stick around to learn how to apply the coupon? No. She evaporated.  M. Jeckel completed the sale with a jovial attitude, while Mya just sat down across the room.

The staff was super helpful and professional. I had 37 pages to scan and was done in 5 minutes, but I guess that's because I paid extra for automatic scanning and BOUGHT a new flash drive for that purpose... Shiet.So here is the price:$.89 per page for automatic scanning, given that you bring a flash drive with you$.45 per minute to use computer and scan page by page, then you can download the file to your email.$9.99 for an 8GB flash drive.Man never knew scanning could be THIS expensive. Guess I could have saved money if I scanned page per page by myself using their computer, but I had 37 pages!

I've been here a couple times, to pick up orders I'd placed online for school readings to be printed, 3-hole punched, and stapled. The staff members have been so nice and helpful, I'm sure that the beginning of spring semester/winter quarter is insane for them. Nevertheless, my print orders have been accurate and ready when I get there. Also, the parking is usually ample (at least when I get there at 9:00pm), the neighborhood is well-lit and relatively safe.

We didn't receive your email! Very rude customer service. Jon said: I will be right with you after 15 min and another 15 min to check the file. I can't believe they are not busy but the act like it. She literally throw the file for me to choose the paper. You don't hear here the world please or thank you. Make sure that you terribly need this place before you come here, other wise try vista print overnight shipping !

The only reason I go to FedEx Office is for self-service: to make copies, or print from a USB or email.  The fact that this is open 24/7 makes me a fan!  The machines were working perfectly and stocked with paper.  You would think this is a given, but I've been to many locations around the south bay, and this is not always the case.  I came here after 9pm on a Saturday night, and the staff was friendly.  I overheard them helping out another customer who needed something in a rush, and they were so helpful.

David Luna is one horrible person!! I was appalled with the experience I had with David, the manager at the FedEx Office on California Ave. in Palo Alto. I have been a customer for awhile and was going to introduce myself but he completely ignored me! FedEx Office should not have rude and arrogant people like David as their managers! I am pretty sure he will get nothing but bad reviews!!! Stay away from this location because of him!

The reason for most of visits to FedEx is to spend five minutes making a few photocopies. I never get out of there in less than 25 minutes. Today, I was at the FedEx on California Avenue in Palo Alto: 1. The machine was out of paper and the employees ignored my mentioning this to them.2. The same copying machine wouldn't log me out until I pulled the electrical plug on the console. Only then was it possible to use my debit card on a different machine.3. The copy machine then re-formatted the 7-page document MS Word which was to be copied, thereby wasting a dollar.Is it possible to attach photos to one's review? I attached a sign to the useless copying machine which read "DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS ONE", and I wanted to share it with the others who might be reading my review.In all fairness, though I have had positive experiences with the evening staff; they were very helpful and accommodating.

Total waste of time & money. Went in to make a copy of my mom's medical reports on the way to SFO before she flew home. Stick the credit card in the machine, chose option for scan and email and the machine scanned but I didn't see an email on my phone. Twice. After wasting 20 minutes I went to the front desk and asked for help. They said the copy machines can't scan and email. You have to use the computer, and oh it charges 50c by the minute.

I came in a few times this week to cut and laminate some signs and to drop off a package.  The self service area was a bit messy, but I had everything there that I needed, so it didn't bother me.  I was a little confused how to use the lamination machine when I first took a look, but there's signs there to help out so that was cool.  They seem to be a little short staffed because the service for checkout was a little slow.  However, everyone working there that I was in contact with was helpful in getting my tasks done.

        (650) 723-3132
    






I've been here a few times for copy jobs have never left pleased/satisfied.

I went to drop off a FedEx package and had to wait in line for 5 minutes to just hand it to someone.

So, yeah.  Meh.







Don't come here if you need to take care of business in an efficient manner. This place is primarily for students to pick up packages and isn't worth your time if you need to do more than that. Today I came in 15 minutes ahead of the 4pm pick up and waited in line 15 minutes (without it moving) and missed the pick up. It was odd that despite at least 4-5 people working there, the line didn't move. I sped over to the Cal Ave location because I had to get it shipped today, and was in and out there in less than 5 minutes. It's obvious that the tressider fed ex is mostly for students picking up packages and they don't have a well-oiled machine for anything else.







I have noticed an odd, but persistent pattern, wherever I go.  UPS is routinely terrible at delivering packages (and stores them in highly inconvenient locations when it makes me pick them up) but FedEx is routinely terrible at letting me send them (and seems staffed by mysteriously unhelpful people).  In an ideal world I would receive everything by FedEx, and send everything by UPS.  When I sent packages to myself, they would be inter-lined.

The FedEx at Tressider continues the pattern.  I walked in with a heavy box of books only to learn that they "don't do" FedEx ground.  That is, they will let you drop off a ground package, but they won't print or sell you a ground label, only an air label.  Why, was not explained.  I was sent to a nearby computer lab where I managed to create a label but proved unable to print it (thanks, Stanford computing!), and ultimately had to give up and take my package to the post office, where I paid twice as much to somebody who was at least happy to take my money and my package.  And thanks to all of the running around, I nearly missed my flight.







Went in there to send a 10 page fax. I wait at the counter while an employee pretends I'm not there. After some gesturing and polite calls, I flag him down. He types in the fax number - oops, its busy. He says - check your number, it must be wrong. It is not wrong. Ok, no problem, I have 2 alternative numbers that are hopefully not busy. We type in the second one. Still busy. He says (and I kid you not), "this is the last try, I have other things to do." 

Well, I'm sure we ALL have better things to do, but i need to send this fax, that's why I'm in Fedex. We try the last number. Still busy (by the way, this fax is to the DMV). He wanders off. 

I'm left alone for 10 mins as he refuses to answer my queries. 

Eventually, the other fedex employee helping customers post packages comes over to help me out. Total time spent in fedex: 1 hour, to send a simple 10 page fax.

I'm only coming here if there are no other options.







I needed to print out a piece of paper, sign it, scan it, and email it back to someone.  Turns out, that was more than this Kinkos could handle.  They said that they would scan it for me, but they would not email me the scanned document.  The only way to get me the scanned document would be to use a flash drive.  Except that they don't have any flash drives.  However, they do sell flash drives, and they suggested that I buy one, and then they'd put the document on that.  Ridiculous.  That's like the gas station refusing to sell you gas unless you buy a gas pump or bring your own.







The person in the shop is simply rude! I went in for poster printing and the guy said my file size is not right and simply print my poster on a A4 paper! How ridiculous! When I asked him whether he could resize it for me, he said he would charge me. WTF! I wish I could give negative star!

Don't come here if you need to take care of business in an efficient manner. This place is primarily for students to pick up packages and isn't worth your time if you need to do more than that. Today I came in 15 minutes ahead of the 4pm pick up and waited in line 15 minutes (without it moving) and missed the pick up. It was odd that despite at least 4-5 people working there, the line didn't move. I sped over to the Cal Ave location because I had to get it shipped today, and was in and out there in less than 5 minutes. It's obvious that the tressider fed ex is mostly for students picking up packages and they don't have a well-oiled machine for anything else.

I have noticed an odd, but persistent pattern, wherever I go.  UPS is routinely terrible at delivering packages (and stores them in highly inconvenient locations when it makes me pick them up) but FedEx is routinely terrible at letting me send them (and seems staffed by mysteriously unhelpful people).  In an ideal world I would receive everything by FedEx, and send everything by UPS.  When I sent packages to myself, they would be inter-lined.The FedEx at Tressider continues the pattern.  I walked in with a heavy box of books only to learn that they "don't do" FedEx ground.  That is, they will let you drop off a ground package, but they won't print or sell you a ground label, only an air label.  Why, was not explained.  I was sent to a nearby computer lab where I managed to create a label but proved unable to print it (thanks, Stanford computing!), and ultimately had to give up and take my package to the post office, where I paid twice as much to somebody who was at least happy to take my money and my package.  And thanks to all of the running around, I nearly missed my flight.

Went in there to send a 10 page fax. I wait at the counter while an employee pretends I'm not there. After some gesturing and polite calls, I flag him down. He types in the fax number - oops, its busy. He says - check your number, it must be wrong. It is not wrong. Ok, no problem, I have 2 alternative numbers that are hopefully not busy. We type in the second one. Still busy. He says (and I kid you not), "this is the last try, I have other things to do." Well, I'm sure we ALL have better things to do, but i need to send this fax, that's why I'm in Fedex. We try the last number. Still busy (by the way, this fax is to the DMV). He wanders off. I'm left alone for 10 mins as he refuses to answer my queries. Eventually, the other fedex employee helping customers post packages comes over to help me out. Total time spent in fedex: 1 hour, to send a simple 10 page fax.I'm only coming here if there are no other options.

I needed to print out a piece of paper, sign it, scan it, and email it back to someone.  Turns out, that was more than this Kinkos could handle.  They said that they would scan it for me, but they would not email me the scanned document.  The only way to get me the scanned document would be to use a flash drive.  Except that they don't have any flash drives.  However, they do sell flash drives, and they suggested that I buy one, and then they'd put the document on that.  Ridiculous.  That's like the gas station refusing to sell you gas unless you buy a gas pump or bring your own.

The person in the shop is simply rude! I went in for poster printing and the guy said my file size is not right and simply print my poster on a A4 paper! How ridiculous! When I asked him whether he could resize it for me, he said he would charge me. WTF! I wish I could give negative star!

        (650) 493-2120
    






I can't believe I'm writing a Yelp review for a FedEx shipping center, but after the service I received tonight, I thought it warranted. 

This is the first time I've been to this location, and it's tucked away in Palo Alto Square near Page Mill and El Camino. Conveniently, it's open until 8 pm with ample parking (at least in the evening). It also sounds like, given its location and smaller size, it is less busy (meaning shorter wait times/lines). I came around 6:45 pm, and the place was pretty empty, save for a few customers quickly dropping shipments off.

I had to pack and ship 10 packages this evening, and Gabe was manning the desk. He was incredibly polite, helpful and patient. I wanted to give some kudos publicly for his really great customer service.







Never go again!!! Especially if you are a female. It's waste of your time, money and your effort! The staff who is a middle-old age guy who was very disrespectful, disorganized, biased and very good at holding a fake smile! He allows random people cut into your line. Although I was in a hurry, I was very nice and smiled to ask him to ship a camera len for me, it took so long for him to find one box which is x10 bigger than I actually need (I wonder if he want to fool me because it cost me more). When a random guy came in, ignored me and asked him to ship a stuff. (Without asking me if he is in a hurry or if he can cut into my line) The Staff immediately jumped to that guy who obviously came 5-10mins after me. The staff allow him rudely cut into my lines for a long time, without even showing any respect asking me if that is ok. Which makes me looks like a "weak little girl" who can be fooled by these two giant old men in the situation. I hold my madness and remind them "I think it is rude to cut into people's line" I can't believe the staff smiled and said it was very OK because his task is faster. What???!!! So it is ok to sacrifices the time and the right of some customers who seems nicer to serve another customer who seems stronger, madder and came later?!!!  I can't believe I still waited for another 3-5 minutes, but they are still super slow. I was mad and left immediately because I don't want to pay for this rude service. I will never come back again!







If I could give fewer than one star, I would. I went to pick up a package that my son had ordered as a Christmas gift for me which he had directed there to avoid a signature requirement and to maintain a surprise. Despite the fact that my license ID showed the same address as the mailing address, with the same last name as my son, I was not allowed to pick it up--"only he can." He doesn't live here. I guess you can't expect someone managing a fed ex office--David-- to use common sense. I identified the contents of the package, offered to call and have him talk to my son, and yet he couldn't see beyond "policy." To add insult to injury, when I asked him for the number to call for fed ex, he gave me the number for a foreign hotel. Can't even get a phone number correct.

Addendum:  after wasting an hour on this, Fed Ex confirmed by phone that their policy is to allow someone to pick up a package so long as the ID has the same last name OR same address as on package.  Mine had both. Thank you, David, for complying with a non-policy of your own making. Great customer service.







$8.99 for a standard small cardboard box. Are these made of gold? What's with the ripping off FedEx?







I can't say much about this FedEx because I really didn't need much help or do much there.

I came just for a quick drop off. I called ahead because I had always seen the sign but never been able to see the actual store. It's tucked around the back of the building btw.. But I called ahead and spoke to some girl on the phone and she was very understanding and helpful.

When I got there there were signs to help direct to to the store front. Inside, it's not the biggest fedex but it has everything that you need. I can't imagine it gets much of a line either because there was only one person working when I walked in. 

He helped to scan my envelope quickly and get it on its way!

They might deserve more or less stars, but this was the rating the receive based on my experience!







I created an account so I could leave a review here.  The service at this FedEx location is superb!  The staff was friendly, offered helpful shipping advice, and definitely went the extra mile to help get my package shipped.  Whoever was working there in the evening on 11/22/2016 deserves a raise!  I highly recommend this FedEx location!







Thank you for making my shipping experience pleasant! I received very friendly and professional service from this location. They helped me weigh my options for the best way to ship a piece of art. I would highly recommend this location for your shipping needs!







Best fedex center. Highly professional and extremely helpful staff. Great service. Shorter lines as well.







This is by far the best Fedex I've ever been to.  It's in an office complex so you have a super professional helpful staff and much much shorter lines.







They take passport photos...for $14.95 (for two). Not cheap, but there was no wait, and I got my photos in 5 minutes. They location is a bit difficult to find, tucked away with an entrance facing the center of the Palo Alto Square buildings, but I can imagine that it's pretty convenient for all of the office workers to have a service center so close to work. Service was friendly and professional.







This place is tucked into Palo Alto Square. I have come here multiple times for drop off returns (particularly for Zara) and the people that work here are always attentive, super nice, and efficient. They always acknowledge you even if the line is long. Personally, I love that when I drop something off they usually say something like:  "We will take care of the rest." Its a nice personal and responsible touch.







Great customer service, always get the job done.
Russell and Louis both have been very helpful , this is now my primary fedex location







I took the time to drive a package to this ship center on Saturday because I wanted the package to be in San Luis Obispo on Monday morning, and there is no Saturday pick-up from the collection box in my neighborhood. Just learned that the package was sent to Memphis -- and will, hopefully, arrive in SLO 24 hours late. I suspect that the package was put in the wrong pile ("East Coast") by the one individual working in this small ship center on Saturday; will not use this ship center again.







I gave this FedEx a 2-star review last month, but after working with them two or three more times, I'm upping it to a four.

Russell has been fantastically helpful with my various projects - many of them last-minute ones. Once, I needed 40 copies of book printed by 10:30 am the following morning - he told me that their office wouldn't be able to have it done in time and asked if it was alright if he sent the job to the FedEx office on California Ave. He handled everything, I dealt with whatever I needed to straight through him, and all I had to do was pick the books up. He has my CC on file so he sorted out the charges and it all was easy and made sense.

Russell, you've totally changed my mind on your office. Kudos, and good work. I'm definitely going to continue working through you guys.







I have just returned mailing my FedEX package. In a few words it was in & out.
Very courteous, very quick and excellent service. Thank you.

I was in dire need of Fedexing a shipment yesterday and it was past 5pm. I called this store and spoke with Jesse. He informed me that I could drop off as late as 5:45pm and it would be shipped out to L.A. that night. Hooray!!!

I drive down to the movie complex area (AKA Palo Alto Town Square) and drive around the entire thing without seeing the glowing FedEx sign. What the heck!? Where are you FedEx? Finally I park my car and go look at a sign. Building 4 (Closest to El Camino). Ok. 

I run down to building 4 and there, in between 4 & 5, I see FedEx. I step into the store and there is a line, of course, but Jesse asks if I'm just dropping off and takes my envelope from me. Thank you. No need to stand in line. HOORAY!

Thank you Jesse for being so friendly and helpful. Thank you FedEx for taking my package after 4pm. :)







The guys that work here are absolute sweethearts and always greet me with a smile. 

However: Were are your gentlemen manners?!?!?! 

You know your door is super tough to open, especially when I approach in 4" heels and 3 packages weighing around 15 lbs each stacked on my arms and cradled to my chest with my finger tips. Please, one of you three show some old school chivalry and dash around your beloved counter and open this frickin' stubborn obstacle. I can't even push my decent-sized bootie against it since this door opens outward. Yeah, yeah, I know, it's a California earthquake and explosion code requirement. 

So instead you young and capable boys make me do a little balancing act outside like I'm the dial-a-circus and watch me push boxes against the wall while trying to open the door handle with my pinky finger. I get it, it's amusing to watch the blonde struggle, but at some point one of you guys must have that manly instinct to help the female in trouble... This has not been the case in 2009 or so far in 2010, but I'm not giving up hope on you boys! Maybe I'll send a fedex letter to your moms instructing them to teach you some overnight priority manners ;)







This is a great FedEx Office.  The parking is a bit difficult but free.  The staff, especially the manager, are helpful and open. These guys have saved my ass several times.  Rock.







Russell helped me make a large number of copies, and his customer service was fantastic! Everything looked great - it was exactly like I asked for. The turnaround was also quick - I'll definitely be back!







This Fedex location is the best.   I hate to say it and bring crowds, but on the other hand it deserves to thrive.   Everyone at this office is efficient, helpful, and polite.   I have been using this branch since 2004 and have never had a bad experience.   Jesse (sp?) is the greatest but everyone is good.   Also, I have never ever had a delivery problem or a late delivery out of this branch.   No lines, no incompetence--just a pleasure in every way.

I can't believe I'm writing a Yelp review for a FedEx shipping center, but after the service I received tonight, I thought it warranted. This is the first time I've been to this location, and it's tucked away in Palo Alto Square near Page Mill and El Camino. Conveniently, it's open until 8 pm with ample parking (at least in the evening). It also sounds like, given its location and smaller size, it is less busy (meaning shorter wait times/lines). I came around 6:45 pm, and the place was pretty empty, save for a few customers quickly dropping shipments off.I had to pack and ship 10 packages this evening, and Gabe was manning the desk. He was incredibly polite, helpful and patient. I wanted to give some kudos publicly for his really great customer service.

Never go again!!! Especially if you are a female. It's waste of your time, money and your effort! The staff who is a middle-old age guy who was very disrespectful, disorganized, biased and very good at holding a fake smile! He allows random people cut into your line. Although I was in a hurry, I was very nice and smiled to ask him to ship a camera len for me, it took so long for him to find one box which is x10 bigger than I actually need (I wonder if he want to fool me because it cost me more). When a random guy came in, ignored me and asked him to ship a stuff. (Without asking me if he is in a hurry or if he can cut into my line) The Staff immediately jumped to that guy who obviously came 5-10mins after me. The staff allow him rudely cut into my lines for a long time, without even showing any respect asking me if that is ok. Which makes me looks like a "weak little girl" who can be fooled by these two giant old men in the situation. I hold my madness and remind them "I think it is rude to cut into people's line" I can't believe the staff smiled and said it was very OK because his task is faster. What???!!! So it is ok to sacrifices the time and the right of some customers who seems nicer to serve another customer who seems stronger, madder and came later?!!!  I can't believe I still waited for another 3-5 minutes, but they are still super slow. I was mad and left immediately because I don't want to pay for this rude service. I will never come back again!

If I could give fewer than one star, I would. I went to pick up a package that my son had ordered as a Christmas gift for me which he had directed there to avoid a signature requirement and to maintain a surprise. Despite the fact that my license ID showed the same address as the mailing address, with the same last name as my son, I was not allowed to pick it up--"only he can." He doesn't live here. I guess you can't expect someone managing a fed ex office--David-- to use common sense. I identified the contents of the package, offered to call and have him talk to my son, and yet he couldn't see beyond "policy." To add insult to injury, when I asked him for the number to call for fed ex, he gave me the number for a foreign hotel. Can't even get a phone number correct.Addendum:  after wasting an hour on this, Fed Ex confirmed by phone that their policy is to allow someone to pick up a package so long as the ID has the same last name OR same address as on package.  Mine had both. Thank you, David, for complying with a non-policy of your own making. Great customer service.

I can't say much about this FedEx because I really didn't need much help or do much there.I came just for a quick drop off. I called ahead because I had always seen the sign but never been able to see the actual store. It's tucked around the back of the building btw.. But I called ahead and spoke to some girl on the phone and she was very understanding and helpful.When I got there there were signs to help direct to to the store front. Inside, it's not the biggest fedex but it has everything that you need. I can't imagine it gets much of a line either because there was only one person working when I walked in. He helped to scan my envelope quickly and get it on its way!They might deserve more or less stars, but this was the rating the receive based on my experience!

They take passport photos...for $14.95 (for two). Not cheap, but there was no wait, and I got my photos in 5 minutes. They location is a bit difficult to find, tucked away with an entrance facing the center of the Palo Alto Square buildings, but I can imagine that it's pretty convenient for all of the office workers to have a service center so close to work. Service was friendly and professional.

I gave this FedEx a 2-star review last month, but after working with them two or three more times, I'm upping it to a four.Russell has been fantastically helpful with my various projects - many of them last-minute ones. Once, I needed 40 copies of book printed by 10:30 am the following morning - he told me that their office wouldn't be able to have it done in time and asked if it was alright if he sent the job to the FedEx office on California Ave. He handled everything, I dealt with whatever I needed to straight through him, and all I had to do was pick the books up. He has my CC on file so he sorted out the charges and it all was easy and made sense.Russell, you've totally changed my mind on your office. Kudos, and good work. I'm definitely going to continue working through you guys.

I really wanted to give this place lots of stars, but they misinformed me and caused me some stress. I called them at 4pm on a Tuesday, asking if it would be possible to print 500 pages that day. They told me that if I e-mailed the file to them, they could have it printed within the half hour. I e-mailed it and didn't hear anything back, so I called again about 40 minutes later. They hadn't even checked the e-mail and made me give them all the info (type of paper, color print, number of copies) verbally over the phone, even though I had just e-mailed it to them. He said no problem again and we hung up.Fifteen minutes later, I got an e-mail saying that they would need a deposit before they began the job, and asked for my credit card info - why didn't they specify that to start with? I called them again to give the info and again, I asked how long it would take. He said they wouldn't even be able to START printing it for another 45 minutes. Ridiculous.I had our intern pick up the printouts this morning when they opened and it all ended up being fine, but they lost a lot of stars from me for poor communication.

I was in dire need of Fedexing a shipment yesterday and it was past 5pm. I called this store and spoke with Jesse. He informed me that I could drop off as late as 5:45pm and it would be shipped out to L.A. that night. Hooray!!!I drive down to the movie complex area (AKA Palo Alto Town Square) and drive around the entire thing without seeing the glowing FedEx sign. What the heck!? Where are you FedEx? Finally I park my car and go look at a sign. Building 4 (Closest to El Camino). Ok. I run down to building 4 and there, in between 4 & 5, I see FedEx. I step into the store and there is a line, of course, but Jesse asks if I'm just dropping off and takes my envelope from me. Thank you. No need to stand in line. HOORAY!Thank you Jesse for being so friendly and helpful. Thank you FedEx for taking my package after 4pm. :)

The guys that work here are absolute sweethearts and always greet me with a smile. However: Were are your gentlemen manners?!?!?! You know your door is super tough to open, especially when I approach in 4" heels and 3 packages weighing around 15 lbs each stacked on my arms and cradled to my chest with my finger tips. Please, one of you three show some old school chivalry and dash around your beloved counter and open this frickin' stubborn obstacle. I can't even push my decent-sized bootie against it since this door opens outward. Yeah, yeah, I know, it's a California earthquake and explosion code requirement. So instead you young and capable boys make me do a little balancing act outside like I'm the dial-a-circus and watch me push boxes against the wall while trying to open the door handle with my pinky finger. I get it, it's amusing to watch the blonde struggle, but at some point one of you guys must have that manly instinct to help the female in trouble... This has not been the case in 2009 or so far in 2010, but I'm not giving up hope on you boys! Maybe I'll send a fedex letter to your moms instructing them to teach you some overnight priority manners ;)

This is a great FedEx Office.  The parking is a bit difficult but free.  The staff, especially the manager, are helpful and open. These guys have saved my ass several times.  Rock.

This Fedex location is the best.   I hate to say it and bring crowds, but on the other hand it deserves to thrive.   Everyone at this office is efficient, helpful, and polite.   I have been using this branch since 2004 and have never had a bad experience.   Jesse (sp?) is the greatest but everyone is good.   Also, I have never ever had a delivery problem or a late delivery out of this branch.   No lines, no incompetence--just a pleasure in every way.

FedEx expects 'material' financial impact from Petya cyber attack
Shares of FedEx Corp.  fell 0.8% in premarket trade Monday, after the package delivery giant said it expects a "material" financial impact from the Petya cyber attack on its TNT Express business, as the systems that were affected may not be fully recovered. The company said it does not have cyber or other insurance in place that covers the attack. "Although we cannot currently quantify the amounts, we have experienced loss of revenue due to decreased volumes at TNT Express and incremental costs associated with the implementation of contingency plans and the remediation of affected systems," FedEx said in a statement. " In addition to financial consequences, the cyber-attack may materially impact our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting in future periods." The company said TNT Express customers are still experiencing widespread service delays. The stock has climbed 18.1% over the past three months through Friday, while the Dow Jones Transporation Average  has climbed 8.4% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average  has gained 4.9%.

FedEx's TNT Express was 'significantly' disrupted by a virus
FedEx Corp.  said Wednesday that its TNT Express subsidiary was "significantly affected" by an information systems "virus." The package delivery giant said that while TNT's operations and communications systems were disrupted by the virus, it is not aware of any data breach. TNT Express had revenue of $1.91 billion in fiscal 2017, representing 12.2% of FedEx's total revenue of $15.7 billion. FedEx's stock has resumed trade after a halt, and was up 0.8% in midday trade. It has climbed 16% year to date, while the Dow Jones Transportation Average  has gained 5.3% and the S&P 500  has advanced 9.0%.

Shares of FedEx rise as company swings to quarterly profit
Shares of FedEx Corp.  rose nearly 2% late Tuesday after the logistics company reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and sales above Wall Street expectations. FedEx said it earned $1.02 billion, or $3.75 a share, in the fourth quarter, versus a loss of $70 million, or 26 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Adjusted for one-time items, FedEx earned $1.15 billion, or $4.25 a share, in the quarter, compared with $897 million a year ago. Sales rose to $15.7 billion, from $13 billion a year ago. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected FedEx to report adjusted earnings of $3.87 on sales of $15.6 billion for the quarter. Operating results benefitted from higher base rates and higher package volume, the company said. The company said it was unable to provide GAAP fiscal 2018 earnings guidance because of pension-related adjustments. Shares of FedEx ended the regular trading session down 0.7%.

Importer Security Filing
Importer Security Filing and Additional Carrier Requirements (commonly referred to as ISF or "10+2") is now a critical regulatory prerequisite for your vessel imports. The rule mandates that ISF importers or their authorized agents supply CBP with 10 additional data elements and that ocean carriers supply an additional 2 data sets for ocean cargo other than foreign cargo remaining on board (FROB), immediate exportation (IE), transportation and exportation (T&E) or foreign trade zone (FTZ). This information must be submitted 24 hours prior to vessel loading in the foreign port and must be filed by the Automated Broker Interface (ABI) or AMS (Automated Manifest System). Established importers can use our web-based system to self file.

FedEx Corporation is an American multinational courier delivery services company headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee.[2] The name "FedEx" is a syllabic abbreviation of the name of the company's original air division, Federal Express (now FedEx Express), which was used from 1973 until 2000. The company is known for its overnight shipping service, but also for pioneering a system that could track packages and provide real-time updates on package location (to help in finding lost packages), a feature that has now been implemented by most other carrier services.[3]

History[edit]
For the history of Federal Express, see FedEx Express.




Fedex's first van displayed at the FedEx World Headquarters


FedEx Corporation is an import/export company, incorporated October 2, 1997, in Delaware.[4] FDX Corporation was founded in January 1998 with the acquisition of Caliber System Inc. by Federal Express. With the purchase of Caliber, FedEx started offering other services besides express shipping. Caliber subsidiaries included RPS, a small-package ground service; Roberts Express, an expedited shipping provider; Viking Freight, a regional, less than truckload freight carrier serving the Western United States; Caribbean Transportation Services, a provider of airfreight forwarding between the United States and the Caribbean; and Caliber Logistics and Caliber Technology, providers of logistics and technology solutions. FDX Corporation was founded to oversee all of the operations of those companies and its original air division, Federal Express.[5]
In the 1990s, FedEx Ground planned, but later abandoned, a joint service with British Airways to have BA fly a Concorde supersonic jet airliner to Shannon, Ireland with FedEx packages on board, and then FedEx would have flown the packages subsonically to their delivery points in Europe. Ron Ponder, a vice president at the time, was in charge of this proposed venture.

In January 2000, FDX Corporation changed its name to FedEx Corporation and re-branded all of its subsidiaries. Federal Express became FedEx Express, RPS became FedEx Ground, Roberts Express became FedEx Custom Critical, and Caliber Logistics and Caliber Technology were combined to comprise FedEx Global Logistics. A new subsidiary, called FedEx Corporate Services, was formed to centralize the sales, marketing, and customer service for all of the subsidiaries. In February 2000, FedEx acquired Tower Group International, an international logistics company. FedEx also acquired WorldTariff, a customs duty and tax information company; TowerGroup and WorldTariff were re-branded to form FedEx Trade Networks.[5]
FedEx Corp. acquired privately held Kinko's, Inc. in February 2004 and re-branded it FedEx Kinko's. The acquisition was made to expand FedEx's retail access to the general public. After the acquisition, all FedEx Kinko's locations exclusively offered only FedEx shipping.[5] In June 2008, FedEx announced that they would be dropping the Kinko's name from their ship centers; FedEx Kinko's would now be called FedEx Office.[6][7] In September 2004, FedEx acquired Parcel Direct, a parcel consolidator, and re-branded it FedEx SmartPost.[5]
In December 2007, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service "tentatively decided" the FedEx Ground Division might be facing a tax liability of $319 million for 2002, due to misclassification of its operatives as independent contractors. Reversing a 1994 decision which allowed FedEx to classify its operatives that own their own vehicles as independent contractors, the IRS audited the years 2003 to 2006, with a view to assessing whether similar misclassification of operatives had taken place. FedEx denied that any irregularities in classification had occurred, but faced legal action from operatives claiming benefits that would have accrued had they been classified as employees.[8]
In June 2009, FedEx began a campaign against United Parcel Service (UPS) and the Teamsters union, accusing its competitor of receiving a bailout in an advertising campaign called "Brown Bailout". FedEx claimed that signing the Federal Aviation Administration re-authorization bill, which would let some of its workers unionize more easily (and, according to the Memphis-based company, "could expose [its] customers at any time to local work stoppages that interrupted the flow of their time-sensitive, high-value shipments”),[9] was equivalent to giving UPS a "bailout". Independent observers heavily criticized FedEx's wording,[9] claiming that it was "an abuse of the term".[9] FedEx Express employees are regulated under the Railway Labor Act.[10]
On January 14, 2013, FedEx named Henry Maier CEO and President of FedEx Ground, to take effect after David Rebholz retired on May 31, 2013.[11] On July 17, 2014, FedEx was indicted for conspiracy to distribute controlled substances in cooperation with the Chhabra-Smoley Organization and Superior Drugs.[12] According to the U.S. Department of Justice, "FedEx is alleged to have knowingly and intentionally conspired to distribute controlled substances and prescription drugs, including Phendimetrazine (Schedule III); Ambien, Phentermine, Diazepam, and Alprazolam (Schedule IV), to customers who had no legitimate medical need for them based on invalid prescriptions issued by doctors who were acting outside the usual course of professional practice."[13] A representative for the company contested these claims, stating that it would violate personal rights of customers to deny service and that "We are a transportation company — we are not law enforcement".[14] On July 17, 2016 the Department of Justice U.S. Attorney's Office confirmed in a statement that it had asked U.S. District Court Judge Charles Breyer to dismiss the indictment but also did not say why.[15][16][17]
In April 2015, FedEx acquired their rival firm TNT Express for €4.4 billion ($4.8 billion; £3.2 billion) as it looks to expand their operations in Europe.[18][19]
Operating units and logos[edit]
FedEx is organized into operating units, each of which has its own version of the wordmark designed in 1994 by Lindon Leader of Landor Associates, of San Francisco.[20] The Fed is always purple and the Ex is in a different color for each division and platinum for the overall corporation use. The original FedEx logo had the Ex in orange; it is now used as the FedEx Express wordmark. The FedEx wordmark is notable for containing a subliminal right-pointing arrow in the negative space between the "E" and the "X", which was achieved by designing a proprietary font, based on Univers and Futura, to emphasize the arrow shape.[20] In August 2016, FedEx announced that all operating units will switch over to the purple and orange color logo over the next 5 years.

SCAC codes[edit]
The Standard Carrier Alpha Code (SCAC) is a unique code used to identify transportation companies. It is typically two to four alphabetic letters long. It was developed by the National Motor Freight Traffic Association in the 1960s to help the transportation industry for computerizing data and records. FedEx's codes include:

FDE – FedEx Express
FDEG – FedEx Ground
FXFE – FedEx Freight
FDCC – FedEx Custom Critical
FXO - FedEx Office
FSDC- FedEx Same Day City

Political donations and lobbying[edit]
According to the Center for Responsive Politics, FedEx Corp is the 21st largest campaign contributor in the United States. The company has donated over $21 million since 1990, 45% of which went to Democrats and 55% to Republicans. Strong ties to the White House and members of Congress allow access to international trade and tax cut rebates as well as the rules of the business practices of the United States Postal Service. In 2001, FedEx sealed a $9 billion deal with the USPS to transport all of the post office's overnight and express deliveries.[28]
In 2005, FedEx was among 53 entities that contributed the maximum of $250,000 to sponsor the second inauguration of President George W. Bush.[29][30][31]
During the first three months of 2010, FedEx spent nearly $4.9 million lobbying the federal government (UPS, FedEx's main competitor, spent $1.6 million on lobbying over the same period), a 4% increase from the $4.7 million spent during the last quarter of 2009, but more than twice what it spent on lobbying during the first quarter of 2009.[32]
Awards and honors[edit]
The firm was named by Fortune magazine as one of the top 100 companies to work for in 2013, citing the company's choice to downsize with voluntary buyouts rather than involuntary layoffs.[33]
Advertising[edit]
Some of FedEx's ad campaigns:[34]

"When it Absolutely, Positively has to be there overnight" – 1978–1983
"It's not Just a Package, It's Your Business" – 1987–1988

John Moschitta ad[edit]




FedExForum in Memphis, Tennessee.


In 1981, their advertising firm Ally & Gargano hired performer John Moschitta, Jr., known for his fast speech delivery, to do an ad for Federal Express titled "Fast Paced World". This single commercial would be cited years later by New York as one of the most memorable ads ever.[35]
Motorsports[edit]

From 1997 to 2002, FedEx was the title sponsor of Champ Car World Series when it was known as CART. The series was known as the "CART FedEx Championship Series", which led to the official "Champ Car" designation in reference to the fact they were the FedEx Championship.
FedEx became the sponsor of the No. 11 NASCAR Sprint Cup Toyota owned by Joe Gibbs Racing and driven by Mike Bliss, Jason Leffler and Denny Hamlin in 2005. FedEx uses four (predominantly black) paint schemes to showcase its different products (Express, Freight, Ground, and Office), and in 2005 also ran a special scheme to promote a charity event at the FedEx St. Jude Classic golf tournament. The 11 car has been driven on a permanent basis by Hamlin since 2006.
FedEx previously sponsored the Formula One team McLaren. Prior to that FedEx had sponsored Ferrari, Benetton, and Williams F1. FedEx does not currently sponsor any F1 team.

Football[edit]

From 1989 to 2010, FedEx was the title sponsor of the Orange Bowl, played in Miami, Florida.[36]

FedEx Corporation is an American multinational courier delivery services company headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee.[2] The name "FedEx" is a syllabic abbreviation of the name of the company's original air division, Federal Express (now FedEx Express), which was used from 1973 until 2000. The company is known for its overnight shipping service, but also for pioneering a system that could track packages and provide real-time updates on package location (to help in finding lost packages), a feature that has now been implemented by most other carrier services.[3]

History[edit]
For the history of Federal Express, see FedEx Express.




Fedex's first van displayed at the FedEx World Headquarters


FedEx Corporation is an import/export company, incorporated October 2, 1997, in Delaware.[4] FDX Corporation was founded in January 1998 with the acquisition of Caliber System Inc. by Federal Express. With the purchase of Caliber, FedEx started offering other services besides express shipping. Caliber subsidiaries included RPS, a small-package ground service; Roberts Express, an expedited shipping provider; Viking Freight, a regional, less than truckload freight carrier serving the Western United States; Caribbean Transportation Services, a provider of airfreight forwarding between the United States and the Caribbean; and Caliber Logistics and Caliber Technology, providers of logistics and technology solutions. FDX Corporation was founded to oversee all of the operations of those companies and its original air division, Federal Express.[5]
In the 1990s, FedEx Ground planned, but later abandoned, a joint service with British Airways to have BA fly a Concorde supersonic jet airliner to Shannon, Ireland with FedEx packages on board, and then FedEx would have flown the packages subsonically to their delivery points in Europe. Ron Ponder, a vice president at the time, was in charge of this proposed venture.

In January 2000, FDX Corporation changed its name to FedEx Corporation and re-branded all of its subsidiaries. Federal Express became FedEx Express, RPS became FedEx Ground, Roberts Express became FedEx Custom Critical, and Caliber Logistics and Caliber Technology were combined to comprise FedEx Global Logistics. A new subsidiary, called FedEx Corporate Services, was formed to centralize the sales, marketing, and customer service for all of the subsidiaries. In February 2000, FedEx acquired Tower Group International, an international logistics company. FedEx also acquired WorldTariff, a customs duty and tax information company; TowerGroup and WorldTariff were re-branded to form FedEx Trade Networks.[5]
FedEx Corp. acquired privately held Kinko's, Inc. in February 2004 and re-branded it FedEx Kinko's. The acquisition was made to expand FedEx's retail access to the general public. After the acquisition, all FedEx Kinko's locations exclusively offered only FedEx shipping.[5] In June 2008, FedEx announced that they would be dropping the Kinko's name from their ship centers; FedEx Kinko's would now be called FedEx Office.[6][7] In September 2004, FedEx acquired Parcel Direct, a parcel consolidator, and re-branded it FedEx SmartPost.[5]
In December 2007, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service "tentatively decided" the FedEx Ground Division might be facing a tax liability of $319 million for 2002, due to misclassification of its operatives as independent contractors. Reversing a 1994 decision which allowed FedEx to classify its operatives that own their own vehicles as independent contractors, the IRS audited the years 2003 to 2006, with a view to assessing whether similar misclassification of operatives had taken place. FedEx denied that any irregularities in classification had occurred, but faced legal action from operatives claiming benefits that would have accrued had they been classified as employees.[8]
In June 2009, FedEx began a campaign against United Parcel Service (UPS) and the Teamsters union, accusing its competitor of receiving a bailout in an advertising campaign called "Brown Bailout". FedEx claimed that signing the Federal Aviation Administration re-authorization bill, which would let some of its workers unionize more easily (and, according to the Memphis-based company, "could expose [its] customers at any time to local work stoppages that interrupted the flow of their time-sensitive, high-value shipments”),[9] was equivalent to giving UPS a "bailout". Independent observers heavily criticized FedEx's wording,[9] claiming that it was "an abuse of the term".[9] FedEx Express employees are regulated under the Railway Labor Act.[10]
On January 14, 2013, FedEx named Henry Maier CEO and President of FedEx Ground, to take effect after David Rebholz retired on May 31, 2013.[11] On July 17, 2014, FedEx was indicted for conspiracy to distribute controlled substances in cooperation with the Chhabra-Smoley Organization and Superior Drugs.[12] According to the U.S. Department of Justice, "FedEx is alleged to have knowingly and intentionally conspired to distribute controlled substances and prescription drugs, including Phendimetrazine (Schedule III); Ambien, Phentermine, Diazepam, and Alprazolam (Schedule IV), to customers who had no legitimate medical need for them based on invalid prescriptions issued by doctors who were acting outside the usual course of professional practice."[13] A representative for the company contested these claims, stating that it would violate personal rights of customers to deny service and that "We are a transportation company — we are not law enforcement".[14] On July 17, 2016 the Department of Justice U.S. Attorney's Office confirmed in a statement that it had asked U.S. District Court Judge Charles Breyer to dismiss the indictment but also did not say why.[15][16][17]
In April 2015, FedEx acquired their rival firm TNT Express for €4.4 billion ($4.8 billion; £3.2 billion) as it looks to expand their operations in Europe.[18][19]
Operating units and logos[edit]
FedEx is organized into operating units, each of which has its own version of the wordmark designed in 1994 by Lindon Leader of Landor Associates, of San Francisco.[20] The Fed is always purple and the Ex is in a different color for each division and platinum for the overall corporation use. The original FedEx logo had the Ex in orange; it is now used as the FedEx Express wordmark. The FedEx wordmark is notable for containing a subliminal right-pointing arrow in the negative space between the "E" and the "X", which was achieved by designing a proprietary font, based on Univers and Futura, to emphasize the arrow shape.[20] In August 2016, FedEx announced that all operating units will switch over to the purple and orange color logo over the next 5 years.

SCAC codes[edit]
The Standard Carrier Alpha Code (SCAC) is a unique code used to identify transportation companies. It is typically two to four alphabetic letters long. It was developed by the National Motor Freight Traffic Association in the 1960s to help the transportation industry for computerizing data and records. FedEx's codes include:

FDE – FedEx Express
FDEG – FedEx Ground
FXFE – FedEx Freight
FDCC – FedEx Custom Critical
FXO - FedEx Office
FSDC- FedEx Same Day City

Political donations and lobbying[edit]
According to the Center for Responsive Politics, FedEx Corp is the 21st largest campaign contributor in the United States. The company has donated over $21 million since 1990, 45% of which went to Democrats and 55% to Republicans. Strong ties to the White House and members of Congress allow access to international trade and tax cut rebates as well as the rules of the business practices of the United States Postal Service. In 2001, FedEx sealed a $9 billion deal with the USPS to transport all of the post office's overnight and express deliveries.[28]
In 2005, FedEx was among 53 entities that contributed the maximum of $250,000 to sponsor the second inauguration of President George W. Bush.[29][30][31]
During the first three months of 2010, FedEx spent nearly $4.9 million lobbying the federal government (UPS, FedEx's main competitor, spent $1.6 million on lobbying over the same period), a 4% increase from the $4.7 million spent during the last quarter of 2009, but more than twice what it spent on lobbying during the first quarter of 2009.[32]
Awards and honors[edit]
The firm was named by Fortune magazine as one of the top 100 companies to work for in 2013, citing the company's choice to downsize with voluntary buyouts rather than involuntary layoffs.[33]
Advertising[edit]
Some of FedEx's ad campaigns:[34]

"When it Absolutely, Positively has to be there overnight" – 1978–1983
"It's not Just a Package, It's Your Business" – 1987–1988
"Our Most Important Package is Yours" – 1991–1994
"Absolutely, Positively Anytime" – 1995
"The Way the World Works," 1996–1998
"Be Absolutely Sure," 1998–2000
"This is a Job for FedEx," 2001–2002
"Don’t worry, there's a FedEx for that,” 2002–2003
"Relax, it’s FedEx," 2004–2008
"The World On Time" 2001–present
"We Understand," 2009–present
"We Live To Deliver" 2009–present

John Moschitta ad[edit]




FedExForum in Memphis, Tennessee.


In 1981, their advertising firm Ally & Gargano hired performer John Moschitta, Jr., known for his fast speech delivery, to do an ad for Federal Express titled "Fast Paced World". This single commercial would be cited years later by New York as one of the most memorable ads ever.[35]
Motorsports[edit]

From 1997 to 2002, FedEx was the title sponsor of Champ Car World Series when it was known as CART. The series was known as the "CART FedEx Championship Series", which led to the official "Champ Car" designation in reference to the fact they were the FedEx Championship.
FedEx became the sponsor of the No. 11 NASCAR Sprint Cup Toyota owned by Joe Gibbs Racing and driven by Mike Bliss, Jason Leffler and Denny Hamlin in 2005. FedEx uses four (predominantly black) paint schemes to showcase its different products (Express, Freight, Ground, and Office), and in 2005 also ran a special scheme to promote a charity event at the FedEx St. Jude Classic golf tournament. The 11 car has been driven on a permanent basis by Hamlin since 2006.
FedEx previously sponsored the Formula One team McLaren. Prior to that FedEx had sponsored Ferrari, Benetton, and Williams F1. FedEx does not currently sponsor any F1 team.

Football[edit]

From 1989 to 2010, FedEx was the title sponsor of the Orange Bowl, played in Miami, Florida.[36]
FedExField, home of the National Football League's Washington Redskins in Landover, Maryland[37]

Other sports[edit]

FedEx sponsors FedExForum, home of the NBA's Memphis Grizzlies and the University of Memphis men's basketball team.[38]
FedEx sponsors the Heineken Cup in Rugby [39]
Beginning in 2007, FedEx became the title sponsor of the FedEx Cup, a championship trophy for the PGA Tour.[40]
FedEx is the Main Sponsor of the UEFA Europa League since 2015.

Shipping FAQs

Does FedEx offer weekend delivery?

FedEx Express® offers Saturday delivery options to most metropolitan postal codes. Select the Saturday delivery option and then select FedEx Priority Overnight® service if you will ship the package on Friday or FedEx 2Day® if you will ship the package on Thursday. The shipper must select the Saturday Delivery special handling option at the time of shipment.
FedEx Home Delivery® offers standard Saturday delivery to residential addresses and may deliver on Saturdays depending on the transit time from origin to destination.
A Saturday delivery surcharge will apply to FedEx Express® shipments.
FedEx Freight® does not offer regular weekend delivery, but if a weekend delivery is needed, contact customer service at 1.866.393.4585 for available options. Using one of our online tools is the best way to determine transit times for your shipments. Follow one of our links to find the service that best fits your needs.

FedEx SameDay® and FedEx® International Next Flight provide same-day service in the shortest time possible. Call 1.800.GoFedEx 1.800.463.3339 for availability and rate.
If the Saturday Delivery special handling option is not selected, a shipment sent overnight on Friday will be delivered the next business day: Monday. If the Saturday Delivery special handling option is not selected, a shipment sent via FedEx 2Day on Thursday will be delivered the second business day: Monday.
Guide to Services



What are my choices for overnight delivery?

Recognizing your deadlines can vary day to day, FedEx provides three overnight delivery options: FedEx First Overnight® by 8, 8:30, 9 or 10 a.m. the next business day; FedEx Priority Overnight® by 10:30 a.m. the next business day; and FedEx Standard Overnight® by 3 p.m. to most areas and by 4:30 p.m. to some rural areas (by 8 p.m. to residences) the next business day. The latter is a cost-effective choice if you can wait for afternoon delivery.
In some cases, FedEx Ground®, FedEx Home Delivery® and FedEx Freight® may provide overnight service depending on locations and distances involved. For specific delivery commitments based on your shipment's origin and destination, please see our Get Rates & Transit Times application.



How do I determine the address my package was delivered to?

If you have the package tracking number, you can access delivery city information and signature information if a signature was obtained.
If you need the detailed delivery information (includes address), you can obtain a Signature Proof of Delivery online by using your tracking number and the shipper's or payer’s account number.



Is it possible to change the service type or delivery speed of a package once I have already sent it?

Generally, it is not possible to change the service commitment of the shipment once it has been shipped.



How I cancel a shipment I created online?

Shipments can be cancelled in FedEx Ship Manager® at fedex.com’s Ship History. Log into FedEx Ship Manager® at fedex.com and click on the Ship History tab. Select the shipment and click on the Cancel button.



I lost the label I printed. Can I reprint it?

FedEx Ship Manager® at fedex.com allows you to reprint shipping labels and/or international documentation. FedEx labels and documents may be reprinted up to 12 hours after they are processed, or until midnight local time (whichever comes first). Click on the Ship History tab, select the shipment, and click on the Reprint button.



Can I get a copy of the delivery signature?

You can get a copy of the recipient's signature on your FedEx Express® or FedEx Ground® shipment by using our Signature Proof of Delivery tool. Proof of delivery is offered for most packages shipped within the U.S., to Canada and to Puerto Rico. Shipment delivery signatures from other international locations are not available at this time.



How do I change the delivery address on my shipment?

If you are the shipper, you may contact FedEx Customer Service at 1.800.GoFedEx 1.800.463.3339 to change the delivery address. Please see the FedEx Service Guide for more information concerning this service and applicable fees.
If you are the intended recipient of the package and you wish to provide additional information about the delivery address (example, add a suite or apartment number), you may contact FedEx Customer Service at 1.800.GoFedEx 1.800.463.3339. If you are the intended recipient and want the shipment delivered to a new address, contact the package's shipper and request the change of address.
You may request your package be held for pickup at your nearby FedEx Office location. For FedEx Express® packages, you may also request the package be held at the delivery station.
FedEx Locations



I've shipped a package, when will FedEx deliver?

Track the status of your package on fedex.com using your tracking number and look for the Estimated Delivery Date. We are unable to specify an exact delivery time. Typically deliveries occur during normal business hours and depend on service selected.
If you do not have your tracking number, contact the shipper to obtain the tracking number. Customer service may be able to find your shipment information if you are unable to get your tracking number from the shipper. Contact us at 1.800.GoFedEx 1.800.463.3339.

Freight Delivery Maps



What is the difference between FedEx Express® and FedEx Ground®?

FedEx Express® lets you choose from several different services so you can pick the delivery time that fits your degree of urgency. It's for shippers with high-value or time-critical shipments who need to plan on fast delivery on a specific day, by a specific time. FedEx Ground® service is a ground service for shipments that don't need the speed of express shipping. You receive reliable delivery for packages up to 150 lbs., with the precise date of delivery based on distance from origin to destination.



How do I ship collect or C.O.D.?

For specific C.O.D. information, go to our Guide to Services and select the Collect on Delivery (C.O.D.) Service option.



How do I specify a time window for delivery?

FedEx has a variety of shipping options:

For FedEx Express® shipments, we offer several services that provide delivery by a certain time. Select the service that delivers by your specified time. 
For FedEx Ground® shipments, we deliver by the end of business day on the scheduled delivery day. 
For FedEx Home Delivery® shipments, we deliver between 9 a.m. and 8 p.m., Monday through Saturday. If your recipient wishes to schedule a specific time frame for delivery, you can select one of our convenient delivery options: FedEx Evening Home Delivery® or FedEx Appointment Home Delivery®. 
FedEx Freight offers a range of time-definite options — for both FedEx Freight® Priority and FedEx Freight® Economy shipments. No matter which service you choose, you can ship with confidence, knowing your freight shipment will get the special attention and handling it deserves. 

Please see our Get Rates & Transit Times application to explore our delivery options.



What are your delivery hours?

Delivery days and times vary by service type:

FedEx Express®: Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. (and Saturday 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. with Saturday Delivery special handling option) 
FedEx Ground®: Monday through Friday by end of day. 
FedEx Home Delivery®: Tuesday through Saturday by end of day. 

Please note, specific delivery times may vary by location, especially for rural areas.



Are FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight shipments backed by a money-back guarantee?

Yes! You can request a refund or credit of your transportation charges for FedEx Express and FedEx Ground shipments, if your shipments within the U.S. do not arrive by the end of the scheduled delivery day, as published on this website. For more information, please visit the money-back guarantee section of the Terms and Conditions.

I don't understand the route my shipment is taking. The city where my shipment is being scanned doesn't appear to be on the correct route. Should I be concerned?

Shipments may move through regional sorting locations before arriving at the delivery destination. Often times this may not appear to be the most direct route from the pickup location to the delivery destination.

I'm expecting a package, when will it arrive?

FedEx Locations



I wasn't home when FedEx tried to deliver my package, now what can I do?

For packages not requiring a signature for release, our drivers will leave the package at a recipient's door, or other secure location, if the driver believes it is reasonable to do so.
In most cases, FedEx will attempt to deliver your package three times before returning to the shipper.
When the driver is unable to leave your package, they will leave a door tag on your door, informing you of the delivery attempt. The door tag contains information that may offer you the option to sign the door tag and have the driver leave your package in a secure location on the next delivery attempt, typically the next business day.
If signing the door tag is not possible because the shipper has requested an in-person, direct signature, you may request your package be held for pickup at your nearby FedEx Office location. For FedEx Express® packages, you may also request the package be held at the delivery station.



I won't be able to sign for my package, what can I do?

For packages not requiring a signature for release, our drivers will leave the package at a recipient's door, or other secure location, if the driver believes it is reasonable to do so. If your package was shipped with the Indirect Signature Release option, you may leave a signed and dated handwritten note on the door instructing the driver to leave the package at your door.
When the driver is unable to leave your package, they will leave a door tag on your door, informing you of the delivery attempt. The door tag contains information that may offer you the option to sign the door tag and have the driver leave your package in a secure location on the next delivery attempt, typically the next business day.
If signing the door dag is not possible because the shipper has requested an in-person, direct signature, you may request your package be held for pickup at your nearby FedEx Office location. For FedEx Express® packages, you may also request the package be held at the delivery station. Click here for FedEx Locations.



How do I determine the address my package was delivered to?

If you have the package tracking number, you can access delivery city information and signature information if a signature was obtained. Track your package.
If you need the detailed delivery information (includes address), you can obtain a Signature Proof of Delivery online by using your tracking number and the shipper's or payer’s account number.



Can I get a copy of the delivery signature?

You can get a copy of the recipient's signature on your FedEx Express® or FedEx Ground® shipment by using our Signature Proof of Delivery tool. Proof of delivery is offered for most packages shipped within the U.S., to Canada and to Puerto Rico. Shipment delivery signatures from other international locations are not available at this time.



How do I specify a time window for delivery?

FedEx has a variety of shipping options:

For FedEx Express® shipments, we offer several services that provide delivery by a certain time. Select the service that delivers by your specified time. 
For FedEx Ground® shipments, we deliver by the end of business day on the scheduled delivery day.

FedEx Freight offers a range of time-definite options — for both FedEx Freight® Priority and FedEx Freight® Economy shipments. No matter which service you choose, you can ship with confidence, knowing your freight shipment will get the special attention and handling it deserves.

Please see our Get Rates & Transit Times application to explore our delivery options.



My package was supposed to be here, but it has not arrived. What can I do?

A good first step is to track the status of your package using your FedEx tracking number. The tracking number enables us to provide you with your package's most up-to-date tracking information. If the tracking results do not answer your question, your next step can be to contact FedEx for further assistance.
If you do not have your tracking number, contact the shipper to obtain the tracking number. FedEx Customer Service may be able to find your shipment information if you are unable to get your tracking number from the shipper. Contact us at 1.800.GoFedEx 1.800.463.3339.
Information about your package 
The tracking detail page provides detailed information about your shipment, including your shipment's current status and estimated delivery date. Delivery days and times vary by service type:

FedEx Express®: Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. (and Saturday with Saturday Delivery special handling option) 
FedEx Ground®: Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. 
FedEx Home Delivery®: Tuesday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturday, 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. 

If the tracking page indicates you shipment is on time, use the estimated delivery date as a guide to when your shipment will arrive.



I tracked my shipment, and there haven't been scans on it in more than a day. What should I do?

Packages in the FedEx system receive scans at various points between pickup and delivery. It is not unusual for a package to go more than 24 hours without a scan while in transit – your package may be traveling as intended.



I tracked my shipment, and it appears there is a customs or clearance delay. What should I do?

Customs and clearance delays occur for a variety of reasons. If additional information is required from the shipper or recipient, FedEx will attempt to contact them.



I tracked my shipment, and there are no scans. What should I do?

If there are no scans for the tracking number entered, contact your shipper to verify the tracking number is correct. If you are the shipper, and it has been more than 24 hours since you dropped off the shipment or had the shipment picked up, please contact us at 1.800.GoFedEx 1.800.463.3339.



What are your delivery hours?

Delivery days and times vary by service type:

FedEx Express®: Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. (and Saturday with Saturday Delivery special handling option) 
FedEx Ground®: Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. 
FedEx Home Delivery®: Tuesday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturday, 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. 

Please note, specific delivery times may vary by location, especially for rural areas.



I don't understand the route my shipment is taking. The city where my shipment is being scanned doesn't appear to be on the correct route. Should I be concerned?

Shipments may move through regional sorting locations before arriving at the delivery destination. Often times this may not appear to be the most direct route from the pickup location to the delivery destination.



When I first tracked the package, it had an estimated delivery date, and now there isn't one. What does this mean?

We are able to provide the estimated delivery date information for many of our shipments. When the shipment encounters a delay or an exception in handling, we may not be able to accurately state when we expect the package to be delivered.



What does the "status of exception code" mean?

This is information noting that there was an exception to the traditional in-person courier delivery. For example, perhaps no one was at the destination address so the package was left with a neighbor or front desk, or it was not left and delivery will be reattempted, or it was left without a signature because we had prior approval from the sender or recipient to do so.

FedEx Corporation is an American multinational courier delivery services company headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee.[2] The name "FedEx" is a syllabic abbreviation of the name of the company's original air division, Federal Express (now FedEx Express), which was used from 1973 until 2000. The company is known for its overnight shipping service, but also for pioneering a system that could track packages and provide real-time updates on package location (to help in finding lost packages), a feature that has now been implemented by most other carrier services.[3]

History[edit]
For the history of Federal Express, see FedEx Express.




Fedex's first van displayed at the FedEx World Headquarters


FedEx Corporation is an import/export company, incorporated October 2, 1997, in Delaware.[4] FDX Corporation was founded in January 1998 with the acquisition of Caliber System Inc. by Federal Express. With the purchase of Caliber, FedEx started offering other services besides express shipping. Caliber subsidiaries included RPS, a small-package ground service; Roberts Express, an expedited shipping provider; Viking Freight, a regional, less than truckload freight carrier serving the Western United States; Caribbean Transportation Services, a provider of airfreight forwarding between the United States and the Caribbean; and Caliber Logistics and Caliber Technology, providers of logistics and technology solutions. FDX Corporation was founded to oversee all of the operations of those companies and its original air division, Federal Express.[5]
In the 1990s, FedEx Ground planned, but later abandoned, a joint service with British Airways to have BA fly a Concorde supersonic jet airliner to Shannon, Ireland with FedEx packages on board, and then FedEx would have flown the packages subsonically to their delivery points in Europe. Ron Ponder, a vice president at the time, was in charge of this proposed venture.

In January 2000, FDX Corporation changed its name to FedEx Corporation and re-branded all of its subsidiaries. Federal Express became FedEx Express, RPS became FedEx Ground, Roberts Express became FedEx Custom Critical, and Caliber Logistics and Caliber Technology were combined to comprise FedEx Global Logistics. A new subsidiary, called FedEx Corporate Services, was formed to centralize the sales, marketing, and customer service for all of the subsidiaries. In February 2000, FedEx acquired Tower Group International, an international logistics company. FedEx also acquired WorldTariff, a customs duty and tax information company; TowerGroup and WorldTariff were re-branded to form FedEx Trade Networks.[5]
FedEx Corp. acquired privately held Kinko's, Inc. in February 2004 and re-branded it FedEx Kinko's. The acquisition was made to expand FedEx's retail access to the general public. After the acquisition, all FedEx Kinko's locations exclusively offered only FedEx shipping.[5] In June 2008, FedEx announced that they would be dropping the Kinko's name from their ship centers; FedEx Kinko's would now be called FedEx Office.[6][7] In September 2004, FedEx acquired Parcel Direct, a parcel consolidator, and re-branded it FedEx SmartPost.[5]
In December 2007, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service "tentatively decided" the FedEx Ground Division might be facing a tax liability of $319 million for 2002, due to misclassification of its operatives as independent contractors. Reversing a 1994 decision which allowed FedEx to classify its operatives that own their own vehicles as independent contractors, the IRS audited the years 2003 to 2006, with a view to assessing whether similar misclassification of operatives had taken place. FedEx denied that any irregularities in classification had occurred, but faced legal action from operatives claiming benefits that would have accrued had they been classified as employees.[8]
In June 2009, FedEx began a campaign against United Parcel Service (UPS) and the Teamsters union, accusing its competitor of receiving a bailout in an advertising campaign called "Brown Bailout". FedEx claimed that signing the Federal Aviation Administration re-authorization bill, which would let some of its workers unionize more easily (and, according to the Memphis-based company, "could expose [its] customers at any time to local work stoppages that interrupted the flow of their time-sensitive, high-value shipments”),[9] was equivalent to giving UPS a "bailout". Independent observers heavily criticized FedEx's wording,[9] claiming that it was "an abuse of the term".[9] FedEx Express employees are regulated under the Railway Labor Act.[10]
On January 14, 2013, FedEx named Henry Maier CEO and President of FedEx Ground, to take effect after David Rebholz retired on May 31, 2013.[11] On July 17, 2014, FedEx was indicted for conspiracy to distribute controlled substances in cooperation with the Chhabra-Smoley Organization and Superior Drugs.[12] According to the U.S. Department of Justice, "FedEx is alleged to have knowingly and intentionally conspired to distribute controlled substances and prescription drugs, including Phendimetrazine (Schedule III); Ambien, Phentermine, Diazepam, and Alprazolam (Schedule IV), to customers who had no legitimate medical need for them based on invalid prescriptions issued by doctors who were acting outside the usual course of professional practice."[13] A representative for the company contested these claims, stating that it would violate personal rights of customers to deny service and that "We are a transportation company — we are not law enforcement".[14] On July 17, 2016 the Department of Justice U.S. Attorney's Office confirmed in a statement that it had asked U.S. District Court Judge Charles Breyer to dismiss the indictment but also did not say why.[15][16][17]
In April 2015, FedEx acquired their rival firm TNT Express for €4.4 billion ($4.8 billion; £3.2 billion) as it looks to expand their operations in Europe.[18][19]
Operating units and logos[edit]
FedEx is organized into operating units, each of which has its own version of the wordmark designed in 1994 by Lindon Leader of Landor Associates, of San Francisco.[20] The Fed is always purple and the Ex is in a different color for each division and platinum for the overall corporation use. The original FedEx logo had the Ex in orange; it is now used as the FedEx Express wordmark. The FedEx wordmark is notable for containing a subliminal right-pointing arrow in the negative space between the "E" and the "X", which was achieved by designing a proprietary font, based on Univers and Futura, to emphasize the arrow shape.[20] In August 2016, FedEx announced that all operating units will switch over to the purple and orange color logo over the next 5 years.

SCAC codes[edit]
The Standard Carrier Alpha Code (SCAC) is a unique code used to identify transportation companies. It is typically two to four alphabetic letters long. It was developed by the National Motor Freight Traffic Association in the 1960s to help the transportation industry for computerizing data and records. FedEx's codes include:

FDE – FedEx Express
FDEG – FedEx Ground
FXFE – FedEx Freight
FDCC – FedEx Custom Critical
FXO - FedEx Office
FSDC- FedEx Same Day City

Political donations and lobbying[edit]
According to the Center for Responsive Politics, FedEx Corp is the 21st largest campaign contributor in the United States. The company has donated over $21 million since 1990, 45% of which went to Democrats and 55% to Republicans. Strong ties to the White House and members of Congress allow access to international trade and tax cut rebates as well as the rules of the business practices of the United States Postal Service. In 2001, FedEx sealed a $9 billion deal with the USPS to transport all of the post office's overnight and express deliveries.[28]
In 2005, FedEx was among 53 entities that contributed the maximum of $250,000 to sponsor the second inauguration of President George W. Bush.[29][30][31]
During the first three months of 2010, FedEx spent nearly $4.9 million lobbying the federal government (UPS, FedEx's main competitor, spent $1.6 million on lobbying over the same period), a 4% increase from the $4.7 million spent during the last quarter of 2009, but more than twice what it spent on lobbying during the first quarter of 2009.[32]
Awards and honors[edit]
The firm was named by Fortune magazine as one of the top 100 companies to work for in 2013, citing the company's choice to downsize with voluntary buyouts rather than involuntary layoffs.[33]
Advertising[edit]
Some of FedEx's ad campaigns:[34]

"When it Absolutely, Positively has to be there overnight" – 1978–1983
"It's not Just a Package, It's Your Business" – 1987–1988
"Our Most Important Package is Yours" – 1991–1994
"Absolutely, Positively Anytime" – 1995
"The Way the World Works," 1996–1998
"Be Absolutely Sure," 1998–2000
"This is a Job for FedEx," 2001–2002
"Don’t worry, there's a FedEx for that,” 2002–2003
"Relax, it’s FedEx," 2004–2008
"The World On Time" 2001–present
"We Understand," 2009–present

In 1981, their advertising firm Ally & Gargano hired performer John Moschitta, Jr., known for his fast speech delivery, to do an ad for Federal Express titled "Fast Paced World". This single commercial would be cited years later by New York as one of the most memorable ads ever.[35]
Motorsports[edit]

From 1997 to 2002, FedEx was the title sponsor of Champ Car World Series when it was known as CART. The series was known as the "CART FedEx Championship Series", which led to the official "Champ Car" designation in reference to the fact they were the FedEx Championship.
FedEx became the sponsor of the No. 11 NASCAR Sprint Cup Toyota owned by Joe Gibbs Racing and driven by Mike Bliss, Jason Leffler and Denny Hamlin in 2005. FedEx uses four (predominantly black) paint schemes to showcase its different products (Express, Freight, Ground, and Office), and in 2005 also ran a special scheme to promote a charity event at the FedEx St. Jude Classic golf tournament. The 11 car has been driven on a permanent basis by Hamlin since 2006.
FedEx previously sponsored the Formula One team McLaren. Prior to that FedEx had sponsored Ferrari, Benetton, and Williams F1. FedEx does not currently sponsor any F1 team.

Football[edit]

From 1989 to 2010, FedEx was the title sponsor of the Orange Bowl, played in Miami, Florida.[36]
FedExField, home of the National Football League's Washington Redskins in Landover, Maryland[37]

Other sports[edit]

FedEx sponsors FedExForum, home of the NBA's Memphis Grizzlies and the University of Memphis men's basketball team.[38]
FedEx sponsors the Heineken Cup in Rugby [39]
Beginning in 2007, FedEx became the title sponsor of the FedEx Cup, a championship trophy for the PGA Tour.[40]
FedEx is the Main Sponsor of the UEFA Europa League since 2015.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
