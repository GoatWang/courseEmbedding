        About Cable Hill Partners    



Our Team











        Our Focus: You    

We created Cable Hill Partners to provide you with Advice at a Higher Level.
We are an independent wealth management firm, bound by the fiduciary standard: we put your needs above all other interests—including our own.
We give you clarity in your financial situation, a course to meet your goals, and the confidence to move forward.









        Why Us?    

We’re experienced. We have the knowledge to help you, the insight to guide you, and the maturity to understand the intricacies of your particular situation.
We’re committed. We are personally invested in you—whether you are an individual, family, business, or organization. You are our focus—personally and professionally.We’re passionate. Speak to us for a few minutes and you’ll discern a difference. We bring an energy, a sincerity, and a dedication that attest to our love for what we do.









        What Matters to You    

Your needs are our priorities—so much so that we designed our team with you in mind. Here’s what sets us apart, and why it matters to you:
You have a single, skilled source for your wealth management needs. Your needs may be complex. We’ve likely handled similar situations before. We’re not learning on the job on your time. You benefit from our experience, our network of contacts, and our collective insight. If we can’t solve a problem directly, we’ll track down the best person who can.
You have a team that transcends more than one relationship. You’ll work with all of us and we’ll all get to know you. That’s how we like to work. We think your welfare is too precious to reside with the “brain trust” of just one person. You have peace of mind knowing that your wellbeing is a responsibility that we all embrace.
You have an empathetic and engaged partner. We’re nice people. We think that matters a lot; if you think so too, you’re probably the kind of person who should talk to us. But nice doesn’t mean vanilla. We’re engaged, energized, and absolutely committed to your success. We help you stay accountable to your goals and your dreams. And we hold ourselves to the same standard. Together, we believe we can move mountains.
You have definite preferences. We get that. In fact, we encourage that. We want you to be demanding. Expect exquisite service? We agree. Want a well-rounded relationship? We applaud that idea. We encourage multiple members of a family, business, or organization to get to know us. Our advisor team brings multiple perspectives; male and female; planning-based and investment-based; young and seasoned. If you have a particular need, we think we’re likely a good fit.

        Solutions    

You’ve built your success, but that doesn’t necessarily mean you want to manage it.
Wealth brings you a lot of things, complexity usually being one of them. Simplifying it is what we do. You may not really be that interested in the mechanics of financial planning, wealth management and investment portfolios – or you may not have the time – but you want to know you’re getting the best possible solutions. To that end, when we built Cable Hill Partners we started with a vision; providing advice at a higher level. That means taking what we learn about you and putting it through the filter of our fiduciary standards so that the course of action we come up with is exactly right for your needs and in your best interests. Independence means we can work with any providers and any financial products without fear of conflicts or quotas.
It’s that simple.







            PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT        

We believe in and follow an evidence-based portfolio management approach that is fundamentally different than what is found in most wealth management offerings, or pursued by most investors. We use research and strategic, passive investment strategies from Nobel Prize-winning asset management and index providing firms like Vanguard and Dimensional Fund Advisors (DFA), offering diversified and very low-cost portfolios that are tilted toward and successfully capture excess returns from broad market exposure with leanings to areas of the market that offer higher expected returns.
The end result is that you will have a customized investment strategy built entirely around your individual lifestyle needs, time frame, risk tolerance and aspirations.




            Liquidity and Cash Flow        

Integral to each client relationship is a collaborative development of budgetary guidelines to ensure cash is readily available for your needs. To achieve this, we regularly review and rebalance holdings to provide proper liquidity for current requirements, new investment opportunities and unexpected emergencies.




            Risk Management        

Risk level has everything to do with comfort level. Establishing appropriate risk parameters is personal to each client. Adhering to those risk guidelines is achieved through diversification across asset classes to reduce risk from changes in interest rates, credit, business performance and inflation, global economic factors and more.




            Tax Management        

There are few things we advocate more strongly than tax efficient strategies in all aspects of financial life. While we do not provide tax advice to our clients, we regularly work with tax advisors retained by our clients to coordinate solutions that minimize the frequency and impact of taxable events.








            Philanthropy        

Success offers the chance to do more in life, and big among our clients is the chance to give back whenever possible. Many of our clients are prominent patrons of Portland, Oregon and national charitable organizations, so we develop a range of charitable giving strategies that help our clients support the organizations and causes most important to them. In addition to doing good, charitable giving is intrinsically tied to prudent tax management. Everybody wins.




            Estate Planning        

Our clients want their families to inherit more than just heirlooms. That’s why we make intelligent estate planning a cornerstone of our comprehensive wealth management. Cable Hill Partners works closely with estate planning experts to help minimize tax exposure and maximize family harmony as wealth passes from one generation to another. We also specialize in crafting and administering business succession plans for family-owned companies and other closely-held businesses.




            Education Planning        

The escalating costs of higher education raise the eyebrows of even our most successful clients. This has made education planning an integral part of our wealth management conversations. We help assess costs, identify appropriate college savings plans and build investment strategies so that the children and grandchildren of our clients can pursue their dreams.




            Cash Management Services        

Our concierge service provides highly personalized attention from representatives of the firm who are trained to assist clients in virtually all financial management activities.












        Our Approach    

Whether you’re an individual or family, an executive or business owner, have a foundation or oversee an endowment, you want advice and guidance to help navigate important decisions. We commit ourselves to gaining a thorough understanding of your life: not just your balance sheet, but also your hopes, dreams, fears, and concerns. And then we fully invest our energies, insights, and experience in helping you wherever and whenever your wealth touches your life.







            Client Discovery: Who You Are        

Each client relationship begins with essential conversations about the key financial and personal issues they face. These conversations extend well beyond discussions about the markets, risk tolerances and investment philosophies to uncover the personal values and family dynamics that shape their most important goals and most pressing concerns.




            Goal Definition: What You Want        

Working alongside our clients, we identify, define and refine what they want to achieve today and how they envision tomorrow. From retirement planning, education funding or discovering more intelligent ways to borrow, to business succession plans and preserving assets and values over time, this portion of the process sets priorities and outlines our collective expectations moving forward.




            Plan Development: How We Can Help        

Utilizing a holistic lens encompassing client assets across personal and business holdings, we present a comprehensive, fully integrated and completely customized wealth management plan. Each plan features bespoke recommendations and insights on investments, borrowing, liability protection, estate planning, philanthropy and more.




            Implementation: How We Move Forward        

With client feedback taken into account, we now move to the implementation and monitoring phase of our process. On the investment side, we continuously evaluate asset performance and guard against overweighted portfolio sectors, rebalancing holdings whenever necessary. In other areas of the plan, we collaborate with the firm’s strategic partners and outside advisors our clients have retained to address their needs in lending, insurance, tax and estate planning and more.




            Ongoing Communication: How We Make Sure We’re On Track        

Through regular phone, email and face-to-face meetings, we make sure our clients fully understand the progress they are making against stated objectives. This is highlighted by monthly performance reports and holistic quarterly reviews, providing the basis for deeper conversations where we focus on specific areas of the plan.

        Our Team    

        A higher level of advice.    

    We’re not big on talking about ourselves — what you have to say is a lot more important. But for those of you who don’t know us, it might be helpful if we step out into the light for a moment and give you a better idea of who we are (as people, not financial advisors), what drives us (your goals), our passion for Portland, and why you may want to work with us (we’re independent, fee-only, fiduciaries, and nice folks). After this, it’s all about you.

What are analysts saying about CA stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about CA stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "CA is a leading information technology (IT) management software company. We are optimistic about CA’s acquisition strategy, which has enhanced its IT management, software and services portfolio. Moreover, we believe that the diversity of its products and the increased efficiency offered by them will attract customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model. Additionally, CA’s “go to market” sales strategy integrates the commercial functions of sales, marketing, brand management, pricing and consumer insight, which helps it in lowering costs, thereby improving the bottom line. Nonetheless, intensifying competition from peers, an uncertain economic environment, currency headwinds and the weak IT spending forecast by Gartner are other concerns. Notably, shares of the company has underperformed the broader market over the last one year period." (7/17/2017)
2. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "CA announced the acquisition of privately held Veracode for $614M in cash. Veracode provides SaaS-based application security for integration across the software development lifecycle. The deal value represents about 6.0-8.0x NTM revenue, which we view as reasonable, and discuss in more detail below. We believe providing security at the application level will become even more important over time given the ever increasing distributed nature of IT infrastructures." (3/7/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for CA (NASDAQ:CA) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 3 Sell Ratings, 7 Hold Ratings, 5 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.13)Consensus Price Target: $34.85 (12.07% upside)

                  Alt Turnover is calculated by taking either the total MV of new purchases or
                   the MV of securities sold, whichever is less,
                   divided by the total MV of the fund.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year
