Jean-Philippe Courtois: Meet the new breed of business leader driving enterprise innovation
4 May, 2017







If competing on product was the 20th century focus, then competing on business model is the focus of the 21st century. A new breed of entrepreneurial business leader is re-imagining what it means to be a digitally driven enterprise, and identifying how technology can grow revenues, diversify product lines and fend off hungry competitors.
Recently, I’ve been having more and more discussions with such forward-thinking business leaders. It seems to me that big enterprises are turning a corner. Thanks to digital transformation, they’re no longer lagging behind born-in-the-cloud startups. Rather, they’re using vast amounts of data, and tools like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, to re-evaluate their business models, re-think product lines, optimize operations for maximum efficiency and create new value for their customers.
One of my favorite examples is Mattel. Famous across the world for Barbies and Hot Wheels, its leaders recognize that the company can’t afford to be complacent in this digital age. During our most recent meeting, the business leaders I spoke to articulated a new sense of purpose for Mattel and we discussed how they could create a new identity – moving from the traditional model of manufacturing millions of plastic toys to a company that aspires to become a trusted advisor for parents to enable their children’s early childhood development through connected play from their very first days to their early teens.
This 75-year-old company is now preparing for the future, not only by evolving its traditional product lines, but by completely rethinking its go-to-market strategy with a new digital platform. As a result, it has started to expand its offering to include products like Aristotle, an AI-powered smart hub that can require kids to say “please” before the device will respond, helping parents to encourage good manners in their kids.
Another business breaking with tradition is Publicis Groupe, a bastion of the advertising and public relations world, founded in 1926. The group’s leaders were quick to spot that traditional advertising budgets are shrinking and that today’s consumers are engaging with brands in new ways. The tone of our recent discussions has evolved from focusing purely on IT capabilities to a much deeper business discussion. Together we’ve explored how the group can create a set of digital apps and services that will help them generate new, digitally relevant business outcomes.
For example, the group saw that it could apply AI to its goldmine of data to establish a deeper understanding of the brands it represents, and the consumers who buy from those brands, putting its agencies in a better position to proactively offer sound strategic counsel and new products to their clients. Digital agency SapientRazorfish is now building an application for a retailer which detects the details and features of a customer’s face, and then recommends a matching beauty product, with Cortana Intelligence Suite and Microsoft Cognitive Services.
Innovation is being incubated and executed within big, traditional enterprises at a breadth and depth that I haven’t seen before. The technology conversations that I’m having with business leaders are no longer compartmentalized, or focused on one system, solution or tool. They’re about the digital drivers that are underpinning the entire organization, touching the vast majority of revenue streams. As someone who has been at Microsoft for more than 30 years, it’s incredibly exciting to be having these new conversations, with these new types of leaders, as together we embrace a more digital future.

Big interview: Jean-Philippe Courtois, Microsoft International – Windows of opportunity









            By John Russell, M... on Jan 9, 2008 


Microsoft aims to expand into emerging markets by creating products with social benefits, according to the software giant’s head outside North America

It is now approaching a decade since Microsoft founder Bill Gates infamously said that poor countries had no need for information technology. In 2000, Gates said: “The world’s poorest two billion people desperately need healthcare, not laptops.” How times have changed.
Gates is now devoting his attention, and huge personal fortune, to improving public health in Africa through his charitable foundation. And the company he left behind is developing software for billions of future customers in emerging markets. It is a move that could be seen as complementary to Gates’ efforts to spur development in the world’s poorer nations.
Microsoft International president Jean-Philippe Courtois says opening new markets is vital for the software giant’s long-term survival. “To stay relevant in 15 years’ time, we cannot just keep selling to rich and affluent people in the world,” says Courtois, the company’s head outside North America. “In the last few years we have been reshaping our mission to address the social and economic development of the next billion people.”
Social innovation
Microsoft faces a world where, for all of the software giant’s success, just the richest one billion have access to IT. This presents huge opportunities for a $51 billion global firm, Courtois says. 
According to analysts IDC, global IT spending was $1.2 trillion last year, or 2.5 per cent of global GDP. Fast growing areas are central and eastern Europe, while in Brazil, Russia, India, China and Mexico a total of 1.2 million IT software jobs are set be created by 2011.
Courtois believes that Microsoft must constantly innovate to stay ahead. He says: “The company was created around a promise, 30 years ago … that one day there would be a personal computer in every office and every home.” That mission has changed over time, he observes, as the PC dream was superseded by email and the internet, and most recently, “web 2.0”.
To reach emerging market customers, Microsoft is having to adapt its software again. Courtois highlights two examples of what he calls “social innovation” – a term made popular by Unilever chief executive and fellow Frenchman Patrick Cescau to describe new products that have social benefits.
The first is a piece of software called Windows MultiPoint, which enables up to 12 children to use and control a single computer at the same time, via multiple mice and other peripherals. This saves schools having to buy a separate PC for each child. Courtois explains: “The big opportunity is India and developing countries that do not have the luxury of a full classroom of PCs.” 
Having designed the product in India, Microsoft has seen interest from western countries, where many schools still do not have one computer per child. “It was designed for emerging countries, but it is coming back already to rich countries,” Courtois says.
An even newer example of the company’s changing approach is Phone Plus. Courtois explains: “The idea is that in many countries, the PC is not your first screen. The phone is your first screen. In India you get six million new phones being sold every month.” In a Beijing laboratory, Microsoft developers are searching for a way to morph a mobile phone into a computer. The aim is to develop software and the capability for a phone to link it up to a keyboard, mouse, and a range of displays such as an analogue television. 
Courtois admits that these products are yet to make Microsoft much money, saying: “It’s really about the revenue five to ten years from now”. The company plans over a ten-year horizon. 
Aside from developing new products, Microsoft is selling existing products cheap, such as a $3 software package that includes Windows and a student version of Microsoft Office for customers in China. The company is training local software companies in how to develop applications for Microsoft systems. 
When entering new markets, the biggest challenge for Microsoft is winning the trust of governments, says Courtois. To do this, he believes the company makes the case for the wider economic benefits of a high-skilled IT sector. A Microsoft-commissioned study from IDC in October last year found that for every $1 the company earned in revenue, $8 went to companies that sell IT products that run with or on Microsoft software. “These arguments work very well with governments,” says Courtois.
Open-source software rivals, which offer applications for free, could give Microsoft a run for its money in poor countries. As Courtois knows, how the firm makes new products relevant to emerging markets will determine how many of the next billion IT users it manages to reach.

Jean-Philippe Courtois leads global sales, marketing and services for Microsoft International, a territory that spans 100 subsidiaries operating in more than 240 countries. As president of Microsoft International, Courtois drives strategic planning, global operations and key growth initiatives in developed and emerging markets.
