  "This will significantly reduce our construction time        frame and allow the line to be taken out of service for this project        without impacting the reliability of our grid." 



ST. PAUL, Minn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Alabama Power Co., which supplies electricity to 1.3 million homes, 
      businesses and industrial facilities, will become the third major 
      utility to install 3M's breakthrough electricity conductor, the 3M 
      aluminum conductor composite reinforced (ACCR). The 3M ACCR is a new 
      type of metal overhead line that can double the transmission capacity of 
      conventional conductors of the same diameter without requiring new 
      towers or any visual changes.
    

      The 3M ACCR will replace a key 10-mile (16-kilometer) line in 
      northeastern Alabama. The change is being made because the existing 
      conductor would be at capacity for certain contingencies resulting from 
      the addition of new generation during summer peak loads beginning in 
      2008. Installation of the 3M ACCR is expected to begin in January 2006.
    

      The new 3M conductor, which is heat-sag resistant, was developed to 
      reduce the potential for thermally constrained transmission lines that 
      increasingly have plagued electricity grids in recent years causing 
      brownouts and blackouts across the country. In addition, the 3M ACCR 
      provides the industry with a metal overhead conductor solution.
    

      Alabama Power, the second largest unit of Southern Co., supplies energy 
      to two thirds of the state. Its selection of 3M ACCR to improve capacity 
      on a key line follows similar decisions by Xcel Energy for a 10-mile 
      line in Minnesota and the Western Area Power Administration for an 
      80-mile line along the Colorado River in Arizona. 3M expects to announce 
      additional sales of the conductor to utilities around the nation in the 
      coming months.
    

      "The use of the 3M conductor for this project allowed us to avoid the 
      replacement of 22 transmission structures and the installation of eight 
      additional structures," said Andy Wallace, transmission line manager for 
      Alabama Power. "This will significantly reduce our construction time 
      frame and allow the line to be taken out of service for this project 
      without impacting the reliability of our grid."
    

      Tracy Anderson, 3M project manager for the 3M ACCR, said interest in the 
      new conductor "is building quickly as a cost-efficient and reliable way 
      to relieve many of the national grid potential bottlenecks. Before 
      bringing this product to market, we devoted four years to rugged, 
      extensive field testing with several utilities and the Department of 
      Energy under virtually every conceivable atmospheric condition. The 3M 
      ACCR met every expectation."
    

      Anderson noted that the first two purchases of the 3M ACCR were made by 
      utilities that participated in the field testing for installation in 
      areas subject to extreme weather conditions. "That is a powerful 
      endorsement of the product's performance," he said.
    

      The 3M ACCR contains a multistrand core of heat resistant aluminum 
      matrix composite wires. The conductor retains its strength at high 
      temperatures and is not adversely affected by environmental conditions. 
      Its lightweight and reduced thermal expansion properties are what enable 
      installation on existing towers with no requirement for visual changes 
      to a line or additional rights of way.
    

      In addition to the Department of Energy and the utilities that field 
      tested the 3M ACCR, 3M retained the National Electric Energy Testing, 
      Research and Applications Center at the Georgia Institute of Technology 
      to test the conductor during development.
    

      The 3M ACCR's technology has been recognized by R&D Magazine with an R&D 
      100 award as one of the most technologically significant products 
      introduced into the marketplace and by the Minnesota High Tech 
      Association with a Tekne Award for innovative development.
    

      More information about the 3M ACCR is available at www.3m.com/accr.

Alabama Power Co (OTCPK:ALBMP)
Gross Property, Plant and Equipment
=GURUF("ALBMP","Gross Property, Plant and Equipment")

$27,108.00 Mil (As of Mar. 2017)
Alabama Power Co's quarterly gross PPE increased from Sep. 2016 ($26,618.00 Mil) to Dec. 2016 ($26,858.00 Mil) and increased from Dec. 2016 ($26,858.00 Mil) to Mar. 2017 ($27,108.00 Mil).
Alabama Power Co's annual gross PPE increased from Dec. 2014 ($24,434.00 Mil) to Dec. 2015 ($25,914.00 Mil) and increased from Dec. 2015 ($25,914.00 Mil) to Dec. 2016 ($26,858.00 Mil).

Definition
Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) are the fixed assets of the company. Fixed assets are also known as non-current assets.
Property, plant, and equipment includes assets that will - in the normal course of business - neither be used up in the next year nor will become a part of any product sold to customers.
Some of the most common parts of property, plant, and equipment are:

	Land
	Buildings (and leasehold improvements)
	Transportation equipment
	Manufacturing equipment
	Office equipment
	Office furniture

Companies with lots of property, plant, and equipment often have special categories. For example, railroad property includes:

	Track
	Ties
	Ballast
	Bridges
	Tunnels
	Signals
	Locomotives
	Freight Cars

There is often a note in the financial statements - found in a companys 10-K - that will explain the different categories of property a company owns.
The market value of property, plant, and equipment can differ tremendously from the book value of property, plant, and equipment.
For example, when Berkshire Hathaway liquidated its textile mills, it had to pay the buyers of the companys manufacturing equipment to haul the equipment away. That property, plant, and equipment was literally worth less than zero. On the other hand, some companies own thousands of acres of land.
All property, plant, and equipment other than land is depreciated. Land is never depreciated. However, land is not marked up to market value either. Under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), land is shown on the balance sheet at cost.
The property, plant, and equipment line shown on the balance sheet is usually net property, plant, and equipment. This means it is the cost of the property, plant, and equipment less accumulated depreciation.

Explanation
A company with durable competitive advantage doesnt need to constantly upgrade its equipment to stay competitive. The company replaces when it wears out. On the other hand, a company without any advantages must replace to keep pace.
Difference between a company with a moat and one without is that the company with the competitive advantage finances new equipment through internal cash flows, whereas the no advantage company requires debt to finance.
Producing a consistent product that doesnt change equates to consistent profits. There is no need to upgrade plants which frees up cash for other ventures. Think Coca Cola, Johnson & Johnson etc.

Environmental litigation[edit]




William Crawford Gorgas Electric Generating Plant


In 1999 the United States Environmental Protection Agency commenced an enforcement action against Alabama Power under the Clean Air Act. In 2006, the EPA announced that Alabama Power had agreed to spend more than $200 m to upgrade pollution controls as a partial settlement of this action.[6] The settlement did not include claims regarding five coal-fired plants.[7] Those claims proceeded to trial, and Alabama Power prevailed. However, the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC) has stated that they intend to appeal the ruling. SELC was involved in a case against Duke Energy that was appealed to the Supreme Court in 2006.[8][9]
Corporate citizenship[edit]
The Alabama Power Foundation is a non-profit foundation providing grants for watershed, environmental and community projects along the Coosa River and within the state of Alabama[10]
In April 2006, Alabama Power and Southern Company were given the "Outstanding Stewardship of American Rivers Award" by the National Hydropower Association, representing domestic, non-federal hydroelectric producers, for their "Renew Our Rivers" program.[11]

In 1999 the United States Environmental Protection Agency commenced an enforcement action against Alabama Power under the Clean Air Act. In 2006, the EPA announced that Alabama Power had agreed to spend more than $200 m to upgrade pollution controls as a partial settlement of this action.[6] The settlement did not include claims regarding five coal-fired plants.[7] Those claims proceeded to trial, and Alabama Power prevailed. However, the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC) has stated that they intend to appeal the ruling. SELC was involved in a case against Duke Energy that was appealed to the Supreme Court in 2006.[8][9]
Corporate citizenship[edit]
The Alabama Power Foundation is a non-profit foundation providing grants for watershed, environmental and community projects along the Coosa River and within the state of Alabama[10]
In April 2006, Alabama Power and Southern Company were given the "Outstanding Stewardship of American Rivers Award" by the National Hydropower Association, representing domestic, non-federal hydroelectric producers, for their "Renew Our Rivers" program.[11]

Alabama Power Company, headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama, is a company in the southern United States that provides electricity service to 1.4 million customers in the southern two-thirds of Alabama. It also operates appliance stores.[3] It is one of four U.S. utilities operated by the Southern Company, one of the nation's largest generators of electricity.
Alabama Power is an investor-owned, tax-paying utility, and the second largest subsidiary of Southern Company. More than 78,000 miles (126,000 km) of power lines carry electricity to customers throughout 44,500 square miles (115,000 km2). Alabama Power is the largest taxpayer in Alabama. If the company was a stand-alone entity (as opposed to a subsidiary), it would be the largest company headquartered in Alabama by revenue and would rank #448[4] on the Fortune 500 in 2015.
Alabama Power's hydroelectric generating plants encompass several lakes on the Tallapoosa, Coosa, and Black Warrior rivers, as well as coal, oil, natural gas, nuclear and cogeneration plants in various parts of the state. In addition to generating electricity, the waters surrounding the plants offer recreational opportunities for Alabama residents and visitors.

In 1999 the United States Environmental Protection Agency commenced an enforcement action against Alabama Power under the Clean Air Act. In 2006, the EPA announced that Alabama Power had agreed to spend more than $200 m to upgrade pollution controls as a partial settlement of this action.[6] The settlement did not include claims regarding five coal-fired plants.[7] Those claims proceeded to trial, and Alabama Power prevailed. However, the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC) has stated that they intend to appeal the ruling. SELC was involved in a case against Duke Energy that was appealed to the Supreme Court in 2006.[8][9]
Corporate citizenship[edit]
The Alabama Power Foundation is a non-profit foundation providing grants for watershed, environmental and community projects along the Coosa River and within the state of Alabama[10]
In April 2006, Alabama Power and Southern Company were given the "Outstanding Stewardship of American Rivers Award" by the National Hydropower Association, representing domestic, non-federal hydroelectric producers, for their "Renew Our Rivers" program.[11]

Alabama Power Company, headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama, is a company in the southern United States that provides electricity service to 1.4 million customers in the southern two-thirds of Alabama. It also operates appliance stores.[3] It is one of four U.S. utilities operated by the Southern Company, one of the nation's largest generators of electricity.
Alabama Power is an investor-owned, tax-paying utility, and the second largest subsidiary of Southern Company. More than 78,000 miles (126,000 km) of power lines carry electricity to customers throughout 44,500 square miles (115,000 km2). Alabama Power is the largest taxpayer in Alabama. If the company was a stand-alone entity (as opposed to a subsidiary), it would be the largest company headquartered in Alabama by revenue and would rank #448[4] on the Fortune 500 in 2015.
Alabama Power's hydroelectric generating plants encompass several lakes on the Tallapoosa, Coosa, and Black Warrior rivers, as well as coal, oil, natural gas, nuclear and cogeneration plants in various parts of the state. In addition to generating electricity, the waters surrounding the plants offer recreational opportunities for Alabama residents and visitors.

Environmental litigation[edit]




William Crawford Gorgas Electric Generating Plant


In 1999 the United States Environmental Protection Agency commenced an enforcement action against Alabama Power under the Clean Air Act. In 2006, the EPA announced that Alabama Power had agreed to spend more than $200 m to upgrade pollution controls as a partial settlement of this action.[6] The settlement did not include claims regarding five coal-fired plants.[7] Those claims proceeded to trial, and Alabama Power prevailed. However, the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC) has stated that they intend to appeal the ruling. SELC was involved in a case against Duke Energy that was appealed to the Supreme Court in 2006.[8][9]
Corporate citizenship[edit]
The Alabama Power Foundation is a non-profit foundation providing grants for watershed, environmental and community projects along the Coosa River and within the state of Alabama[10]
In April 2006, Alabama Power and Southern Company were given the "Outstanding Stewardship of American Rivers Award" by the National Hydropower Association, representing domestic, non-federal hydroelectric producers, for their "Renew Our Rivers" program.[11]
