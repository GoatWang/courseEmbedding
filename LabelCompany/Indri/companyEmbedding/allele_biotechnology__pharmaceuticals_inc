iPSCs Generation
Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSC): Stem Cell Generation
The direct reprogramming of somatic cells to pluripotency was first accomplished in 2006. Adult mouse fibroblasts were converted to iPS Cells (induced pluripotent stem cells) through ecotropic expression of a select group of transcription factors. In 2007, direct reprogramming was achieved in human cells. The generation of iPS from differentiated adult cells has vast therapeutic implications, particularly in the context of pharmaceutical screening and cellular replacement therapies. Extensive research has been conducted in search of efficient ways for stem cell generation.

iPSCs Validation
Nanog, Oct4, and Rex1 promoters have been reported to display ES/iPS cell specific expression under undifferentiated states. Allele Biotech provides pre-packaged lentiviral fluorescent protein (FP) reporters driven by all three promoters to confirm the state of the reprogrammed iPSCs. A GFP or RFP gene was cloned behind these ES-specific promoters to offer convenient fluorescence tracking of undifferentiated cells.
We also provide the iPS Cell Identification CR Primer Kits. Instead of ordering individual oligos, complete sets of primers, as precisely defined and tested in Takahashi et al. 2006, are conveniently and sufficiently provided for 50 reactons for each gene.
For iPSCs identification antibodies, chech the Antibody group or search in products.

Pluripotency Reporters
Human embryonic stem (ES) cells or induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells promise to serve as an unlimited source for transplantation or tissue-specific differentiation. However, obtaining and maintaining stem cells can be difficult for multiple reasons. For instance, most stem cell lines tend to spontaneously differentiate in culture, and even if the cells form stem cell-like colonies, they may be of a heterogeneous population. There have been a number of publications using murine Oct-4, Nanog, and Rex-1 promoters driven fluorescent proteins as markers for pluripotency tests [1-3]. Allele Biotech provides, under its iPS product line, packaged and validated lentiviral particles that would insert these 3 promoter-FP reporters into the stem cells. Although currently these promoters are of mouse sequences, their use in human stem cells has been reported.

Oligonucleotide Synthesis

 
Allele's Oligonucleotide Synthesis Division has been providing oligos for almost a decade to San Diego research establishments, such as UCSD, SALK, Scripps and SDSU.  We specialize in very long oligos (e.g., 215 nt) and will ship or deliver most oligos within 1-3 days.  Our oligo synthesis service offers a large variety of synthesis scales, modifications, and purifications for our customer's various needs, including: sequencing, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), Ligase Chain Reaction (LCR), reverse transcriptase PCR, hybridization studies, site directed mutagenesis, microarray experiments, dye terminator sequencing reactions, cloning and other techniques. 
Allele offers discounted pricing for all academic institutions, please email us at  oligo@allelebiotech.com for specifics.
Free desalting, fully deprotected and ready to use, conveniently delivered in ddH2O with free concentration normalization.
 
For customers within our delivery range, we will deliver between 1:00-3:30pm. For all other customers, we will ship next-day. Please indicate any special delivery requests on the day of purchase by making a note in the “Comments” field or emailing us at oligo@allelebiotech.com
 
*Even with advanced technology, high-performance machines and elaborate programs, the efficiency of each chemical step of oligo synthesis is seldom above 99%. As a result, deletion events at 1-2% of elongating oligos must occur at each and every position. As the oligo length increases, these deletion mutations accumulate; therefore, long oligos are more affected by this problem than shorter oligos. We strongly recommend PAGE purification for oligonucleotides greater than 45 bases in length. We cannot guarantee the quality of oligonucleotides longer than 45 bases in length unless they are purified.

Allele Biotechnology and Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Key Developments

Allele Biotechnology & Pharmaceuticals Plans to Form a Cell Banking Business for Personalized Medicine; Appoints Mahendra Rao and Joseph Paulauskis as the First Members of its Scientific Advisory Board for iPSC Banking and cGMP Production
Oct 6 15
Allele Biotechnology & Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced plans to form a commercial business for the banking of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by private individuals. Human iPSCs are cells that can be grown to virtually infinite numbers and can become any cell in the human body,
features which hold great promise for therapies that can alleviate or cure human disease. Allele’s business model recognizes that an individual can have their own cells ready for future therapeutic use via the generation and storage of iPSCs from that individual’s skin cells. While this is similar to what is done with newborn cord blood, iPSCs can be generated from humans of any age. The banking of human iPSCs for potential future therapeutic use is a relatively new industry with unprecedented potential, and Allele is benefitting from expert opinions internally and from current and future SAB members, ensuring a solid scientific and ethical foundation for this business. In addition to serving its customers, Allele’s iPSC bank will be an unparalleled resource for biomedical research. Proper consent and privacy guardianship will allow thousands of iPSC lines with accompanying sequence database and health information to be made available from the bank to scientists and clinicians. Currently, iPSC banks are funded by government agencies at multi-million dollar costs per project; Allele’s model does not rely on tax dollars and provides potentially a larger bank of iPSCs of higher quality to aid research and treatment efforts. 

The company announced Drs. Mahendra Rao and Joseph Paulauskis as the first members of its Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) for iPSC banking and cGMP production. Dr. Rao is a world-renowned scientist in the fields of stem cells and medicine, having served as the VP of Regenerative Medicine at Invitrogen, founding Director of the NIH Center for Regenerative Medicine, Chair of the Biological Response Modifiers Committee (BRMAC, now CTAGT) of the FDA, and he is currently Chief Strategy Officer at Q Therapeutics. Dr. Paulauskis is the Chief Operating Officer of Paradigm Dx as well as the Vice-President of Research and Biobanking for the International Genomics Consortium, and has previously held senior positions in pharmacogenomics at Pfizer. Allele plans to make additional appointments to the SAB as individuals with world-class experience and expertise are identified.

AlleleBiotechnology & Pharmaceuticals Inc. released the first group of a brand new class of antibodies against crucial biological targets to the research market. This week, Allele launches nano-antibodies isolated from llamas against human bFGF, P16, VEGF, and TNFa, which are all important targets in the field of cancer biology. Nano-Antibodies (also known as nAb™, Nanobodies®, Single Domain Antibodies, Camelid Antibodies and VHH antibodies) represent the future in antibody technology of Allele’s interest. This first wave of novel reagents has been meticulously tested for immunohistochemistry (IHC) in human cancer tissues; some of these antibodies also performed well in cross-species reactivity in mouse and rat while others are highly suitable for advanced applications such as flow cytometry and antigen immunoprecipitation.
