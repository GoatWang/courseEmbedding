CEO David Campisi



Back to Our Leadership









David Campisi is Chief Executive Officer and President of Big Lots, a Fortune 500 company with annual revenues exceeding $5 billion. Big Lots is a unique, non-traditional discount retailer operating more than 1,400 stores in 47 states with product assortments in the merchandise categories of Food, Consumables, Furniture, Seasonal, Soft Home, Hard Home, and Electronics & Accessories.
Campisi joined Big Lots in May 2013. A 30-year veteran of the retail industry, Campisi directs a range of strategic initiatives to successfully leverage the company’s core competencies in merchandising, marketing, and operational excellence. Under his leadership, Big Lots has enhanced its product assortments, improved the customer experience, and strengthened associate engagement. Campisi has also been instrumental in launching the Big Lots Foundation and spearheading the company’s first national point of sale donation campaign for Nationwide Children’s Hospital, one of the largest and most comprehensive pediatric hospitals in the U.S.
His extensive merchandising experience, collaborative leadership style, and operational expertise positioned him for his role. Before joining Big Lots, he was Chairman and CEO of Respect Your Universe (RYU), a publicly traded company focused on premium performance apparel and equipment.
Prior to RYU, Campisi served as Chairman, CEO, and President of The Sports Authority, a privately held $3B sporting goods retailer. From 2004 to 2010, he was also President and Chief Merchandising Officer for the company. During his tenure, Sports Authority unified its stores under a single national brand and improved the quality of the company’s key assortments of branded sports apparel. Campis’s experience also includes senior executive merchandising positions with Kohl’s, Fred Meyer Inc. (a division of the Kroger Company), and May Department Stores.
An active community member, Campisi serves on the Board of Directors for Big Lots, Nationwide Children’s Hospital, and the Wexner Center for the Arts. He and his wife Beci reside in Columbus and are the proud parents of two daughters and a son.
