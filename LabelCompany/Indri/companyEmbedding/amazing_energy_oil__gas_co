Permian Basin, Gulf to lead U.S. to '18 production record



		7/21/2017

 Ken Stickney, kstickney@theadvertiser.comPublished 11:37 a.m. CT July 21, 2017 | Updated 5:22 p.m. CT July 21, 2017​Permian Basin, Gulf to lead U.S. to '18 production recordU.S. daily crude oil production in 2018 may shatter a record established nearly a half-century ago, the Energy Information Administration has suggested.The average production will be 9.9 million barrels per day next year, the federal agency revealed this week, up from 9.3 million barrels this year and more than the 9.6 million barrels produced in 1970, the landmark year.Leading the U.S. production charge will be Permian Basin operations in western Texas and southeastern New Mexico and operations in the Gulf of Mexico.The EIA said production in the Permian will increase to about 2.9 million barrels per day in 2018 as average production ramps up 515,000 barrels per day from June 2017 to the end of 2018. That 2.9 million barrels represents almost 30 percent of expected U.S. production next year.Specifically, the EIA said lower costs of production have enabled Permian producers to make a profit even with oil prices lingering in the $50-a-barrel range and falling into the mid-$40 range in recent weeks. Baker Hughes' rig count says there are 366 onshore rigs in the Permian alone; there are 915 onshore rigs in all in the lower 48 U.S. states.Eight projects came online in the Gulf in 2016; another seven may come online in 2018. That will help Gulf production increase from 1.7 million barrels a day this year to 1.9 million barrels per day next year.Lower costs made the difference​More: Gulf oil lease sales reflect better marketMore: LAGCOE '17: Emphasis on programs, director saysSome West Texas producers are producing oil at a cost of about $39, it has been reported."In addition to responding to changes in (West Texas Intermediate) price, increases in right counts are related to cash flow," the EIA said Wednesday. "In the Permian, operators have been able to maintain positive cash flow because of lower costs, higher productivity, and increased hedging activity by producers, many of whom have sold future production at prices higher than $50 per barrel."The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries launched a price war principally aimed at U.S. shale producers at Thanksgiving 2014. At that time, OPEC nations led by Saudi Arabia vowed to increase their drilling to drive down prices and force U.S. producers out of the global market, experts suggested. Instead, some U.S. producers have become more efficient at producing at lower prices. Eric Smith, associate director of the Tulane Energy Institute, told The Daily Advertiser earlier this month that independent U.S. producers have been finding it easier to borrow money of late."When they borrow, they drill and drill and drill," he said.

 The Permian Basin Keeps On GivingRobert Rapier,  CONTRIBUTOR I write about energy, the environment, and the economy.  Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own       Last week the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) announced the largest estimate of continuous oil that it has ever assessed. The area assessed is in the Permian Basin, a region that has been producing oil continuously for nearly 100 years.The Permian Basin lies underneath western Texas and southeastern New Mexico. The geology of the Permian Basin is rich and complex, both horizontally and vertically. The Permian Basin has commercial accumulations of oil and gas in stacked layers, at depths ranging from 1,000 feet to more than 25,000 feet. The greater Permian is made up of several subsidiary basins, the largest of which are the Midland and the Delaware.The new USGS assessment is of the Wolfcamp shale in the Midland Basin portion of Texas’ Permian Basin. The new USGS survey estimates that there are 20 billion barrels of undiscovered, technically recoverable oil in the Wolfcamp alone. Quoting from the USGS news release:“The fact that this is the largest assessment of continuous oil we have ever done just goes to show that, even in areas that have produced billions of barrels of oil, there is still the potential to find billions more,” said Walter Guidroz, program coordinator for the USGS Energy Resources Program. “Changes in technology and industry practices can have significant effects on what resources are technically recoverable, and that’s why we continue to perform resource assessments throughout the United States and the world.”It is important to understand what this assessment actually means. This oil has been assessed as an “undiscovered resource.” This scientific assessment means the forecasters have a certain degree of confidence that the oil is there. For this particular assessment, the 50% confidence level is that there are at least 20 billion barrels there. The study further estimates that there is a 95% chance that there are at least 11 billion barrels there, and a 5% chance that there are at least 31 billion barrels there.However, the fact that the assessment refers to the “resource” means that they are estimating the technically recoverable oil in place. This says nothing of the economics of recovering this oil. The amount that would be economically worthwhile to recover at prevailing commodity prices -- which would be classified as “proved reserves” -- will be a smaller subset of the assessed amount. It would even be zero at a sufficiently low oil price. This is merely an attempt by the USGS to estimate the amount of oil that could be extracted over time if cost was not an object.But given the history of the Permian Basin, it's a pretty safe bet that there is still a lot of oil still left to produce there. The Permian Basin began producing oil in 1921. The Texas side of the Permian has already produced nearly 30 billion barrels of crude, as well as 75 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of natural gas. Permian crude oil production has more than doubled since 2010 largely as a result of hydraulic fracturing in six low-permeability formations: Spraberry, Wolfcamp, Bone Spring, Glorieta, Yeso and Delaware.According to the Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) most recent Permian Region Drilling Productivity Report, the Permian is presently producing 2 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil and 7.3 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) of natural gas. This accounts for more than 23% of current U.S. crude oil production, and exceeds the combined oil output of the Bakken and the Eagle Ford:Source: Energy Information Administration.I have heard some dismiss this assessment as much ado about nothing, and I have heard some characterize it as a new oil discovery. It it neither. This new USGS assessment is merely an attempt to put some framework around how much oil may exist in one of the multiple producing formations within the Permian.

Continues Development in Pecos County, TexasBusiness WireAugust 25, 2016ReblogShareTweetShareAMARILLO, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amazing Energy Oil and Gas Co. (AMAZ) is pleased to announce recent results from its Pecos County, Texas property.Reese Pinney, Chief Operating Officer, reported, “The Company has closed the acquisition of Jilpetco, which greatly improves operational and cost control over our leasehold. The acquired equipment includes workover rigs, as well as various service equipment needed to respond quickly to maintaining and increasing our production. Also included in the Jilpetco transaction, we have purchased a drilling rig, which is perfectly sized for the shallow Queen Sand wells we are drilling, thereby providing further control over timing and costs. These moves by the company not only advance our plans immediately, but also serve to add a measure of protection when the industry rebounds and services become more costly or hard to obtain.”Mr. Pinney continued, “Also, within the next 60 days, we will commence a workover program on 4 wells, implementing the completion design that has delivered the best results to date.

      Amazing Energy Oil and Gas Co. Reports Operations Update from Its 
      Permian Basin, Texas Property
    





November 29, 2016 02:57 PM Eastern Standard Time



AMARILLO, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amazing Energy Oil and Gas Co. (OTCQX: AMAZ) is pleased to announce 
      recent results from its Pecos County, Texas property.
    

      Reese Pinney, Chief Operating Officer, reported, “The Company is 
      executing our development plan on the property. We are pleased with the 
      initial results of this work. The 4-well workover program on the ‘C’ 
      Lease is still in its flowback phase, and is averaging approximately 20 
      BOPD. Adjustments are being made to the production facility to determine 
      the optimum production rates. The No. 21 well was successfully completed 
      on November 21, and is also in its flowback stage, currently producing 
      approximately 22 BOPD and 270 MCFD (67 BOEPD). The rest of the field is 
      averaging 30 BOPD and 300 MCFD (80 BOEPD). This includes many wells 
      scheduled for similar completion and production enhancement work. The 
      combination of these rates takes the Company’s operated production to 
      167 BOEPD (43% oil).”
    

      Mr. Pinney continued, “Concurrent with this work, we are permitting the 
      No. 28 location for drilling. We are mobilizing company owned equipment 
      to continue the recompletion work in the field. Our deliberate focus on 
      methodical growth of this scalable operation is putting our production 
      on a good trajectory. We expect continued improvements at the field 
      level, which is critical to remaining economically viable during this 
      industry downturn. Our dedicated team of field personnel is doing a 
      great job of growing this production base.”
    

      Cautionary Statement: Statement of future events or conditions in this 
      release are forward-looking statements. Actual future results, including 
      project plans and schedule and resource recoveries could differ 
      materially due to changes in market condition affecting the oil and gas 
      industry or long term oil and gas price levels; political or regulatory 
      developments; reservoir performance; the outcome of future exploration 
      and development efforts; technical or operating factors; the outcome of 
      future commercial negotiations, and other factors.

Amazing Energy Oil And Gas Co. Continues Development In Pecos County, Texas






Business Wire




Aug 25, 2016 12:22 PM EDT













 




























































  Amazing Energy Oil and Gas Co. ( AMAZ) is pleased to announce recent results from its Pecos County, Texas property.  Reese Pinney, Chief Operating Officer, reported, "The Company has closed the acquisition of Jilpetco, which greatly improves operational and cost control over our leasehold. The acquired equipment includes workover rigs, as well as various service equipment needed to respond quickly to maintaining and increasing our production. Also included in the Jilpetco transaction, we have purchased a drilling rig, which is perfectly sized for the shallow Queen Sand wells we are drilling, thereby providing further control over timing and costs. These moves by the company not only advance our plans immediately, but also serve to add a measure of protection when the industry rebounds and services become more costly or hard to obtain."  Mr. Pinney continued, "Also, within the next 60 days, we will commence a workover program on 4 wells, implementing the completion design that has delivered the best results to date. The last four wells that had this work done had an average reported IP of 80 barrels per day. Replication of this would add significantly to the company's new cash flow, even at today's product prices."  Jilpetco will continue as a registered operator with the Texas Railroad Commission, with Mr. Pinney serving as its President.  Cautionary Statement: Statement of future events or conditions in this release are forward-looking statements. Actual future results, including project plans and schedule and resource recoveries could differ materially due to changes in market condition affecting the oil and gas industry or long term oil and gas price levels; political or regulatory developments; reservoir performance; the outcome of future exploration and development efforts; technical or operating factors; the outcome of future commercial negotiations; and other factors.

      Report dated December 31, 2014 that the well produced 148 barrels of oil 
      and 122 MCF on an initial 24 hour flow test. The operator’s update on 
      Monday, January 5, 2015 reported that the well continued to flow between 
      120 and 130 BOPD and has produced approximately 1,082 BBLS since coming 
      online last month. The Railroad Commission has given the operator 
      approval to sell the first 5,000 barrels of oil on a P8 permit.
    

      Mr. Dunne stated that, “The Company will continue to develop the 
      approximate 70,000 acre Pecos County, Texas leasehold with plans of 
      expanding drilling operations into adjacent sections soon. We are very 
      excited about our recent success in our shallow-well project. The 
      Company continues to be a low cost per barrel producer. Unlike the shale 
      plays that might cost several millions of dollars per well, our wells 
      cost approximately $400,000. We utilize conventional drilling techniques 
      in legacy producing, shallow formations that are usually less than 2,000 
      ft deep, giving us an advantage during these times of price volatility, 
      and allowing us to grow, while others are shutting down.”
    

      According to Mr. Dunne, “Amazing Energy Oil and Gas Co. currently owns 
      interests in 18 wells in the Permian Basin. Although not all 18 wells 
      are currently operating, we will be bringing them online as we continue 
      to build our infrastructure, adding more gas lines and electric service. 
      This is a very large project and we are focused on getting it up and 
      running as quickly as we can. The WWJD #13 is another great addition 
      toward accomplishing this goal.”

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
