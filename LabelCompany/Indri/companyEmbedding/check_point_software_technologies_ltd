Small Business –  100 Employees or Less




Small businesses need cost-effective security that provides robust protections and ease of use. Check Point brings its long-standing history of security expertise to a range of solutions optimized for the unique demands of small businesses.



 










Constrained by budgets, resources
Few small businesses have money to burn on complex security solutions—or the staff to manage them. Yet, in a world of ever-changing threats, even small businesses need comprehensive, advanced protections against cyber-attacks. In fact, 60 percent of small businesses close within six months of being attacked. The best choice for a small business without a dedicated security team is a simple device that covers all the bases and works out of the box. In short, the key ingredients include:

Affordability—A cost easily absorbed on a limited budget
Ease of use—Can be set up and deployed in minutes, and offers hands-free management for those who need it
Peace of mind—Provides reliable security with minimal intervention or management






Do not compromise security for performance
A common problem small businesses face when it comes to deploying robust protections is performance. Most often, vendor bandwidth claims fall short when put to the real-world test. As a result, as Internet speeds degrade over time, security services are often disabled to compensate for lack of performance. This opens up the business to cyber-attacks.
The Check Point 700 Appliances provide unparalleled security without the performance degradation witnessed by other firewalls. So, small businesses can maintain full Internet performance and deploy the strongest protections for their business.



 









How We Can Help



 
Small Business Appliances
Our small business appliances are simple and easy to use, ideal for any small office with limited IT budgets and resources. You can manage the appliances via a simplified web-based local management or centrally via our Cloud Managed Security Service.

Midsize & Enterprise




Protecting today’s enterprise networks requires greater flexibility and innovation to keep pace with increasingly sophisticated threats. Check Point’s enterprise network security solutions provide a comprehensive security architecture with flexible enforcement points for advanced protection against the latest cyberattacks.




 












Coping with constant change
When you have a target on your back, your reality is a constant, unrelenting barrage of threats. Not just any threats, but complex threats that change as needed to undermine your defenses. To combat this trend, midsize and large enterprises need an adaptive security platform that does more than traditional firewalling. They need multiple technologies—tightly integrated within a single appliance—to control network access, detect sophisticated attacks and provide additional security capabilities like data loss prevention and protection from web-based threats.
By emphasizing versatility, organizations can customize security that’s optimized for their organizational profile and needs.
 



 









How We Can Help



 
Security Appliances
Our  enterprise network security appliances combine high-performance, multi-core capabilities with fast networking technologies to provide the highest level of security. By consolidating multiple security technologies into a single security gateway, these appliances are designed to deliver advanced and integrated security solutions to meet all of your business security needs.

Workflow and Orchestration




Your security program is only as strong as your ability to manage it. A streamlined interface and built-in best practices features increase efficiency and reduce errors in policy and change management. Our highly extensible platform makes it easy to align security with IT processes and systems. 



 










Work smarter, not harder
With too much work and too little staff, CISOs need a security management solution that has automation capabilities to help their teams work smarter, not harder.

Routine tasks such as access rights management or help desk tickets can be delegated, empowering security self-service for business owners.
Trusted APIs enable enterprises using network or orchestration systems to securely integrate security into their workflow and change management processes, paving the way for end-to-end security controls automation.


 




Enjoy task-oriented management
A security management system should anticipate the daily tasks of a security administrator. To that end, we have simplified interfaces and built-in numerous features into our management interface to streamline processes and make it as efficient as possible for security teams to do their work.

Concurrent administration now allows multiple administrators to work simultaneously on the same policy without conflict.
Productivity tools such as hit count per object rule and integrated logs help streamline policy troubleshooting.
Policy best-practice features such as policy validation provide security intelligence to help administrators make better policy decisions.





 









How We Can Help



 
Workflow
Workflow automates the enforcement of a formal process for editing, reviewing, approving and auditing policy changes from a single console, for one-stop, total policy lifecycle management. This helps reduce errors and facilitates policy compliance.  Workflow is currently available with R77.30.



Provisioning
Security administrators can automate device configuration and easily roll out changes using policy templates, to multiple, geographically distributed devices via a central console. Also enables quick deployment of new devices.  Provisioning is currently available with R77.30.

History[edit]
Check Point was established in Ramat-Gan, Israel in 1993, by Gil Shwed (CEO as of 2016[update]), Marius Nacht (Chairman as of 2016[update]) and Shlomo Kramer (who left Check Point in 2003).[3] Shwed had the initial idea for the company’s core technology known as stateful inspection, which became the foundation for the company's first product, FireWall-1; soon afterwards they also developed one of the world’s first VPN products, VPN-1.[4] Shwed developed the idea while serving in the Unit 8200 of the Israel Defense Forces, where he worked on securing classified networks.[5][6]
Initial funding of US$400,000 was provided by venture capital fund BRM Group.[7]
In 1994 Check Point signed an OEM agreement with Sun Microsystems,[4] followed by a distribution agreement with HP in 1995.[8] The same year, the U.S. head office was established in Redwood City, California.
By February 1996 the company was named worldwide firewall market leader by IDC, with a market share of 40 percent.[9] In June 1996 Check Point raised $67 million from its initial public offering on NASDAQ.[10]
In 1998 Check Point established a partnership with Nokia, which bundled Check Point's Software with Nokia's computer Network Security Appliances.[11]
In 2003, a class action lawsuit was filed against Check Point over violation of the Securities Exchange Act by failing to disclose major financial information.[12]
During the first decade of the 21st century Check Point started acquiring other IT security companies, including Nokia's network security business unit in 2009.[13]
Over the years many employees who worked at Check Point have left to start their own software companies. These include Shlomo Kremer, who started Imperva; Nir Zuk, who founded Palo Alto Networks; Ruvi Kitov and Reuven Harrison of Tufin; and Yonadav Leitersdorf, who founded indeni.

Acquisitions[edit]




Check Point offices, Tel Aviv



Zone Labs, makers of the ZoneAlarm personal firewall software, in 2003, for $205 million in cash and shares.[17]
Protect Data, the holding company for PointSec Mobile Technologies, in a cash deal valued at $586m in late 2006.[18] Prior to their acquisition by Check Point, Protect Data acquired Reflex Software.[19]
NFR security, an intrusion prevention system developer, for $20 million in late 2006, following its failed plan to acquire the larger IPS vendor Sourcefire.[20]
Nokia Security Appliances division was acquired in April 2009.[13]
Liquid Machines, a data security startup company based in Boston, was acquired in June 2010.[21]
Dynasec, a provider of enterprise governance, risk management, and compliance products, was acquired in November 2011. Dynasec offers a Web-based enterprise application, branded as Easy2comply, for Sarbanes-Oxley compliance, Basel II compliance, operational risk management, information security management, HIPAA compliance, and internal audit management.[22]
Hyperwise, an early-stage startup, focused on CPU Level Threat Prevention was acquired Feb 2015.[23]
Lacoon Mobile Security was acquired in April 2015.[24]

In 2005, Check Point tried to acquire intrusion prevention system developers Sourcefire for $225 million,[25] but later withdrew its offer after it became clear US authorities (specifically, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States ) would try to block the acquisition.[26]
SofaWare legal battle[edit]
SofaWare Technologies was founded in 1999, as a cooperation between Check Point and SofaWare's founders, Adi Ruppin and Etay Bogner, with the purpose of extending Check Point from the enterprise market to the small business, consumer and branch office market. SofaWare's co-founder Adi Ruppin said that his company wanted to make the technology simple to use and affordable, and to lift the burden of security management from end users while adding some features.[27] In 2001 SofaWare began selling firewall appliances under the SofaWare S-Box brand;[28] in 2002 the company started selling the Safe@Office and Safe@Home line of security appliances, under the Check Point brand.[27] By the fourth quarter of 2002 sales of SofaWare's Safe@Office firewall/VPN appliances had increased greatly, and SofaWare held the #1 revenue position in the worldwide firewall/VPN sub-$490 appliance market, with a 38% revenue market share.[29]
Relations between Check Point and the SofaWare founders went sour after the company acquisition in 2002. In 2004 Etay Bogner, co-founder of SofaWare, sought court approval to file a shareholder derivative suit, claiming Check Point was not transferring funds to SofaWare as required for its use of SofaWare's products and technology. His derivative suit was ultimately successful, and Check Point was ordered to pay SofaWare 13 million shekels for breach of contract. In 2006 the Tel Aviv District Court Judge ruled that Bogner SofaWare could sue Check Point by proxy for $5.1 million in alleged damage to SofaWare.[30] Bogner claimed that Check Point, which owned 60% of Sofaware, had behaved belligerently, and withheld monies due for use of SofaWare technology and products[30] Check Point appealed the ruling, but lost.[31]
In 2009 the Israeli Supreme Court ruled that a group of founders of SofaWare, which includes Bogner, had veto power over any decision of SofaWare. The court ruled that the three founders could exercise their veto power only as a group and by majority rule.
In 2011 Check Point settled all litigation relating to SofaWare. As part of the settlement it acquired the SofaWare shares held by Bogner and Ruppin, and began a process of acquiring the remaining shares, resulting in SofaWare becoming a wholly owned subsidiary.[32]

History[edit]
Check Point was established in Ramat-Gan, Israel in 1993, by Gil Shwed (CEO as of 2016[update]), Marius Nacht (Chairman as of 2016[update]) and Shlomo Kramer (who left Check Point in 2003).[3] Shwed had the initial idea for the company’s core technology known as stateful inspection, which became the foundation for the company's first product, FireWall-1; soon afterwards they also developed one of the world’s first VPN products, VPN-1.[4] Shwed developed the idea while serving in the Unit 8200 of the Israel Defense Forces, where he worked on securing classified networks.[5][6]
Initial funding of US$400,000 was provided by venture capital fund BRM Group.[7]
In 1994 Check Point signed an OEM agreement with Sun Microsystems,[4] followed by a distribution agreement with HP in 1995.[8] The same year, the U.S. head office was established in Redwood City, California.
By February 1996 the company was named worldwide firewall market leader by IDC, with a market share of 40 percent.[9] In June 1996 Check Point raised $67 million from its initial public offering on NASDAQ.[10]
In 1998 Check Point established a partnership with Nokia, which bundled Check Point's Software with Nokia's computer Network Security Appliances.[11]
In 2003, a class action lawsuit was filed against Check Point over violation of the Securities Exchange Act by failing to disclose major financial information.[12]
During the first decade of the 21st century Check Point started acquiring other IT security companies, including Nokia's network security business unit in 2009.[13]
Over the years many employees who worked at Check Point have left to start their own software companies. These include Shlomo Kremer, who started Imperva; Nir Zuk, who founded Palo Alto Networks; Ruvi Kitov and Reuven Harrison of Tufin; and Yonadav Leitersdorf, who founded indeni.
Products[edit]
Check Point offers the following primary products:

Network Security

Acquisitions[edit]




Check Point offices, Tel Aviv



Zone Labs, makers of the ZoneAlarm personal firewall software, in 2003, for $205 million in cash and shares.[17]
Protect Data, the holding company for PointSec Mobile Technologies, in a cash deal valued at $586m in late 2006.[18] Prior to their acquisition by Check Point, Protect Data acquired Reflex Software.[19]
NFR security, an intrusion prevention system developer, for $20 million in late 2006, following its failed plan to acquire the larger IPS vendor Sourcefire.[20]
Nokia Security Appliances division was acquired in April 2009.[13]
Liquid Machines, a data security startup company based in Boston, was acquired in June 2010.[21]
Dynasec, a provider of enterprise governance, risk management, and compliance products, was acquired in November 2011. Dynasec offers a Web-based enterprise application, branded as Easy2comply, for Sarbanes-Oxley compliance, Basel II compliance, operational risk management, information security management, HIPAA compliance, and internal audit management.[22]
Hyperwise, an early-stage startup, focused on CPU Level Threat Prevention was acquired Feb 2015.[23]
Lacoon Mobile Security was acquired in April 2015.[24]

In 2005, Check Point tried to acquire intrusion prevention system developers Sourcefire for $225 million,[25] but later withdrew its offer after it became clear US authorities (specifically, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States ) would try to block the acquisition.[26]
SofaWare legal battle[edit]
SofaWare Technologies was founded in 1999, as a cooperation between Check Point and SofaWare's founders, Adi Ruppin and Etay Bogner, with the purpose of extending Check Point from the enterprise market to the small business, consumer and branch office market. SofaWare's co-founder Adi Ruppin said that his company wanted to make the technology simple to use and affordable, and to lift the burden of security management from end users while adding some features.[27] In 2001 SofaWare began selling firewall appliances under the SofaWare S-Box brand;[28] in 2002 the company started selling the Safe@Office and Safe@Home line of security appliances, under the Check Point brand.[27] By the fourth quarter of 2002 sales of SofaWare's Safe@Office firewall/VPN appliances had increased greatly, and SofaWare held the #1 revenue position in the worldwide firewall/VPN sub-$490 appliance market, with a 38% revenue market share.[29]
Relations between Check Point and the SofaWare founders went sour after the company acquisition in 2002. In 2004 Etay Bogner, co-founder of SofaWare, sought court approval to file a shareholder derivative suit, claiming Check Point was not transferring funds to SofaWare as required for its use of SofaWare's products and technology. His derivative suit was ultimately successful, and Check Point was ordered to pay SofaWare 13 million shekels for breach of contract. In 2006 the Tel Aviv District Court Judge ruled that Bogner SofaWare could sue Check Point by proxy for $5.1 million in alleged damage to SofaWare.[30] Bogner claimed that Check Point, which owned 60% of Sofaware, had behaved belligerently, and withheld monies due for use of SofaWare technology and products[30] Check Point appealed the ruling, but lost.[31]
In 2009 the Israeli Supreme Court ruled that a group of founders of SofaWare, which includes Bogner, had veto power over any decision of SofaWare. The court ruled that the three founders could exercise their veto power only as a group and by majority rule.
In 2011 Check Point settled all litigation relating to SofaWare. As part of the settlement it acquired the SofaWare shares held by Bogner and Ruppin, and began a process of acquiring the remaining shares, resulting in SofaWare becoming a wholly owned subsidiary.[32]

SofaWare legal battle[edit]
SofaWare Technologies was founded in 1999, as a cooperation between Check Point and SofaWare's founders, Adi Ruppin and Etay Bogner, with the purpose of extending Check Point from the enterprise market to the small business, consumer and branch office market. SofaWare's co-founder Adi Ruppin said that his company wanted to make the technology simple to use and affordable, and to lift the burden of security management from end users while adding some features.[27] In 2001 SofaWare began selling firewall appliances under the SofaWare S-Box brand;[28] in 2002 the company started selling the Safe@Office and Safe@Home line of security appliances, under the Check Point brand.[27] By the fourth quarter of 2002 sales of SofaWare's Safe@Office firewall/VPN appliances had increased greatly, and SofaWare held the #1 revenue position in the worldwide firewall/VPN sub-$490 appliance market, with a 38% revenue market share.[29]
Relations between Check Point and the SofaWare founders went sour after the company acquisition in 2002. In 2004 Etay Bogner, co-founder of SofaWare, sought court approval to file a shareholder derivative suit, claiming Check Point was not transferring funds to SofaWare as required for its use of SofaWare's products and technology. His derivative suit was ultimately successful, and Check Point was ordered to pay SofaWare 13 million shekels for breach of contract. In 2006 the Tel Aviv District Court Judge ruled that Bogner SofaWare could sue Check Point by proxy for $5.1 million in alleged damage to SofaWare.[30] Bogner claimed that Check Point, which owned 60% of Sofaware, had behaved belligerently, and withheld monies due for use of SofaWare technology and products[30] Check Point appealed the ruling, but lost.[31]
In 2009 the Israeli Supreme Court ruled that a group of founders of SofaWare, which includes Bogner, had veto power over any decision of SofaWare. The court ruled that the three founders could exercise their veto power only as a group and by majority rule.
In 2011 Check Point settled all litigation relating to SofaWare. As part of the settlement it acquired the SofaWare shares held by Bogner and Ruppin, and began a process of acquiring the remaining shares, resulting in SofaWare becoming a wholly owned subsidiary.[32]

History[edit]
Check Point was established in Ramat-Gan, Israel in 1993, by Gil Shwed (CEO as of 2016[update]), Marius Nacht (Chairman as of 2016[update]) and Shlomo Kramer (who left Check Point in 2003).[3] Shwed had the initial idea for the company’s core technology known as stateful inspection, which became the foundation for the company's first product, FireWall-1; soon afterwards they also developed one of the world’s first VPN products, VPN-1.[4] Shwed developed the idea while serving in the Unit 8200 of the Israel Defense Forces, where he worked on securing classified networks.[5][6]
Initial funding of US$400,000 was provided by venture capital fund BRM Group.[7]
In 1994 Check Point signed an OEM agreement with Sun Microsystems,[4] followed by a distribution agreement with HP in 1995.[8] The same year, the U.S. head office was established in Redwood City, California.
By February 1996 the company was named worldwide firewall market leader by IDC, with a market share of 40 percent.[9] In June 1996 Check Point raised $67 million from its initial public offering on NASDAQ.[10]
In 1998 Check Point established a partnership with Nokia, which bundled Check Point's Software with Nokia's computer Network Security Appliances.[11]
In 2003, a class action lawsuit was filed against Check Point over violation of the Securities Exchange Act by failing to disclose major financial information.[12]
During the first decade of the 21st century Check Point started acquiring other IT security companies, including Nokia's network security business unit in 2009.[13]
Over the years many employees who worked at Check Point have left to start their own software companies. These include Shlomo Kremer, who started Imperva; Nir Zuk, who founded Palo Alto Networks; Ruvi Kitov and Reuven Harrison of Tufin; and Yonadav Leitersdorf, who founded indeni.

SofaWare legal battle[edit]
SofaWare Technologies was founded in 1999, as a cooperation between Check Point and SofaWare's founders, Adi Ruppin and Etay Bogner, with the purpose of extending Check Point from the enterprise market to the small business, consumer and branch office market. SofaWare's co-founder Adi Ruppin said that his company wanted to make the technology simple to use and affordable, and to lift the burden of security management from end users while adding some features.[27] In 2001 SofaWare began selling firewall appliances under the SofaWare S-Box brand;[28] in 2002 the company started selling the Safe@Office and Safe@Home line of security appliances, under the Check Point brand.[27] By the fourth quarter of 2002 sales of SofaWare's Safe@Office firewall/VPN appliances had increased greatly, and SofaWare held the #1 revenue position in the worldwide firewall/VPN sub-$490 appliance market, with a 38% revenue market share.[29]

Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.: Buy at the High?
The data security provider continues to deliver and investors are finally taking notice.

With Check Point Software (NASDAQ:CHKP) bumping up against its 52-week high following a strong earnings release, some investors may wonder if it's too late to enjoy the run. But for long-term investors, it looks like there's plenty of growth ahead of the company, particularly because of CEO Gil Shwed's leadership and how management has gone about building the business over the past couple of years.
As one of Check Point's competitors, Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW), has demonstrated Check Point's slow but steady approach to its business model isn't as easy to deliver on as one may think. 

A data security interface. Image source: Check Point.

Slow and steady
Unlike many of its peers, Check Point Software doesn't post ridiculously high year-over-year revenue gains. While Palo Alto was reporting 50%-plus sales gains for nearly two years running due in part to its rampant spending on sales and marketing, which at $226.7 million last quarter, accounted for more than half its total revenue.
For some perspective, Check Point's sales-related costs totaled just $106.2 million, less than a quarter of its total revenue. Shwed made a committed effort to build Check Point's business methodically by focusing on its recurring revenue foundation via its subscription-based model and managing overhead, and he's delivering.
Though Palo Alto has performed admirably in building its own subscription revenue and became analyst favorites, Check Point was delivering what many others weren't: steadily increasing profits. One reason is last quarter Check Point's sales and marketing  costs rose 15.7% year-over-year, while Palo Alto Networks sales-related costs jumped  24.4%. Recurring sales should result in minimal increases in sales costs and steady bottomline growth, as is the case with Check Point. But Palo Alto continues to spend, negatively impacting its own increasing subscription sales.






Check Point reported $435 million in revenue last quarter, an 8% jump compared to a year ago, about par for the course. Thanks to the combination of its sound expense management and the growth of Check Point's recurring revenue subscription sales, earnings per share increased 15% to $1.08. Palo Alto? It's per-share loss increased to $0.67 from last year's $0.66 a share. Check Point's enjoying the benefit of its low-cost, recurring revenue model while the Palo Alto's of the world continue struggling to overcome costs, minimizing the benefits of an on-going revenue model..

Check Point's subscription revenue still doesn't equal that of its product and license sales, but the gap is narrowing with each passing quarter. Product and license sales equaled $126.3 million last quarter, up 3% over last year. Software subscription revenue contributed $112 million to Check Point's sales, a stellar 27% improvement.
The balance of Check Point's revenue, $197 million, was derived from software updates and maintenance, which should also continue climbing given its software subscription emphasis. The result of Shwed's recurring-revenue focus is it helps keep expenses to a minimum assuming its executing, which Check Point is, because over time it costs less to service existing customers than to continually drum up more product sales.
Yin and yang
The systematic approach to growth Check Point has opted for doesn't warrant a lot of hoopla. It's just a reliable, steady process that investors can rely on for years to come. While Palo Alto is enduring the inevitable slowing of top-line growth yet is still spending indiscriminately, Check Point keeps chugging along.
The more conservative path Check Point has chosen is proving worthwhile. As more pundits and investors take notice of what Shwed and team are doing, shareholders are reaping the rewards, to the tune of a 30% jump in value this year.





At the other end of the spectrum are providers such as Palo Alto. Now that Palo Alto is no longer an analyst darling because of its continually slowing sales growth, its shares are down 3.5% this year.
Yes, Check Point stock is flying high, but the manner in which it's finally won over investors is highly sustainable, so there's no reason to think it will change anytime soon. In fact, at the mid-range of Check Point's revenue guidance of $440 million to $465 million for this quarter, investors can expect its "usual" 7% year-over-year improvement. Check Point has forecast per-share earnings excluding one-time items of $1.17 to $1.25 a share, which would be a 32% increase over last year's $0.95. 
Considering its increasing quarterly profits and expectations for more, its conservative expense management, and a position in an industry that's expected to grow for years to come, Check Point remains a buy, even at the high.

CHECK PRINTING SOFTWARE BASICS
Is it legal to write and print check from my printer?

Yes, writing and printing checks from your own printer is perfectly legal. However, you must print checks on special check paper. 


Do I need special toner to print checks?

If you have pre-printed checks with MICR line, you can use any printer. If you need to print checks on blank stock, we suggest customers to use MICR (Magnetic Ink Character Recognition) toner and MICR ink for the best printing quality. However, many US bank are using Optical check reader today which can scan the checks printed on blank stock with regular office/home laser printers. A jet or dot matrix printer CAN'T be used to print checks on blank check stock.

However, checks must be printed on special check paper. 


What kind of blank check paper is acceptable for check printing?

DO NOT use plain paper for check printing! Blank check stock has security features (watermarks, micro printing, etc.) which help prevent fraud. ezCheckPrinting cheque software will work with any blank computer check paper with 8-1/2" X 11" size and check on top with size 8-1/2" X 3-1/2", check on middle with size 8-1/2" X 3-1/2", check on bottom with size 8-1/2" X 3-1/2"or 3 checks per page. Or you can print check on pre-printed checks (by uncheck the top check box on Check Setup form).



Does this check writing software print MICR encoding on checks?

Yes.ezCheckPrinting cheque software does print checks with the MICR encoding. You can print MICR bank routing numbers, account numbers, check numbers and bank information on blank check stock using a laser printer.
	

What are the system requirements for ezCheckPrinting check writer?


Windows XP, 2003, Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, 10
.Net Framework v1.1 or later

ezCheckPrinting check writer can run on both 32-bit and 64-bit machines.				

	
ABOUT PURCHASE
Is the check out process safe?

Yes.
The payment is done by PayPal official site. We do not store your credit card number
						The payment is secure under SSL with 128bit encryption (Learn more about PayPal Encryption ).
						With PayPal you also have fraud insurance (Learn more about PayPal Buyer Protection). 

How long it takes to get the license key?

Our system will send the check printing software download link and license key to your email account after the transaction is completed. Usually, you can get it in 1 to 5 minutes depending on how often your mailbox is updated.
							
							Some mail servers may block messages sent by machine. If you cannot find the key in your Inbox folder or Junk Mail folder after one hour, please contact us at services@halfpricesoft.com. We are glad to send the key to you manually.

	

HOW IT WORKS
How to setup bank account inside this check writer?





						On check setup page, you can do:
Uncheck the "Use Blank Check Stock" check box to print check on preprinted check. The default is checked.
Specify the bank information: Bank name, addresses, transit code, Routing Number, Bank Account.

Unlimted Accounts and Unlimited Checks with One Flat Rate. No Hidden Cost
How to Print QuickBooks Checks on Blank Stock 
 




















Never order expensive pre-printed blank checks for QuickBooks. With ezCheckPrinting software and QuickBooks virtual printer, you can print checks faster and less expensively.
ezCheckPrinting QB version can work with QuickBooks online, 2017, 2016, 2015 and previous versions on Windows machines.
You can print checks and stubs on blank stock in one step. 
You can print Pre-printed check with MICR encoding to fill in manually later
You can print checks with logo, signature and extra labels.
You can print check draft to collect fund via phone, fax and internet
ezCheckPrinting single user version can support multiple accounts on the same machine with no extra charge. We also have multiple-user network version available for customers who need to print QB checks from multiple machines.
No monthly fee or annual fee.



Note: For QuickBooks online version customers, ADOBE or ADOBE compatible PDF reader is required to print checks correctly. Otherwise, you may get "Index was out of bounds of array" or other error. Learn more here


You can print QuickBooks checks on blank stock in one step! EzCheckPrinting works with QuickBooks online, desktop and network versions.


Step 1: Install both ezCheckPrinting and Virtual Printer for QuickBooks.
To print checks from QuickBooks and Quicken (no matter desktop version, network version or online version), you need to install both ezCheckPrinting and Virtual Printer on your local machine

You can try ezCheckPrinting and virtual printer for free with no obligation before purchasing. However, the trial version will print TRIAL images on checks. You can purchase the key code 
later to remove it. All the data you entered in the trial version will stay there.
1.1 Download ezCheckPrinting application
http://www.halfpricesoft.com/check_printing_software_download.asp
1.2 Download ezCheckPrinting virtual Printer for QuickBooks
http://www.halfpricesoft.com/business_check_software/quickbooks_check_writer_dowload.asp


Step 2: Run ezCheckPrinting application at least once and print a test check to make sure both ezCheckPrinting and your printer work

- You need to use a real physical printer to print test checks in this step. (Do not use the QB virtual printer)

- If you need to print check with 3-per-page format, please specify the check position in step 2.2


2.1 Start ezCheckPrinting
The virtual printer will call ezCheckPrinting CheckPrint() function to print check(s) from QuickBooks and Quicken. So you need to run ezCheckPrinting software at least once before you can print checks from QuickBooks. 
You can click the desktop shortcut to start ezCheckPrinting application.



If you have not purchased the key code, you can use the trial version.


2.2 Set up Account
For testing purpose, you can use the test data without setting up your bank account. If you need to set up bank account or customize your check, please make sure you checked the option to use blank stock on check set up screen. You can access this screen by clicking ezCheckPrinting top menu "Settings", then the sub menu "check setup". You can select "Top" or "3-per-page" for check position field. 


2.3 Add and print one test check

You MUST select voucher check or 1 per page format in this step. If you need to print checks in different formats such as 3-per-page, you can specify the check format inside ezCheckPrinting in step 2.2. (Learn more about how to print checks on 3-per-page sheets) 

- for desktop version 


- for online version

3.2 If you are using trial version, you will see the key input pop up window. Once you enter the key code, you will not see it again.
You should copy and paste the key code including "-" for ezCheckPrinting virtual printer here. (Note: the key codes for ezCheckPrinting and virtual printer are different. When you purchase ezCheckPrinting QuickBooks version, you will see two key codes in the key message. Please use the right one)


3.3 You can switch account and printer in this step





If you cannot see the pop up screen in step 3.2 or 3.3, you can check your status bar. Usually you can click the ezCheckPrinting virtual printer icon on status bar to make it visible.





3.4 Print preview check. If you like the result, click the printer icon to print QuickBooks checks on blank stock.




Still have questions?

1. If you are using QuickBooks online verison, please make sure you are using ADOBE or ADOBE compatible PDF driver as the default PDF printer for your browser. Otherwise, you may get "Index out of bounds of array" error when you print the checks. You can learn more here

CHECK PRINTING SOFTWARE BASICS
Is it legal to write and print check from my printer?

Yes, writing and printing checks from your own printer is perfectly legal. However, you must print checks on special check paper. 


Do I need special toner to print checks?

If you have pre-printed checks with MICR line, you can use any printer. If you need to print checks on blank stock, we suggest customers to use MICR (Magnetic Ink Character Recognition) toner and MICR ink for the best printing quality. However, many US bank are using Optical check reader today which can scan the checks printed on blank stock with regular office/home laser printers. A jet or dot matrix printer CAN'T be used to print checks on blank check stock.

However, checks must be printed on special check paper. 


What kind of blank check paper is acceptable for check printing?

DO NOT use plain paper for check printing! Blank check stock has security features (watermarks, micro printing, etc.) which help prevent fraud. ezCheckPrinting cheque software will work with any blank computer check paper with 8-1/2" X 11" size and check on top with size 8-1/2" X 3-1/2", check on middle with size 8-1/2" X 3-1/2", check on bottom with size 8-1/2" X 3-1/2"or 3 checks per page. Or you can print check on pre-printed checks (by uncheck the top check box on Check Setup form).



Does this check writing software print MICR encoding on checks?

Yes.ezCheckPrinting cheque software does print checks with the MICR encoding. You can print MICR bank routing numbers, account numbers, check numbers and bank information on blank check stock using a laser printer.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

History[edit]
Check Point was established in Ramat-Gan, Israel in 1993, by Gil Shwed (CEO as of 2016[update]), Marius Nacht (Chairman as of 2016[update]) and Shlomo Kramer (who left Check Point in 2003).[3] Shwed had the initial idea for the company’s core technology known as stateful inspection, which became the foundation for the company's first product, FireWall-1; soon afterwards they also developed one of the world’s first VPN products, VPN-1.[4] Shwed developed the idea while serving in the Unit 8200 of the Israel Defense Forces, where he worked on securing classified networks.[5][6]
Initial funding of US$400,000 was provided by venture capital fund BRM Group.[7]
In 1994 Check Point signed an OEM agreement with Sun Microsystems,[4] followed by a distribution agreement with HP in 1995.[8] The same year, the U.S. head office was established in Redwood City, California.
By February 1996 the company was named worldwide firewall market leader by IDC, with a market share of 40 percent.[9] In June 1996 Check Point raised $67 million from its initial public offering on NASDAQ.[10]
In 1998 Check Point established a partnership with Nokia, which bundled Check Point's Software with Nokia's computer Network Security Appliances.[11]
In 2003, a class action lawsuit was filed against Check Point over violation of the Securities Exchange Act by failing to disclose major financial information.[12]
During the first decade of the 21st century Check Point started acquiring other IT security companies, including Nokia's network security business unit in 2009.[13]
Over the years many employees who worked at Check Point have left to start their own software companies. These include Shlomo Kremer, who started Imperva; Nir Zuk, who founded Palo Alto Networks; Ruvi Kitov and Reuven Harrison of Tufin; and Yonadav Leitersdorf, who founded indeni.

Acquisitions[edit]




Check Point offices, Tel Aviv



Zone Labs, makers of the ZoneAlarm personal firewall software, in 2003, for $205 million in cash and shares.[17]
Protect Data, the holding company for PointSec Mobile Technologies, in a cash deal valued at $586m in late 2006.[18] Prior to their acquisition by Check Point, Protect Data acquired Reflex Software.[19]
NFR security, an intrusion prevention system developer, for $20 million in late 2006, following its failed plan to acquire the larger IPS vendor Sourcefire.[20]
Nokia Security Appliances division was acquired in April 2009.[13]
Liquid Machines, a data security startup company based in Boston, was acquired in June 2010.[21]
Dynasec, a provider of enterprise governance, risk management, and compliance products, was acquired in November 2011. Dynasec offers a Web-based enterprise application, branded as Easy2comply, for Sarbanes-Oxley compliance, Basel II compliance, operational risk management, information security management, HIPAA compliance, and internal audit management.[22]
Hyperwise, an early-stage startup, focused on CPU Level Threat Prevention was acquired Feb 2015.[23]
Lacoon Mobile Security was acquired in April 2015.[24]

In 2005, Check Point tried to acquire intrusion prevention system developers Sourcefire for $225 million,[25] but later withdrew its offer after it became clear US authorities (specifically, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States ) would try to block the acquisition.[26]
SofaWare legal battle[edit]
SofaWare Technologies was founded in 1999, as a cooperation between Check Point and SofaWare's founders, Adi Ruppin and Etay Bogner, with the purpose of extending Check Point from the enterprise market to the small business, consumer and branch office market. SofaWare's co-founder Adi Ruppin said that his company wanted to make the technology simple to use and affordable, and to lift the burden of security management from end users while adding some features.[27] In 2001 SofaWare began selling firewall appliances under the SofaWare S-Box brand;[28] in 2002 the company started selling the Safe@Office and Safe@Home line of security appliances, under the Check Point brand.[27] By the fourth quarter of 2002 sales of SofaWare's Safe@Office firewall/VPN appliances had increased greatly, and SofaWare held the #1 revenue position in the worldwide firewall/VPN sub-$490 appliance market, with a 38% revenue market share.[29]
Relations between Check Point and the SofaWare founders went sour after the company acquisition in 2002. In 2004 Etay Bogner, co-founder of SofaWare, sought court approval to file a shareholder derivative suit, claiming Check Point was not transferring funds to SofaWare as required for its use of SofaWare's products and technology. His derivative suit was ultimately successful, and Check Point was ordered to pay SofaWare 13 million shekels for breach of contract. In 2006 the Tel Aviv District Court Judge ruled that Bogner SofaWare could sue Check Point by proxy for $5.1 million in alleged damage to SofaWare.[30] Bogner claimed that Check Point, which owned 60% of Sofaware, had behaved belligerently, and withheld monies due for use of SofaWare technology and products[30] Check Point appealed the ruling, but lost.[31]
In 2009 the Israeli Supreme Court ruled that a group of founders of SofaWare, which includes Bogner, had veto power over any decision of SofaWare. The court ruled that the three founders could exercise their veto power only as a group and by majority rule.
In 2011 Check Point settled all litigation relating to SofaWare. As part of the settlement it acquired the SofaWare shares held by Bogner and Ruppin, and began a process of acquiring the remaining shares, resulting in SofaWare becoming a wholly owned subsidiary.[32]

SofaWare legal battle[edit]
SofaWare Technologies was founded in 1999, as a cooperation between Check Point and SofaWare's founders, Adi Ruppin and Etay Bogner, with the purpose of extending Check Point from the enterprise market to the small business, consumer and branch office market. SofaWare's co-founder Adi Ruppin said that his company wanted to make the technology simple to use and affordable, and to lift the burden of security management from end users while adding some features.[27] In 2001 SofaWare began selling firewall appliances under the SofaWare S-Box brand;[28] in 2002 the company started selling the Safe@Office and Safe@Home line of security appliances, under the Check Point brand.[27] By the fourth quarter of 2002 sales of SofaWare's Safe@Office firewall/VPN appliances had increased greatly, and SofaWare held the #1 revenue position in the worldwide firewall/VPN sub-$490 appliance market, with a 38% revenue market share.[29]
Relations between Check Point and the SofaWare founders went sour after the company acquisition in 2002. In 2004 Etay Bogner, co-founder of SofaWare, sought court approval to file a shareholder derivative suit, claiming Check Point was not transferring funds to SofaWare as required for its use of SofaWare's products and technology. His derivative suit was ultimately successful, and Check Point was ordered to pay SofaWare 13 million shekels for breach of contract. In 2006 the Tel Aviv District Court Judge ruled that Bogner SofaWare could sue Check Point by proxy for $5.1 million in alleged damage to SofaWare.[30] Bogner claimed that Check Point, which owned 60% of Sofaware, had behaved belligerently, and withheld monies due for use of SofaWare technology and products[30] Check Point appealed the ruling, but lost.[31]
In 2009 the Israeli Supreme Court ruled that a group of founders of SofaWare, which includes Bogner, had veto power over any decision of SofaWare. The court ruled that the three founders could exercise their veto power only as a group and by majority rule.
In 2011 Check Point settled all litigation relating to SofaWare. As part of the settlement it acquired the SofaWare shares held by Bogner and Ruppin, and began a process of acquiring the remaining shares, resulting in SofaWare becoming a wholly owned subsidiary.[32]

History[edit]
Check Point was established in Ramat-Gan, Israel in 1993, by Gil Shwed (CEO as of 2016[update]), Marius Nacht (Chairman as of 2016[update]) and Shlomo Kramer (who left Check Point in 2003).[3] Shwed had the initial idea for the company’s core technology known as stateful inspection, which became the foundation for the company's first product, FireWall-1; soon afterwards they also developed one of the world’s first VPN products, VPN-1.[4] Shwed developed the idea while serving in the Unit 8200 of the Israel Defense Forces, where he worked on securing classified networks.[5][6]
Initial funding of US$400,000 was provided by venture capital fund BRM Group.[7]
In 1994 Check Point signed an OEM agreement with Sun Microsystems,[4] followed by a distribution agreement with HP in 1995.[8] The same year, the U.S. head office was established in Redwood City, California.
By February 1996 the company was named worldwide firewall market leader by IDC, with a market share of 40 percent.[9] In June 1996 Check Point raised $67 million from its initial public offering on NASDAQ.[10]
In 1998 Check Point established a partnership with Nokia, which bundled Check Point's Software with Nokia's computer Network Security Appliances.[11]
In 2003, a class action lawsuit was filed against Check Point over violation of the Securities Exchange Act by failing to disclose major financial information.[12]
During the first decade of the 21st century Check Point started acquiring other IT security companies, including Nokia's network security business unit in 2009.[13]
Over the years many employees who worked at Check Point have left to start their own software companies. These include Shlomo Kremer, who started Imperva; Nir Zuk, who founded Palo Alto Networks; Ruvi Kitov and Reuven Harrison of Tufin; and Yonadav Leitersdorf, who founded indeni.

Acquisitions[edit]




Check Point offices, Tel Aviv



Zone Labs, makers of the ZoneAlarm personal firewall software, in 2003, for $205 million in cash and shares.[17]
Protect Data, the holding company for PointSec Mobile Technologies, in a cash deal valued at $586m in late 2006.[18] Prior to their acquisition by Check Point, Protect Data acquired Reflex Software.[19]
NFR security, an intrusion prevention system developer, for $20 million in late 2006, following its failed plan to acquire the larger IPS vendor Sourcefire.[20]
Nokia Security Appliances division was acquired in April 2009.[13]
Liquid Machines, a data security startup company based in Boston, was acquired in June 2010.[21]
Dynasec, a provider of enterprise governance, risk management, and compliance products, was acquired in November 2011. Dynasec offers a Web-based enterprise application, branded as Easy2comply, for Sarbanes-Oxley compliance, Basel II compliance, operational risk management, information security management, HIPAA compliance, and internal audit management.[22]
Hyperwise, an early-stage startup, focused on CPU Level Threat Prevention was acquired Feb 2015.[23]
Lacoon Mobile Security was acquired in April 2015.[24]

In 2005, Check Point tried to acquire intrusion prevention system developers Sourcefire for $225 million,[25] but later withdrew its offer after it became clear US authorities (specifically, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States ) would try to block the acquisition.[26]
SofaWare legal battle[edit]
SofaWare Technologies was founded in 1999, as a cooperation between Check Point and SofaWare's founders, Adi Ruppin and Etay Bogner, with the purpose of extending Check Point from the enterprise market to the small business, consumer and branch office market. SofaWare's co-founder Adi Ruppin said that his company wanted to make the technology simple to use and affordable, and to lift the burden of security management from end users while adding some features.[27] In 2001 SofaWare began selling firewall appliances under the SofaWare S-Box brand;[28] in 2002 the company started selling the Safe@Office and Safe@Home line of security appliances, under the Check Point brand.[27] By the fourth quarter of 2002 sales of SofaWare's Safe@Office firewall/VPN appliances had increased greatly, and SofaWare held the #1 revenue position in the worldwide firewall/VPN sub-$490 appliance market, with a 38% revenue market share.[29]
Relations between Check Point and the SofaWare founders went sour after the company acquisition in 2002. In 2004 Etay Bogner, co-founder of SofaWare, sought court approval to file a shareholder derivative suit, claiming Check Point was not transferring funds to SofaWare as required for its use of SofaWare's products and technology. His derivative suit was ultimately successful, and Check Point was ordered to pay SofaWare 13 million shekels for breach of contract. In 2006 the Tel Aviv District Court Judge ruled that Bogner SofaWare could sue Check Point by proxy for $5.1 million in alleged damage to SofaWare.[30] Bogner claimed that Check Point, which owned 60% of Sofaware, had behaved belligerently, and withheld monies due for use of SofaWare technology and products[30] Check Point appealed the ruling, but lost.[31]
In 2009 the Israeli Supreme Court ruled that a group of founders of SofaWare, which includes Bogner, had veto power over any decision of SofaWare. The court ruled that the three founders could exercise their veto power only as a group and by majority rule.
In 2011 Check Point settled all litigation relating to SofaWare. As part of the settlement it acquired the SofaWare shares held by Bogner and Ruppin, and began a process of acquiring the remaining shares, resulting in SofaWare becoming a wholly owned subsidiary.[32]

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:
