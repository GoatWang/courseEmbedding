Editorial Reviews


Publishers Weekly
Thomas, food editor at the Orange County Register, along with  the proprietors of Melissa's World Variety Produce, a major  distributor of specialty fruits and vegetables, has created a  comprehensive-but not overwhelming-manual that explains how to  find, store, prepare and serve fruits, from Asian pear to yuzu,  and vegetables, from artichoke to yu choy sum. Brilliant color  photos render the food tantalizing and make it easy for readers  to identify the produce piled high in their grocery store's  aisles. Thomas explains the differences between varieties of  grapes, mushrooms, onions and peas (check for scent, heft,  texture and hue) and provides a primer on the exotic horned  melon, with recipes for using it in margaritas, on ice cream and  in salad dressing. Her tone is affable and knowledgeable  ("Basically, quince look like squatty pears"), and her recipes  are creative yet not too complicated. A glossary of "gizmos"  includes instructions for segmenting citrus and using other  tools. This is an excellent resource and valuable tool for cooks  experienced and amateur; the only improvement might be a  pocket-sized edition for easy toting to the grocery store. (Mar.)

Publishers Weekly
Starred Review. In this invaluable guide to fresh produce, food columnist Thomas (Melissa's Great Book of Produce) proceeds alphabetically through 56 popular fruits and vegetables, offering tips on varieties, buying year-round, and proper prep and storage. The real bounty, though, is the recipes-more than 400-that give readers copious suggestions for those persimmons, leeks, or eggplants that look so tempting at the market, and so perplexing on the kitchen counter. While obvious applications such as salads are included, Thomas's recipes are anything but phoned-in: cooks with too many cherries can use them in Cherry, Chocolate and Toasted Almond Ice Cream or as a relish for a grilled pork tenderloin; fresh ginger can be used to liven up Chicken Saté with Peanut Sauce and Cucumber Raita; and even the spinach-averse will reconsider when facing Linguine with Baby Spinach and Blue Cheese, complemented by toasted pine nuts, fresh basil, and prosciutto. Thomas even ventures beyond mains and sides to include a tasty Kiwi Martini and White Sangria, as well as a Nectarine Barbecue Sauce, basic carrot vinaigrette, and easy-to-accomplish pickled shallots.
