A History of Dependability
 
For more than 75 years, Global Partners LP, its subsidiaries and their predecessors have served the energy needs of businesses, industrial enterprises and government agencies throughout the Northeast. We have grown with our customers.  Today, Global Partners LP, a FORTUNE 500 company, is a leader in the storage, distribution and marketing of energy products across the Northeast.
For decades we have served a diverse base of customers, including, in part, independent heating oil dealers, gasoline and diesel fuel distributors, state and municipal agencies, public utilities and large commercial organizations. Our expertise in traditional and emerging fuel markets enables us to be at the forefront of competitive, reliable energy supply.
Today, with a portfolio of approximately 800 owned or supplied gas stations under a variety of brands including Mobil, Exxon, Shell, Sunoco, Gulf, CITGO and Global, we also count millions of consumers among our customers. These stations are operated by our recently acquired Alliance Energy retail division, a premier owner and operator of gasoline stations and convenience stores and a leading gasoline distributor. Together, we are committed to provide the highest quality fuel products to meet all of your driving needs.  
For additional information please contact the Global Marketing Department  or by calling 800-685-7222.

This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Global Partners to Utilize Kalibrate Pricing
More than 800 locations to use daily pricing and management operations.

February 4, 2015, 02:05 pm



 



WALTHAM, Mass. — Global Partners LP selected Kalibrate Pricing to support pricing strategy and execution across its network of more than 800 retail fuel locations. As it continues to expand its gas station-related business, the master limited partnership will use the end-to-end pricing solution to support its daily fuel pricing and management operations.
"Kalibrate Pricing will help us further enhance efficiencies and enable us to quickly make optimal pricing decisions in response to changing market conditions," said Global Partners' Executive Vice President Andrew Slifka. "It is an effective pricing tool to support the ongoing growth of our retail fuel business."
The company plans to use features of Kalibrate Pricing that include automated pricing, integration to store systems such as point-of-sale, analytics, map-based visualization, and mobile functionality on smart devices and tablets. Global Partners will also use Kalbrate's managed hosting services to provide full software application and information technology (IT) support.

"We are excited that Global Partners has selected Kalibrate's retail fuel pricing program," said Bob Stein, president and chief executive officer of Florham Park, N.J.-based Kalibrate Technologies plc. "We are also delighted that Global Partners has chosen to take advantage of our managed hosting services to complement its existing IT infrastructure."
Waltham-based Global Partners owns, supplies and operates nearly 1,500 convenience stores and gas stations, primarily in the Northeast.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
