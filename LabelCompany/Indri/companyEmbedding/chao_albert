Now I'd like to turn the call over to Albert Chao. Albert?
Albert Yuan Chao - Westlake Chemical Corp.
Thank you, Ben. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us on our earnings call to discuss our first quarter results. In this morning's press release, we reported quarterly net income of $138 million, or $1.06 per diluted share, on net sales of $1.9 billion. Our first quarter results are a record for sales of $1.9 billion and EBITDA of $390 million, and reflect the strength of our business, which benefited from improving economic conditions.
The first quarter saw higher sales prices for our products, which follow improving demand that reflects the strengthening of global economies. We are pleased with our first quarter results despite the impact of the planned turnaround at our Calvert City, Kentucky vinyls facility, the Geismar, Louisiana chlor-alkali plant, other planned outages and integration-related items.
During the quarter, we performed maintenance work on a number of our plants to improve operational performance and started the expansion work in our Calvert City ethylene plant. That, along with other incremental projects, added 100 million pounds of ethylene production capacity, which we recently completed in April. This expansion utilizes low-cost ethane feedstock from the Marcellus Shale basin.
Thanks to the ongoing dedication and efforts of our employees, we continued to make good progress in our Axiall integration and remain on track to capture the $120 million of synergies and cost savings this year that we have previously communicated.
Our operational performance program that was launched after we closed the transaction in August of 2016 to review the Axiall assets and identify areas for operational improvements is well underway. We are already seeing the benefit from these efforts. We continue to focus on improving the safe and reliable performance of our assets, and derive the value from these efforts.
I would now like to turn our call over to Steve to provide more detail on the financial and operating results.
Mark Steven Bender - Westlake Chemical Corp.
Albert, and good morning, everyone. I will start with discussing our consolidated financial results followed by a detailed review of our Olefins and Vinyls segment results. Let me begin with our consolidated results.
This morning, Westlake reported net income for the first quarter of 2017 of $138 million, or $1.06 per diluted share, on net sales of $1.9 billion. Our first quarter results were higher compared to the first quarter 2016 due to higher sales prices for our major products, resulting in improved margins and from earnings contributed from Axiall. First quarter results benefited from a lower quarterly effective tax rate that was primarily due to a nonrecurring adjustment of $4 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, and a lower estimated annual tax rate for 2017 as compared to the prior year.
The first quarter results also included pre-tax unabsorbed fixed manufacturing and other costs associated with the turnaround and expansion of the Calvert City ethylene unit, and other planned turnarounds and unplanned outages totaling approximately $36 million, or $0.19 per diluted share; the lost sales associated with these turnarounds of approximately $33 million pre-tax, or $0.18 per diluted share; and pre-tax transaction and integrated-related costs of approximately $8 million, for $0.04 per diluted share associated with the acquisition.
First quarter 2017 net sales of $1.9 billion were driven by sales contributed by Axiall and higher sales prices for all of our major products. Operating income of $235 million for the first quarter of 2017 also benefited from higher sales prices for all of our major products, which resulted in higher integrated product margins and from the earnings contributed following the Axiall acquisition. This was primarily offset by unabsorbed fixed manufacturing and other cost and lost sales associated with the turnaround expansion of our Calvert City ethylene unit, and other planned turnaround and unplanned outages that took place in the first quarter of 2017, which totaled to the $69 million that I previously mentioned.

Compared to the same period last year, we saw improved operating performance in the first quarter from our acquired assets, as our recent investments to address previously deferred maintenance are already delivering higher operating rates and improved reliability.
Compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, sales revenue in the first quarter of 2017 of $1.9 billion and income from operations of $235 million both increased. First quarter 2017 sales benefited from higher sales volumes for all of our major products and higher sales prices for caustic and North American PVC resin. The improvement in operating income was due to increased sales volumes for all of our major products, higher Olefins and Vinyls integrated margins and lower integration costs as compared to the prior quarter.
Our utilization of a FIFO method of accounting resulted in a favorable impact of approximately $24 million pre-tax, or $0.13 per share in the first quarter compared to what earnings would have been reported on the LIFO method. This calculation is only an estimate and has not been audited.
Now let's move on to review the performance of our two segments, starting with our Olefins segment. In the first quarter of 2017, the Olefins segment reported operating income of $180 million on net sales of $543 million. Net sales increased from the first quarter 2016 as we saw sales prices for our major products improve, along with sales volumes for polyethylene and ethylene.
Operating income also increased over the same period, driven by higher olefins integrated product margins following the increase in sales prices for our major products, and higher polyethylene and ethylene sales volumes, partially offset by higher feedstock and energy prices. Compared to the fourth quarter, first quarter net sales and income from operations both increased. The improved results followed the increase in average sales prices and from higher polyethylene and styrene sales volumes, partially offset by higher feedstock and energy cost.
Now moving on to the Vinyls segment. The Vinyls segment reported operating income of $71 million in the first quarter of 2017 and net sales of $1.4 billion, both which improved as compared to the first quarter of 2016. Net sales increased due to sales contributed by Axiall, higher sales prices for PVC resin, higher caustic and building products sales volumes, and higher European sales prices for PVC resin and caustic soda. The improvement in operating income was a result of higher PVC sales prices and earnings contributed by Axiall. These increases were partially offset by the lower production rates and costs associated with the Calvert City planned turnaround and expansion and other planned turnarounds by higher feedstock and energy prices during the current quarter.
When compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, operating income improved by $33 million while sales improved by $130 million. The improved results were driven by higher sales volumes from all of our major products and higher caustic and PVC sales prices, partially offset by higher energy costs.
The first quarter 2017 was negatively impacted by the planned turnarounds and expansion of our Calvert City ethylene unit and other planned turnarounds, while the fourth quarter 2016 was negatively impacted by the planned turnaround of our Lake Charles vinyls chlor-alkali unit and other planned turnarounds and unplanned outages. The first quarter 2017 also benefited from lower integration-related expenses compared to the prior quarter.
Now let's turn our attention to our balance sheet and cash flow. For the first quarter of 2017, cash generated from operating activities was $157 million, and we invested $134 million in capital expenditures. At the end of the first quarter, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $382 million, and our total debt was approximately $3.6 billion. We will continue to prudently manage our balance sheet and continue our planned investments to address deferred maintenance.

Now allow me to provide some updated guidance for modeling purposes. We will continue our efforts that began last year to improve our operational performance. Our current maintenance plan includes several planned outages that will impact our second quarter earnings by approximately $60 million. This number reflects the higher maintenance expenses that will be incurred for these outages along with the associated lost sales. Also note that the second quarter guidance includes the impact from a recently completed Calvert City ethylene unit expansion and turnaround.
In the second half of the year, we expect an impact of $50 million as we continue our maintenance effort to improve reliability and performance. We will continue to assess our planned turnarounds and maintenance activity, and we will provide more guidance on our next earnings call.
Moving on to capital spending, our current estimate for 2017 capital expenditures remains in the range of $550 million to $600 million. This includes capital for our Calvert City ethylene unit expansion that we recently completed, and also includes our investment in the Lotte ethylene joint venture. These capital and maintenance investments improve our reliability and competitiveness of our plants. We estimate that our 2017 effective annual tax rate for the year will be approximately 30% and our cash tax rate will be approximately 25%.
We are on track to capture the synergies and cost savings of $200 million that we previously announced, and remain on track to capture approximately $125 million of these savings this year while expensing around $25 million to achieve these savings.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Albert to make some closing comments. Albert?
Albert Yuan Chao - Westlake Chemical Corp.
Thank you, Steve. We saw improving fundamentals in the first quarter as we benefited from higher sales prices and integrated product margins along with solid demand for our end products. We continue to focus on capturing synergies related to our Axiall acquisition and are investing to improve the operational reliability and competitiveness of our assets.
Looking further into 2017, we expect to see greater ethylene availability as the new ethylene plant starts up and capacity expansions are completed to take advantage of the low-cost North American shale-based oil and gas production. We also see favorable underlying demand trends continuing through 2017 for all of our major products, including chlor-alkali.
We are seeing some chlor-alkali capacity reductions in North America, and there have been no new plans announced. Additionally, the European regulatory authorities have mandated that mercury-based chlorine production must shut down or convert to another technology by the end of the year, which will lead to capacity reduction in the region.
We believe that Westlake is well positioned to benefit from these market developments. The first quarter marked an important milestone in our efforts to improve the plant's reliability, performance and competitiveness of our recently acquired assets. We still have work ahead of us in 2017, and we have a strong management team in place to deliver the improvements to our operations that will drive growth in our bottom line. Thank you very much for listening to our earnings call this morning.
Now I will turn the call back over to Ben.
L. Benjamin Ederington - Westlake Chemical Corp.
Thank you, Albert. Before we begin taking questions, I would like to remind you that a replay of the teleconference will be available starting two hours after we conclude the call. We will provide that number again at the end of the call. Operator, we will now take questions.

And the first question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov from Nomura Instinet. Your line is now open.

Matthew S. Skowronski - Nomura Instinet
Morning. This is Matt Skowronski, on for Aleksey today.
Albert Yuan Chao - Westlake Chemical Corp.
Good morning.
Mark Steven Bender - Westlake Chemical Corp.
Good morning.
Matthew S. Skowronski - Nomura Instinet
Was your planned three-week shutdown of Calvert City completed in the first quarter, or did this extend at all into the second quarter?
Mark Steven Bender - Westlake Chemical Corp.
It moved to the middle of the 2nd of April.
Matthew S. Skowronski - Nomura Instinet
Okay. All right. And then can you describe what your expectations are for styrene pricing for the rest of the year?
Albert Yuan Chao - Westlake Chemical Corp.
Well, as you know, the styrene price has benefited from some of the strong demand and supply issues around the world. And since then, benzene prices has come down and styrene prices has also dropped from its high. If you're looking at CDI's forecast, that they're looking at styrene prices to remain in this range for the rest of the year, maybe a little bit higher than the April price, but I think the rest of the year looks like pretty much flat in the area.
Matthew S. Skowronski - Nomura Instinet
Thank you.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial. Your line is now open.
Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP
Thank you. A question on your deferred maintenance and other spending. So Steve, it looks like it's not up that much, sort of totals up to $179 million despite â I would have thought that your lost volumes would have cost you more with the increase in prices that we've seen in the marketplace.
Mark Steven Bender - Westlake Chemical Corp.
Well, Don, we attempted to give as good an estimate as we could. And you're right, the increase was close to our estimate of $60 million for the first quarter, came in at $69 million.
Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP
Okay. And a question on pricing realization. So we saw the March Caustic Index up 10, April up 45. Two questions, how long does it take you to realize those index increases? And how much of your business is tied to indexes now versus how much is non-index?
Albert Yuan Chao - Westlake Chemical Corp.
Index is a small portion of our business, even though it plays an important position in the industry.
Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP
So you should see some fairly meaningful caustic increases in Q2 then?
Albert Yuan Chao - Westlake Chemical Corp.
Yeah, we would expect to have â yes.
Mark Steven Bender - Westlake Chemical Corp.
That's right.
Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP
Okay. Thank you.

And our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research. Your line is now open.
Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners
Yes. Good morning.
Albert Yuan Chao - Westlake Chemical Corp.
Good morning.
Mark Steven Bender - Westlake Chemical Corp.
Good morning.
Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners
We've seen lumber prices increased quite a bit in response to the tariff increase proposals. Do you expect that to have any impact on PVC resin or building materials, either in the U.S. or Canada moving forward?
Albert Yuan Chao - Westlake Chemical Corp.
Certainly, they will have some advantage. As you know, most of the PVC goes into the pipe area, which lumber would not have impact. But on PVC sidings, they do compete with lumber. And I think now is the season that building construction's going into higher gear with the improving weather. So we will see that some of the resin price increases in PVC will pass through more easily into the sidings area.
Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners

I see. And then second question, if I may, we saw the Williams cracker trade since your last conference call. What are your thoughts on that particular deal as well as your own short position in ethylene monomer and any options that you see ahead to bridge that gap?
Albert Yuan Chao - Westlake Chemical Corp.
Sure. I think the fact that foreign investors are investing in the U.S. ethylene plants at a reasonable price indicates that people's confidence the U.S. feedstock supply will be adequate and at a good competitive price compared to rest of world. So I think it's very positive for the U.S. ethylene industry.
Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners
Thank you very much.

And our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Your line is now open.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Yes. Hi, good morning. Over the last few years, Axiall and other industry players never made money on caustic with the jump in the export market. So as the industry consolidates, do you think North American players are looking at caustic differently and they can make money on both sides of the molecule, namely, chlorine and caustic?
Albert Yuan Chao - Westlake Chemical Corp.
Yeah. That's a good question, P.J. I think in the past, with the slow global economy growth and with excess capacity in the world, the caustic business has not been doing well. But since then, the economy globally has improved, there's been capacity reductions in Europe and in U.S., and I think with no new additional capacity being announced in the U.S. or most of the world, and with the Chinese environmental enforcement, I think that dampens supply and demand's still growing, so we believe that margin will improve in the coming years.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thank you. And as you analyze Axiall assets and look at their profitability plant by plant, are there any assets that you think you can shut down, such as their Natrium plant, which as we know has been high cost plant?
Albert Yuan Chao - Westlake Chemical Corp.
Certainly, as we mentioned earlier, we have been reviewing all our assets that we've acquired. And the number one goal is to see whether we can improve the facilities. And if the investment is not justified, then we'll look at alternatives. We did shut down a PVC pipe plant that we acquired from Axiall that was not economical to run. So we are looking at all the assets very carefully. But our primary goal is to see whether we can improve the operations of the plants.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thank you.

And our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Great, thanks. Just wanted to understand some of your expectations on price realization. So in PVC, what do you guys expect, I guess, as far as price and margin for Q2 and the rest of 2017?
Albert Yuan Chao - Westlake Chemical Corp.
Certainly. PVC, as you know, price went up $0.04 in February, additional $0.02 in March. And on the table, there's another $0.03 for April price increase. So sometimes large buyers have 30-day price protection, so we didn't get the full benefit in the first quarter, and the price increases will carry over into the second quarter to get a full benefit. And looking forward, at least for the next few months, at least the industry analysts are not seeing any price reductions in the next few months.
Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay, great. That's helpful. And then similarly in polyethylene, there was a $0.05 increase in February, $0.03 in March, looks like the $0.03 for April's been pushed to May. We're also seeing some declines in the spot market. Are you seeing those as well? And how do you expect polyethylene pricing and margin to play out for the rest of this year?

Albert Yuan Chao - Westlake Chemical Corp.
Yes, certainly. Yes, we did implement the $0.05 a pound in February and $0.03 a pound in March. And the additional $0.03 for April's been pushed to May. We are getting the price increase, as said, other than contractual 30-day price protection. So I think second quarter we'll see the full benefit of price increases.
The export market price is very high, sometimes higher than the domestic market. But as the export market has adjusted, it has come down. So the spot prices reflected some reductions. But again, looking forward, people don't expect the next several months with any price reductions.
Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC
And then just lastly, on the Axiall integration, you called out some expenses to get the savings. Would you characterize the integration going kind of in line with your expectations or better? And do you ultimately see any upside to your synergy expectations? Thanks.
Albert Yuan Chao - Westlake Chemical Corp.
Yes. The integration is moving as planned and certainly, we are looking at more synergies and cost-downs that we had announced before. And our management team as well as the whole Westlake Company team, are looking at all the ways to find further improvements. So we will inform investors as we progress, but it's going quite smoothly.
Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Great. Thanks.

And your next question comes from the line of Robert Koort from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Ryan Berney - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Good morning. This is Ryan Berney on for Bob. Just wanted to ask...
Albert Yuan Chao - Westlake Chemical Corp.
Morning.
Ryan Berney - Goldman Sachs & Co.
...around the margins in the Olefins segment, seems like they were quite strong this quarter, especially relative to the top line number you put up, which came up but not quite as much. So I was hoping you could give us a sense for if there were any special items in there. I know you called out a few things, but within that Olefins piece that you could put some clarity around â especially relative to some of your competitors who are part of the cycle, those margins seemed pretty strong.
Mark Steven Bender - Westlake Chemical Corp.
No. There isn't anything that I would call out, Ryan, that was unusual in that Olefins segment, the special item and all. I think as Albert outlined earlier, the price increases that were announced and put in, we'll get the full benefit of that in Q2, but there was nothing unusual that I would call out in our Olefins or polyolefins pieces of the business.
Ryan Berney - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great. Thanks. And then I was hoping you could provide an update on kind of the Axiall cost side, and whether or not you've â could take the opportunity to update your guidance around the combined cost savings and the synergies there.
Mark Steven Bender - Westlake Chemical Corp.
The synergy number that we expect to achieve this year still remains on track at $120 million that we believe it will achieve this year. And I gave some guidance in terms of how much we thought we'd spend this year. We think the expenditure will be about $25 million to achieve that $120 million, and so we're still very much on track to achieve the total of $200 million a year. And of course, as Albert said, we're looking for opportunities to find synergies beyond that. And once we find those and achieve those, we'll talk about those and explain where those are coming from.
Ryan Berney - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Thank you very much.

And our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Thanks. Albert, could you discuss how you see new polyethylene supply coming in to the market this year and how it might impact your business? And any impact at all, do you think, on your LDPE business over the course of the next year or so?
Albert Yuan Chao - Westlake Chemical Corp.
Certainly. Yes, certainly. These plants coming on stream are LDPE, linear low or high density, they are large scale â worldscale plants. They're probably making more commodity grades and probably targeting more the export market, since U. S. is exporting already about 20% of its polyethylene production, Westlake trying to focus more on the specialty side of the polyethylene businesses. And as you know, our LDPE, 80% is autoclave, and the U.S. capacity being added are all tubular LDPE technology, which is somewhat different from autoclave process. So...

And just out of curiosity, in Calvert City, what do you pay for ethane? How much of a discount versus Gulf Coast prices?
Albert Yuan Chao - Westlake Chemical Corp.
Certainly. Ethane we purchase comes from the Marcellus, Utica area. And our prices is market-related.

And our next question comes from the line of John Roberts from UBS. Your line is now open.
John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC
Thank you. Nice quarter, guys.
Albert Yuan Chao - Westlake Chemical Corp.
Thank you, John.
John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC
While ethane has been a more competitive feed, more often than not, propane has actually become competitive on occasion, especially because of propylene co-product credit. Did you retain flexibility to go back towards more propane at Calvert City? And would you even ever consider that given your now short ethylene because of the Axiall transaction?
Albert Yuan Chao - Westlake Chemical Corp.
Certainly, yes. Calvert City still has the ability to go back to propane. And so is our Lake Charles Petro II. But if we went back to propane, we'll have to produce less ethylene. And as you said, we are ethylene short. So net-net, even though maybe propane cracking may be at times a few cents better, but the fact that the ethylene volume penalty would not justify running propane for us.
John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC
Great. And just a follow-up question. As you review the Axiall assets, and I know you're looking to improve there, they were non-core assets for PPG, at least part of them were, and then Axiall was capital-constrained. So I would guess that there's some unexploited debottleneck opportunities at either PPG and then Axiall as a subsequent owner, just didn't want to put capital towards â or couldn't put capital towards. Have you come across any yet, or it's still too early to think about debottlenecks?
Albert Yuan Chao - Westlake Chemical Corp.
Certainly, with our improvement programs at all the plants, we are identifying areas for debottleneck as well as just reliability improvements that will also increase production. So we're evaluating all the above. And as you said, the more work we do, we identify more opportunities.
John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Thank you.

And your next question comes from the line of Hassan Ahmed from Alembic Global. Your line is now open.
Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC
Good morning, Albert, and Steve.

Albert Yuan Chao - Westlake Chemical Corp.
Good morning.
Mark Steven Bender - Westlake Chemical Corp.
Good morning, Hassan.
Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC
Albert, you've talked about curtailment on capacity closures and the like in the chlor-alkali side of things, partly in North America, obviously, driven by regulation out in Europe. Question is that on the nearer term side of things, because obviously you flagged these regulations kicking in by end 2017, so my question is around the pace of these closures, are you seeing a deceleration over the next couple of quarters in terms of the pace of these capacity shutdowns, or is it the opposite?
Albert Yuan Chao - Westlake Chemical Corp.
Yeah. In the European side, I think people who are converting are already in progress to convert them. Those people who plan to shut down, they'll run their plants through the end of the year before they have to shut down. And those people who are shutting down, either they shut down their derivative plants or they are in the process of lining up feedstock supplies for their derivative plants from other sources. So, all these activities are going on.
Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC
Got it, got it. Thanks so much for that. And as a follow-up...
Albert Yuan Chao - Westlake Chemical Corp.
You're welcome.
Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC
...revisiting one of the questions that was asked earlier about the Williams-NOVA transaction. As I sort of ran my numbers on a replacement value basis, it seems that those assets were sold at over $1 a pound. So with, I would imagine, the engineering and construction or the E&C market sort of flattening now, obviously, you guys are sort of building out your cracker with Lotte as well, how does that valuation stack up to a new greenfield build in a flattening E&C market, in your mind?
Albert Yuan Chao - Westlake Chemical Corp.
That's a good question. As you know that some company have announced completion of their plants â of new ethylene plant like OXY. I think it's well over $1 a pound. And certainly, in the Lotte joint venture, they have publicly announced this $2 billion project for a 2.2 billion pounds plant. Now it's yet to be finished, so we don't know what the final cost will be. And you have certainly, Exxon, Chevron, Dow's and Sasol's plants, and so they are all over the place, but those are new plants, worldscale. And the Williams plants are older plants and â it's still pretty big, close to worldscale plants.
So it's hard to say if this is priced high or low, but the fact that NOVA and certainly its parents, IPIC, is investing sizable money in the U.S., which again, reconfirms the competitiveness of U.S. ethylene facility and manufacturing for the long term into the future.
Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC
Very good. Thanks so much, Albert.

Thank you. You mentioned some of your Axiall facilities, you were able to increase the operating rates that legacy Axiall had run at. Can you comment on where you see the Axiall operating rates today?
Albert Yuan Chao - Westlake Chemical Corp.
Yes. As we mentioned earlier, the production improvement program has been going on. Some started before we acquired the assets and some started after we acquired the assets. And we are seeing those efforts been bearing fruit. And we do have turnarounds going on in the first quarter and in second quarter but, by and large, I think our plants are improving better than in the past.
James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.

Are the Axiall facilities running at the same utilization as legacy Westlake facilities?
Albert Yuan Chao - Westlake Chemical Corp.
Yes. Some has done well, and some are still ongoing under the performance improvement programs. So depend on the plants but, by and large, things are doing better than the past.
James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
All right. Thank you.
Albert Yuan Chao - Westlake Chemical Corp.

And our next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.
Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hey, good morning. If I could just follow up on that last question.
Albert Yuan Chao - Westlake Chemical Corp.
Good morning, Frank.
Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hey, Albert. If I could just follow-up on that last question, are you seeing the better performance out of chlor-alkali, or is it more in the VC and PVC side of things with the Axiall assets?
Albert Yuan Chao - Westlake Chemical Corp.
It's throughout all the assets.
Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Across the board, you've seen improving in terms of operating rates and reliability?
Albert Yuan Chao - Westlake Chemical Corp.
Yes, Frank.
Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Awesome. And, Albert, you mentioned earlier on that some of the environmental actions taken by the Chinese has had an impact on the PVC area. Can you provide a little more color on what you're seeing there and how long term you think that may be? Are we looking at permanent shutdowns or are we just looking at short-term shutdowns? And how should we think about what's going on in that part of the world?
Albert Yuan Chao - Westlake Chemical Corp.
Okay. Well, I don't have all the details, but what I understand is that the enforcement of environmental rules are more strict than in the past, and applies not only to the chemical plants but also applies to derivative fabrication plants. So it has impact throughout the Chinese industries. And the biggest impact have been on the coastal region where the populations are and as well as during the colder months when much coal is burned. So I think they may have been less strict in the summer months when there's less coal burning going on. But I think, by and large, on the average, the Chinese authorities are more strict on environmental compliance in all industries going forward.
Second part is the trucking overloading has been, again â are enforcing these rules. So the cost of transporting finished goods or carbide (40:23) has increased as well. So all these have increased costs for the plants. And coastal plants are more affected than inland plants.
Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And so the way we should see this manifest itself is through higher exports of VC and PVC, EDC and caustic out of North America, is that the thought process here?
Albert Yuan Chao - Westlake Chemical Corp.
Certainly, North American costs are more competitive with our low-cost ethylene and low-cost power and low-cost chlor-alkali manufacturing costs. So we are more competitive. However, the Chinese (41:01) not their only goal. And when caustic prices gone up, they can allow them to export PVC even the costs have gone up, because higher caustic price, they can afford some of them to export PVC.
So we are seeing (41:18) Chinese prices have come down from its high we saw in early spring, but this is also construction season, not only in the U.S. and North America, but also in China and the rest of the world. So second and the third quarter usually are stronger months for the Vinyls business, and hence, the price increase we have into North America as well.
Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Thank you so much.
Albert Yuan Chao - Westlake Chemical Corp.

You're very welcome.

And our next question comes from the line of Matthew Blair from Tudor, Pickering Holt. Your line is now open.
Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.
Hey. Good morning Albert and Steve.
Albert Yuan Chao - Westlake Chemical Corp.
Morning, Matthew.
Mark Steven Bender - Westlake Chemical Corp.
Good morning
Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.
Maybe turning back to the feedstock question at Calvert City. So, some of the Marcellus E&Ps are reporting ethane pricing about $0.08 or $0.09 below Gulf Coast pricing, but there's also some new pipeline coming out of the Marcellus, both going east and west over the next year or two. So how do you see that basis shaping up? Do you still expect to realize a pretty significant discount to Gulf Coast ethane pricing at Calvert City going forward, or do you think that basis is going to narrow due to the new pipeline capacity?
Albert Yuan Chao - Westlake Chemical Corp.
Yeah. As I mentioned earlier, that our purchase for ethane at Calvert City is market price-related.
Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.
Okay, okay. And then I guess a question for Steve. We saw a little bit of debt repaid in the first quarter. How much more should we expect for the rest of 2017? And could you remind us of your long-term targets in this area? Thanks.
Mark Steven Bender - Westlake Chemical Corp.
Yeah. Certainly, you can expect it we'll continue to look to delever the balance sheet. So there's certainly opportunity to retire additional debt through the course of this year and even into early next as opportunities permit. So our focus really is to keep that strong balance sheet and remain strongly in the investment-grade spaces we are today. And so that remains our focus. And you can see with the focus on debt retirement and the focus on spending capital on the deferred maintenance actions, that's really how we're going to target the use of our capital in the next year or two.
Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.
Okay. Thank you.
Mark Steven Bender - Westlake Chemical Corp.

And our last question comes from of Chris Perrella from Bloomberg Intelligence. Your line is now open.
Christopher Silvio Perrella - Bloomberg Intelligence
Thanks. After the completion of Calvert City, could you just remind us what your net ethylene position would be?
Mark Steven Bender - Westlake Chemical Corp.
We're at production capacity, annualized, is 3.7 billion pounds.
Christopher Silvio Perrella - Bloomberg Intelligence
All right. And with the Lotte, what's the timing of the capital spending for the JV cracker?
Mark Steven Bender - Westlake Chemical Corp.
We'll be spending the capital over the next few years with a startup expected in 2019. Our total capital commitment is expected to be $225 million. And so you'd expect we'll be spending that as we move forward with an expected startup in 2019.
Christopher Silvio Perrella - Bloomberg Intelligence
All right. Thank you very much.

Albert Chao
Thank you, Ben. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining this call this morning. Westlake announced the acquisition of Axiall this morning and we are very excited over this transaction. We also look forward to welcoming the Axiall employees into the Westlake family and look forward to meeting them all.

We strongly believe the industrial and strategic logic of this transaction and we believe it's compelling. The combined Company will be a leader in the North American olefins and vinyls business, and together, we'll create a larger, more integrated and diverse Company. We'll be the second largest North American producer of PVC and the third largest chlor-alkali producer in the North American markets.
This transaction is consistent with our history of vertical integration, which captures the margins across the chain and through the cycles. The acquisition greatly extends our manufacturing footprint and positions us for future growth. We believe we will achieve annual synergies of $100 million per year and the transaction will be accretive in the first year after close.
Axiall is a leader in the chlor-alkali, PVC and building products businesses. Its chlor-alkali and PVC businesses include seven chemical sites and four PVC compounding facilities, with over 20 billion pounds of chemical capacity per annum. Its PVC building products businesses include products such as sidings, deck, trim, molding and various pipe products. Axiall's 2016 first-quarter last 12 months revenue was $3.3 billion and EBITDA of $330 million.
Steven Bender
So turning to the transaction, let me provide you an overview of the transaction. Westlake and Axiall announced today that they've entered into the agreement to acquire Axiall stock for $33 in an all-cash transaction. The enterprise value is $3.8 billion, including the assumption of $1.4 billion of Axiall debt. This is a 6.1 times cycle average with synergies.
Westlake has in place a $1.8 billion bridge loan provided by Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs. And Westlake is committed to maintaining a strong investment-grade credit rating. This transaction will require Axiall shareholder vote which we expect to be dealt with very quickly as we go through the coming months. We do not expect any regulatory issues and thus expect to close by 4Q 2016.
So let's review a few of the key highlights of this transaction. As Albert noted, it creates a North American chlorovinyls leader with enhanced scale. Secondly, it highly integrates the chain in the US margin and brings margin stability for the combined Company. Thirdly, it creates the opportunity for us to capture value through the synergy opportunities that Albert just noted. Fourth, the combination combine of Axiall and Westlake builds a history built on Westlake's history of integration and strategic growth and, of course, importantly, it works off the strong financial profile that Westlake brings and our strong financial culture.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Albert to add some more detail to these particular issues. Albert?
Albert Chao
Thanks, Steve. The combined entity is a leader in the North American chlorovinyl markets. As we said earlier, the combination creates the number three North American chlor-alkali producer and the number two PVC producer in the North American markets. It also provides greater scale and synergies with Westlake's existing businesses, includes vinyls business and olefins business. It better positions us in this increasing global competition. We also have greater ability to serve customers with the combination and capitalizes on future investment opportunities.
The combined business will have a broader geographical footprint that will include Westlake's vinyls business in Europe, which is the global leader in specialty PVC resins. It is also worth highlighting that Westlake is also a leading North American olefins producer, being the largest integrated low density polyethylene to ethylene producer in North America. Finally, our sales will also see a significant increase by about 75% to $7.6 billion per annum and a combined Company will benefit from this improved scale.

Now let's look at the integration for the businesses. We are fully integrated in our olefins chain from ethylene to polyethylene and styrene as shown in the dark blue boxes. We are currently one of the most integrated vinyls producer in the US and possibly one of the lowest production cost locations globally as shown in the light blue boxes.
Our strategy is to continue to integrate our businesses throughout the olefins and vinyls chain. For example, our new qualified facility in Geismar, Louisiana, which completed our [chlorine] integration in 2013. We completed a ethylene de-stock conversion and expansion project in Calvert City, Kentucky in the first half of 2014 and have another expansion planned in the ethylene business in 2017. That, along with smaller improvements, will have added some additional 100 pounds ethylene capacity to Calvert City by 2017. We are also currently debottlenecking our Petro 1 unit in Lake Charles, Louisiana, which will add another 250 million pounds of ethylene capacity, which when combined with our Calvert City expansion, will give us total of 350 million pounds of new ethylene capacity by 2017.
On the downstream side, we will use a significant portion of our PVC to make PVC building products and this acquisition is exactly consistent with our strategy. The strategy allows us to not be completely dependent on one single commodity product and profits have been made at different places along the value chain throughout the cycle. Thus the acquisition of Axiall creates a stronger Company with significantly increased scale, greater product diversity, and integration throughout the value chain.
Steven Bender
Our synergy estimate that we mentioned earlier, $100 million, reflects the input from Westlake's operational and commercial teams based on due diligence that we performed and the synergies fall in four buckets: general and administrative, procurement and supply chain, manufacturing, and sales and marketing. The synergy opportunities we derived are all from identifiable cost synergies. The annual run rate of synergies is $100 million a year, comprised of these cost synergies and the opportunities that we see in front of us.
Westlake is a leading integrated plastics materials company in the olefins and vinyls chain, as Albert outlined. The four points that you see in our mission statement that we use are very important. We pursue profitable growth, and as a result, are always working to create and grow value for our shareholders. We are focused in businesses that we understand, we do business globally where we can gain a competitive edge, and we always act in a financially disciplined manner.
As I mentioned, we are focused in the olefins and vinyls business and our main products in our olefins business is polyethylene. Polyethylene is the largest plastic material used in the world and its ideal for choices of countless consumer nondurable products, largely used in food packaging. Our vinyls business makes PVC. PVC is known as the poor man's plastic because half of that raw material was made from relatively cheap, non-hydrocarbon-based chlorine. Its unique set of properties make it the plastic of choice in many consumer durable applications.
The chart that you may have seen on our presentation illustrates Westlake's growth from inception in 1986 through our planned 2006 (sic - see slide 10, "2016") capacity expansions in Calvert City that Albert just mentioned, and of course, the acquisition of Axiall. Please note that as we have achieved this growth, both through acquisition as well as through organic growth opportunities. At Westlake, we are not just looking for ways to grow the Company, but to strategically grow the Company through the prudent use of our strong balance sheet.

Now as we turn to our financial profile, we importantly want to maintain a strong financial profile and generate and we continue to see generation of strong cash flows from the combined companies. And we expect this transaction will be accretive in the first year following our close. Westlake is committed to maintain an investment grade credit rating, and the transaction is supported by Westlake's large cash balance. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Albert for some comments. Albert?
Albert Chao
Thank you, Steve. In summary, we strongly believe the industrial and strategic logic of this transaction and is very compelling. The combined Company will be a leader in the North American olefins and vinyls businesses.
We'll be the second largest North American producer of PVC and the third largest chlor-alkali producer in the North American markets, as well as we are the largest North American producer of LDPE integrated with ethylene. And this transaction is consistent with our history of vertical integration which captures the margins across the chain and through the cycles and on a global basis, which will create value for our shareholders. Thank you very much for listening today.
Ben Ederington
I would like to turn the call over to the operator to see if there are any questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets.
Arun Viswanathan
Good morning. Congratulations on the deal.
Albert Chao
Good morning, Arun.
Steven Bender
Thank you.
Arun Viswanathan
I guess my question is just on the point of integration, post close, you'll be a little but more levered to be in chlorine and caustic. I guess how do you expect to kind of bridge the gap on the ethylene side as far as backward integration?
Albert Chao
Well we mentioned earlier we are going through extensions in two of our ethylene plants, so we have more ethylene to be used in the integration, and secondly, we will always look for other opportunities to strengthen our ethylene positions.
Arun Viswanathan
And there are a couple other options out there, I guess, as far as crackers available as well as the Lotte proposed cracker. Would those also be on the table as potential increases in ethylene capacity?
Albert Chao
Yes. We look forward to working with Lotte and its management in the new ethylene joint venture in Lake Charles.
Arun Viswanathan
The next question I had was just on the synergies and the overall capacity footprint. It looks like there could be some overlap in the Gulf Coast on some of your facilities and you have the new Geismar facility, which theoretically is lower cost than some of the facilities that you're acquiring. Would footprint optimization or actualization be also a consideration that you would consider down the line?
Albert Chao
I think both Axiall and Westlake have very good plans along the Gulf Coast and a very good people and we plan to build upon the strength of each of these plants and grow our Westlake's business on a global basis.
Arun Viswanathan
And then the last question I just had was just, strategically, many of the acquisitions that you've pursued in the past, Albert, have been a little bit specialty in nature. I mean, how would you characterize the value proposition here? Many of Axiall's products could be construed as relatively commodity in nature. Thanks.
Albert Chao
Yes. We are a commodity company with segments of business in specialty. We find the Axiall business is very compelling and will be a good match with Westlake's businesses and integrate very well going forward.
Arun Viswanathan
Okay, thanks.
Albert Chao
You're welcome.
Operator
Our next question comes from Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial.
Don Carson
A couple of modeling questions. Steve, what kind of purchase accounting step-up do you expect in the first year as you do your accretion analysis? And then can you expand on the timing of the synergies? When do you hit that $100 million and break those synergies out by each of the four buckets that you've outlined.

Steven Bender
Don, the $100 million synergy that we outlined we have not yet given any further detail in how they break out into the four buckets, but you would imagine some of the public company cost would disappear as a result of this combination. As it relates to doing the work as it relates to the valuation of work, obviously, we'll get started on that and I don't yet have any guidance for you, but we'll look and be communicating that as we go forward. But again, we've just completed this transaction and so we'll give some better help on that as we go forward.
Don Carson
And then how about on debt levels and interest rate? How much of that $1.8 billion facility will you be drawing down? What would you expect your average financing rate to be as you fund this acquisition?
Steven Bender
Well you know, we have a very conservative financial policy and that remains very much the bedrock of Westlake. And so as we think about the structure that we look to structure of the transaction around, we're going to be targeting to maintain that strong investment-grade balance sheet that we've had and enjoy and expect to continue to enjoy.
So as we think about how we'll finance this transaction, we'll be interacting with the agencies and looking back at how we've operated the business historically to make sure that we've done so and we've not given specific guidance yet in terms of how we'll be financing this or how we'll be layering in the tranches. But certainly, we'll be certainly better communicating that as we go forward. But at this stage, we wanted to really focus on the business combination and the opportunities that we see.
Don Carson
Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
David Begleiter
Thank you. Good morning. Albert, maybe you could just talk about why you find chlor-alkali and PVC attractive at this point in the cycle.
Albert Chao
Well, as Steve mentioned, PVC is a poor man's plastics and they use chlorine as half of the feedstock and it was just relatively cheap and low-cost, solid to low-cost power with that low-cost natural gas price in the US. So I think US is one of the lowest-cost producer to produce ethylene and chlorine and as well as PVC and there's a large growth of demand for PVC going forward, especially in the developing nations. So I think the US will be a great place to supply the world's needs going forward.
David Begleiter
Very good. And just lastly maybe for Steve as well as you, just on synergies, what's the potential to exceed that $100 million target you've laid out today?
Steven Bender
Well, certainly, I think the $100 million is a number that we believe we can achieve and certainly as we get into the business, we'll be looking to achieve more if we can find it, but certainly, I think the $100 million is the number you should be working with and the number that we will work aggressively to achieve as quickly as practical.
David Begleiter
Thank you.
Albert Chao
You're welcome.
Operator
Our next question comes from Roger Spitz with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Roger Spitz
Thank you. Good morning.
Albert Chao
Good morning.
Roger Spitz
Can you tell us if Westlake will provide a downstream guaranteed to Axiall's debt and what are your plans regarding Axiall's bonds and credit facility? Thank you.
Steven Bender
What we will do, what our expectation is we'll obviously assume those bonds and we'll be providing either a guarantee or providing an exchange offer there, Roger.
Roger Spitz
Either guarantee or exchange offer. Thank you very much.
Albert Chao
You're welcome.
Operator
Our next question comes from Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global.
Hassan Ahmed
Good morning, Albert and Steve.
Albert Chao
Good morning, Hassan.
Hassan Ahmed
I just wanted to revisit the whole synergy side of things. So if I take a look at what Axiall was run-rating in terms of EBITDA back in 2013, the number was close to $670 million. Now, you compare that to 2015, and the number had fallen down to $330 million, right? Then if I do a compare and contrast, I look at PVC prices, $13 versus $15, I look at your alkali prices. Prices for all of Axiall's products are flat to up, $13 versus $15.

Their raw material costs, be it nat gas, be it ethylene, are down significantly. So to me, correct me if I'm wrong, they had a series of sort of planned and unplanned outages, through the course of this time period, so I would imagine operational synergies could run north of $300 million. What am I missing over here?
Steven Bender
Well, I think, Hassan, when you think about the synergies that we've outlined, I think the $100 million, I think, as I mentioned earlier, is the number that we believe is deliverable. If there's additional opportunity that requires additional capital, to improve the business and operate the business, those are separate from this transaction.
But certainly, we would certainly look to improve the business and grow the business opportunity set, and certainly, as you can well imagine, we'll be looking to do what we can to find additional value here, but the value of $100 million a year that we've identified in synergies I believe are deliverable and realistic for this transaction.
Hassan Ahmed
Very fair. So if I were to take a look at some of the sort of earlier presentations from the Axiall side of things, they would consistently point to a mid-cycle number which was around $950 million. I'm sure you guys have run your own numbers. Is that roughly sort of ballpark what you're coming up with for the mid-cycle earnings power?
Steven Bender
Hassan, as you know, we don't give earnings guidance and I wouldn't want to use another company's guidance for our business. And so I think, as you know us well, we say what we do and we do what we say, and I think what you see is we've not historically given guidance for our business and that has not changed. But I wouldn't want to suggest that we should be using someone else's guidance attributable to our business.
Hassan Ahmed
Fair enough. And one final one, if I may. Tim Mann had basically stated that he would, in the second half of the year, sort of consider some chlor-alkali rationalization. What are your thoughts about that? Would you carry on with that or would that be sold?
Steven Bender
Well, as Albert mentioned, we clearly have a strong desire to really understand the operations of Axiall and understand the business as well, and so certainly, there is no plan at this stage to do anything of that sort.
Hassan Ahmed
Perfect. Thank you so much, guys.
Albert Chao
You're welcome.
Operator
Our next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov with Nomura.
Aleksey Yefremov
Good morning, everyone. Thank you. Could you address any potential tax benefits of the deal? Axiall does have some NOLs. Do you think Westlake could use some of that and any thoughts on the tax aspect?
Steven Bender
Certainly as we look at the tax NOLs, a large part of those are certainly in Canada. But we'll certainly, Alex, be looking to optimize the tax structure. As you know, we have operations in Canada as well.
But I think for your modeling purposes, I would, given the scale of our business and the scale of their of Axiall's business, I think still the run rate of 35% is probably the right rate to use, at least for the time being.
Aleksey Yefremov
And going back to the question of the cycle, you address some of that, but is it fair to assume that you're at least somewhat bullish on chlor-alkali cycle here on the caustics and the chlorine prices?
Albert Chao
Well, as Hassan mentioned, three full years ago, the ECU value was higher, margin was higher. And what happened was there were expansions going on in the US chlor-alkali industry and there's still some going on this year. But after this year, we have not heard any new capacity expansions.
So when the global demand for chlor-alkali improves and absorbs this extra capacity, then we believe supply and demand will improve going forward. That's not a lot of capacity added in the world and Europe with the mercury cell conversion, people are estimating between 800,000 to 1 million ton reduction in chlor-alkali capacity in Europe. So that could help our future global chlor-alkali businesses.

Aleksey Yefremov
And a final question, if I may. Did considerations for putting chlor-alkali assets into MLD enter into your evaluation and what are your current thoughts on that?
Steven Bender
Alex, we've never seen anybody do such a thing and, as you know, there's a regulation being written now by the IRS and Treasury that would define what does and doesn't qualified. So I think it's clear to say that, from what we've seen of their writings, not much qualifies until they define that it does. So I think we all have to look back at what worked and what didn't at this stage and say we'll see what goes forward.
Aleksey Yefremov
Okay. Thank you very much.
Albert Chao
You're welcome.
Operator
Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities.
Frank Mitsch
Good morning, gentlemen. A deal four years in the making, Albert. I guess good things do come to those who wait. Axiall made a big point a few weeks ago about a public announcement that they reopened their data room for you to have another look at all their financials, et cetera.
And then obviously, we just see a bump, a 40% bump in the price that you're willing to pay. I assume that also during that time period and during this whole process, that you've been studying the $270 million synergy number that Axiall believes could be achieved from this transaction and yet today you're still talking about this $100 million deliverable.
What about that, what in the $270 million synergy number that Axiall has thrown out there do not quite agree with? Or perhaps is there some conservatism going on here?
Steven Bender
Well, Frank, it's Steve. I think when you think about the number that we put forth, as you can imagine, we've had this discussion with Axiall's management team and had a chance to understand it and I think that we still were very comfortable with the number that we put forth and that's really where I think we are. So we've had that conversation, we've had an opportunity to understand those numbers, and I think the $100 million synergy is the number that I believe we can deliver and we will deliver. I think some of the numbers that might be above and beyond that may require additional capital and we'll see, but that's separate from this transaction.
Frank Mitsch
All right, that's helpful. Steve, in the press release, you talked about the transaction being accretive year one. What sort of assumptions were you using in terms of the underlying Axiall EBITDA and the realization of synergies to make that statement?
Steven Bender
Well as you know, we don't give EBITDA forecasts, but I think it's fair to assume that the synergies would be achieved over a couple year time period. Of course, there are going to be costs associated with achieving those synergies at the same time, but I think it's fair to assume that we'll achieve those over a couple-year time period.
Frank Mitsch
Thank you.
Albert Chao
You're welcome.
Operator
Our next question comes from John Roberts with UBS.
John Roberts
Thanks. Congratulations on the deal. Maybe you can answer my questions.
Steven Bender
I'll try, John.
John Roberts
Steve, you mentioned layering tranches of debt here, but you didn't mention equity. Westlake was willing to issue stock in its initial bid here. So, post-closing, if your stock is at or above current levels, should we expect you to accelerate that reduction by issuing stock or having a convertible component of your debt or something like that?
Steven Bender
Well John, as you know, we have always had a historically strong and very consistent financial strategy. And our policies, our financial policies have been very consistent on that front. And so there's nothing contemplated at this stage as it relates to an equity component of that.
But I think it's quite clear that we've maintained a strong and very consistently position on maintaining an investment-grade stance and that remains here. So we'll continue to work to make sure that we always have a strong balance sheet and an investment-grade rating from the agencies.

John Roberts
Okay and then maybe to get to the cycle questions you were being asked earlier, on slide 8, where you have the pie chart showing chlor-alkali as a larger contributor than ethylene, to the vinyls margins over the last cycle. Obviously in recent years, it's been more ethylene than it's been chlorine or chlor-alkali to the vinyls market.
As you modeled the future here or justifying the price that you're paying, what kind of ratio were you considering as you kind of model this out? Do you consider that normal going forward or do you consider something else normal?
Steven Bender
Well as you know, we don't give forward projections at all. So, but what I think is instructive here is when you look back in time, whether it be this time period, which is a fairly lengthy period over the cycle or you look at any other say shorter period of time, what is clear is the mix of chlor-alkali and ethylene will move, as you noted, back and forth.
But what is important, and very much so, is the integration. And I think it's that integration strategy that Albert spoke to that we think is so very important in this industry and in this business. And I think that hallmark of integration is very much how we built our business and how you see us continuing to be focused in building this business.
John Roberts
Okay, thank you.
Albert Chao
You're welcome.
Operator
Our next question comes from James Sheehan with SunTrust Robinson.
James Sheehan
Thank you for taking my question. On the integration strategy, Albert, do you see your ethylene position as being balanced with this transaction and what the Lotte JV or do you need other ethylene sources in order to achieve that integration?
Albert Chao
Yes. As we understand, with the supply of ethylene from the Lotte JV is only for half of the plant. So the Axiall business still will be short of ethylene, even taking in half of the JVs ethylene.
James Sheehan
So what would your strategy be? Would you be purchasing ethylene at that point or would you consider further expansions in your own system?
Albert Chao
We will look at all the above. As of now, Axiall is buying ethylene and so, eventually we will be balanced or excess for short-term. In the long-term, we look at debottlenecking, purchasing ethylene, potential JV purchasing assets, many other alternatives. We're looking for ways to increase value for our assets.
James Sheehan
Great and can you comment on where you think chlor-alkali operating rates will be in North America in 2017?
Albert Chao
I hope it's better.
James Sheehan
Great, thank you very much.
Albert Chao
You're welcome.
Operator
Our next question comes from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.
Ryan Berney
Good morning. This is Ryan Berney on for Bob.
Steven Bender
Good morning, Ryan.
Ryan Berney
Were there any change of control provisions between the Axiall Lotte JV that would've changed that agreement at all post this deal?
Steven Bender
No. There's nothing that impacts that venture as it relates to our transaction with Axiall.
Ryan Berney
Thanks. And then secondarily, given some of the operating issues that Axiall had over the last couple of years, would you expect a period of kind of elevated maintenance CapEx out of the gate?
Steven Bender
Well certainly, what we'll do is we'll spend time assessing operations as we would do with any asset and do, as we have done with our business over time, is to make sure that the businesses operate at their peak operability. And so, as you know, we pride ourselves in running operations at consistently good operating rates because of the integration. Certainly we'll assess the opportunities to see if these plans can be improved and we know we've got very good people on-site and we look to work with them hand-in-glove in that process.
Ryan Berney
Great. Thank you very much.

Steven Bender
You're welcome.
Operator
Our next question comes from Christopher Perrella with Bloomberg Intelligence.
Christopher Perrella
Good morning. Thank you for taking my call. What conversations have you had with the rating agencies so far? And is there a longer-term leverage ratio, Steve, that you would like to get back to down to overtime?
Steven Bender
We have an ongoing dialogue with the agencies. Of course, we've spoken to them recently about this transaction, but we also have a very good ongoing dialogue with the agencies and our consistent strong financial policy has been very much the hallmark of that dialogue.
And so as we think about the transaction in front of us, what we've said very consistently, and they hear us, is that we intend to maintain that investment-grade rating that we enjoy today and that continues to be where we expect to be with the end of this transaction completed. So as we go forward, that is very much what we see in front of us, and as I say, we have a very good relationship with them and an ongoing dialogue.
Christopher Perrella
All right. Thank you. And is there anything that could cause the transaction to slip into 2017?
Steven Bender
We don't contemplate it at this stage. As I mentioned earlier, we have regulatory filings that will be made in just a couple of countries and we've already given an outline timeframe that we expect these filings to be completed in the transaction close being toward the end of the third quarter, early fourth quarter.
Christopher Perrella
Thank you very much.
Operator
Our next question comes from David Wang with Morningstar.
David Wang
Thank you for taking my question. I had a follow-up question on the synergy. So within the sales and marketing bucket of that, would you consider that a cost or a revenue synergy?
Steven Bender
Well, the sales and marketing, it's actually a -- it can be a, as I see it, it is a cost opportunity, not a revenue synergy. So when we think about it, we're looking at ways in which we can operate in our business much more effectively in the sales and marketing arena, not necessarily looking at it as a revenue opportunity, but managing the cost associated with that opportunity.
David Wang
Okay. Great. And then for the ethylene cracker with the JV that Axiall has, I guess, do you still value creation from it with the current ethylene margins where they are and considering that it's essentially going to be a Greenfield expansion as opposed to the brown fields that you've been pursuing?

Certainly, today, ethane cracking still enjoy the lowest costs among the various feedstocks and going forward, that forecast is that ethane still will be the preferred feedstock in the US and in the world as well. So we look forward to understand more about the joint venture and structure and we like to being the shareholder to make this joint venture a very successful joint venture.
David Wang
All right. Great. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.
Q âUnidentified Analyst
Good morning. It's Delta Cook for Jeff.
Albert Chao
Good morning.
Q âUnidentified Analyst
Do think the cash costs for the $100 million synergies will also be $100 million?
Steven Bender
We've not given specific guidance, but generally, rules of thumb tend to be in that order of magnitude.
Q âUnidentified Analyst
Okay. And in terms of the combined DNA, do you think is going to be something that is bigger than $550 million? I guess if you have to take a first guess. I know not all the variables are known, but do you think it would be in that range or it would be significantly higher or lower than that?
Steven Bender
Once we've completed our evaluation analysis, we will have an opportunity to have a more broad discussion of what the DNA tends to be. But once -- what we need obviously to complete, is our evaluation analysis, and then we will have a better opportunity to have a more complete and robust discussion about depreciation.

Q âUnidentified Analyst
Okay. Thanks very much.

Our next question comes from Sunil Sibal with Seaport Global Securities.
Sunil Sibal
Hello, good morning, guys, and congratulations on the transaction.
Albert Chao
Good morning. Thank you.
Sunil Sibal
Most of my questions have been address, but I was kind of curious, with regard to your start of the year on the MLP side. You clearly have taken a very fluent approach so far in terms of [job balancing] with MLP and I wondering as you kind of think of deleveraging the pay rate post the transaction, how do you think about using the MLP currency?
Steven Bender
Well certainly, as we've said from the beginning of the launch of the partnership that we see this as a opportunity to use it as a very cost effective form of capital. It is relatively small relative to the parent and so it's opportunities itself have to be taken into consideration, but we certainly see it as an opportunity to use it as a form of currency for opportunities. So certainly, as we look forward into the future, we continue to expect the partnership to be part of that overall mix.
Sunil Sibal
Got it. And then in terms of the latter JV timeline of building the new cracker, any changes do you anticipate other than that this transaction, I think, previously Axiall had talked about a lead 2019 as kind of a start up for that.
Albert Chao
We don't know anything more than what's known to the public so far.
Sunil Sibal
Got it. Okay. Thanks, guys. Congrats to you.
Albert Chao
You're welcome. Thank you.

Our next question comes form Bill Cambilair [ph] with Seaport Group
Unidentified Analyst
My questions have been answered. Thank you very much.

Our next question comes from Jeff Gates with Gates Capital Markets.
Jeff Gates
I have a couple questions. You referenced a 6.1 times cycle average. I believe that was an EBITDA number, and I'm wondering, is that a number that includes synergy?
Steven Bender
Yes, that does.
Jeff Gates
So that would be, if I did the math right, about $620 million, which that would include the $100 million of synergies so you're saying --
Steven Bender
Yes, it's in that neighborhood, that's correct.
Jeff Gates
But do you think the mid-cycle average for Axiall is about $520 million.
Steven Bender
Yes, and we are talking about a period of probably five or six years.
Jeff Gates
Okay. And then the second question is what do you think the ongoing capital required to be competitive at Axiall is? Sort of a normalized CapEx number.
Steven Bender
Well, it's a good question. And as I mentioned earlier, we'll come in and assess all the capital projects, not only in Axiall, but in Westlake at this time. We want to maintain a very disciplined way in which we are spending capital, but where we see opportunities, we'll certainly avail ourselves of those opportunities. And so you would imagine that we'll take a fresh look at the newly combined businesses and look at all those opportunities. So I think I'm going to have to hold an answer until we've had a chance to do that assessment.
Jeff Gates
But you did diligence and you came up with a price that you're paying for it, so what was your base case assumption in getting to the price that you were willing to pay for the asset?
Steven Bender
Well certainly that was an exercise in doing the modeling work for evaluation purposes, but to be more specific, what I'd like to do is give you a more refined answer after we've had a chance to meet with the people that are running the businesses and give you a better, clearer answer.
Jeff Gates
Okay, thank you.
Steven Bender
You're welcome.

Our next question comes from Lawrence Stalin [ph] with Sinkling Capital.
Q â Unidentified Analyst
Steve, I had a bond specific questions, if you don't mind. Earlier on the call in response to Roger Spitz' question, you said your current expectation is to assume the bonds and likely provide either a downstream guarantee or execute an exchange offer. I'm not sure I understand what an exchange offer would be in this situation.
Steven Bender
Well, in this situation, in a classic exchange offer, it's exchanging the Axiall bonds for Westlake bonds at the same terms and conditions.
Q â Unidentified Analyst
Okay and, as you know, most of onerous covenants under the Axiall indentures would be stripped upon IG, but the financial reporting covenant would not be?
Steven Bender
That is correct.
Q â Unidentified Analyst
Is that enough of a nuisance, time and expense, to encourage you to seek to take those bonds out? And I guess that might be related to the exchange rate offer as well.
Steven Bender
Well, if you do an exchange offer, then you don't have a separate audit to perform.
Q â Unidentified Analyst
Okay. Thanks, Steve.
Steven Bender
Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Owen Douglas with Baird.
Owen Douglas
Thanks for taking the questions here. Got a lot of good ones been asked already, but I just curious. So Axiall is marketing the building product segment. Is there any sort of standstill while this transaction's waiting to be closed on that?
Steven Bender
I'm sorry, you're asking whether there will be a standstill on that transaction?
Owen Douglas
Yes. While your transaction acquire Axiall's pending, will there be any standstill on the marketing of Axiall's building products business? And if that were to be marketed -- oh, sorry. You answered?
Steven Bender
Yes, there will not be a transaction on that front.
Owen Douglas
Okay, I see. And how do you guys view the building products segment of Axiall with regards to the portfolio? Is that non-core or is that something which you guys want to continue to own?
Steven Bender
Well, you may know that we have our own building products division and certainly, we'll be assessing that in terms of how it does fit into, in terms of how it fits into our overall business. And so as I mentioned, we see that as a valued business and we'll assess it in terms of how it fits into the overall view of our building products divisions.
Owen Douglas
Okay, thank you.
