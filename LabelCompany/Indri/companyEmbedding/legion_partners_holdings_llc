Legion Partners serves select institutional and high net worth clients.

Our investment objective is to achieve superior long-term returns for clients by primarily investing in deeply undervalued equity and debt securities of small- and mid-cap North American companies.  We focus on identifying companies trading at a significant discount to intrinsic value.
Our investment process is intricately driven by two primary functions: security selection and professional shareholder activism. 
Our value-oriented investment strategy embraces an active ownership role, generally known as corporate governance or activism.  We employ a private equity approach to public equity investing, specializing in fundamental research, long-term oriented investing and building productive relationships with portfolio companies.  Our dedicated activist investment management style involves engaging and partnering with management teams and boards of directors of publicly traded companies to assist in unlocking substantial shareholder value and achieving enhanced long-term performance.
We seek to fulfill a more comprehensive ownership and leadership support role in corporate governance through a unique collaboration with our investment partners by applying highly constructive, long-term oriented public equity ownership.

Investment Approach

We Are Deep Value, Long-Term Oriented Active Investors

Our Competitive Advantage Stems From An Ability To Combine The Strengths And Reputations Of Institutional Partners And High Net Worth Investors With A Well-Aligned Active Management Strategy In Corporate Governance

Legion Partners is committed to executing a corporate governance, or activism, style of investing.  This strategy generally incorporates deep value security selection, a long-term oriented ownership horizon and some form of active engagement or event-driven catalyst to ultimately realize additional value for the benefit and interests of longer-term shareholders.  Activist strategies may involve obtaining representation on a portfolio company's board of directors, implementing various efforts to impact a portfolio company’s policies or strategic direction, or, in some cases, simply advocating specific business activities for the fundamental benefit of a portfolio company. 
We believe that in certain circumstances poor governance and ineffective corporate leadership have led to considerable deterioration of long-term value.  These instances include individual company situations, sectors and industries, and to an extent the broader capital markets.  Appropriate corporate governance and proper oversight from long-term oriented equity owners have meaningful potential to protect value by lowering risk and, in fact, provide a major catalyst to reverse value destruction under select conditions.

Responsible activism has historically been able to unlock significant shareholder value and generate highly attractive returns for investors.  Our private equity approach to investing in public markets is distinctly efficient and well aligned with the interests of long-term shareholders.  In addition, our active involvement with and extensive due diligence on each target portfolio company helps to mitigate overall investment risk and creates a more beneficial risk profile for our investors.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

BEVERLY HILLS, Calif., May 26, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- In response to recent positive steps the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Perry Ellis International, Inc.  (NASDAQ:   PERY) ("Perry Ellis" or the "Company") has taken to address shareholder concerns, Legion Partners Holdings, LLC (together with its affiliates, "Legion Partners") and the California State Teachers' Retirement System ("CalSTRS") today announced the withdrawal of their slate of director nominees for election to the Board and their proposal to appoint an independent chairman at the Company's upcoming 2015 annual meeting of shareholders ("Annual Meeting").  CalSTRS' 14a-8 proposal to declassify the Board will continue to be presented for a vote at the Annual Meeting.  Legion Partners and CalSTRS beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 6.3% of Perry Ellis' outstanding common stock.
"We are pleased with Perry Ellis' decision to nominate Bruce J. Klatsky and Michael W. Rayden to the Board to replace two long-serving incumbent directors," said Chris Kiper of Legion Partners. "We believe their relevant experience and record of building value at other companies will bring positive change to the boardroom. In recognition of the Company moving in the overall direction of our recommendations, we are withdrawing our slate of director nominees for election to the Board at the Annual Meeting. With the election of Messrs. Klatsky and Rayden at the Annual Meeting, the Board will have replaced five long-tenured directors with five new independent directors in the past 18 months – an outcome we do not believe would have resulted without our active and ongoing involvement on behalf of all shareholders."
"While we believe more must be done to build value for shareholders, we are encouraged by the steps taken to date and stand ready to help this reconstituted Board move the Company in the right direction," said Anne Sheehan, CalSTRS Director of Corporate Governance.
Legion Partners and CalSTRS last year filed a Schedule 13D and commenced a number of private and public communications in which Legion Partners and CalSTRS expressed significant concerns regarding the Company's historical underperformance, poor corporate governance practices, high level of related-party transactions, and need for the addition of truly independent directors to the Board. Since that process began, the Board announced, among other things: 

a substantially reconstituted Board comprising five new independent directors on a Board of seven; 
the resignation of George Feldenkreis as CEO; 
the appointment of a new lead independent director with less than one year of tenure on the Board; 
the reassessment of all related-party transactions and termination of certain related-party transactions; 
the adoption of a majority voting requirement for the election of directors in uncontested elections; 
the implementation of restrictions on pledging and hedging of the Company's common stock for executives and employees; and, 
the adoption of a stock ownership policy for directors.
As the changes recommended by Legion Partners and CalSTRS have been implemented, the Company' stock price has increased 52%, since the date of Legion Partners' and CalSTRS' original Schedule 13D filing.  As significant holders of Perry Ellis, Legion Partners and CalSTRS are hopeful the reconstituted Board will continue to make changes that benefit all shareholders.  Specifically, Legion Partners and CalSTRS hope that the Company will move to, among other things, (1) undertake a robust search process to find the right CEO for the Company, rather than continue the Feldenkreis family domination; (2) agree to de-stagger the Board such that directors will be elected annually; (3) appoint a truly independent Chairman; (4) terminate all related party transactions; and (5) undertake a strategic review process. 
Said Mr. Kiper: "We remain excited about the opportunity ahead for the Company and will continue to encourage the reconstituted Board and management to embrace the strategic initiatives that we have advanced, but that have not yet been adopted.  We sincerely hope that the reconstituted Board and management will be amenable to considering alternative views expressed by shareholders to maximize value for all shareholders.  Going forward, we will continue to hold the Board and management accountable for achieving the Company's current-year EBITDA margin target of 6% and the 2019 EBITDA margin target of 10%.  We believe the Company needs to implement a plan to achieve EBITDA margins well above the 2019 target of 10% and that a new CEO will likely be required to make this a reality."
