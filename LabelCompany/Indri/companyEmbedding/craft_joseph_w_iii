Not including his super PAC contributions, Craft, along with his ex-wife, Kathy, has donated more than $800,000 to federal candidates, party committees, business PACs and other political committees since the 1998 election cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, including:

Biography:
Wealthy coal executive Joseph W. Craft III was one of Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney’s finance co-chairmen in Kentucky, Craft’s home state.
Craft’s Alliance Resource Partners, L.P. operates 11 mining complexes in five states — Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, West Virginia and Maryland. The company also operates a coal-loading terminal on the Ohio River in Indiana.
In 2011, it produced more than 30 million tons of coal, ranking it the third largest coal producer in the eastern United States. Its revenues exceeded $1.8 billion, up 14.5 percent from 2010, a year that saw two miners die after a roof collapsed in one of the company’s Kentucky mines. (The Associated Press noted at the time that the mine had been cited for 840 safety violations since January 2009.)
Craft, who has expressed doubts about whether humans are causing climate change, is also a board member of the National Mining Association, a director of the Tulsa-based BOK Financial Corp., a director of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity and a former chairman of the National Coal Council.
In a 2010 documentary, Craft said the future of the coal industry depends on “what happens in elections,” adding that the only thing that impedes the industry’s growth was “bad public policy.”
Craft, who resides in Tulsa, Okla., got his start in the coal business with a company called MAPCO Coal Inc., which was the predecessor of Alliance Resource Partners, L.P.
At MAPCO, Craft rose through the ranks serving in roles including general counsel, chief financial officer and, ultimately, president. Since August 1999, he has been the president, chief executive officer and a director of ARLP.
ARLP’s structure is unusual. It is what’s known as a publicly traded “master limited partnership,” and consists of several interlocking corporate entities.
Records show that Craft owns 43 percent of ARLP, as well as 72 percent of Alliance Holdings GP, L.P., the limited partnership formed to own and control Alliance Resource Management GP, LLC, which is the managing general partner of ARLP.
In March, Forbes estimated Craft’s net worth to be $1.4 billion, including the assets of his ex-wife, Kathy. They divorced in late 2011.
Over the years, Craft has been a prolific political and philanthropic donor, particularly to his alma mater, the University of Kentucky.
“I’ve been fortunate to have been able to have the ability to give,” Craft said in an interview with Kentucky’s PBS affiliate that aired in 2010. “I want the state of Kentucky to be the best it can be. I want America to be the best it can be.”
