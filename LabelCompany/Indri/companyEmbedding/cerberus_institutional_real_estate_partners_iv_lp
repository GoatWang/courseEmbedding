Cerberus Capital Management Raises $1.8 Billion for Fourth Global Opportunistic Real Estate Fund


NEW YORK, Jan. 24, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Cerberus Capital Management announced today that it raised $1.8 billion for its fourth global opportunistic real estate fund, Cerberus Institutional Real Estate Partners IV, L.P. (CIREP IV).
As with previous funds, CIREP IV will pursue an investment strategy focused on distressed or otherwise undervalued real estate transactions globally, with a focus in the United States and Western Europe. The fund received commitments from more than 60 investors, including sovereign wealth funds, public pension plans, corporate plans, insurance companies, endowments, foundations and high net worth individuals.
Ronald J. Kravit, Senior Managing Director of Cerberus, said, “We are delighted to announce the successful close of CIREP IV. We have an experienced investment team and the firm has been successfully investing in distressed and opportunistic real estate assets for over 20 years.

According to Evercore’s recent “European Distressed Real Estate Market” report, Cerberus was the most active buyer of commercial and residential mortgage and non-performing loan portfolios and distressed real estate in Europe in 2016, an investor league table milestone that it also achieved in 2014 and 2015. Cerberus accounted for 19 percent of European closed volume in 2016, acquiring €9.4bn of secured real estate loans.
Hodes Weill Securities, LLC acted as global placement agent for CIREP IV, and Axius Partners Pty Limited provided representation in Australia.
