GLENVIEW, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Anixter International Inc. (NYSE: AXE) today reported sales of $2.0 
      billion for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, a 2.3% increase compared to 
      the prior year quarter. Organic sales increased 2.6% year-over-year, 
      excluding the impact of the following items:
    



        $13.8 million favorable impact from the higher average price of copper
      

        $18.2 million unfavorable impact from the fluctuation in foreign 
        currencies
      


      Both the current and prior year quarters had 64 billing days.
    

      All commentary in this release reflects results from continuing 
      operations unless otherwise noted. Please refer to the tables at the end 
      of this release for the reconciliations from our reported results 
      prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP to the non-GAAP measures.
    

      Net income of $40.1 million includes amortization of intangible assets 
      expense of $9.0 million pre-tax and $6.1 million after-tax. Net income 
      of $20.8 million in the second quarter of 2016 included amortization of 
      intangible assets, as well as a UK pension settlement, Latin America bad 
      debt provision, a restructuring charge, and acquisition and integration 
      costs, which combined had a $33.7 million pre-tax and $23.4 million 
      after-tax impact.
    

      Excluding the impact of the above items, second quarter 2017 adjusted 
      net income of $46.2 million increased 4.3% versus the prior year 
      adjusted net income of $44.2 million.
    

      Diluted earnings per share of $1.18 compares to $0.62, and adjusted 
      diluted earnings per share of $1.36 compares to $1.32, both versus the 
      prior year quarter.
    

      Adjusted EBITDA of $103.2 million, or 5.2% of sales, compares to prior 
      year adjusted EBITDA of $101.8 million, or 5.2% of sales and first 
      quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA of $89.5 million, or 4.7% of sales.
    

      Strong year-to-date cash flow from operations of $137.1 million was 
      driven by ongoing working capital improvements. Working capital was 
      18.5% of sales in the second quarter, a 70 basis point improvement from 
      the prior year quarter.
    

      "Second quarter 2017 year-over-year organic sales growth of 2.6% was 
      driven by a strong 15.8% organic growth in our Utility Power Solutions 
      segment. Against a backdrop of slow economic growth and a gradually 
      improving global economy, end market recovery remains uneven, with 
      strength in our growth initiatives, such as global accounts and 
      security, offsetting more challenging industrial markets" commented CEO 
      Bob Eck. "In the current economic and competitive environment, our 
      specialized distribution model, differentiated by our global footprint, 
      supply chain capabilities and technical expertise, position us well for 
      sustainable growth while helping our customers reduce risk, cost and 
      complexity in their supply chains."
    

Income Statement Detail


      Gross margin of 19.8% compares to 20.1% in the prior year quarter and 
      20.0% in the first quarter of 2017. The change in gross margin versus 
      prior year was primarily due to the growth coming from our lowest gross 
      margin segment. The significant operating leverage achieved in that 
      segment favorably contributes to consolidated operating margin.
    

      Operating expense of $313.0 million, or 15.6% of sales, compares to 
      prior year operating expense of $336.7 million, or 17.2% of sales. 
      Excluding current quarter expense of $9.0 million and second quarter 
      2016 expense of $33.7 million, as detailed above, second quarter 2017 
      adjusted operating expense of $304.0 million increased 0.3% versus 
      second quarter 2016 adjusted operating expense of $303.0 million and 
      0.7% versus first quarter 2017 adjusted operating expense of $301.7 
      million. Current quarter adjusted operating expense of 15.2% of sales 
      improved from 15.5% of sales in the second quarter of 2016 and 15.9% in 
      the first quarter of 2017, driven by the combination of expense 
      reduction initiatives and leveraging growth in the business.
    

      Operating income of $82.7 million, or 4.1% of sales, compares to $56.7 
      million, or 2.9% of sales, in the prior year quarter. Excluding 
      operating expense items outlined above, second quarter 2017 adjusted 
      operating income was $91.7 million compared to $90.4 million in the 
      second quarter of 2016. Adjusted operating margin of 4.6% is flat 
      compared to the prior year quarter.
    

      Interest expense of $17.9 million compares to $19.8 million in the prior 
      year quarter, as we decreased debt with the strong cash flow we continue 
      to generate. Foreign exchange and other expense of $1.0 million compares 
      to $0.8 million in the prior year quarter.
    

      Our second quarter 2017 U.S. GAAP effective tax rate ("ETR") was 37.2% 
      versus 42.4% in the second quarter of 2016 and our second quarter 2017 
      non-GAAP ETR was 36.6% versus 36.7% in the prior year quarter. Our 
      year-to-date 2017 non-GAAP effective tax rate of 36.9% differs from our 
      first quarter effective tax rate of 37.2% primarily due to country mix 
      of earnings.
    

Segment Update


Network & Security Solutions ("NSS") sales of $1,029.4 
      million compares to $1,044.7 million in the prior year period. Adjusted 
      for the $7.4 million unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, NSS 
      organic sales decreased 0.8%, reflecting fewer large projects in the 
      current quarter versus the prior year quarter. On a sequential basis, 
      sales increased by 4.5%.
    

      Second quarter NSS security sales of $423.1 million, which represents 
      approximately 41% of segment sales, increased 2.1% from the prior year 
      quarter. Adjusted for the $2.6 million negative currency impact, organic 
      security sales growth was 2.7%.
    

      NSS operating income of $64.9 million is flat compared to the second 
      quarter of 2016 and compares to $61.8 million in the first quarter of 
      2017. NSS adjusted EBITDA of $69.8 million compares to $75.7 million in 
      the second quarter of 2016 and $66.6 million in the first quarter of 
      2017. The corresponding adjusted EBITDA margin of 6.8% compares to 7.2% 
      in the second quarter of 2016 and is flat with the first quarter of 2017.
    

Electrical & Electronic Solutions (“EES”) sales of $561.5 
      million compares to $555.1 million in the prior year period, an increase 
      of 1.1%. Adjusted for the $9.0 million unfavorable impact from foreign 
      exchange and the $13.6 million favorable impact from higher average 
      copper prices, EES organic sales increased 0.3%, driven by growth with 
      OEM customers and synergistic growth from cross-selling low voltage 
      products to legacy Anixter customers.
    

      EES operating income of $29.6 million compares to $23.9 million in the 
      prior year quarter and $27.9 million in the first quarter of 2017. EES 
      adjusted EBITDA of $32.8 million compares to $32.3 million in the prior 
      year period and $30.4 million in the first quarter of 2017. The 
      corresponding adjusted EBITDA margin of 5.8% in the current quarter is 
      flat compared to both the prior year period and the first quarter of 
      2017.
    

Utility Power Solutions (“UPS”) sales of $410.5 million compares 
      to $355.9 million in the prior year period, an increase of 15.3%. 
      Adjusted for the $1.8 million unfavorable impact from foreign exchange 
      and the $0.2 million favorable impact from higher average copper prices, 
      UPS organic sales increased 15.8%.
    

      UPS operating income of $21.3 million compares to $12.0 million in the 
      prior year quarter and $16.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. UPS 
      adjusted EBITDA of $25.9 million increased 34.1% from $19.3 million in 
      the prior year quarter, and increased 23.9% from $20.9 million in the 
      first quarter of 2017. The corresponding adjusted EBITDA margin of 6.3% 
      in the current quarter increased 90 basis points versus 5.4% in the 
      prior year quarter and 80 basis points versus 5.5% in the first quarter 
      of 2017. The performance of both adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA 
      margin versus prior periods was driven by strong operating profit 
      leverage.
    

      "Our overall sales performance was consistent with our expectations at 
      the beginning of the quarter, as we delivered sales growth at the high 
      end of our projected 1.5 - 3% outlook range. Our NSS segment experienced 
      a decline in sales as we faced challenging comparisons from large 
      projects in the prior year quarter; however, momentum in the business 
      remains strong, evidenced by the 4.5% increase in sales on a sequential 
      basis. Finally, modest growth in our EES segment reflects solid growth 
      trends with OEM customers, partially offset by the persistent 
      challenging industrial end markets," commented Bill Galvin, who was 
      named President and Chief Operating Officer on July 1, 2017.
    

Cash Flow and Leverage


      We generated $137.1 million in cash flow from operations year-to-date 
      through the second quarter of 2017, which compares to $149.6 million in 
      the comparable year-ago period. The decrease is primarily due to higher 
      working capital investment to support growth in the business. We 
      continue to estimate full year 2017 cash flow from operations in the 
      range of $200 - $220 million. In the second quarter of 2017 we invested 
      $20.8 million in capital expenditures, which compares to $16.4 million 
      in the prior year period. For the full year we expect to invest $45 - 
      $50 million in capital expenditures.
    

      "In addition to our focus on our strategic initiatives, including 
      delivering on our synergy goals, we continue to improve our cost 
      structure and working capital efficiency. Our ongoing focus on 
      excellence in execution has resulted in continued strong cash flow from 
      operations, enabling us to further reduce our debt. " commented Ted 
      Dosch, Executive Vice President - Finance and CFO. "Looking at our 
      capital structure, the strong free cash flow we are generating from our 
      repositioned platform, combined with working capital initiatives, 
      enabled us to return our debt-to-capital ratio to our target range of 
      45-to-50% in the first quarter of 2017, ahead of our second half of 2017 
      target. We remain on track to return our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio 
      to our target range of 2.5-to-3.0 times by the end of the year."
    

      Key capital structure and credit-related statistics for the quarter:
    


        Debt-to-total capital ratio improved to 48.8% from 51.6% at the end of 
        2016
      

        Weighted average cost of borrowed capital of 5.1% compares to 4.7% in 
        the prior year quarter
      

        $610.8 million available under revolving lines of credit and secured 
        accounts receivable and inventory facilities
      


Business Outlook


      "Year-to-date, organic sales growth of 3.3% reflects solid execution of 
      our growth initiatives and flat to modest share gain across our markets, 
      against the backdrop of a slowly improving economic environment. As we 
      enter the second half of the year, our focus remains on our growth 
      initiatives which include synergistic sales and global accounts. Based 
      on our backlog and pipeline activity, and supported by our customers' 
      optimism and the macro-economic indicators we track, we remain 
      optimistic that end markets will improve in the second half of 2017," 
      commented Bob Eck. "Reflecting our current sales and backlog trends, we 
      expect third quarter 2017 organic sales growth in the 2.0 - 4.0% range. 
      For the full year 2017 we have increased the midpoint of our outlook 
      range by 50 basis points, and now expect full year organic sales growth 
      in the 3.0 - 5.0% range."

      Safe Harbor Statement
    

      The statements in this release other than historical facts are 
      forward-looking statements made in reliance upon the safe harbor of the 
      Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking 
      statements are subject to a number of factors that could cause our 
      actual results to differ materially from what is indicated here. These 
      factors include but are not limited to general economic conditions, the 
      level of customer demand particularly for capital projects in the 
      markets we serve, changes in supplier relationships or in supplier sales 
      strategies or financial viability, risks associated with the sale of 
      nonconforming products and services, political, economic or currency 
      risks related to foreign operations, inventory obsolescence, copper 
      price fluctuations, customer viability, risks associated with accounts 
      receivable, the impact of regulation and regulatory, investigative and 
      legal proceedings and legal compliance risks, information security 
      risks, risks associated with substantial debt and restrictions contained 
      in financial and operating covenants in our debt agreements, the impact 
      and the uncertainty concerning the timing and terms of the withdrawal by 
      the United Kingdom from the European Union, and risks associated with 
      integration of acquired companies, including, but not limited to, the 
      risk that the acquisitions may not provide us with the synergies or 
      other benefits that were anticipated. These uncertainties may cause our 
      actual results to be materially different than those expressed in any 
      forward looking statements. We do not undertake to update any forward 
      looking statements. Please see our Securities and Exchange Commission 
      (“SEC”) filings for more information.
    

Non-GAAP Financial Measures


In addition to the results provided in accordance with U.S. Generally 
      Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”) above, this release 
      includes certain financial measures computed using non-GAAP components 
      as defined by the SEC. Specifically, net sales comparisons to the prior 
      corresponding period, both worldwide and in relevant segments, are 
      discussed in this release both on an U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We 
      believe that by providing non-GAAP organic growth, which adjusts for the 
      impact of acquisitions (when applicable), foreign exchange fluctuations, 
      copper prices and the number of billing days, both management and 
      investors are provided with meaningful supplemental sales information to 
      understand and analyze our underlying trends and other aspects of our 
      financial performance. Historically and from time to time, we may also 
      exclude other items from reported financial results (e.g., impairment 
      charges, inventory adjustments, restructuring charges, tax items, 
      currency devaluations, pension settlements, etc.) in presenting adjusted 
      operating expense, adjusted operating income, adjusted income taxes and 
      adjusted net income so that both management and financial statement 
      users can use these non-GAAP financial measures to better understand and 
      evaluate our performance period over period and to analyze the 
      underlying trends of our business. As a result of the recent 
      acquisitions we have also excluded amortization of intangible assets 
      associated with purchase accounting from acquisitions from the adjusted 
      amounts for comparison of the non-GAAP financial measures period over 
      period.


EBITDA is defined as net income from continuing operations before 
      interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA 
      is defined as EBITDA before foreign exchange and other non-operating 
      expense and non-cash stock-based compensation, excluding the other items 
      from reported financial results, as defined above. Adjusted EBITDA 
      leverage is defined as the percentage change in Adjusted EBITDA divided 
      by the percentage change in net sales. We believe that adjusted 
      operating income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA leverage 
      provide relevant and useful information, which is widely used by 
      analysts, investors and competitors in our industry as well as by our 
      management in assessing both consolidated and business segment 
      performance. Adjusted operating income provides an understanding of the 
      results from the primary operations of our business by excluding the 
      effects of certain items that do not reflect the ordinary earnings of 
      our operations. We use adjusted operating income to evaluate our 
      period-over-period operating performance because we believe this 
      provides a more comparable measure of our continuing business excluding 
      certain items that are not reflective of expected ongoing operations. 
      This measure may be useful to an investor in evaluating the underlying 
      performance of our business. EBITDA provides us with an understanding of 
      earnings before the impact of investing and financing charges and income 
      taxes. Adjusted EBITDA further excludes the effects of foreign exchange 
      and other non-cash stock-based compensation, and certain items that do 
      not reflect the ordinary earnings of our operations and that are also 
      excluded for purposes of calculating adjusted net income, adjusted 
      earnings per share and adjusted operating income. EBITDA and Adjusted 
      EBITDA are used by our management for various purposes including as 
      measures of performance of our operating segments and as a basis for 
      strategic planning and forecasting. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 
      leverage may be useful to an investor because this measure is widely 
      used to evaluate a company’s operating performance without regard to 
      items excluded from the calculation of such measure, which can vary 
      substantially from company to company depending on the accounting 
      methods, book value of assets, capital structure and the method by which 
      the assets were acquired, among other factors. They are not, however, 
      intended as an alternative measure of operating results or cash flow 
      from operations as determined in accordance with generally accepted 
      accounting principles.


Non-GAAP financial measures provide insight into selected financial 
      information and should be evaluated in the context in which they are 
      presented. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as 
      analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation from, or as 
      a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with 
      U.S. GAAP, and non-GAAP financial measures as reported by us may not be 
      comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies. The 
      non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in conjunction with the 
      Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, including the related 
      notes, and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition 
      and Results of Operations included in this release. Management does not 
      use these non-GAAP financial measures for any purpose other than the 
      reasons stated above.

Early History[edit]
Anixter was started in 1957 by brothers Alan and Bill Anixter. Known originally as Anixter Brothers, the two opened Anixter as a wholesale distribution company that resold cable. The two brothers received a $10,000 loan from their mother to get the business started, and within 10 years grew revenue to $10 million.[5] In 1969, Anixter moved its headquarters to Skokie. In an interview with the Chicago Tribune, Alan Anixter said he carried a list of acquisitions in his pocket, and by the end of the 1960s, Anixter acquired 19 companies.[5] Anixter went public on the American Stock Exchange in 1967 and expanded to the U.K. in 1972. In 1975, Anixter gained a listing on the New York Stock Exchange, and by the end of the 1970s it had $268 million in sales and 38 warehouses in the U.S., nine in Canada, three in the U.K. and one in the Netherlands.[5]
Telecommunications Era[edit]
With the breakup of AT&T in early 1984, Anixter went about hiring executives from phone companies and suppliers and invested heavily in its telecommunications business.[8] Until this time, regional telephone companies had to buy their equipment directly from AT&T’s Western Electric Company; however, this ruling allowed a business like Anixter’s to sell direct to regional telephone companies.[9] By the mid 1980s, telecommunications sales made up 60 to 70 percent of Anixter’s business.[8] In 1987, the holding company bought Anixter, which had moved into the data communications business. Itel was led by Samuel Zell, who had become chairman in 1985.[5] In the late 1980s, Anixter created a program called Levels to compare one brand of cable to the other.[10] By the 1990s, the Levels program became industry standard, and in 2003, Anixter sold the Levels program to Underwriters Laboratories.[11][12] In 1989, Anixter crossed the $1 billion mark in sales.[13] By the 1990s, Itel made Anixter its core operation,[7] and in 1995, Itel changed its name to Anixter.[7] In the 1990s, Anixter continued to expand into different markets. It entered the Mexico market in 1991, Australia in 1992, and Eastern Europe and Asia Pacific in 1993. Anixter entered the South American market in 1995. In the later 1990s and 2000s, Anixter purchased Pacer Electronics, Pentacon, Walters Hexagon, DDI, Infast Group, MFU, Eurofast, Total Supply Solutions, Quality Screw & Nut and Quality Screw de Mexico, World Class Wire & Cable, Sofrasar, CamilleGergen, CLARK Security Products and Jorvex.[7]

Itel was led by Samuel Zell, who had become chairman in 1985.[5] In the late 1980s, Anixter created a program called Levels to compare one brand of cable to the other.[10] By the 1990s, the Levels program became industry standard, and in 2003, Anixter sold the Levels program to Underwriters Laboratories.[11][12] In 1989, Anixter crossed the $1 billion mark in sales.[13] By the 1990s, Itel made Anixter its core operation,[7] and in 1995, Itel changed its name to Anixter.[7] In the 1990s, Anixter continued to expand into different markets. It entered the Mexico market in 1991, Australia in 1992, and Eastern Europe and Asia Pacific in 1993. Anixter entered the South American market in 1995. In the later 1990s and 2000s, Anixter purchased Pacer Electronics, Pentacon, Walters Hexagon, DDI, Infast Group, MFU, Eurofast, Total Supply Solutions, Quality Screw & Nut and Quality Screw de Mexico, World Class Wire & Cable, Sofrasar, CamilleGergen, CLARK Security Products and Jorvex.[7]

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Zacks Equity Research reports, or ZER for short, are our in-house, independently produced research reports.
The ever popular one-page Snapshot reports are generated for virtually every single Zacks Ranked stock. It's packed with all of the company's key stats and salient decision making information. Including the Zacks Rank, Zacks Industry Rank, Style Scores, the Price, Consensus & Surprise chart, graphical estimate analysis and how a stocks stacks up to its peers.
The detailed multi-page Analyst report does an even deeper dive on the company's vital statistics. In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Early History[edit]
Anixter was started in 1957 by brothers Alan and Bill Anixter. Known originally as Anixter Brothers, the two opened Anixter as a wholesale distribution company that resold cable. The two brothers received a $10,000 loan from their mother to get the business started, and within 10 years grew revenue to $10 million.[5] In 1969, Anixter moved its headquarters to Skokie. In an interview with the Chicago Tribune, Alan Anixter said he carried a list of acquisitions in his pocket, and by the end of the 1960s, Anixter acquired 19 companies.[5] Anixter went public on the American Stock Exchange in 1967 and expanded to the U.K. in 1972. In 1975, Anixter gained a listing on the New York Stock Exchange, and by the end of the 1970s it had $268 million in sales and 38 warehouses in the U.S., nine in Canada, three in the U.K. and one in the Netherlands.[5]
Telecommunications Era[edit]
With the breakup of AT&T in early 1984, Anixter went about hiring executives from phone companies and suppliers and invested heavily in its telecommunications business.[8] Until this time, regional telephone companies had to buy their equipment directly from AT&T’s Western Electric Company; however, this ruling allowed a business like Anixter’s to sell direct to regional telephone companies.[9] By the mid 1980s, telecommunications sales made up 60 to 70 percent of Anixter’s business.[8] In 1987, the holding company bought Anixter, which had moved into the data communications business. Itel was led by Samuel Zell, who had become chairman in 1985.[5] In the late 1980s, Anixter created a program called Levels to compare one brand of cable to the other.[10] By the 1990s, the Levels program became industry standard, and in 2003, Anixter sold the Levels program to Underwriters Laboratories.[11][12] In 1989, Anixter crossed the $1 billion mark in sales.[13] By the 1990s, Itel made Anixter its core operation,[7] and in 1995, Itel changed its name to Anixter.[7] In the 1990s, Anixter continued to expand into different markets. It entered the Mexico market in 1991, Australia in 1992, and Eastern Europe and Asia Pacific in 1993. Anixter entered the South American market in 1995. In the later 1990s and 2000s, Anixter purchased Pacer Electronics, Pentacon, Walters Hexagon, DDI, Infast Group, MFU, Eurofast, Total Supply Solutions, Quality Screw & Nut and Quality Screw de Mexico, World Class Wire & Cable, Sofrasar, CamilleGergen, CLARK Security Products and Jorvex.[7]

Early History[edit]
Anixter was started in 1957 by brothers Alan and Bill Anixter. Known originally as Anixter Brothers, the two opened Anixter as a wholesale distribution company that resold cable. The two brothers received a $10,000 loan from their mother to get the business started, and within 10 years grew revenue to $10 million.[5] In 1969, Anixter moved its headquarters to Skokie. In an interview with the Chicago Tribune, Alan Anixter said he carried a list of acquisitions in his pocket, and by the end of the 1960s, Anixter acquired 19 companies.[5] Anixter went public on the American Stock Exchange in 1967 and expanded to the U.K. in 1972. In 1975, Anixter gained a listing on the New York Stock Exchange, and by the end of the 1970s it had $268 million in sales and 38 warehouses in the U.S., nine in Canada, three in the U.K. and one in the Netherlands.[5]

With the breakup of AT&T in early 1984, Anixter went about hiring executives from phone companies and suppliers and invested heavily in its telecommunications business.[8] Until this time, regional telephone companies had to buy their equipment directly from AT&T’s Western Electric Company; however, this ruling allowed a business like Anixter’s to sell direct to regional telephone companies.[9] By the mid 1980s, telecommunications sales made up 60 to 70 percent of Anixter’s business.[8] In 1987, the holding company bought Anixter, which had moved into the data communications business. Itel was led by Samuel Zell, who had become chairman in 1985.[5] In the late 1980s, Anixter created a program called Levels to compare one brand of cable to the other.[10] By the 1990s, the Levels program became industry standard, and in 2003, Anixter sold the Levels program to Underwriters Laboratories.[11][12] In 1989, Anixter crossed the $1 billion mark in sales.[13] By the 1990s, Itel made Anixter its core operation,[7] and in 1995, Itel changed its name to Anixter.[7] In the 1990s, Anixter continued to expand into different markets. It entered the Mexico market in 1991, Australia in 1992, and Eastern Europe and Asia Pacific in 1993. Anixter entered the South American market in 1995. In the later 1990s and 2000s, Anixter purchased Pacer Electronics, Pentacon, Walters Hexagon, DDI, Infast Group, MFU, Eurofast, Total Supply Solutions, Quality Screw & Nut and Quality Screw de Mexico, World Class Wire & Cable, Sofrasar, CamilleGergen, CLARK Security Products and Jorvex.[7]

Early History[edit]
Anixter was started in 1957 by brothers Alan and Bill Anixter. Known originally as Anixter Brothers, the two opened Anixter as a wholesale distribution company that resold cable. The two brothers received a $10,000 loan from their mother to get the business started, and within 10 years grew revenue to $10 million.[5] In 1969, Anixter moved its headquarters to Skokie. In an interview with the Chicago Tribune, Alan Anixter said he carried a list of acquisitions in his pocket, and by the end of the 1960s, Anixter acquired 19 companies.[5] Anixter went public on the American Stock Exchange in 1967 and expanded to the U.K. in 1972. In 1975, Anixter gained a listing on the New York Stock Exchange, and by the end of the 1970s it had $268 million in sales and 38 warehouses in the U.S., nine in Canada, three in the U.K. and one in the Netherlands.[5]

With the breakup of AT&T in early 1984, Anixter went about hiring executives from phone companies and suppliers and invested heavily in its telecommunications business.[8] Until this time, regional telephone companies had to buy their equipment directly from AT&T’s Western Electric Company; however, this ruling allowed a business like Anixter’s to sell direct to regional telephone companies.[9] By the mid 1980s, telecommunications sales made up 60 to 70 percent of Anixter’s business.[8] In 1987, the holding company bought Anixter, which had moved into the data communications business. Itel was led by Samuel Zell, who had become chairman in 1985.[5] In the late 1980s, Anixter created a program called Levels to compare one brand of cable to the other.[10] By the 1990s, the Levels program became industry standard, and in 2003, Anixter sold the Levels program to Underwriters Laboratories.[11][12] In 1989, Anixter crossed the $1 billion mark in sales.[13] By the 1990s, Itel made Anixter its core operation,[7] and in 1995, Itel changed its name to Anixter.[7] In the 1990s, Anixter continued to expand into different markets. It entered the Mexico market in 1991, Australia in 1992, and Eastern Europe and Asia Pacific in 1993. Anixter entered the South American market in 1995. In the later 1990s and 2000s, Anixter purchased Pacer Electronics, Pentacon, Walters Hexagon, DDI, Infast Group, MFU, Eurofast, Total Supply Solutions, Quality Screw & Nut and Quality Screw de Mexico, World Class Wire & Cable, Sofrasar, CamilleGergen, CLARK Security Products and Jorvex.[7]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
