Overview 















Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 provides that money market funds may not acquire any security other than a “weekly liquid asset” unless, immediately following such purchase, at least 30% of its total assets would be invested in weekly liquid assets. In addition, the Rule provides that taxable money market funds may not acquire any security other than a “daily liquid asset” unless, immediately following such purchase, at least 10% of its total assets would be invested in daily liquid assets.
Daily Liquid Assets include (i) cash; (ii) direct obligations of the U.S. Government; and (iii) securities that will mature or are subject to a demand feature that is exercisable and payable within one business Day. May include the effect of receivables from pending sales and payables from pending purchases.
Weekly Liquid Assets include (i) cash; (ii) direct obligations of the U.S. Government; (iii) U.S. Government securities issued by a person controlled or supervised by and acting as an instrumentality of the U.S. Government pursuant to authority granted by the U.S. Congress, that are issued at a discount to the principal amount to be repaid at maturity and have a remaining maturity of 60 days or less; and (iv) securities that will mature or are subject to a demand feature that is exercisable and payable within five business Days.

		What I Should Know 
Before Investing




You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. The Fund may impose a fee upon sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the Fund's liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund’s sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any time. 
 The Fund's yield may be affected by changes in interest rates and changes in credit ratings. Please see the Fund's prospectus for additional fund specific risks.

 Performance 






Performance








IMPORTANT PERFORMANCE INFORMATION: The performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results, and current performance may be higher or lower than the performance shown.  Average annual total returns and calendar year returns assumes reinvestment of all distributions at net asset value and the deduction of all fund expenses. Performance would have been lower if fees had not been reimbursed or waived in various periods. Performance for other share classes will vary due to differences in sales charge structure and class expenses. All classes of shares are not available through all distribution channels.
The Current SEC 7-day yield represents net interest income generated by the investments for the past 7 days and assumes that the same income is generated each week over a 365-day period. The 7-day yield more closely reflects current fund earnings than does total returns. Yields for other share classes may vary due to differences in sales charge structure and class expenses. The Fund's yields reflect expense reimbursements or fee waivers, if any; absent these expense reimbursements and/or fee waivers, performance would have been lower.

**Gross expenses are the Fund's total annual operating expenses for the share class(es) shown.  Net expenses for Class(es) A reflect contractual fee waivers and/or reimbursements, where these reductions reduce the Fund's gross expenses, which cannot be terminated prior to Dec 31, 2018 without Board consent.

 Holdings 






Holdings









Weighted Average Maturity (WAM) is a weighted average of all the maturities of the securities held in a fund. WAM for money market funds can be used as a measure of sensitivity to interest rate changes. Generally, the longer the maturity, the greater the sensitivity. Weighted Average Life (WAL) is the weighted average of the life of the securities held in a fund or portfolio and can be used as a measure of sensitivity to changes in liquidity and/or credit risk. Generally, the higher the value, the greater the sensitivity. However, unlike WAM, WAL does not include interest rate resets in its calculation. Effective Maturity is a measure of a bond's maturity which takes into consideration the possibility that the issuer may call the bond before its maturity date.

Overview 















Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 provides that money market funds may not acquire any security other than a “weekly liquid asset” unless, immediately following such purchase, at least 30% of its total assets would be invested in weekly liquid assets. In addition, the Rule provides that taxable money market funds may not acquire any security other than a “daily liquid asset” unless, immediately following such purchase, at least 10% of its total assets would be invested in daily liquid assets.
Daily Liquid Assets include (i) cash; (ii) direct obligations of the U.S. Government; and (iii) securities that will mature or are subject to a demand feature that is exercisable and payable within one business Day. May include the effect of receivables from pending sales and payables from pending purchases.
Weekly Liquid Assets include (i) cash; (ii) direct obligations of the U.S. Government; (iii) U.S. Government securities issued by a person controlled or supervised by and acting as an instrumentality of the U.S. Government pursuant to authority granted by the U.S. Congress, that are issued at a discount to the principal amount to be repaid at maturity and have a remaining maturity of 60 days or less; and (iv) securities that will mature or are subject to a demand feature that is exercisable and payable within five business Days. May include the effect of receivables from pending sales and payables from pending purchases.
Shadow NAV is the market-based net asset value per share of a fund calculated based on current market factors, before applying the amortized cost method.The Funds do not use a market-based NAV for purchase and sale transactions in Fund shares.









Highlights

Also seeks to provide preservation of capital and liquidity. 
At least 80% of the  portfolio is diversified among a wide array of securities issued by California and its political subdivisions, agencies and public authorities and certain other qualifying governmental issuers.

		What I Should Know 
Before Investing




You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. The Fund may impose a fee upon sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the Fund's liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund's sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any time. 
 The Fund's yield may be affected by changes in interest rates and changes in credit ratings. Because the Fund concentrates its holdings in a specific state, economic and political developments in that state may adversely affect the Fund. Certain investors may be subject to the Federal Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), and state and local taxes may apply. Capital gains, if any, are fully taxable. Please see the Fund's prospectus for additional fund specific risks.

 Performance 






Performance








IMPORTANT PERFORMANCE INFORMATION: The performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results, and current performance may be higher or lower than the performance shown.  Average annual total returns and calendar year returns assumes reinvestment of all distributions at net asset value and the deduction of all fund expenses. Performance would have been lower if fees had not been reimbursed or waived in various periods. Performance for other share classes will vary due to differences in sales charge structure and class expenses. All classes of shares are not available through all distribution channels.
The Current SEC 7-day yield represents net interest income generated by the investments for the past 7 days and assumes that the same income is generated each week over a 365-day period. The 7-day yield more closely reflects current fund earnings than does total returns. Yields for other share classes may vary due to differences in sales charge structure and class expenses. The Fund's yields reflect expense reimbursements or fee waivers, if any; absent these expense reimbursements and/or fee waivers, performance would have been lower.
Click here for historical Shadow NAV data.





















**Gross expenses are the Fund's total annual operating expenses for the share class(es) shown.  Net expenses for Class(es) A & N reflect contractual fee waivers and/or reimbursements, where these reductions reduce the Fund's gross expenses, which cannot be terminated prior to Dec 31, 2018 without Board consent.

 Holdings 






Holdings









IMPORTANT HOLDINGS INFORMATION: The Portfolio's investments are valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value, in accordance with Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The amortized cost method of valuation involves valuing portfolio securities at their cost and thereafter assuming a constant amortization to maturity of any discount or premium. As of the period ended April 30, 2016, the data in the “Value” column represents the market value of the Portfolio’s investments.  For those periods prior to April 30, 2016, the data in the “Value” column represents the amortized cost value. 
The Portfolio's use of amortized cost is subject to its compliance with certain conditions as specified by Rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act. The Portfolio continues to meet the requirements of Rule 2a-7 that permit it to utilize amortized cost to value its securities.
Portfolio holdings are subject to change at any time. Percentages are based on total investments. This information is provided for information purposes only and should not be construed as a recommendation to purchase or sell any security.
Derivatives, such as options and futures, which can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and have a potentially large impact on Fund performance.

Weighted Average Maturity (WAM) is a weighted average of all the maturities of the securities held in a fund. WAM for money market funds can be used as a measure of sensitivity to interest rate changes. Generally, the longer the maturity, the greater the sensitivity. Weighted Average Life (WAL) is the weighted average of the life of the securities held in a fund or portfolio and can be used as a measure of sensitivity to changes in liquidity and/or credit risk. Generally, the higher the value, the greater the sensitivity. However, unlike WAM, WAL does not include interest rate resets in its calculation. Effective Maturity is a measure of a bond's maturity which takes into consideration the possibility that the issuer may call the bond before its maturity date.

 Distributions 






Distributions









IMPORTANT DISTRIBUTION INFORMATION: The fund's policy is to declare daily, and pay monthly, dividends from net investment income. Each day on which the fund declares a dividend distribution is ex date.

The character of distributions for certain funds may have been subsequently adjusted for tax purposes. Shareholders can determine which funds may have reclassified the tax character of distributions by visiting the Tax Center in Account Services. Information on reclassifications for distributions paid during the current calendar year will not be available until the first quarter of the following year.

a The Fund has decreased its distributions to a level
          that better approximates the current level of net investment income
          generated by its investment portfolio.
        



b Total monthly distribution unchanged from prior month -
          $0.0900 ($0.0779 per share from income and $0.0121 per share from
          LTCG)
        



          LTCG – Long-Term Capital Gain
        



           
        



      This press release is not for tax reporting purposes but is being
      provided to announce the amount of each Fund’s distributions that have
      been declared by the Board of Directors. In early 2018, after definitive
      information is available, each Fund will send shareholders a Form
      1099-DIV, if applicable, specifying how the distributions paid by each
      Fund during the prior calendar year should be characterized for purposes
      of reporting the distributions on a shareholder’s tax return (e.g.,
      ordinary income, long-term capital gain or return of capital).
    

      For more information about the Funds, please call 1-888-777-0102 or
      consult the Fund’s web site at www.lmcef.com.
      Hard copies of the Funds’ complete audited financial statement are
      available free of charge upon request.
    

      Data and commentary provided in this press release are for informational
      purposes only. Legg Mason and its affiliates do not engage in selling
      shares of the Funds.
