KVH has the worst customer service ever.

I had a KVH sat phone installed on my boat.

It failed on day one.

I called KVH customer service daily for 10 days, as I was embarking on a 10,000 mile voyage.

They blamed each other (activation v tech support) and Inmarsat.

The KVH tech support guy was unfamiliar with the handset display ON THEIR OWN PRODUCT!!!

I spent around 10 hours on the phone and was told it was being "escalated" and to await their call.  Nobody ever followed up.  I was always sent to VM.

Finally, I called Inmarsat who told me I needed to reset my sat phone and ten minutes later it worked.

A paper clip reset and ten minutes later it worked.

Why was an Inmarsat help line guy able to diagnose this but KVH wasn't.

They sold me a top dollar product and provided bottom dollar support.

What a poorly supported product.

History

                    Established in 1982.
            

                In 1982, Arent, Robert, and Martin Kits van Heyningen launched the world's first digital compass for use in racing sailboats. They called it Sailcomp, and the company Sailcomp Industries was born. As other products and applications were added, the company changed the name to KVH Industries, a name they felt would cover any future development. Throughout the 1990s, KVH developed dozens of innovative products, expanding beyond marine compass technology to mobile satellite television systems and land-based systems utilizing sensor technology for commercial and military applications. KVH's mission is to connect in-motion global customers with the same digital services they rely on in their homes and offices, and to contribute to the potential of unmanned systems for improving human lives. Innovative ideas, engineering challenges, and a passion to exceed customer expectations propel the company forward - today, as in the past.

	KVH Industries Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2016 Results









	MIDDLETOWN, RI, March 2, 2017


	 — KVH Industries, Inc., (Nasdaq: KVHI) reported financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 today. The company will hold a conference call to discuss these results at 10:30 a.m. ET today, which can be accessed at investors.kvh.com. Following the call, a replay of the webcast will be available through the company’s website.




	Fourth Quarter 2016 Highlights




	 













	•






	Revenue was at the high end of the guidance range at $43.9 million, which was a decrease of 19%, from $54.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Excluding foreign exchange translation, revenue decreased 15%.





















	•






	Net loss was $6.8 million, or $0.43 per share, compared to net income of $4.1 million, or $0.26 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2015, below our guidance range by $0.37 per share. The company recorded $6.6 million in income tax expense, of which $7.1 million related to certain discrete non-cash tax reserves. These charges are excluded from the calculation of non-GAAP EPS.





















	•






	Non-GAAP net income was $2.2 million, or $0.13 per share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $6.8 million, or $0.43 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015, exceeding the high end of the guidance by $0.03 per share.





















	•






	Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA was $4.3 million, compared to $9.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, exceeding the high end of the guidance by $0.8 million.





















	•






	The company had $52.1 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities on its balance sheet at December 31, 2016, compared to $45.3 million as of December 31, 2015.












	Commenting on the quarter, Martin Kits van Heyningen, KVH’s Chief Executive Officer, said “We are generally pleased with our fourth quarter results having met the high end of, or exceeded, our most recent guidance at almost every level. In 2017, we will be investing in key strategic initiatives such as low cost fiber optic gyros for self-driving cars and new high throughput satellite services for the maritime market that have the potential to transform the company going forward. We are taking a more conservative view with respect to near term TACNAV revenue guidance, but we continue to be extremely optimistic about this part of our business as well.”









	In the fourth quarter of 2016, consistent with certain internal organizational changes implemented by the company, the company changed its reporting structure from two operating segments based on geographies selling navigation, guidance and stabilization and mobile communication products, to two operating segments based on product lines: mobile connectivity and inertial navigation. Net sales for the mobile connectivity segment decreased $3.0 million as reported but decreased only $1.4 million in constant currency compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, as lower mini-VSAT Broadband product sales were partially offset by higher airtime and content and training revenues. Net sales for inertial navigation decreased $7.0 million, or 39%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. The decrease was driven primarily by lower TACNAV orders.

	Fourth Quarter Financial Summary




	Revenue was $43.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, a decrease of 19% compared to $54.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, notwithstanding weakness in the British Pound that negatively impacted revenue in 2016 by $1.6 million, or 4%. Fourth quarter product revenues of $18.6 million were 32% lower than the prior year quarter, primarily due to a 41% year-over-year decrease in navigation product revenues and a 16% decrease in mobile connectivity product revenues.




	Service revenues for the fourth quarter of 2016 were $25.3 million, a decrease of 5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Airtime service revenues, which include mini-VSAT Broadband airtime revenues, were up slightly year-over-year. Our mini-VSAT airtime increased 2% and Inmarsat airtime decreased 26%. Our engineering service revenues declined 53% as a result of the completion of a substantial contract in the first quarter of 2016. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we provided a significant level of engineering services that pertained to nonstandard products, which were subsequently delivered in the first quarter of 2016. Content and training revenues, which include our entertainment, eLearning, and safety content, decreased by 14% in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015; however, on a constant currency basis, revenues increased by 4%. Weakness in the British Pound negatively impacted content and training revenues by $1.6 million, or 17%.




	Our operating expenses decreased $1.4 million year over year to $19.4 million. The key drivers were the reduction of sales commissions, resulting from the lower sales revenue and the weakness in the British Pound, as well as a gain of $0.9 million recognized as a result of the termination and settlement of certain royalty agreements. The decrease in operating expenses was partially offset by a $0.9 million increase in research and development expenses.









	Full Year Financial Summary




	For the year ended December 31, 2016, revenue was $176.1 million, a decrease of 5%, compared to $184.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Weakness in the British Pound negatively impacted revenue in 2016 by $4.0 million, or 2%. Product revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 of $73.1 million were 4% lower than the comparable period last year, driven primarily by a 5% decrease in mobile connectivity product revenues and a 3% decrease in our navigation product revenues year-over-year.




	Service revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 of $103.0 million decreased 5% from the comparable period last year. Airtime service revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased 1% year-over-year. Our mini-VSAT Broadband airtime revenue increased slightly, but was offset by a decrease in Inmarsat airtime revenue of 28%. Engineering service revenue decreased 53% principally due to the previously described fourth quarter decrease. Content and training revenues decreased by 10%, however on a constant currency basis, revenue in those product lines increased by 1%. British Pound weakness negatively impacted content and training revenues by $4.0 million, or 11%.




	The company reported a GAAP net loss of $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, or $0.47 per share. During the same period last year, the company recorded a GAAP net income of $2.3 million, or $0.14 per share. The net loss in 2016 includes $6.8 million of non-cash discrete tax reserves. The company recorded non-GAAP net income of $7.0 million, or $0.44 per share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $11.6 million, or $0.73 per diluted share reported for the prior year. Non-


























	GAAP adjusted EBITDA was $15.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $21.2 million in the prior year.




	First Quarter 2017 and Full Year 2017 Outlook




	We expect 2017 will be an important year of strategic investment in certain initiatives that we believe have the potential to result in significant revenue growth in 2018 and beyond. These initiatives include the rollout of new high throughput satellite service and hardware, the introduction of innovative subscription options for the commercial maritime sector, development of a low cost fiber optic gyro for autonomous vehicles, and enhancements to our TACNAV technology to support the critical military demand for assured position, navigation, and timing. Together, we believe these initiatives have the potential to result in significant increases to our revenues in the next 3 to 4 years. However, we expect to see little benefit at the revenue line for these initiatives in 2017, and in fact are likely to see some initial headwinds, especially as we roll out our new commercial maritime subscription program, as the hardware revenue will be recognized over time. We will make incremental investments in these initiatives this year in order to put ourselves in the best position to benefit from their success in 2018 and beyond. Consequently, our guidance for 2017 anticipates only moderate growth in revenue with a fairly large increase in operating expenses as we fund these programs. We have also been conservative in including only a limited number of TACNAV systems from the anticipated large orders in the pipeline. Specifically, our guidance for the first quarter and full year of 2017 is as follows:

	Non-GAAP Financial Measures




	Provided in this release is non-GAAP financial information, including non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted EPS, and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, as a supplement to the condensed financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing financial results to assess operational performance and (only in the case of non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA) liquidity. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release adjust for specified items that can be highly variable or difficult to predict. The company generally uses these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate management’s financial and operational decision-making, including evaluation of the company’s historical operating results, comparison to competitors’ operating results and determination of management incentive compensation. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the company’s operations


























	that, when viewed with GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the company's business.




	Some limitations of non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP diluted EPS, and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, include the following:


















	•






	Non-GAAP net income (loss) and basic and diluted EPS exclude amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation, certain discrete tax items, acquisition-related compensation, and other discrete charges.







	  













	•






	Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA represents net income (loss) before interest income, interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related compensation and other discrete charges.












	Other companies, including companies in KVH’s industry, may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently or not at all, which will reduce their usefulness as a comparative measure.









	Future Non-GAAP Adjustments




	Future GAAP EPS may be affected by changes in ongoing assumptions and judgments, and may also be affected by non-recurring, unusual or unanticipated charges, expenses or gains, which are excluded in the calculation of the company's non-GAAP EPS guidance as described in this press release.









	Because non-GAAP financial measures exclude the effect of items that will increase or decrease the company’s reported results of operations, management strongly encourages investors to review the company’s consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the tables accompanying this release.

KVH has the worst customer service ever.

I had a KVH sat phone installed on my boat.

It failed on day one.

I called KVH customer service daily for 10 days, as I was embarking on a 10,000 mile voyage.

They blamed each other (activation v tech support) and Inmarsat.

The KVH tech support guy was unfamiliar with the handset display ON THEIR OWN PRODUCT!!!

I spent around 10 hours on the phone and was told it was being "escalated" and to await their call.  Nobody ever followed up.  I was always sent to VM.

Finally, I called Inmarsat who told me I needed to reset my sat phone and ten minutes later it worked.

A paper clip reset and ten minutes later it worked.

Why was an Inmarsat help line guy able to diagnose this but KVH wasn't.

They sold me a top dollar product and provided bottom dollar support.

What a poorly supported product.

History

                    Established in 1982.
            

                In 1982, Arent, Robert, and Martin Kits van Heyningen launched the world's first digital compass for use in racing sailboats. They called it Sailcomp, and the company Sailcomp Industries was born. As other products and applications were added, the company changed the name to KVH Industries, a name they felt would cover any future development. Throughout the 1990s, KVH developed dozens of innovative products, expanding beyond marine compass technology to mobile satellite television systems and land-based systems utilizing sensor technology for commercial and military applications. KVH's mission is to connect in-motion global customers with the same digital services they rely on in their homes and offices, and to contribute to the potential of unmanned systems for improving human lives. Innovative ideas, engineering challenges, and a passion to exceed customer expectations propel the company forward - today, as in the past.

	Recent KVH Highlights













	•

	•






	Ramping sales and design wins from customers in the self-driving vehicle market and other autonomous platforms, including drones.
















	•






	Major global maritime fleets choosing our new usage-based airtime plans to take advantage of the fastest speeds on our mini-VSAT Broadband

	 network.
















	•






	Generated cash from operations of $10 million during the third quarter and $19 million for the nine-month period.
















	•






	Content and training showing steady growth on a constant currency basis.







	For the third quarter of 2016, our revenues were $45.8 million up 3% from a year ago; our net income was $2.9 million or $0.18 per share, while non-GAAP net income was $4.3 million, or $0.27 per share. During the same period last year, we reported revenues of $44.5 million and a net loss of $0.5 million, or $0.03 per share, and a non-GAAP net income of $1.8 million, or $0.12 per share.




	Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA was $6.7 million for the third quarter of 2016 compared to $4.2 million in the prior year quarter.




	“Overall we are pleased with our results for the third quarter, with revenue coming in at the high end of our guidance range, and net income and EPS exceeding our guidance. Our TACNAV



	®



	 products provided KVH with a strong revenue stream during the quarter and helped to offset the negative impact on revenues of our UK operations, which were adversely affected by the weakness of the British Pound,” said Martin Kits van Heyningen, KVH’s Chief Executive Officer. “Given that we don’t have the anticipated TACNAV orders for Q4 in backlog yet, we are removing them from our Q4 guidance. We still expect these to be awarded and we continue to do work so that we can deliver promptly when we receive the orders.”

	Third Quarter Financial Summary




	Revenue was $45.8 million for the third quarter of 2016, an increase of 3% compared to $44.5 million in the third quarter of 2015, notwithstanding weakness in the British Pound that negatively impacted revenue in 2016 by $1.2 million or 3%. Third quarter product revenues of $19.0 million were 22% higher than the prior year quarter, primarily due to a 66% year-over-year increase in guidance & stabilization product revenues, partially offset by a decrease in sales of our mobile communication products of 2%. Service revenues for the third quarter of 2016 were $26.8 million, a decrease of 7% compared to the third quarter of 2015. Airtime service revenues, which include mini-VSAT Broadband



	sm



	 airtime revenues, were up slightly year-over-year. Our mini-VSAT airtime increased slightly and Inmarsat airtime decreased 17%. Our engineering service revenues declined 75% as a result of the completion of a substantial contract in the first quarter of 2016. In the third quarter of 2015, we provided a significant level of engineering services that pertained to nonstandard products, which were subsequently delivered in the fourth quarter of 2015 and throughout 2016. Content and training revenues, which include our entertainment, e-Learning, and safety content, decreased by 11% in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015, however on a constant currency basis, the revenues increased by 3%. British Pound weakness negatively impacted content and training revenues by $1.2 million, or 14%. Our operating expenses decreased $1.3 million year over year to $18.2 million. The key driver was the reduction of incentive compensation, resulting from the lowering of our financial outlook for the remainder of the year.




	Nine Months Ended September 30 Financial Summary




	For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, revenue was $132.2 million, an increase of 1%, compared to $130.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Weakness in the British Pound negatively impacted revenue in 2016 by $2.1 million, or 2%. Product revenues for the 2016 nine-month period of $54.5 million were 11% higher than the comparable period last year, which was driven primarily by a 38% increase in guidance & stabilization product revenues year-over-year, most notably TACNAV product revenues. Service revenues for the 2016 nine-month period of $77.7 million decreased 5% compared to the nine-month period last year. Airtime service revenues in the 2016 nine-month period decreased 1% year-over-year. Our mini-VSAT Broadband airtime revenue increased slightly but was offset by a decrease in Inmarsat airtime revenue of 28%. Engineering service revenue decreased 54% principally due to the previously described third quarter decrease. Content and training revenues decreased by 8%, however on a constant currency basis, the revenue increased by 2%. British Pound weakness negatively impacted content and training revenues by $2.1 million, or 9%.




	The company reported a GAAP net loss of $0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, or $0.05 per share. During the same period last year, the company recorded a GAAP net loss of $1.8 million, or $0.12 per share. The company recorded non-GAAP net income of $4.9 million, or $0.31 per share, for both the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA was $11.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $11.5 million in the same period last year.


























	Fourth Quarter 2016 Outlook




	We are revising our guidance down for 2016 to $174 million to $176 million. Previously the revenue range we predicted for the full year was $190 million to $210 million. We are estimating fourth quarter revenues to be in the range of $42 million to $44 million. Given that we do not have the anticipated TACNAV orders in backlog yet, we are removing them from our fourth quarter guidance. If these orders were to be received and shipped in the fourth quarter, they would add at least $15 million in revenue. Also, a portion of our revenues and costs are denominated in British Pound, and there have recently been significant fluctuations in currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar. Significant changes to currency exchange rates, particularly between the U.S. dollar and British Pound, may have a material impact on our earnings.













	•






	For the fourth quarter of 2016, GAAP net loss per diluted share is expected to be in the range of $(0.06) to $(0.01) and non-GAAP net income per diluted share is expected to be in the range of $0.05 to $0.10. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter is projected to be in the range of $2.4 million to $3.5 million.

	Non-GAAP Financial Measures




	Provided in this release is non-GAAP financial information, including non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted EPS, and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, as a supplement to the condensed financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing financial results to assess operational performance and (only in the case of non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA) liquidity. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. KVH believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. KVH believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow for greater transparency with respect to key financial metrics used in making operating decisions and because its investors and analysts use them to help assess the health of its business.




	Some limitations of non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income (loss), and non-GAAP diluted EPS, include the following:













	•






	Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA represents net income (loss) before interest income, interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, and acquisition-related compensation. In the periods presented, there were no charges for acquisition-related expenses (other than acquisition-related compensation) or adjustments resulting from the application of purchase accounting in connection with acquisitions and, accordingly, we have removed these adjustments from the non-GAAP calculation.
















	•






	Non-GAAP net income (loss) and basic and diluted EPS exclude amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation, certain discrete tax items, and acquisition-related compensation. In the periods presented, there were no charges for acquisition-related expenses (other than acquisition-related compensation) or adjustments resulting from the application of purchase accounting in connection with acquisitions and, accordingly, we have removed these adjustments from the non-GAAP calculation.












	Other companies, including companies in KVH’s industry, may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently or not at all, which will reduce their usefulness as a comparative measure.









	Because of these limitations, investors should consider these non-GAAP financial measures together with other financial performance measures, including net income (loss), diluted net income (loss) per share, and KVH’s other financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. See the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations below for further details.

	This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. For example, forward-looking statements include statements regarding our financial goals for future periods, our anticipated revenue, competitive positioning, profitability, and product orders. Actual results could differ materially from the forward-looking statements made in this press release. Factors that might cause these differences include, but are not limited to: delays in the receipt of anticipated orders for our products and services, including significant orders for TACNAV products, or the potential failure of such orders to occur at all; continued adverse impacts of currency fluctuations, particularly the British Pound; risks associated with the impact of Brexit on sales and operations in the U.K. and Europe and on the overall global economy; potential reduced sales to companies in or dependent upon the turbulent oil and gas industry; continued substantial fluctuations in military sales, including to foreign customers; the unpredictability of defense budget priorities as well as the order timing, purchasing schedules, and priorities for defense products, including possible order cancellations; the uncertain impact of potential budget cuts by government customers; the impact of extended economic weakness on the sale and use of marine vessels and recreational vehicles; the potential inability to increase or maintain our market share in the market for airtime services; the need to increase sales of the TracPhone V-IP series products and related services to maintain and improve airtime gross margins; the need for, or delays in, qualification of products to customer or regulatory standards; potential declines or changes in customer demand, due to economic, seasonal, and other factors, particularly with respect to the TracPhone V-IP series, including with respect to new pricing models; recent increases in airtime termination rates and lower unit sales in our mobile business; increased price and service competition in the mobile communications market; potential increased expenses associated with investments in new technology; exposure for potential intellectual property infringement; potential additional litigation expenses; fluctuations in interest rates; potential changes in tax and accounting requirements or assessments, including management’s assessment of the probability and effect of future events; stock price volatility; and export restrictions, delays in procuring export licenses, and other international risks.

	SUMMARY






	We design and
	manufacture systems and solutions using our proprietary satellite antenna
	and fiber optic technologies for two principal markets - mobile satellite
	communications and defense-related navigation and guidance.





	Our mobile satellite
	communications products connect people on the move to satellite
	television, telephone and high-speed Internet services. Using a
	combination of sensors, proprietary software algorithms and innovative
	designs, our proprietary stabilized antennas remain pointed at specific
	geo-stationary satellites and receive digital TV, voice, fax and
	high-speed Internet signals regardless of how a vehicle or vessel moves.
	Our antenna systems are automated and carry out satellite tracking and
	other operations with little or no operator intervention. Our mobile
	satellite communications products support marine and land applications and
	are sold through a network of third-party dealers and distributors.
	Principal markets for our mobile satellite communications products
	include:



	 Marine - for example, yachts, commercial fishing vessels and merchant
	ships


	 Land mobile - for example, recreational vehicles, motorcoaches and
	trucks


	 Automotive passenger entertainment - for example, SUVs and minivans




	In the
	defense-related navigation and guidance marketplace, we use our magnetic
	sensing, fiber optic gyro, navigation systems integration, and display
	technology to develop and manufacture products that address a variety of
	systems requirements, principally for military customers. Uses of our products in
	this market include:



	 Positioning, vehicle navigation, heading/pointing, and targeting


	 Direction finding/pointing


	 Motion sensing and control


	 Munitions guidance




	Our defense-related
	navigation and guidance products are sold through a network of third-party
	independent sales representatives, through government contractors and
	directly to governments and original equipment manufacturers.





	Our executive offices
	are located at 50 Enterprise Center, Middletown, Rhode Island, 02842, and
	our telephone number is (401) 847-3327.








	ABOUT
	THIS PROSPECTUS






	This prospectus is
	part of a registration statement that we filed with the SEC using a
	"shelf" registration process. Under this shelf registration process, we
	may sell up to 3,000,000 shares of common stock in one or more offerings
	on a delayed or continuous basis.





	This prospectus
	provides a general description of the common stock we may offer. Each time
	we offer common stock, we will provide a prospectus supplement that will
	contain specific information about the terms of the offering. The
	prospectus supplement may also supplement, update or change the
	information in this prospectus. In that event, the information in the
	prospectus supplement will supersede the information in this prospectus.





	This prospectus and
	the applicable prospectus supplement will include all material information
	regarding an offering. This prospectus may not be used to complete sales
	of common stock unless it is accompanied by a prospectus supplement.





	You should read this
	prospectus, the applicable prospectus supplement and the additional
	information described under the heading "Where You Can Find More
	Information" beginning on page 9.













	RISK
	FACTORS






	Investing in our
	common stock involves a high degree of risk. Please see the risk factors
	described under the heading "Forward Looking Statements - Trends, Risks
	And Uncertainties" in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter
	ended September 30, 2003, which is incorporated by reference in this
	prospectus.





	Before making an
	investment decision, you should carefully consider these risks as well as
	the other information we include or incorporate by reference in this
	prospectus. The risks and uncertainties we have described are not the only
	ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties of which we are unaware
	or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our
	business operations. If any of these risks materializes, the trading price
	of our common stock could fall and you might lose all or part of your
	investment.











	FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS






	Except for historical
	facts, the statements in this prospectus, the applicable prospectus
	supplement and the documents we incorporate by reference are
	forward looking statements. Forward looking statements are merely our
	current predictions of future events. These statements are inherently
	uncertain, and actual events could differ materially from our predictions.
	Important factors that could cause actual events to vary from our
	predictions include those discussed under the headings "Forward Looking
	Statements - Trends, Risks And Uncertainties," "Management's Discussion
	and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and
	"Business" in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and our
	subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q incorporated by reference in
	this prospectus. We assume no obligation to update our forward looking
	statements to reflect new information or developments. We urge readers to
	review carefully the risk factors incorporated by reference in this
	prospectus and in the other documents that we file with the Securities and
	Exchange Commission. You can read these documents at www.sec.gov.











	USE
	OF PROCEEDS






	Unless we indicate
	otherwise in the applicable prospectus supplement, we currently intend to
	use our net proceeds from the sale of common stock for working capital and
	other general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions of
	businesses, assets and technologies that are complementary to our
	business. As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty the
	particular uses for the net proceeds we will receive from any issuances of common stock.
	Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion in the application of
	our net proceeds, if any. Pending these uses, we intend to invest our net proceeds in
	investment-grade, short-term, interest-bearing instruments.





	We may provide
	additional information on our use of proceeds in a prospectus supplement.













	DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK






	Our authorized
	capital stock consists of 20,000,000 shares of common stock and 1,000,000
	shares of preferred stock.








	Common
	Stock







	Voting

	.     Holders of our common stock
	are entitled to one vote per share held of record on all matters to be
	voted upon by our stockholders. Our common stock does not have cumulative
	voting rights. As a result, subject to the voting rights of any
	outstanding shares of our preferred stock, persons who hold a majority of
	the outstanding common stock entitled to vote on the election of directors
	can elect all of the directors who are eligible for election in a
	particular year.






	Dividends

	.
	Subject to preferences that may be applicable to the holders of any
	outstanding shares of our preferred stock, the holders of our common stock
	are entitled to receive such lawful dividends as may be declared by our
	board of directors.






	Liquidation and
	Dissolution

	.      In the event of our
	liquidation, dissolution or winding up, and subject to the rights of the
	holders of any outstanding shares of our preferred stock, the holders of
	shares of our common stock will be entitled to receive pro rata all of our
	remaining assets available for distribution to our stockholders.






	Other Rights and
	Restrictions

	.     Holders of our common stock do
	not have preemptive, subscription, redemption or conversion rights. All
	outstanding shares are fully paid and nonassessable.






	Listing

	.     Our common stock is listed
	on The Nasdaq National Market.








	Preferred Stock






	Our charter
	authorizes our board of directors, subject to any limitations prescribed
	by Delaware law, to:



	 issue preferred stock in one or more series;


	 establish from time to time the number of shares in each series; and


	 fix the preferences, voting powers, qualifications, and special or
	relative rights or privileges of the preferred stock.





	Our board of
	directors may issue preferred stock with voting, conversion, and other
	rights and preferences that could adversely affect the voting power or
	other rights of the holders of our common stock. Although we have no
	current plans to issue any preferred stock, the issuance of preferred
	stock or of rights to purchase preferred stock could have the effect of
	making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging
	a third party from attempting to acquire, a majority of our outstanding
	voting stock.








	Delaware Law and Certain Charter and By-Law Provisions






	Provisions of
	Delaware law, our charter and our by-laws could make it more difficult to
	acquire us by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest, open market
	purchases, removal of incumbent directors and otherwise. These provisions,
	which are summarized below, are expected to discourage types of coercive
	takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and to encourage persons
	seeking to acquire control of us to first negotiate with us. We believe
	that the benefits of increased protection of our potential ability to
	negotiate with the proponent of an unfriendly or unsolicited proposal to
	acquire or restructure us outweigh the disadvantages of discouraging
	takeover or acquisition proposals because negotiation of these proposals
	could result in an improvement of their terms.






	Authorized but
	Unissued Stock

	. We have shares of common stock and preferred stock
	available for future issuance, in some cases, without stockholder approval. We may issue
	these additional shares for a variety of corporate purposes, including
	public offerings to raise additional capital, corporate acquisitions,
	stock dividends on our capital stock or equity compensation plans.




	The existence of
	unissued and unreserved common stock and preferred stock may enable our
	board of directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current
	management or to issue preferred stock with terms that could render more
	difficult or discourage a third-party attempt to obtain control of us,
	thereby protecting the continuity of our management. In addition, if we
	issue preferred stock, the issuance could adversely affect the voting
	power of holders of common stock and the likelihood that such holders will
	receive dividend payments and payments upon liquidation.






	Business
	Combinations

	. As a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Section 203
	of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an anti-takeover law. In general,
	Section 203 prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging
	in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of
	three years after the date the person becomes an interested stockholder,
	unless the business combination or the transaction in which the person
	becomes an interested stockholder is approved in a prescribed manner.
	Generally, a business combination includes a merger, asset or stock sale,
	or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to an interested
	stockholder. An interested stockholder includes a person who, together
	with affiliates and associates, owns, or did own within three years before
	the person was determined to be an interested stockholder, 15% or more of
	a corporation's voting stock. The existence of this provision generally
	will have an anti-takeover effect for transactions not approved in advance
	by the board of directors, including discouraging attempts that might
	result in a premium over the market price of our common stock.






	Staggered Board;
	Removal of Directors

	. Our charter and by-laws provide:



	 for the division of the board of directors into three classes as
	nearly equal in size as possible with staggered three-year terms;


	 that directors may be removed only for cause by the affirmative vote
	of the holders of two-thirds of our shares of capital stock entitled to
	vote; and


	 any vacancy on the board of directors, however occurring, including a
	vacancy resulting from an enlargement of the board, may be filled only by
	the vote of a majority of the directors then in office.




	The limitations on
	the removal of directors and the filling of vacancies could have the
	effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of
	discouraging a third party from acquiring, control of us. Our charter and
	by-laws require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of our
	shares of capital stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote to
	amend or repeal any of these provisions.






	Stockholder
	Action; Special Meeting of Stockholders.

	Our charter and by-laws
	provide that:



	 any action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders at an
	annual meeting or special meeting of stockholders may only be taken if it
	is properly brought before the meeting;


	 stockholder action may not be taken by written action in lieu of a
	meeting; and


	 special meetings of the stockholders may only be called by our
	president or by our board of directors.




	The foregoing
	provisions could have the effect of delaying until the next stockholders'
	meeting stockholder actions that are favored by the holders of a majority
	of our outstanding voting securities. These provisions may also discourage
	another person or entity from making a tender offer for our common stock,
	because that person or entity, even if it acquired a majority of our
	outstanding voting securities, would be able to take action as a
	stockholder only at a duly called stockholders' meeting, and not by
	written consent. Our charter and by-laws require the affirmative vote of
	the holders of at least 75% of our shares of capital stock issued and
	outstanding and entitled to vote to amend or repeal the provisions
	relating to the calling of a special meeting of stockholders.






	Advance Notice
	Requirements for Stockholder Proposals and Director Nominations

	. Our
	by-laws provide that nominations for election to the board of directors
	may be made either by the board or by a stockholder who complies with
	specified advance notice provisions. Our by-laws contain similar advance
	notice provisions for stockholder proposals for action at a stockholders'
	meeting. These provisions prevent stockholders from making nominations for
	directors and proposals from the floor at any stockholders' meeting and
	require any stockholder making a nomination or proposal to give us advance
	notice of the names of the nominees or the stockholder proposal, together
	with specified information about the nominee or any stockholder proposal,
	before the meeting at which directors are to be elected or action is to be
	taken. Our secretary must generally receive the notice at least 60 days
	before the date of the meeting. The notice must contain, among other
	things, a description of the business the stockholder desires to bring
	before the meeting, its reasons for doing so, the name and address of the
	stockholder, any material interest the stockholder may have in the
	business and the stockholder's beneficial ownership of our securities.





	These provisions may
	have the effect of delaying stockholder action. Our charter and by-laws
	require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of our shares
	of capital stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote to amend or
	repeal these provisions.






	Limitation of
	Liability

	. Our charter limits the liability of our directors to the
	maximum extent permitted by Delaware law. Under our charter, no director
	will be personally liable for monetary damages for breach of his or her
	fiduciary duties as a director except for liability:



	 for any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to us or our


	 for acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional
	misconduct or a knowing violation of law;


	 for unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or
	redemptions as provided in Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation
	Law; or


	 for any transaction from which the director derives an improper
	personal benefit.






	Indemnification

	. Our charter contains provisions to
	indemnify our directors and officers to the maximum extent permitted by
	Delaware law. We believe that indemnification under our charter covers at
	least negligence on the part of an indemnified person. Our charter permits
	us to advance expenses incurred by an indemnified person in connection
	with the defense of any action or proceeding arising out of the person's
	status or service as our director, officer, employee or other agent upon
	an undertaking by the person to repay those advances if it is ultimately
	determined that the person is not entitled to indemnification. We believe
	that these provisions will assist us in attracting and retaining qualified
	individuals to serve as directors and officers.








	Transfer Agent






	The transfer agent
	and registrar for our common stock is EquiServe L.P.











	PLAN
	OF DISTRIBUTION






	We may offer shares
	of common stock:



	 to or through underwriters or duly registered dealers;


	 through agents;


	 directly to purchasers; or


	 through a combination of these methods.




	We may offer our
	common stock for sale in one or more transactions, including block
	transactions, at a fixed price or prices, which may be changed, at market
	prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to such market
	prices, or at prices determined on a negotiated or competitive bid basis.
	Each time we offer common stock, we will provide a prospectus supplement
	that will contain specific information about the terms of the offering,
	including the following:



	 the names of any underwriters, dealers or agents;


	 the material terms of the distribution, including the number of shares
	to be sold;


	 any over-allotment option under which underwriters may purchase
	additional shares of common stock;


	 any initial public offering price and the proceeds we will receive
	from the sale;


	 any underwriting discounts and commissions, as well as any other items
	constituting underwriters' compensation;


	 any discounts or concessions allowed or reallowed or paid to dealers;


	 any commissions paid to agents; and


	 the nature of any transaction by any underwriter, dealer or agent
	during the offering that is intended to stabilize or maintain the market
	price of our common stock.





	We may use
	underwriters, dealers or agents with whom we have a material relationship.
	We will describe the nature of any such relationship in the applicable
	prospectus supplement.








	Sale
	through Underwriters or Dealers






	We may sell shares of
	common stock through underwriters, either through underwriting syndicates
	represented by one or more managing underwriters or through underwriters
	without a syndicate. The underwriters will acquire the shares of common
	stock for their own account and may resell the shares from time to time in
	one or more transactions, including negotiated transactions. Unless
	otherwise described in the applicable prospectus supplement, the
	obligations of the underwriters to purchase common stock will be subject
	to conditions stated in the applicable underwriting agreement, and the
	underwriters will be obligated to purchase all the shares of common stock
	if any are purchased. Underwriters may be deemed to have received
	compensation from us in the form of underwriting discounts or commissions
	and may also receive commissions from purchasers for whom they may act as
	agent.





	Underwriters may sell
	the shares of common stock to or through dealers. These dealers may
	receive compensation in the form of discounts, commissions or concessions
	from the underwriters and/or commissions from the purchasers for whom they
	may act as agent. Any initial offering price and any discounts or
	concessions allowed or reallowed or paid to dealers may be changed from
	time to time.





	We may sell shares of
	common stock directly to dealers as principals. The dealers may then
	resell such common stock to the public at varying prices which they
	determine at the time of resale. We will describe in the applicable
	prospectus supplement the terms of any such transaction.





	Underwriters, dealers
	and agents that participate in the distribution of our common stock may be
	underwriters as defined in the Securities Act of 1933, and any discounts
	or commissions they receive from us, as well as any profit on their resale
	of our common stock, may be treated as underwriting compensation under the
	Securities Act.








	Sale
	through Agents






	We may sell shares of common stock through
	agents that we designate from time to time. We will identify in the
	applicable prospectus supplement the name
	of any agent involved in the offer or sale of the shares of common stock
	for which the prospectus supplement is delivered and will disclose any
	commissions we may pay to that agent. Unless otherwise indicated in the
	applicable prospectus supplement, any agent will be acting on a reasonable
	efforts basis for the period of its appointment.








	Direct
	Sales






	We may sell shares of
	common stock directly to one or more investors without using underwriters,
	dealers or agents. These investors may be underwriters as defined in the
	Securities Act of 1933 with respect to any sale of that common stock.








	Indemnification






	We may agree to
	indemnify underwriters, dealers and agents against civil liabilities
	arising out of this prospectus and any applicable prospectus supplement,
	including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, and to contribute
	to payments which the underwriters, dealers and agents may be required to
	make relating to those liabilities.








	Delayed
	Delivery Contracts






	We may authorize
	underwriters or agents to solicit offers by institutional investors to
	purchase shares of common stock under contracts providing for payment and
	delivery on a future date. We will describe in the applicable prospectus
	supplement the conditions to these contracts and the commissions we may
	pay for solicitation of these contracts. Unless otherwise indicated in the
	applicable prospectus supplement, any underwriters or agents soliciting
	these contracts will have no responsibility for the validity or
	performance of any such contract.








	Stabilization Activities






	In connection with an
	underwritten offering of our common stock, the underwriters may engage in
	transactions that stabilize, maintain, or otherwise affect the price of
	our common stock during and after the offering. These transactions may be
	effected on the Nasdaq National Market or otherwise. Specifically, the
	underwriters may over-allot or otherwise create a short position in our
	common stock for their own account by selling more shares than we have
	actually sold to them. A short position is "covered" if the short position
	is no greater than the number of shares of common stock available for
	purchase by the underwriters under the underwriters' over-allotment
	option, if any. The underwriters can close out a covered short sale by
	exercising any over-allotment option or purchasing shares in the open
	market. In determining the source of shares to close out a covered short
	sale, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the open market
	price of the shares compared to the price available under any
	over-allotment option. The underwriters may also sell shares in excess of
	any over-allotment option, creating a naked short position. The
	underwriters must close out any naked short position by purchasing shares
	in the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if
	the underwriters are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the
	price of the shares in the open market after pricing that could adversely
	affect investors who purchase in the offering.





	In addition, the
	underwriters may stabilize or maintain the price of our common stock by
	bidding for or purchasing shares in the open market and may impose penalty
	bids, under which selling concessions allowed to syndicate members or
	other broker-dealers participating in the offering are reclaimed if shares
	previously distributed in the offering are repurchased in connection with
	stabilization transactions or otherwise. The imposition of a penalty bid
	may also affect the price of our common stock to the extent that it
	discourages resales. The effect of the transactions described in this and
	the preceding paragraph may be to stabilize or maintain the market price
	of our common stock at a level above that which might otherwise prevail in
	the open market. We make no representation regarding the occurance, likelihood,
	magnitude or effect of these activities and, if commenced, these
	activities may be discontinued at any time.








	Passive
	Market Making






	Any underwriters who
	are qualified market makers on the Nasdaq National Market may engage in
	passive market-making transactions in our common stock on the Nasdaq
	National Market in accordance with Rule 103 of Regulation M before the
	commencement of offers or sales of the common stock. Passive market makers
	must comply with applicable volume and price limitations and must be
	identified as passive market makers. In general, a passive market maker
	must display its bid at a price not in excess of the highest independent
	bid for such security; if all independent bids are lowered below the
	passive market maker's bid, however, the passive market maker's bid must
	then be lowered when certain purchase limits are exceeded.











	LEGAL
	MATTERS






	The validity of the
	shares of common stock offered by this prospectus will be passed upon for
	us by Foley Hoag LLP, Boston, Massachusetts.

	Item 15.
	Indemnification of directors and officers.





	Section 102(b)(7) of
	the Delaware General Corporation Law allows us to adopt a charter
	provision eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors to
	us or our stockholders for breach of fiduciary duty as directors, but the
	provision may not eliminate or limit the liability of directors for (a)
	any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to us or our stockholders,
	(b) any acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional
	misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (c) unlawful payments of
	dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions under Section 174
	of the Delaware General Corporation Law or (d) any transaction from which
	the director derived an improper personal benefit. Article Seventh of our
	charter provides that none of our directors shall be personally liable to
	us or our stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary
	duty as a director, subject to the limitations imposed by Section
	102(b)(7). Article Seventh also provides that no amendment to or repeal of
	Article Seventh shall apply to or have any effect on the liability or the
	alleged liability of any director with respect to any acts or omissions of
	such director occurring prior to such amendment or repeal. A principal
	effect of Article Seventh is to eliminate or limit the potential liability
	of our directors for monetary damages arising from breaches of their duty
	of care, unless the breach involves one of the four exceptions described
	in (a) through (d) above.





	Article Sixth of our
	charter and Section 10 of our bylaws provide that we will indemnify our
	directors and officers to the fullest extent we are permitted or required
	to do so by Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Section
	145 provides, among other things, that we may indemnify any person who was
	or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened,
	pending or completed action, suit or proceeding (other than an action by
	us or in our right) by reason of the fact that the person is or was one of
	our directors, officers, agents or employees or is or was serving at our
	request as a director, officer, agent, or employee of another corporation,
	partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses
	(including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in
	settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection
	with such action, suit or proceeding. The power to indemnify applies (a)
	if such person is successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any
	action, suit or proceeding, or (b) if such person acted in good faith and
	in a manner which the person reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed
	to, our best interest, and with respect to any criminal action or
	proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such conduct was unlawful.
	The power to indemnify also applies to actions brought by us or in our
	right but only to the extent of expenses (including attorneys' fees but
	excluding amounts paid in settlement) actually and reasonably incurred and
	not to any satisfaction of judgment or settlement of the claim itself, and
	with the further limitation that in such actions no indemnification shall
	be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter for which such person
	shall have been adjudged to be liable to us, unless and only to the extent
	that the court determines, in light of all the circumstances of the case,
	that indemnification for such expenses is proper. Our charter provides
	that no amendment, termination or repeal of Article Sixth will affect or
	diminish the rights of an indemnitee with respect to any action, suit or
	proceeding arising out of any actions, transactions or facts occurring
	prior to the amendment, termination or repeal.





	The effect of these
	provisions would be to permit indemnification by us for, among other
	liabilities, liabilities arising out of the Securities Act of 1933.





	Section 145 of the
	Delaware General Corporation Law also allows us to obtain insurance on
	behalf of our directors and officers against liabilities incurred by them
	while serving as a director or officer or while serving at our request as
	a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,
	partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, whether or not we
	would have the power to indemnify them against those liabilities. We have
	procured a directors' and officers' liability and company reimbursement
	liability insurance policy that (a) insures our directors and officers
	against losses (above a deductible amount) arising from certain claims
	made against them by reason of certain acts done or attempted by them and
	(b) insures us against losses (above a deductible amount) arising from any
	such claims, subject in each case to limitations stated in the policy.

	Item 17.
	Undertakings.






	    (a)       
	The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes:










	(1)




	 





	To file,
	during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a
	post-effective amendment to this registration statement:










	(i)




	        To include any
	prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933;










	(ii)




	        To reflect in the
	prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the
	registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment
	thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental
	change in the information set forth in the registration statement.
	Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of
	securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would
	not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or
	high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the
	form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if,
	in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than
	20 percent change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the
	"Calculation of Registration Fee" table in the effective registration
	statement;










	(iii)




	       
	To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution
	not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material
	change to such information in the registration statement;



	provided, however,

	that paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(1) (ii) do not
	apply if the information required to be included in a post-effective
	amendment by those paragraphs is contained in periodic reports filed with
	or furnished to the Commission by the registrant pursuant to Section 13 or
	Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that are incorporated
	by reference in the registration statement.














	(2)




	 





	That, for
	the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933,
	each post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration
	statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of
	such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide
	offering thereof.











	(3)




	 





	To remove
	from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the
	securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the
	offering.











	(b)




	 





	The
	undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that, for purposes of determining
	any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each filing of the
	registrant's annual report pursuant to Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of
	the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that is incorporated by reference in
	the registration statement shall be deemed to be a new registration
	statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of
	such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide
	offering thereof.











	(c)




	 





	Insofar as
	indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933
	may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the
	registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the
	registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and
	Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as
	expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a
	claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment
	by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or
	controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any
	action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or
	controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the
	registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been
	settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate
	jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against
	public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by
	the final adjudication of such issue.











	(d)




	 





	The
	undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that:











	(1)




	 





	For
	purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933,
	the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part of this
	registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form
	of prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(1) or (4) or
	497(h) under the Securities Act shall be deemed to be part of this
	registration statement as of the time it was declared effective.











	(2)




	 





	For the
	purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933,
	each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall be
	deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities
	offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be
	deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.















	SIGNATURES






	Pursuant to the
	requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, the registrant certifies that
	it has reasonable grounds to believe that it meets all of the requirements
	for filing on Form S-3 and has duly caused this registration statement to
	be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, in
	the city of Middletown, Rhode Island, on November 26, 2003.

FOLEY HOAG LLP

ATTORNEYS AT LAW



November 26, 2003


KVH Industries, Inc.

50 Enterprise Center

Middletown, RI  02842


Ladies and Gentlemen:


We have acted as counsel to KVH  Industries,  Inc., a Delaware  corporation
(the  "Company"),  in  connection  with the  filing  on the date  hereof  of the
Registration   Statement  on  Form  S-3   (including   any   pre-effective   and
post-effective  amendments  thereto,  the  "Registration  Statement")  with  the
Securities and Exchange  Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the  "Securities  Act").  The  Registration  Statement  relates to the proposed
public  offering by the Company of  3,000,000  shares (the  "Shares")  of common
stock,  par value $0.01 per share,  of the  Company  (the  "Common  Stock") on a
delayed or continuous basis under Rule 415 under the Securities Act.


We are familiar with the Company's  Certificate  of  Incorporation  and all
amendments  thereto and  restatements  thereof,  its By-Laws and all  amendments
thereto and  restatements  thereof,  the records of meetings and consents of its
Board of Directors and of its  stockholders  provided to us by the Company,  and
its stock records. In addition,  we have examined and relied on the originals or
copies  certified  or  otherwise  identified  to our  satisfaction  of all  such
corporate   records  of  the  Company  and  such  other  instruments  and  other
certificates of public officials,  officers and  representatives  of the Company
and such other persons,  and we have made such investigations of law, as we have
deemed appropriate as a basis for the opinions expressed below.


We have assumed that,  at the time of the  issuance,  offer and sale of the
Shares,  a sufficient  number of shares of Common Stock will be duly  authorized
and reserved or available for issuance.


We express no  opinion  as to the laws of any state or  jurisdiction  other
than the General  Corporation  Law of the State of Delaware and the federal laws
of the United States of America.


Based on the foregoing, it is our opinion that when (i) the issuance, offer
and sale of any of the Shares shall have been duly  authorized  by all necessary
corporate  action on the part of the Company,  (ii) the  Registration  Statement
shall have become effective, (iii) the Company shall have filed with the





KVH Industries, Inc.

November 26, 2003



Page 2


Securities and Exchange  Commission a Prospectus  Supplement  complying with all
applicable  laws with  respect to the terms of the  issuance,  offer and sale of
such Shares,  (iv) the terms of the  issuance,  offer and sale of such Shares do
not violate any  applicable  law, or result in a default  under or breach of any
agreement or instrument binding on the Company,  and comply with any requirement
imposed by any court or governmental body having  jurisdiction over the Company,

(v) such Shares shall have been issued,  offered and sold as contemplated by the
Registration  Statement  and such  Prospectus  Supplement,  and (vi) the Company
shall have received the  consideration  provided for in the  resolutions  of the
Board of Directors,  or a duly  authorized  committee  thereof,  authorizing the
issuance,  offer and sale of such Shares,  and such  consideration  shall not be
less than the par  value per share of the  Common  Stock,  such  Shares  will be
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.


This opinion is to be used only in connection with the issuance,  offer and
sale of Shares while the Registration Statement is in effect.


This opinion is based upon currently existing statutes,  rules, regulations
and  judicial  decisions,  and we disclaim any  obligation  to advise you of any
change  in  any  of  these  sources  of  law  or  subsequent  legal  or  factual
developments which might affect any matters or opinions set forth herein.


We consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the  Registration
Statement  and to the reference to us under the heading  "Legal  Matters" in the
prospectus forming part of the Registration  Statement.  In giving such consent,
we do not hereby admit that we are in the category of persons  whose  consent is
required under Section 7 of the  Securities Act or the rules and  regulations of
the Securities and Exchange Commission.


Very truly yours,



FOLEY HOAG LLP

KVH has the worst customer service ever.

I had a KVH sat phone installed on my boat.

It failed on day one.

I called KVH customer service daily for 10 days, as I was embarking on a 10,000 mile voyage.

They blamed each other (activation v tech support) and Inmarsat.

The KVH tech support guy was unfamiliar with the handset display ON THEIR OWN PRODUCT!!!

I spent around 10 hours on the phone and was told it was being "escalated" and to await their call.  Nobody ever followed up.  I was always sent to VM.

Finally, I called Inmarsat who told me I needed to reset my sat phone and ten minutes later it worked.

A paper clip reset and ten minutes later it worked.

Why was an Inmarsat help line guy able to diagnose this but KVH wasn't.

They sold me a top dollar product and provided bottom dollar support.

What a poorly supported product.

History

                    Established in 1982.
            

                In 1982, Arent, Robert, and Martin Kits van Heyningen launched the world's first digital compass for use in racing sailboats. They called it Sailcomp, and the company Sailcomp Industries was born. As other products and applications were added, the company changed the name to KVH Industries, a name they felt would cover any future development. Throughout the 1990s, KVH developed dozens of innovative products, expanding beyond marine compass technology to mobile satellite television systems and land-based systems utilizing sensor technology for commercial and military applications. KVH's mission is to connect in-motion global customers with the same digital services they rely on in their homes and offices, and to contribute to the potential of unmanned systems for improving human lives. Innovative ideas, engineering challenges, and a passion to exceed customer expectations propel the company forward - today, as in the past.

KVH has the worst customer service ever.

I had a KVH sat phone installed on my boat.

It failed on day one.

I called KVH customer service daily for 10 days, as I was embarking on a 10,000 mile voyage.

They blamed each other (activation v tech support) and Inmarsat.

The KVH tech support guy was unfamiliar with the handset display ON THEIR OWN PRODUCT!!!

I spent around 10 hours on the phone and was told it was being "escalated" and to await their call.  Nobody ever followed up.  I was always sent to VM.

Finally, I called Inmarsat who told me I needed to reset my sat phone and ten minutes later it worked.

A paper clip reset and ten minutes later it worked.

Why was an Inmarsat help line guy able to diagnose this but KVH wasn't.

They sold me a top dollar product and provided bottom dollar support.

What a poorly supported product.

KVH has the worst customer service ever.I had a KVH sat phone installed on my boat.It failed on day one.I called KVH customer service daily for 10 days, as I was embarking on a 10,000 mile voyage.They blamed each other (activation v tech support) and Inmarsat.The KVH tech support guy was unfamiliar with the handset display ON THEIR OWN PRODUCT!!!I spent around 10 hours on the phone and was told it was being "escalated" and to await their call.  Nobody ever followed up.  I was always sent to VM.Finally, I called Inmarsat who told me I needed to reset my sat phone and ten minutes later it worked.A paper clip reset and ten minutes later it worked.Why was an Inmarsat help line guy able to diagnose this but KVH wasn't.They sold me a top dollar product and provided bottom dollar support.What a poorly supported product.

History

                    Established in 1982.
            

                In 1982, Arent, Robert, and Martin Kits van Heyningen launched the world's first digital compass for use in racing sailboats. They called it Sailcomp, and the company Sailcomp Industries was born. As other products and applications were added, the company changed the name to KVH Industries, a name they felt would cover any future development. Throughout the 1990s, KVH developed dozens of innovative products, expanding beyond marine compass technology to mobile satellite television systems and land-based systems utilizing sensor technology for commercial and military applications. KVH's mission is to connect in-motion global customers with the same digital services they rely on in their homes and offices, and to contribute to the potential of unmanned systems for improving human lives. Innovative ideas, engineering challenges, and a passion to exceed customer expectations propel the company forward - today, as in the past.

KVH has the worst customer service ever.

I had a KVH sat phone installed on my boat.

It failed on day one.

I called KVH customer service daily for 10 days, as I was embarking on a 10,000 mile voyage.

They blamed each other (activation v tech support) and Inmarsat.

The KVH tech support guy was unfamiliar with the handset display ON THEIR OWN PRODUCT!!!

I spent around 10 hours on the phone and was told it was being "escalated" and to await their call.  Nobody ever followed up.  I was always sent to VM.

Finally, I called Inmarsat who told me I needed to reset my sat phone and ten minutes later it worked.

A paper clip reset and ten minutes later it worked.

Why was an Inmarsat help line guy able to diagnose this but KVH wasn't.

They sold me a top dollar product and provided bottom dollar support.

What a poorly supported product.

KVH has the worst customer service ever.

I had a KVH sat phone installed on my boat.

It failed on day one.

I called KVH customer service daily for 10 days, as I was embarking on a 10,000 mile voyage.

They blamed each other (activation v tech support) and Inmarsat.

The KVH tech support guy was unfamiliar with the handset display ON THEIR OWN PRODUCT!!!

I spent around 10 hours on the phone and was told it was being "escalated" and to await their call.  Nobody ever followed up.  I was always sent to VM.

Finally, I called Inmarsat who told me I needed to reset my sat phone and ten minutes later it worked.

A paper clip reset and ten minutes later it worked.

Why was an Inmarsat help line guy able to diagnose this but KVH wasn't.

They sold me a top dollar product and provided bottom dollar support.

What a poorly supported product.

From the business

History

                    Established in 1982.
            

                In 1982, Arent, Robert, and Martin Kits van Heyningen launched the world's first digital compass for use in racing sailboats. They called it Sailcomp, and the company Sailcomp Industries was born. As other products and applications were added, the company changed the name to KVH Industries, a name they felt would cover any future development. Throughout the 1990s, KVH developed dozens of innovative products, expanding beyond marine compass technology to mobile satellite television systems and land-based systems utilizing sensor technology for commercial and military applications. KVH's mission is to connect in-motion global customers with the same digital services they rely on in their homes and offices, and to contribute to the potential of unmanned systems for improving human lives. Innovative ideas, engineering challenges, and a passion to exceed customer expectations propel the company forward - today, as in the past.

KVH has the worst customer service ever.

I had a KVH sat phone installed on my boat.

It failed on day one.

I called KVH customer service daily for 10 days, as I was embarking on a 10,000 mile voyage.

They blamed each other (activation v tech support) and Inmarsat.

The KVH tech support guy was unfamiliar with the handset display ON THEIR OWN PRODUCT!!!

I spent around 10 hours on the phone and was told it was being "escalated" and to await their call.  Nobody ever followed up.  I was always sent to VM.

Finally, I called Inmarsat who told me I needed to reset my sat phone and ten minutes later it worked.

A paper clip reset and ten minutes later it worked.

Why was an Inmarsat help line guy able to diagnose this but KVH wasn't.

They sold me a top dollar product and provided bottom dollar support.

What a poorly supported product.

History

                    Established in 1982.
            

                In 1982, Arent, Robert, and Martin Kits van Heyningen launched the world's first digital compass for use in racing sailboats. They called it Sailcomp, and the company Sailcomp Industries was born. As other products and applications were added, the company changed the name to KVH Industries, a name they felt would cover any future development. Throughout the 1990s, KVH developed dozens of innovative products, expanding beyond marine compass technology to mobile satellite television systems and land-based systems utilizing sensor technology for commercial and military applications. KVH's mission is to connect in-motion global customers with the same digital services they rely on in their homes and offices, and to contribute to the potential of unmanned systems for improving human lives. Innovative ideas, engineering challenges, and a passion to exceed customer expectations propel the company forward - today, as in the past.

KVH has the worst customer service ever.

I had a KVH sat phone installed on my boat.

It failed on day one.

I called KVH customer service daily for 10 days, as I was embarking on a 10,000 mile voyage.

They blamed each other (activation v tech support) and Inmarsat.

The KVH tech support guy was unfamiliar with the handset display ON THEIR OWN PRODUCT!!!

I spent around 10 hours on the phone and was told it was being "escalated" and to await their call.  Nobody ever followed up.  I was always sent to VM.

Finally, I called Inmarsat who told me I needed to reset my sat phone and ten minutes later it worked.

A paper clip reset and ten minutes later it worked.

Why was an Inmarsat help line guy able to diagnose this but KVH wasn't.

They sold me a top dollar product and provided bottom dollar support.

What a poorly supported product.

History

                    Established in 1982.
            

                In 1982, Arent, Robert, and Martin Kits van Heyningen launched the world's first digital compass for use in racing sailboats. They called it Sailcomp, and the company Sailcomp Industries was born. As other products and applications were added, the company changed the name to KVH Industries, a name they felt would cover any future development. Throughout the 1990s, KVH developed dozens of innovative products, expanding beyond marine compass technology to mobile satellite television systems and land-based systems utilizing sensor technology for commercial and military applications. KVH's mission is to connect in-motion global customers with the same digital services they rely on in their homes and offices, and to contribute to the potential of unmanned systems for improving human lives. Innovative ideas, engineering challenges, and a passion to exceed customer expectations propel the company forward - today, as in the past.

KVH has the worst customer service ever.

I had a KVH sat phone installed on my boat.

It failed on day one.

I called KVH customer service daily for 10 days, as I was embarking on a 10,000 mile voyage.

They blamed each other (activation v tech support) and Inmarsat.

The KVH tech support guy was unfamiliar with the handset display ON THEIR OWN PRODUCT!!!

I spent around 10 hours on the phone and was told it was being "escalated" and to await their call.  Nobody ever followed up.  I was always sent to VM.

Finally, I called Inmarsat who told me I needed to reset my sat phone and ten minutes later it worked.

A paper clip reset and ten minutes later it worked.

Why was an Inmarsat help line guy able to diagnose this but KVH wasn't.

They sold me a top dollar product and provided bottom dollar support.

What a poorly supported product.

History

                    Established in 1982.
            

                In 1982, Arent, Robert, and Martin Kits van Heyningen launched the world's first digital compass for use in racing sailboats. They called it Sailcomp, and the company Sailcomp Industries was born. As other products and applications were added, the company changed the name to KVH Industries, a name they felt would cover any future development. Throughout the 1990s, KVH developed dozens of innovative products, expanding beyond marine compass technology to mobile satellite television systems and land-based systems utilizing sensor technology for commercial and military applications. KVH's mission is to connect in-motion global customers with the same digital services they rely on in their homes and offices, and to contribute to the potential of unmanned systems for improving human lives. Innovative ideas, engineering challenges, and a passion to exceed customer expectations propel the company forward - today, as in the past.
