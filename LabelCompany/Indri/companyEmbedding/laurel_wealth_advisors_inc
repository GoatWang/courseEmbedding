Investing — Laurel Wealth Advisors






















































sound economic principles anda healthy dose of humility






Our Investment PhilosophyInvesting should be simple, but it’s not easy. Unpredictable events move market prices, creating dramatic cycles of greed and fear. Investors who react to these moves are driven by emotions of euphoria and panic, instead of by analysis and insight.  Unlike most of our industry, who keeps searching for the next clever way to control market outcomes, we help our clients manage their emotions and reduce poor decision making. We provide them the economic intuition behind their portfolios, so they have confidence in where they are going. To help them get there, we keep them focused on a thoughtful and disciplined plan that increases their chances of success, regardless of how the markets are doing.We do not rely on crystal balls or blackboxes. Just sound economic principles, an academic approach to looking at data and drawing objective conclusions, and a healthy dose of humility about the extent of our knowledge.  To find out how to invest differently, we invite you to start a conversation with us! 




















Wealth Services — Laurel Wealth Advisors






















































Our Wealth Services ProcessEach client, business or institution has different needs. Some simple, others complex, and pressing. Our approach starts with a conversation in which we invite you to communicate your greatest need, share your biggest fears, paint your perfect outcome, and detail your past, present and future. From each client’s desired end in mind, we work backwards to the beginning steps of today. We evaluate needs, establish goals and measure our progress along the way.Sometimes it takes a battlefield mentality to achieve success because life can be unpredictable. We will navigate together with you through those ups and downs. When events occur beyond your control, we have the experience to deliver both leadership and direction. This is the art of communication, research, analysis and action.We help Individuals:Invest for long-term successWe protect and grow your wealth in a sustainable, transparent manner with globally diversified, tax and fee-efficient strategies.Plan for life’s milestonesWe help you achieve your financial goals with a diligent review of your assets and liabilities, and deliver to you an easy to follow plan of action.Preserve your legacyWe focus on your family and philanthropic goals, and help you maximize the impact of your giving with wealth transfer strategies that minimize your taxes. We help Businesses and Corporations:EMPOWER YOUR EMPLOYEESWe educate your employees on the benefits of retirement planning and help you establish 401k and other corporate retirement plans.Reward your stakeholdersWe assist owners of concentrated wealth (both public and private) diversify their risk by selling or hedging their positions in the capital markets.

A Simple Idea — Laurel Wealth Advisors






















































Our people are the foundation for buildinga better future for all






A Simple IdeaLWA was founded on a simple idea: A collaboration between clients and advisors to create a firm where advisors would never want to leave, and clients turn into our staunchest supporters.As long time investment advisors, senior managers and client advocates, we saw the disparity between what we had always envisioned as the perfect client experience and the reality of Wall Street practices. Through boom and bust, we witnessed increasing client mistrust with their financial institutions, and ethical, hard-working advisors leaving the industry out of frustration. We realized that we could build a firm where everybody feels valued, heard and respected. A firm that is guided by transparency, trust, intellect and hard work. We knew that there was a demand for a firm that put the client’s interest first, where employees felt loyalty from their employers, and in turn, were loyal.Our quest to provide a truly special experience relies on listening to our clients and advisors. Your voice is the gift that allows us to deliver the client and advisor experience that you deserve. Please accept our invitation to learn more about LWA and let us know your thoughts!Sincerely,Lee and Mark 

The Laurel Leaf: A symbol of awareness and creativity, renewal and hopeful expectation, triumph and success, prosperity and peace.
