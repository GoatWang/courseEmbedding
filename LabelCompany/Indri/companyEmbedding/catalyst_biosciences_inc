Catalyst Biosciences, Inc. Announces Achievement of Stable Normal Factor IX Blood Levels in a Preclinical Subcutaneous Dosing Model
Jun 26 17
Catalyst Biosciences, Inc. announced positive preclinical results of CB 2679d/ISU304, its next-generation coagulation Factor IX, in a well-validated preclinical model of hemophilia B. The results demonstrate the attractive pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of CB 2679d based on bioavailability, potency, time to maximal concentration, and half-life. The company’s Factor IX preclinical program, including the results being presented at the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) Meeting in July 2017, supported the initiation of an ongoing Phase 1/2 proof-of-concept clinical trial evaluating CB 2679d for subcutaneous prophylaxis. At the meeting, the company will also have a Factor VIIa Poster Presentation which supports the initiation of a Phase 2/3 clinical trial to evaluate subcutaneous dosing of marzeptacog alfa (activated); the Phase 2 portion of the trial is expected to commence by the end of 2017. Oral Factor IX Presentation: Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Daily Subcutaneously Administered CB 2679d/ISU304 In Hemophilia B Dogs (abstract #OC 10.3). Howard Levy, Timothy Nichols, Elizabeth Merricks, Robin Raymer, and Andrew Hetherington (Oral Communications Session: Future Biotherapeutics for Hemophilia A and B. July 10, 2017 at 10:00 am CEST). The authors tested daily subcutaneous (SQ) doses of CB 2679d/ISU304 in hemophilia B dogs for six days. Factor IX antigen and activity were measured at various time points. The results are summarized as follows: CB 2679d/ISU304 corrected severe hemophilia to normal in hemophilia B dogs, after six daily subcutaneous doses. Daily SQ dosing of CB 2679d after six doses had peak Factor IX activity levels of 60% and 53% at 126 hours. Trough activity levels 24 hours after six daily doses were 56% and 40% respectively. The progressive increase in Factor IX activity levels after daily SQ dosing of CB 2679d supported the initiation of the ongoing Phase 1/2 proof-of-concept subcutaneous dosing study in individuals with hemophilia B with the target of achieving normal Factor IX activity trough levels. There were no emergent clinical adverse events or lab abnormalities recorded. Factor VIIa Poster Presentation: Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Subcutaneously Administered Marzeptacog Alfa (Activated) in Hemophilia B Mice (abstract #PB 1119). Howard Levy, Nassim Usman, and Andrew Hetherington (July 11, 2017 from 12:00-13:15pm CEST). The authors tested subcutaneous doses of marzeptacog alfa (activated) in hemophilia B mice. Factor VIIa antigen and activity were measured at various time points. The results are summarized as follows: Daily subcutaneous dosing (0.5 mg/kg) had trough levels of marzeptacog alfa (activated) 29.9 to 76.9 (mean 43.4) ng/mL and increased two hours after administration to 267.4 to 362 (mean 323.9) ng/mL. Daily subcutaneous dosing (1 mg/kg) achieved trough levels of marzeptacog alfa (activated) 50 to 80.9 (mean 63.7) ng/mL and increased two hours after administration to 230.8 to729.5 (mean 471.9) ng/mL. Increased potency of marzeptacog alfa (activated), blood drug levels and reduction in activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) achieved, support the initiation of a Phase 2/3 subcutaneous dosing study in individuals with hemophilia A and B with inhibitors, with a target of achieving normal coagulation pharmacodynamics.


Catalyst Biosciences Announces Presentations on its Next-Generation Subcutaneous Hemophilia Product Candidates at 2017 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis Meeting
Jun 8 17
Catalyst Biosciences, Inc. announced that data from two of its product candidates will be presented at the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) Meeting being held in Berlin, Germany from July 8 to 13, 2017. Catalyst is focused on the prevention of bleeding in individuals with hemophilia through the development of clotting factors that may be injected subcutaneously, rather than intravenously, potentially achieving normal coagulation activity. Catalyst announced that CB 2679d/ISU304, its next-generation Factor IX variant, received a positive Orphan Drug Designation recommendation in the EU. Catalyst’s South Korean collaborator, ISU Abxis, plans to initiate a Phase 1/2 proof-of-concept study of CB 2679d in individuals with severe hemophilia B in June 2017 in South Korea.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

-- Factor IX oral presentation & Factor VIIa poster presentation -- -- Presentations to summarize the pharmacokinetics and activity of daily subcutaneous dosing in preclinical hemophilia models -- SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., June  08, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  Catalyst Biosciences, Inc. (Nasdaq:CBIO), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel medicines to address hematology indications, today announced that data from two of its product candidates will be presented at the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) Meeting being held in Berlin, Germany from July 8 to 13, 2017. Catalyst is focused on the prevention of bleeding in individuals with hemophilia through the development of clotting factors that may be injected subcutaneously, rather than intravenously, potentially achieving normal coagulation activity. Catalyst recently announced that CB 2679d/ISU304, its next-generation Factor IX variant, received a positive Orphan Drug Designation recommendation in the EU. Catalyst’s South Korean collaborator, ISU Abxis, plans to initiate a Phase 1/2 proof-of-concept study of CB 2679d in individuals with severe hemophilia B in June 2017 in South Korea. The presentations being made by Catalyst are as follows: Oral PresentationFactor IX: CB 2679d/ISU304 is a next-generation coagulation Factor IX variant that is IND-approved in South Korea.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Unless otherwise indicated, in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, (i) references to "Catalyst," "we," "us," "our" or the "Company" mean Catalyst Biosciences, Inc. and our subsidiaries. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q ("Report").  In addition to historical information, this Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("The Exchange Act"). Forward-looking statements are identified by words such as "believe," "will," "may," "estimate," "continue," "anticipate," "intend," "should," "plan," "expect," "predict," "could," "potentially" or the negative of these terms or similar expressions. You should read these statements carefully because they discuss future expectations, contain projections of future results of operations or financial condition, or state other "forward-looking" information. These statements relate to our future plans, objectives, expectations, intentions and financial performance and the assumptions that underlie these statements. For example, forward-looking statements include any statements regarding the strategies, prospects, plans, expectations or objectives of management for future operations, the progress, scope or duration of the development of product candidates or programs, clinical trial plans, timelines and potential results, the benefits that may be derived from product candidates or the commercial or market opportunity in any target indication, our ability to protect intellectual property rights, our anticipated operations, financial position, revenues, costs or expenses, statements regarding future economic conditions or performance, statements of belief and any statement of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed in this report in Part II, Item 1A - "Risk Factors," elsewhere in this Report and in Part I - Item 1A - "Risk Factors" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 ("Annual Report"). Forward-looking statements are based on our management's beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management. These statements, like all statements in this report, speak only as of their date, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements in light of future developments. We caution investors that our business and financial performance are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties.  Overview  We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel medicines to address serious medical conditions for individuals who need new or better treatment options. We used a scientific approach to engineer several protease-based therapeutic candidates. We are focusing our product development efforts in the field of hemostasis (the process that regulates bleeding) and have a mission to develop valuable therapies for individuals with hemophilia.  We are applying our substantial expertise in protease engineering and our proprietary product discovery platform to create, engineer and characterize protease drug candidates. Proteases regulate several complex biological cascades, or sequenced biochemical reactions, including the coagulation cascade (a mechanism of blood clotting) in hemophilia and non-hemophilia settings and the complement cascade that causes inflammation and tissue damage in certain diseases. Our protease expertise allowed us to improve the biochemical and pharmacological properties of currently marketed hemophilia protease drugs, specifically Factors VIIa, IX and Xa and to create completely novel proteases that cleave disease-causing proteins, specifically complement Factor 3 (C3), for the potential treatment of dry age-related macular degeneration (Dry AMD) and renal delayed graft function (DGF).  Our most advanced program is a highly potent next-generation coagulation Factor VIIa protease variant, marzeptacog alfa (activated) (formerly CB 813d), that has successfully completed an intravenous Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and coagulation activity in individuals with severe hemophilia A and B with and without an inhibitor. We expect to advance marzeptacog alfa (activated) into the Phase 2 portion of a Phase 2/3 subcutaneous prophylaxis efficacy trial in 2017.  Our next most advanced hemophilia program, a highly potent Factor IX protease variant, CB 2679d/ISU304, is IND approved in South Korea. We expect to initiate a Phase 1/2 subcutaneous dosing trial for CB 2679d/ISU304 in the second quarter of 2017.  The substantially enhanced potency of marzeptacog alfa (activated) and CB 2679d/ISU304 compared with existing treatment options may allow for effective subcutaneous prophylactic treatment of individuals with hemophilia A or B with an inhibitor or individuals with hemophilia B, respectively. Catalyst's engineered hemostasis proteases are designed to overcome current treatment limitations by allowing delivery via subcutaneous injection which we believe will facilitate effective prophylactic treatment, especially in children, and ultimately deliver substantially better outcomes for individuals with hemophilia.  Subcutaneous dosing results in progressive increases in the levels of our protease factors until they reach a stable blood level therapeutic target range (ideally mild hemophilia to normal). Conversely, dosing by intravenous infusions results in very high factor  levels in the blood initially, but the factor level then falls rapidly to a trough level at a range that is measured as moderate or severe hemophilia, triggering the next dose.  Stable factor levels could potentially yield a significant improvement in outcomes and have the added benefit of convenience over competing intravenous therapeutics, particularly when administered to children where venous access is challenging.  We also have several Factor Xa variants that have demonstrated efficacy in several preclinical models and have the potential to be used as a universal procoagulant. We have delayed initiating further work on our Factor Xa therapeutic program at this time to focus our efforts on the Factor VIIa and Factor IX clinical programs.  We continue to explore licensing opportunities for our anti-complement programs in DGF and Dry AMD so that we can focus our efforts and resources on advancing marzeptacog alfa (activated) and CB 2679d/ISU304 through Phase 2/3 and Phase 1/2 clinical trials, respectively.  We estimate the total market for our product candidates is $3.4 billion. Based on industry reports, annual worldwide sales in 2016 for Factor VIIa recombinant products for individuals with hemophilia A or B with an inhibitor were approximately $1.4 billion, and prothrombin complex concentrate products used to treat individuals with hemophilia A or B with an inhibitor were $0.8 billion. Worldwide sales in 2016 for Factor IX products for individuals with hemophilia B were approximately $1.2 billion.  On June 29, 2009 we entered into a Research and License agreement with Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Inc., subsequently acquired by Pfizer, whereby we and Pfizer collaborated on the development of novel human Factor VIIa products and we granted Pfizer the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize the licensed products on a worldwide basis. On April 2, 2015, Pfizer notified us that it was exercising its right to terminate the research and license agreement effective June 1, 2015. Accordingly, we revised the expected period of performance to end on June 1, 2015, and the deferred revenue balance was fully amortized as of that date. On December 8, 2016, we signed a definitive agreement related to the termination of the Pfizer Agreement. Pursuant to this termination agreement, Pfizer granted us an exclusive license to Pfizer's proprietary rights for manufacturing materials and processes that apply to Factor VIIa variants, CB 813a and marzeptacog alfa (activated). Pfizer also transferred to us the IND application and documentation related to the development, manufacturing and testing of the Factor VIIa products as well as the orphan drug designation.  Pursuant to this agreement, we agreed to make contingent cash payments to Pfizer in an aggregate amount equal to up to $17.5 million, payable upon the achievement of clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones. Following commercialization of any covered product, Pfizer would also receive a single-digit royalty on net product sales on a country-by-country basis for a predefined royalty term.  In September 2013, we signed a license and collaboration agreement with ISU Abxis pursuant to which we licensed our proprietary human Factor IX products to ISU Abxis for initial development in South Korea. Under the agreement, ISU Abxis is responsible for manufacturing, preclinical development activities and clinical development through a proof-of-concept Phase 1/2 study in individuals with hemophilia B. We have the sole rights and responsibility for worldwide development, manufacture, and commercialization of Factor IX products after Phase 1/2 development. ISU Abxis may exercise its right of first refusal to acquire commercialization rights in South Korea, in which case they would be entitled to profit sharing on worldwide sales. ISU Abxis paid us an up-front fee of $1.75 million and is obligated to pay to us contingent milestone-based payments on the occurrence of certain defined development events, of which one has been achieved as of March 31, 2017. Collaboration and license revenue related to the ISU Abxis agreement during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 was $0.3 million and $0.1 million, respectively, that reflect the amortization of the up-front fee over the estimated period of our performance obligations, which are estimated to conclude in February 2018 and $0.2 million recorded in March 2017 for a milestone earned by us. We had a deferred revenue balance of $0.3 million as of March 31, 2017 related to the ISU Abxis collaboration.  We have never been profitable and have incurred significant operating losses in each year since inception. Our net losses were $4.1 million and $3.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As of March 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of $152.1 million. Substantially all our operating losses resulted from expenses incurred in our research and development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations.  We expect to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for at least the next several years as we continue the preclinical, manufacturing and clinical development, and seek regulatory approval for our drug candidates and our expenses associated with operating as a public company. In addition, our operating losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year due to timing of preclinical, clinical development programs and regulatory approval.  Financial Operations Overview  Contract Revenue  Our contract revenue was generated by recognizing revenue from the amortization of up-front licensee fees for research and development services under our collaboration agreements with ISU Abxis. Payments made to us under these agreements are recognized over the period of performance for each arrangement. We may also be entitled to receive additional milestone payments and other contingent payments upon the occurrence of specific events. We have not generated any revenue from commercial product sales to date. ISU Abxis represents 100% of our total contract revenue for the three months ending March 31, 2017 and 2016.  Due to the nature of the milestone payments under the remaining collaboration agreement and the nonlinearity of the earnings process associated with certain payments and milestones, we expect that our revenue will fluctuate in future periods, as a result of the uncertainty of timing related to achievement of milestones.  Research and Development Expenses  Research and development expenses represent costs incurred to conduct research, such as the discovery and development of our product candidates. We recognize all research and development costs as they are incurred.  Research and development expenses consist primarily of the following:   employee-related expenses, which include salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation;   laboratory and vendor expenses, including payments to consultants, related to the execution of preclinical, non-clinical, and clinical studies;   the cost of acquiring and manufacturing preclinical and clinical materials and developing manufacturing processes;   performing toxicity studies; and   facilities and other allocated expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, depreciation and amortization expense and other supplies.  The following table summarizes our research and development expenses during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):   Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 Personnel costs $ 365 $ 928 Preclinical research 195 716 Clinical Manufacturing 1,353 270 Facility and overhead 148 372 Total research and development expenses $ 2,061 $ 2,286  The largest component of our total operating expenses has historically been our investment in research and development activities, including the clinical development of our product candidates. We are currently focusing substantially all our resources and development efforts on our clinical pipeline. Our internal resources, employees and infrastructure are not directly tied to individual product candidates or development programs. As such, we do not maintain information regarding these costs incurred for these research and development programs on a project-specific basis.  On September 3, 2016, our Board of Directors approved reducing our workforce by 10 employees, or approximately 50% of our workforce consistent with a revised strategic plan to reallocate our resources to our hemostasis programs, including our highly potent next-generation Factor VIIa variant marzeptacog alfa (activated), and our highly potent next-generation Factor IX CB 2679d/ISU304. This reduction in force was completed by the fourth quarter 2016 and we recorded restructuring charges of $1.0 million, for the year ended December 31, 2016. In connection with the restructuring, we received proceeds of $0.9 million for property and equipment from the sale of excess equipment and other assets, which are recorded in other income for the year ended December 31, 2016, there was no further expense recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2017.  Notwithstanding the reduction in force, we expect our aggregate research and development expenses will increase during the next few quarters as we continue the preclinical, manufacturing and clinical development of our product candidates in the United States, particularly the clinical development costs of marzeptacog alfa (activated) and CB 2679d/ISU304. Due to the termination of the  research and license agreement with Pfizer, we will incur all costs for the marzeptacog alfa (activated) program. However, the incurrence of such costs is dependent on whether we will pursue the program on our own or sign a new collaboration and license arrangement with another pharmaceutical or biotech company.  The process of conducting clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time consuming. We may never succeed in achieving marketing approval for our product candidates. The probability of success of each product candidate may be affected by numerous factors, including clinical data, competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability. As a result, we are unable to determine the duration of and costs to complete our research and development projects or when and to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates.  Successful development of current and future product candidates is highly uncertain. Completion dates and costs for our research programs can vary significantly for each current and future product candidate and are difficult to predict. Thus, we cannot estimate with any degree of certainty the costs we will incur in the development of our product candidates. We anticipate we will make determinations as to which programs and product candidates to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program and product candidate on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific success of early research programs, results of ongoing and future clinical trials, our ability to enter into collaborative agreements with respect to programs or potential product candidates, as well as ongoing assessments as to each current or future product candidate's commercial potential.  On May 20, 2016, we signed a development and manufacturing services agreement with CMC ICOS Biologics, Inc. ("CMC"), pursuant to which CMC will conduct manufacturing development and, upon successful development of the manufacturing process, manufacture marzeptacog alfa (activated) that we intend to use in its clinical trials. We will own all intellectual property developed in such manufacturing development activities that are specifically related to marzeptacog alfa (activated) and will have a royalty-free and perpetual license to use CMC's intellectual property to the extent reasonably necessary to make marzeptacog alfa (activated), including commercial manufacturing.  We have agreed to a total of $3.8 million in payments to CMC pursuant to the initial statement of work under the Agreement, subject to completion of applicable work stages. In the event that clinical manufacturing batches need to be cancelled or rescheduled, we would be obligated to pay for a portion of CMC's manufacturing fees less certain fees that CMC is able to mitigate. The initial term of the agreement is ten years or, if later, until all stages under outstanding statements of work have been completed. Either party may terminate the agreement in its entirety upon written notice of a material uncured breach or upon the other party's bankruptcy, and we may terminate the agreement upon prior notice for any reason. In addition, each party may terminate the agreement in the event that the manufacturing development activities cannot be completed for technical or scientific reasons. As of March 31, 2017, we have $2.1 million in payment obligations to CMC remaining under the agreement.  General and Administrative Expenses  General and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs, allocated expenses and other expenses for outside professional services, including legal, human resources, audit and accounting services. Personnel costs consist of salaries, bonus, benefits and stock-based compensation. We incur expenses associated with operating as a public company, including expenses related to compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC and NASDAQ Stock Market LLC ("NASDAQ"), additional insurance expenses, additional audit expenses, investor relations activities, Sarbanes-Oxley compliance expenses and other administrative expenses and professional services. We expect such expenses to continue.  Interest and Other Income, Net  Interest and other income consists primarily of the changes in fair value of the derivative liability. The derivative liability is associated with the redeemable convertible notes we issued immediately prior to the closing of the merger in August 2015. The accounting for the redeemable convertible notes, which are convertible into shares of our common stock, requires us to bifurcate the derivative liability and account for it as a derivative liability at its estimated fair value upon issuance. The derivative liability is remeasured to estimated fair value as of each balance sheet date. We will record adjustments to the fair value of the derivative liability at the end of each reporting period until the earlier of the conversion, redemption or maturity of the redeemable convertible notes. As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the fair value of the derivative liability was immaterial.  Results of Operations The following tables set forth our results of operations data for the periods presented (in thousands): Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 Change ($) Change (%) Contract revenue $ 271 $ 109 $ 162 149 % Operating expenses: Research and development 2,061 2,286 (225 ) (10 )% General and administrative 2,381 2,395 (14 ) (1 )% Total operating expenses 4,442 4,681 (239 ) (5 )% Loss from operations (4,171 ) (4,572 ) 401 (9 )% Interest and other income 33 980 (947 ) (97 )% Net loss $ (4,138 ) $ (3,592 ) $ (546 ) 15 %  Contract Revenue  Contract revenue was $0.3 million and $0.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, an increase of $0.2 million, or 149%. The increase was due to milestone revenue from ISU Abxis of $0.2 million and the recognition of revenue under our collaboration agreement with ISU Abxis.  Research and Development Expenses  Research and development expenses were $2.1 million and $2.3 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, a decrease of $0.2 million, or 10%. The decrease was due primarily to a decrease of $0.6 million in personnel-related costs in connection with the reduction in workforce and a decrease of $0.7 million in lab supply costs and costs related to preclinical third-party research and development service contracts, partially offset by an increase of $1.1 million related to manufacturing expenses for marzeptacog alfa (activated).  General and Administrative Expenses  General and administrative expenses were $2.4 million during both the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.  Interest and Other Income  Interest and other income was $0.03 million and $1.0 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, a decrease of $1.0 million, or 97%. The decrease was due primarily to a $1.0 million gain recognized in 2016, related to the change in fair value of the derivative liability in 2016.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. The standard provides guidance on how certain cash receipts and payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows, including beneficial interests in securitization. The standard is intended to reduce current diversity in practice. ASU 2016-15 will be effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2018, but early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. We are currently evaluating the potential impact that this standard may have on our consolidated financial statements.  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The new standard involves several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. We adopted ASU 2016-09 in the first quarter of 2017 and this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which replaces the existing guidance for leases. The new standard establishes a right-of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet  for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. ASU 2016-02 will be effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2019, but early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new lease standard on our consolidated financial statements.  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Topic 825-10), which updates certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 will be effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2018, and early adoption is not permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential impact that this standard may have on our consolidated financial statements.  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity expects to be entitled when products are transferred to customers. Subsequently, the FASB has issued the following standards related to ASU 2014-09: ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations; ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing; and ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients. We must adopt ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-12 with ASU 2014-09 (collectively, the "new revenue standards"), which will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2018, and early adoption is permitted beginning in the first quarter of 2017. The new revenue standards may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or prospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. We are currently evaluating the timing of our adoption and the impact of adopting the new revenue standards on our consolidated financial statements.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  As of March 31, 2017, we had $14.5 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. We have an accumulated deficit of $152.1 million as of . . .
