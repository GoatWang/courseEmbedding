By updating the company databases while simultaneously acting as one of the primary customer service associates for their high level contacts and meticulous clientele, the HRG principals and recruiters gained a greatly-improved focus on and access to the necessary information to improve and maximize overall company productivity. I still advise HRG in an ad hoc capacity when not working in my primary role as an account executive. I still advise HRG in an ad hoc capacity.The Henderson Recruiting Group is a Member of the San Diego Chamber of Commerce.Server (former Barback, Service Assistant & Service Assistant Coach)Ruth's Chris Steak HouseJuni 2010  –  März 2015 (4 Jahre 10 Monate)Großraum San Diego und UmgebungDEL MAR, (SAN DIEGO) CA: As a service assistant in a corporate training store, I began by studying and certifying in the various processes of the fine dining restaurant cycle to continue on in my food service and customer satisfaction training by fulfilling the duties dictated to me by the waiting and bartending staffs and management so to meet and exceed the ever-increasing standards set by the Ruth’s Chris Steak House chain, the same standards for which they are famous (Spring 2002-May 2003; returned in the same capacity in June 2010). As of September 2011, I trained and worked as the sole dedicated barback for the restaurant, and in February 2012, I was promoted to and worked as a server as well. I also created and managed all of the social media and networking accounts for the restaurant, including Facebook, Twitter, Yelp, Instagram, OpenTable, UrbanSpoon, Foursquare, Pinterest and YouTube.___________________________________________________MISHAWAKA (GRANGER), IN: Returning in the same position I had previously worked as, I was again hired as a service assistant for this franchised location in the third month of their having been open. As the only employee to have been previously employed at a Ruth’s Chris corporate store and the only non-management employee with prior fine dining experience, I was almost immediately promoted to the position of service assistant coach where I was charged to work with the other coaching staff and report directly to the management on the status of my training and certifying all service assistants in all company manuals required for Ruth’s Chris employment as well as helped the management vet applicants for open service assistant positions. (November 2007-October 2008)Ruth's Chris Steak House is ever expanding and is currently made up of 130+ restaurants worldwide and as of 2005 (what is now known as the Ruth’s Hospitality Group) is a publicly traded company. (NASDAQ: RUTH)Federal Sales Support (FedBid Desk) & Notary PublicBlue TechJuli 2012  –  Juni 2014 (2 Jahre)Großraum San Diego und UmgebungTransferring within the sales organization of the company, I assisted in the management of all federal agency accounts for those IT procurement opportunities released via the FedBid reverse-auction marketplace.FedBid is a dynamic reverse auction marketplace for government buyers & private sector sellers. Government procurement officials post purchasing needs to the FedBid site that includes the category & description of the product or service, any additional evaluation criteria or special qualifications & a deadline for bids. A study released by the Reverse Auction Research Center in December 2010 found that the services provided by FedBid have saved certain federal agencies up to 10% annually (in the previous four fiscal years) on more than $500 million in purchases resulting in lower acquisition costs, greater competition and a more streamlined buying process.In addition to FedBid, I also helped manage various federal government customers in their IT acquisition needs via other contracting vehicles: -CSC (Computer Sciences Corporation)-Department of Justice (FBI, Bureau of Prisions, DEA, ATF, & U.S. Marshalls) & U.S. Courts-Commodity Futures Trading Commission-Federal Housing Finance Agency-National Gallery of Art-National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency-National Science Foundation-Library of Congress-Broadcasting Board of Governors.-General Services Administration (eBuy)Blue Tech, Inc. as a registered seller competes to provide the product or service that best meets the buyers’ needs & bids against other sellers to offer the lowest price.Blue Tech, Inc. is a 8(m), WOSB, EDWOSB, HUBZone, & SDB certified company as designated by the US Small Business Administration's (SBA) Office of Government Contracting. The term of my commission as a Notary Public for the State of California ran from July 3, 2011 to July 2, 2015.A full list of the contracts on which Blue Tech, Inc. is a prime can be found at the following:http://www.bluetech.com/?q=contractsFederal Sales Support (USN/DISA/EPA/SPAWAR C-2 COTS) & Notary PublicBlue TechNovember 2011  –  Juli 2012 (9 Monate)Großraum San Diego und UmgebungBuilding upon my experience and capacity as the inside manager of and company liaison for 700+ IT manufacturer and distributor partners, I transitioned into the sales force and helped manage the following accounts: United States Navy (USN), Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as well as the SPAWAR Systems Center Atlantic Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) Command and Control (C2) Support Equipment (C2 Supply MAC) contract for the Department of the Navy's Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command.Vendor Relations Coordinator / NASA SEWP IV Bid Desk Assistant & Notary PublicBlue TechMai 2010  –  Oktober 2011 (1 Jahr 6 Monate)Großraum San Diego und UmgebungIn utilizing my previous extensive work experience within the federal government and my prior military officer training, I was tasked with the organizing, streamlining and expediting of the process by which the various account executives/sales teams receive the federal government's RFQ's (Requests for Quote's) on the NASA SEWP IV contract (on which Blue Tech, Inc. was a Group C (HUBZone and WOSB set-aside) prime).As of August 2010, I was promoted to be named Vendor Relations Coordinator in which I became the inside manager of the and primary point of contact for Blue Tech's 700+ IT manufacturer and distributor partners. In order to more fully consolidate the partnership paperwork for new and existing vendor and distribution partners of the company, I received my California Notary Public Commission (#1942943) on 3 July 2011. In this role I worked to exponentially increase the number of vendors and distribution partners Blue Tech, Inc. was certified to resell products and services through and as a result, my work assisted in the significant annual net sales for the company to where the company collectively achieved the milestone of reaching over $100 million in net sales. Furthermore the processes I helped develop and establish and the framework on which my efforts were built on has since resulted in significant annual net sales year over year. Blue Tech, Inc. was one of 38 prime contract holders on the NASA SEWP IV contract (Contract #: NNG07DA22B) prior to its being awarded to be a set-aside prime on the NASA SEWP V contract in 2015.Campaign StafferChocola for CongressMai 2006  –  November 2006 (7 Monate)South Bend und Umgebung, IndianaBuilding on and applying my previous Congressional internship experience, I transitioned into learning the strategies, policies, and procedures required with the practical, grassroots-style politics of a key (bellwether) national campaign by acting in a support role for all campaign events including assisting with management of databases (Voter Vault) and call spaces for phone banking, telephone campaigning and mass mailings efforts, helping to prepare tracking reports, polling data and press releases and responses, assisting with fundraising list development and distribution of master calendars of fundraising activities, and notifying the public of upcoming campaign events. In addition, I helped provide technical, logistical, and problem-solving support necessary for the Congressman and staff to run a strong and competitive midterm election campaign by providing guidance on platform-based message control in analyzing campaign exposure on paid and earned media content and by tracking the national and district political climates based on data from the Cook Partisan Voting Index (PVI). My efforts were also focused on increasing voter contact through public record research and working to help the campaign gain visibility in the district by researching issue briefs and legislative updates based on local concerns within the context of the larger national debate.Following his loss for reelection, former-Congressman Chris Chocola went on to be the president of the Club for Growth until the end of 2014, a fiscally conservative political organization that supports a low-tax and limited-government agenda.Senior District Office InternUnited States House of RepresentativesMai 2004  –  August 2005 (1 Jahr 4 Monate)Großraum San Diego und UmgebungI learned a great deal of the inner workings of an office of a federal-level politician (during an election season) while performing duties that included legislative research and constituent service and support as well as other administrative tasks such as answering phones, filing and copying sensitive and high-priority documents, scanning news wires and local and major news publications for pertinent articles, intervening on behalf of constituents to federal departments and agencies in the name of the Congressman, sending faxes, returning, recording and forwarding phone calls and emails, and inputting information in the House of Representatives server (Internet Quorum) among others. After returning to re-volunteer as an intern in the district office during the 2004 Christmas Break (following my interning there during the summer of that same year), I was named the senior district office intern and intern trainer. I returned again in this capacity to help run the district office that following summer (2005) where I continued to assist the Washington and district office staffs in the strict maintenance of confidentiality that had become required at the time. With these increased responsibilities and demands, I was also tasked with re-writing and updating the intern manual for future interns for the district office.As a result of my work, I was also selected as a Capitol Tour Guide for the 2005 Inauguration of President George W. Bush.Student Ambassador (Admissions Department)Holy Cross CollegeJuni 2003  –  Mai 2005 (2 Jahre)South Bend und Umgebung, IndianaI represented the college when meeting with prospective and accepted students and their families and by giving them tours of the growing Holy Cross campus. While acting in an official capacity as one of the several student spokespersons, I also discussed life at the college during phone banks and on preview days where campus visitors were able to experience the institution first hand. In being a recruiting officer for Notre Dame’s Air Force R.O.T.C. program from August 2003 to February 2006, I also focused much of my correspondence with those students considering Holy Cross who are also interested in joining the R.O.T.C. program headquartered at Notre Dame. While nowhere near fluent, I was given an award by the Director of Admissions for my attempts to use my limited learned Spanish to speak to those students living in bilingual households.EhrenamtFreiwilliger Studentischer MitarbeiterStudent VolunteerOriginal anzeigenÜbersetzung anzeigenWie finden Sie diese Übersetzung?Gut•FehlerhaftDanke für Ihre Hilfe!Special OlympicsSeptember 1999  –  Mai 2003 (3 Jahre 9 Monate)MenschenrechtThemen, die John T.
