What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

A quarter of S&P 500’s 2017 climb due to five stocks (yes, those five)
              
              Throughout 2017, there’s one acronym that investors have in particular been sinking their teeth into: FAANG.

Amazon earnings fall 77%, shares drop
              
              Amazon.com Inc.  reported much lower earnings than expected Thursday, and shares declined more than 2% in late trading. The e-commerce giant reported net income of $197 million, or 40 cents a share, on sales of $38 billion, a profit decline of 77% from the same quarter a year ago. Analysts on average expected Amazon to report earnings of $1.41 a share on sales of $37.2 billion. The company's spending cut into profit, as fulfillment costs -- the amount Amazon spends to fulfill customers' orders on its e-commerce platform -- rose about 33% from a year ago and spending on technology and content increased by about 43%. Amazon stock traded at all-time highs this week, making Amazon the fourth U.S. company with a market capitalization of $500 billion and briefly giving Chief Executive Jeff Bezos the title of richest man in the world, but shares declined about 2% in immediate after-hours action.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Jul 17 17
Can-Fite BioPharma Ltd. announced that it successfully concluded a Clinical Investigator Meeting with the principal investigators, researchers, and doctors participating as clinical investigators in the Company’s Phase II trial of its drug candidate Namodenoson in the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The Phase II multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, dose-finding study of the efficacy and safety of Namodenoson in the treatment of NAFLD/NASH will enroll approximately 60 patients with NAFLD, with or without NASH. Patients will be enrolled in three arms, including two different dosages of Namodenoson and a placebo, given via oral tablets twice daily. The study's primary endpoints will be percent change from baseline in liver triglyceride (fat) concentration measured by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMRS) and safety. The Phase II trial design is based on preclinical studies showing Namodenoson's efficacy in reducing liver fat in NASH models as compared to placebo, improving liver function, and regenerating liver cells. Can-Fite’s estimated cost of the Phase II trial is under $1 million. Namodenoson supplies are ready to be administered and the costs of supply have been paid.
