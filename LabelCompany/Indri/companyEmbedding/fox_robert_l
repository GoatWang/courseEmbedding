One side was worse; the other side went down further.  I was scared to death of getting any type of injections because of the risks or side effects. Well after several years of hearing "you look tired" "you look sick" "didn't you get any sleep?" etc. I finally decided to go for it; last Friday which was 3 days ago I went to the dermatologist that my friend recommended to me, Katz dermatologist. Dr. Katz do the consulting and discussed the treatment that I will undergo,  now I understand everyone is different but wow, I had no bruising and no swelling that I could see. He injected it deep onto the bone. He used half a syringe. Although I probably couldn't used more we both agreed to leave it as is for now and if I wanted in a couple weeks, He could add more. The hollows are nowhere near as pronounced as they were. I will definitely be doing this again, Very nice improvement. Dr. Katz was conservative and wants to give me an improvement in the area that I’m having a problem with, and instead of overfilling you and making more money in one shot. He did a good job!Katz Dermatologyharoldjames ratedI was on vacation last Nov 2012, prior I’d Lost 25 pounds, but for the first time not so happy with my Face. Im a 50 Years Old, Felt i had a few wrinkles, pale, No pores showing. But I started Moisturizing at 15, Never went to bed with makeup, I am a Half French and a half Italian. So I decide to treat this wrinkles with a facial Dr. Katz Dermatology, it was been recommended to me by my Friend. Dr. Katz Studied my skin thought it in good shape for my age and not getting regular facials. He thought I should have one every other month. He took off my makeup. Then massage a cold cream into my skin, placed a warm sage smelling towel on my face. Cleaned the cream off then applied a silver mask. There was a machine with rolling balls that massaged deeply felt terrific. He also applied creams to my neck and declotte and did a great job on my hands, then left gloves on that. After many steaming after each step and the incredible smelling towels, I was done; He cleaned up my eyebrows, and massaged a serum into my face. Then handed me the mirror, I thought I'd had a face lift, seriously. I then realized that the eye lift I'd been putting off had caused deep wrinkles across my forehead and nose. They were completely gone. I’m serious. Not a single wrinkle and this lasted till beginning of Jan. So happy-Katz Dermatologybobbygraham ratedI have been suffering to acne since i was in my teenage years before I sought treatment. I saw three different dermatologists and no one made my scarring gone. Myself esteemed was shot and i was all afraid to face a mirror. Then my friend recommended to me Dr. Katz, during my consultation i was blown away by his knowledge. We started the treatment right away and after 2 weeks we already seen the result. I can’t see the scarring. 3 doctors did nothing to improve the scarring and then Dr. Katz makes them basically disappear. I strongly recommend Dr. Katz to anyone with acne scarring. He offers a variety of treatment options and can gear different options to your type of scarring. He cares about his patients and is always adding a special touch, whether it is asking about my pooch to remembering things I told him in the past. I know with how I have been treated by him and his dedicated staff that anyone seeking any procedure will be very happy with the experience and the results. Thank you Dr. Katz for making me feel beautiful!Katz Dermatologyrosetteturner ratedI had a treatment, it’s a permanent injectable. I had it under the eye area and also along the jaw line. It's not my first time with Dr. Katz, but it is my first time with this particular Treatment. The reason that I came in was seven years ago I had a procedure and my results from another doctor had not been to my approval, I had some awful like rippling effects under the eye, and it just was not smooth. I've done treatments trying to correct it and I've never left the house without a makeup on because of how concerned I am with the look of those results in the past. I found Dr. Katz and we've been doing some Restylane injections around my temple area and brow bone area, trying to fill in some of the areas around that eye area that I was concerned with. He and I discussed injecting the treatment which is better. It's a more permanent solution to cover up that rippling effect. I've looked in the mirror and I'm ecstatic what my results are and I'm really happy with the resultsKatz Dermatologymatthewhabel ratedThis is a GREAT dermatology clinic ever!! I have been to dermatologists all over the state and I have suffered from adult cystic acne for years. I have been on antibiotics, Accutane. I have tried everything, nothing worked. I made an appointment with Dr. Katz and I found his office to be a refreshing and informative experience. He is very professional and specific. He listened to my medical history and all my concerns. I have a new found faith in modern doctors. Dr. Katz made me feel very comfortable and relaxed. They opened my mind and eyes to 'fixing' my skin problems. I feel hopeful that Dr. Katz really does want to help people that suffer with skin problems. He offered her treatments and alternatives to products I was currently using. This office does not pressure you make drastic changes to your life or wallet. The office is easy to locate. The office is nice, clean and welcoming. The staff is also nice and helpful! I will definitely recommend this clinic to all!Katz Dermatologysamanthalei ratedMy skin has been breaking out like crazy ever since finals last December.  I haven't broken out like this since I first came here but I'm assuming its stress and hormone related. The inflammation has been pretty constant since then so I set up an appt Asap. Had I just been consistent, I probably could have saved myself the new breakouts and scars. From my understanding and research, it does take about 3 months for acne to form so all these suckers have been creeping there way up to the surface and Face Reality tries their best to extract the hell out of them in conjunction with their homecare regimen. I really have to commend their customer service here at Katz Dermatology. Other than that, their products really do work so it’s important that you follow the regimen Dr. Katz will give you. I recommend ANYONE to come here. My skin is perfectly clear.Katz Dermatologyjeaniepres ratedI found out that Dr. Katz could help me about some complexion issues I was concerned about and he took the time, much more than I usually spend with any kind of doctor. To explain everything to me and recommended several products to help, including affordable, over-the-counter and available at drugstores and facial cleansers, moisturizers. He also gave me several samples and coupons for said items, which was very helpful. I felt very comfortable and he addressed all of my concerns and wanted to really educate me about how to take care of my skin.  He also gave me some general advice for my skin and hair. Information was made available to me about laser hair removal.  I look forward to seeing the results in a few weeks from my new regimen. Either way, I feel confident that this office would continue working with me to get the results I'm after.Katz Dermatologymarkav ratedI was terribly scared in an alarplasty gone wrong by my last procedure. My face was uneven, botched and scared so bad I had a hard time leaving my house. When I had an initial visit with Dr Katz we came up with a game plan that he also talked over with colleagues, I wasn't a typical case. We scheduled the procedure and the office helped me stay comfortable and at ease during the whole time. After the surgery I knew it was going to look good. Keep in mind I have had the doc prior to Dr. Katz do this on me 5 times, to keep trying to fix and re fix the damage, So I could tell right away it was aligned even and my suchers were placed evenly. 2 weeks after and I am so happy, I thought I was going to have to live with that horrible disfigurement for the rest of my life..Thank you Dr Katz, I am so happy, Dr. Katz saved my face.Katz Dermatologytonyschimdt ratedI am 58 years old and have lost volume in my face causing me to look older than I think I should. I went to Katz Dermatology for advice on what to do to achieve a more youthful appearance. I ended up having, among other things, Dr. Katz suggested to me Radiesse injections for my cheeks to replace the volume and I am thrilled with the look. he applied some topical numbing cream and it really didn't hurt much at all. Dr. Katz is an excellent in injecting me on my cheeks. he is very careful not to over inject me. I loved the instant results! I also had the Mixto Laser treatment all over my face and Juvederm in my lips. It sounds like a lot but the outcome is just a younger, fresher looking me. It did not alter my face in a way that would make people ask "what did you do?" I feel so much better about how I look.Katz Dermatologyfelixm ratedI have used Juvederm for both my lips and my nasolabial folds. I had my lips done initially about a year ago with Resylane and was really unhappy with the results. So I did more research and visited a Dr. Katz, who took all the time he needed to find out exactly what I wanted. He spent time taking pictures, looking at my face, talking it all out. This time, we decided together on a full syringe, distributed between my lips and my nasiolabial folds. The Dr. Katz used a numbing gel on my lips and laugh lines. He then had the nurse shoot cold air on the spots he was working on. I did not feel a thing at all-nothing. He also gave me pills to take home for 2 days. I LOVE, love the results. Dr. Katz left me with literally NO bruising, no pain, and such minimal swelling I felt totally normal going out the same night.Did You Know?Physicians and surgeons help to keep people - from infants to the elderly - as healthy as possible. These individuals provide diagnoses and treatments for a wide variety of ailments, and preventative care and early detection for more serious illnesses. Whether you love or hate going to the doctor, the fact is your physician is there to listen to your health concerns, take preventative measures against diseases and advise you on your options for staying in tip-top shape.In 2013, there were more than 1 million doctors of medicine in the U.S., over 854,000 of which were active. Additionally, in 2012, there were about 18,000 active general surgeons in the country. It's important to know which type of physician or surgeon you need, how to choose the best one, and account for other considerations in order to stay healthy.Different Types of PhysiciansPatients can choose from a wide variety of physicians depending on doctor specialty and what problems they are experiencing. Here are a few of the most common types of physicians that you may see in your lifetime:General Practitioner
Your GP is the doctor that you go to for regular checkups, vaccines and to identify health issues. GPs can treat many different illnesses and injuries, from the common cold to a broken arm. If your health requires a second opinion or expert care, the GP will refer you to a specialist who has the skills to focus in on the issue.Cardiologist
Heart attacks and heart disease are some of the most common afflictions seen across the country, making cardiologists important to your long-term health. These physicians specialize in studying and treating the heart and related diseases.Dentist
Other than a GP, the dentist is likely the most common physician you'll ever see. These professionals work with the human mouth, ensuring that your teeth and gum health are up to par. Patients typically go to the dentist twice a year.Dermatologist
Dermatologists are focused on skin-related issues and diseases, from skin cancers, to acute acne, eczema, psoriasis, and general cosmetic concerns like aging and scars. Most will also perform annual or semi-annual mole checks to screen for any signs of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer.ENT
If you have a number of sinus infections or have had your tonsils taken out, you've likely seen an ENT specialist. ENTs handle ailments related to the ear, nose and throat, often related to taking out tonsils and treating hearing issues.OB/GYN
For many women, their gynecologist and obstetrician are the same person. These professionals work with the female reproductive system to focus on reproductive health, fertility issues, prenatal care, options for new and expectant mothers, neonatal care and childbirth. OB/GYNs can also help in the early detection of breast or cervical cancer.Choosing a PhysicianThere are obviously a number of physicians that you can choose from, but how do you know if they're the best choice for you? Here are a few considerations to help you pick a physician:Look at Your Insurance
Before you get down to the details, you need to verify which doctors are covered by your insurance and whether they are in or out of your carrier's network. Rates may be cheaper if the doc is in network – a doctor can be covered by your insurance but not necessarily in network. Out of network is typically more expensive. Doctors often add and drop plans, so it's important to ensure that your options are compatible with your insurance plan. Doing your homework will help you avoid unexpected expenses. Check for Board Certification
Your physician should be certified through the American Board of Medical Specialties. Doctors must earn a medical degree from a qualified school, complete three to seven years of residency training, be licensed by a state medical board and pass one or more ABMS exams to be certified.Examine the Reviews
Reviews of a doctor can reveal a lot about what your experience may be like. People may grade on staff friendliness, availability and effectiveness of treatment. Looking at these evaluations and getting recommendations from family and friends can direct you toward a physician for your needs.Choosing a SurgeonSurgeons can literally hold your life in their hands, and it's important to find the best one that can put you at ease and treat you effectivelyCompatibility Factor
You need to feel comfortable with your surgeon. It's important to communicate your concerns and that your surgeon can respond adequately. Surgeons should be willing to go over the details of your procedure and answer any questions that you may have. They must take the time to discuss and address your worries.Expertise Level
If you're going in for surgery, you want someone that knows what they're doing and has a high success rate. Ask how often the surgeon performs this surgery and try to find one that regularly does it. This will give you peace of mind that you're in capable hands.Understanding Your InsuranceYour decision on a physician or surgeon can be majorly affected by the insurance plan you have. You may have insurance through employment, your spouse, your parents if you're under 26, or the marketplace if the previous options don't apply to you. It's important to understand how your insurance works to have the full picture of what you'll need to pay for.Your insurance will have a deductible, which is the amount that you're responsible to pay for covered medical expenses. Some plans have coinsurances, where you must pay a certain percentage of the bill, and insurance will cover the rest. Co-pays state a flat rate for certain services, like paying $20 when you visit your GP or a $100 co-pay for an emergency room visit. Once you reach your out-of-pocket maximum, which will differ if you're an individual or within a family plan, your insurance may pay for 100 percent of covered medical expenses for the rest of the plan year.If you plan to go to the doctor, need medication or have been recommended for surgery, call your insurance provider or go online to see what your plan covers. You can choose the best doctor for your needs, understand your options and prevent yourself from being blindsided by medical expenses.Setting Your AppointmentMost doctors require a phone call for an appointment, although some may provide online scheduling as well. Be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment, and to bring it with you to the actual appointment. They need the ID numbers to verify your coverage, and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you don't have to show it again unless your insurance changes.When you call, let them know if you're a new patient, as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit. Tell them the reason for your visit, such as your symptoms if you're feeling sick. It's also important to inform them if you have Medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit, like current medications or medical records.From here, the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you. During your call, it's important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit. This information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect. Your appointment may progress faster as a result, and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for you.RisksDoctors see a number of patients in a day, sometimes in 15-minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand. This can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations, and they can end up missing certain problem indicators. While some problems, like a cold or flu, can be diagnosed in this time, more complex ailments require attention, which takes up time. Reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demand.Surgery has some more dire risks attached to it, so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure. If a patient has a reaction to anesthesia, it can cause very serious complications, but this is an uncommon occurrence. Blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery, often caused by inactivity during recovery. Infections, numbness, scarring, swelling and death are all possible, but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery you're undergoing. Talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potential.AftercareSurgery affects people in different ways, but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia, you'll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have. The nurse will tell you how the procedure went, what effect it will have on your condition, what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal. If you start feeling pain, the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse. When possible, it's also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs. This can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot. Some surgeries are outpatient procedures, where people are released the same day. For major surgeries, patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home. Discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bring.Recovery and Follow-upYour recovery time and follow-up expectations will vary depending on your procedure. For example, you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out, but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heart-valve surgery. Your surgeon will give you a list of things that you'll need to do during this time, including what medications to take and when you'll be able to get back to work and other activities.Every surgery will have a follow-up call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health. If you have a major operation, like heart surgery, it's important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal. Visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected. These appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early on.

Artist's Description

1939 Garwood runabout docked at its boathouse on the Torch River, just off Torch Lake in Northern Michigan.  National Geographic once rated Torch Lake the 3rd most beautiful lake in the world.  Standard power in these boats was a Chrysler inboard marine.  This one has the Garwood/Gray racing engine.  It was beautifully restored and has been in the same family since new.  The boathouse was custom built to house the boat.

lovely capture Robert !

Used 5 remote flashes to get the wood.  Thanx for checking it out!

Did you colorize this?











Bob Fox
about 9 years ago


No colorization.  Along with the supplemental lighting, I used a polarizing filter to dial in the nice reflections.











        RMonroe
      about 9 years ago


This is a great picture Robert.  I love it….:)











Bob Fox
about 9 years ago


Thanx!  I begged the owner to let me shoot it, and after I did, he took me for a ride!!











Alix Purcell
about 9 years ago


Bob- I love this! That’s really cool what you did with the polarizing filter :) – A











Bob Fox
about 9 years ago


Thanks Alix!  If you ever use a polarizing filter, it works best when the main source of light is 90° to the subject.











Danielle Loscig
about 9 years ago


I absolutely love this one Robert.  My favorite part about this photo is the composition.  What a great place to have been!











Bob Fox
about 9 years ago


As a child, my family owned a farm on the opposite end of Torch Lake.  From way up on the hill, on a clear day, we could see 18 miles all the way down to the south end where this river is.  In my sleep, in my dreams, I still live on that old farm…
This shot is also my first on to sell on RB!

Bob Fox
over 8 years ago


Was a colorful sunset. Much of the color came from a polarizing filter and 5 remote flashes.  When I asked to photograph the boat, the owner took me for a ride!

I have an address on my credit report that I've never lived at. Also amounts that I've owed are marked closed and I've been paying this debt off on time for 4yrs. Where can I get help resolving these issues?

If the company isn't reporting the account correctly, you can submit a dispute to the credit bureaus asking them to correct it.

If you were a grad victim you don't need to fill out a fraud package. Google it. And send it to the credit bureaus.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

I am on a fixed income. I have been working on my credit, so I know that I need a car and I need to start my own business. I am a leader and serious about my finances.

Get a small personal loan what you're asking for your payment to be about $170 to $180 a month

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.

Are there really companies you can pay that guarantee to raise your credit score in 2 months or less or they'll double your money back?
