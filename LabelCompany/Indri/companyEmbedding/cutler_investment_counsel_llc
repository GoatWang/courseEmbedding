LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Corporations Compared to LLCs









Knowledge Center&rtrif;Corporation&rtrif;Corporations Compared to LLCs 













        Corporations Compared to LLCs      
Limited liability companies (LLCs) are one of the newest types of business entities. Like corporations, they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships. Whether an LLC or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business. The best comparison here is between an LLC and an S corporation, because an LLC can choose to be taxed as an S corporation.
Social Security Taxes
The owners of the S corporation can take out some profits without Social Security taxes. For a large business in which the owners take out salaries of $118,500 or more plus profits, there would not be much difference, since the Social Security tax cuts out at that level as of 2015. However, for a smaller business, in which an owner could take out a $30,000 salary and $20,000 profit, the extra taxes on the $20,000 would be over $3,000.
Raising Money
If a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people, the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the LLC.
Liability Protection
An important advantage of an LLC is that in some states, a creditor cannot collect the members’ LLC distributions. With a corporation, creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets, but can collect the shareholder’s dividends.
Profits, Losses, and Taxes
The other advantages of LLCs are found in certain tax situations. For example, an LLC can make special allocations of profits and losses among members, whereas S corporations cannot. S corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership. In an LLC, money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis (and lower the taxes) of the owners, whereas in an S corporation, it does not. Contributing property to set up an LLC is not taxable, even for minority interest owners, whereas for a corporation, regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business.
Foreign Ownership
The owners of an LLC can be foreign persons, other corporations, or any kind of trust, whereas the owners of S corporations cannot. An LLC may have an unlimited number of members, while an S corporation is limited to one hundred.
Management Options
LLCs are also popular because of their flexible management options, allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations. LLCs have fewer formalities than corporations, another advantage for some business owners.
Fringe Benefits
Corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity. Various retirement, stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations. Plus, sole proprietors, partners and employees owning more than 2% of an S corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits (such as group-term life insurance, medical reimbursement plans, medical insurance premiums and parking). Shareholder-employees of a C corporation do not have to pay taxes on these benefits.

Equity Income
Ken Cutler developed Cutler’s Equity Income strategy in the 1960’s. Mr. Cutler was a firm believer that dividends were an important risk-management tool. He believed that dividends cannot be manipulated, and are an indicator of financial viability. Today, we remain stewards of Mr. Cutler’s investment philosophy, applying a strict dividend-based criteria for security selection.
Our Process
The portfolio consists of US-domiciled large capitalization securities. We look for companies with a 10-year dividend history with no reductions. The result is a value-oriented portfolio, applying an S&P 500 benchmark. While dividends are an important criteria as a part of our process, we do not search for the highest possible portfolio yield. Instead, we aim to achieve total return and downside protection.

	The strategies are actively managed.  Holdings and weightings are subject to change at any time without notice.

	Risks for the equity strategy include, but are not limited to liquidity risk (inability to trade a security in stressed market conditions), company‐ specific underperformance or event‐driven risks, and the risk that equities as an asset class have volatility and may decrease in value. The equity strategy also holds from time to time, small‐ capitalization and mid‐capitalization stocks, which have greater liquidity risk and more volatility in general than large‐capitalization stocks.
	 
	The above is not a list of all risks and Cutler does not provide any guarantee that our advisory services or methods of analysis will provide positive results or insulate clients from losses.  All investments involve risk, including possible loss of principal amount invested, which investors should be prepared to bear.  As outlined above, different types of investments involve varying degrees of risk, and there can be no assurance that any specific investment or strategy will be profitable or suitable for a particular investor's financial situation or risk tolerance. Asset allocation and portfolio diversification cannot assure or guarantee better performance and cannot eliminate the risk of investment losses.
	 
	Cutler Investment Counsel, LLC or one or more of its officers, may have a position in the securities discussed herein and may purchase or sell such securities from time to time.
	 
	For comparison purposes, the composite is measured against the S&P 500. The S&P 500 TR Index is a stock market index based on the common stock prices of the 500 top publicly traded American companies, as determined by S&P.  You cannot invest directly in an index.

Erich M. Patten


Chief Investment Officer
Portfolio Manager

Mr. Patten received his Bachelor of Science in Economics from the University of Pennsylvania.

He was awarded his Masters in Public Policy from the University of Chicago.

Cutler’s founding philosophy is a commitment I take to work with me every day. This commitment is our belief that our clients are best served through conservative income producing investments, with a priority on managing risk. Whether the client is a large-institutional plan or a 401(k) participant just getting started, I remain committed to our fiduciary approach and investment decisions based on solid fundamental analysis.

As Portfolio Manager of the Cutler Equity Fund, I take Cutler’s commitment to dividends personally. When my grandfather, Ken Cutler, mentored me in the business, I would spend hours scouring annual reports and balance sheets at his instruction. He believed that consistent dividends were real returns for investors, and something that cannot be manipulated by management. Dividends are something investors can take to the bank.

My commitment to dividends expanded with the launch of the Cutler's third mutual fund, the Cutler Emerging Markets Fund.

Outside of work, I believe that service is a responsibility of the business community, and I am a member of the Bellevue Rotary Club. I live in Bellevue, Washington with my wife and three children and sing tenor in the Queen Anne Lutheran Church Chancel Choir. I am a dedicated Seattle Mariners fan.

In 2003, I assumed the position of Co-Portfolio Manager of the firm’s investment strategies alongside my brother Matt. My focus is on qualitative and quantitative analysis for security selection. I am President of the firm, Chief Investment Officer, and serve as President of the Cutler Trust, providing oversight of the Cutler Equity Fund, Cutler Emerging Markets Fund, and the Cutler Income Fund.

Favorite Quote "We are what we repeatedly do.  Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit." - Aristotle









 

FINRA BrokerCheck Perform a background check on Ultimus Fund Distributors, LLC using FINRA’s BrokerCheck


Xavier J. Urpi


Director of Fixed Income

Mr. Urpi holds a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics and Computer Science from the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University. He also attended New York University’s Graduate School of Finance.

Before the ripe old age of 8 I had already escaped the political chaos of Cuba, where I was born, to Spain before finally immigrating to the United States. I was reunited with my parents in New York where I immediately began to perfect my New York accent and develop a lifelong love of the New York Yankees.  After attending college at New York University, I launched into a career that would take me throughout the US. 

I worked just over a decade at Lehman Management Company, jointly developing the Lehman indices; the investment industry’s standard for measuring performance of a portfolio against its objectives.  Following Lehman, I worked for six years at Smith Barney Capital Management as Director of U.S. Fixed Income before moving to Carmel, California where I established Cypress Asset Management. Eventually, the draw of the East Coast was greater than the sun kissed beaches of California and I moved my family to Charlottesville, Virginia.

Emerging Markets are in my blood...literally.  As an immigrant from Cuba I have been focused on developing markets from a very early age.  I am pleased to be on the investment team of the Cutler Emerging Markets Fund.  My fixed income experience helps the team as we look at the dividend payments in the various countries in which we are investing and managing the risk associated with currency differentials.

Today I serve as our Director of Fixed Income, co-Portfolio Manager of the Cutler Emerging Markets Fund, Portfolio Manager of the Cutler Fixed Income Fund, and I manage our institutional fixed income portfolios.

In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Corporations Compared to LLCs









Knowledge Center&rtrif;Corporation&rtrif;Corporations Compared to LLCs 













        Corporations Compared to LLCs      
Limited liability companies (LLCs) are one of the newest types of business entities. Like corporations, they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships. Whether an LLC or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business. The best comparison here is between an LLC and an S corporation, because an LLC can choose to be taxed as an S corporation.
Social Security Taxes
The owners of the S corporation can take out some profits without Social Security taxes. For a large business in which the owners take out salaries of $118,500 or more plus profits, there would not be much difference, since the Social Security tax cuts out at that level as of 2015. However, for a smaller business, in which an owner could take out a $30,000 salary and $20,000 profit, the extra taxes on the $20,000 would be over $3,000.
Raising Money
If a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people, the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the LLC.
Liability Protection
An important advantage of an LLC is that in some states, a creditor cannot collect the members’ LLC distributions. With a corporation, creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets, but can collect the shareholder’s dividends.
Profits, Losses, and Taxes
The other advantages of LLCs are found in certain tax situations. For example, an LLC can make special allocations of profits and losses among members, whereas S corporations cannot. S corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership. In an LLC, money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis (and lower the taxes) of the owners, whereas in an S corporation, it does not. Contributing property to set up an LLC is not taxable, even for minority interest owners, whereas for a corporation, regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business.
Foreign Ownership
The owners of an LLC can be foreign persons, other corporations, or any kind of trust, whereas the owners of S corporations cannot. An LLC may have an unlimited number of members, while an S corporation is limited to one hundred.
Management Options
LLCs are also popular because of their flexible management options, allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations. LLCs have fewer formalities than corporations, another advantage for some business owners.
Fringe Benefits
Corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity. Various retirement, stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations. Plus, sole proprietors, partners and employees owning more than 2% of an S corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits (such as group-term life insurance, medical reimbursement plans, medical insurance premiums and parking). Shareholder-employees of a C corporation do not have to pay taxes on these benefits.
