Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

51job Inc. Earnings: They're Still Hiring in China
The Chinese online recruiter delivers another quarter of double-digit revenue growth.











                Rick Munarriz
            

                (TMFBreakerRick)



            
            May 9, 2016 at 1:46PM
            
            






China's economy is showing signs of vulnerability, but companies are still hiring. 51job (NASDAQ:JOBS) -- a Shanghai-based provider of Internet-based recruitment services through China -- should know. It came through with another quarter of healthy growth, scoring double-digit percentage growth across its two main businesses.
51job checked in with first-quarter revenue of $81.2 million in its first quarter, 14% ahead of the prior year -- and just ahead of the guidance it issued in early March, calling for $78 million to $81 million on the top line.
It got there through a 13% uptick in its online recruitment services, a big deal since that accounts for 67% of its business. Other human resource-related revenue, accounting for the other third of 51job's business, managed to grow 18% since the prior year. 
There's no longer a need to break out its print publishing business. 51job ceased publication of 51job Weekly -- the weekly job listings that it would wedge into regional newspapers -- at the end of last year. It was once the driving force in 51job's business, but the Internet became too effective. 51job has spent the past couple of years winding down its print operations.
The news wasn't kind on the way down the income statement. Gross margin contracted, and income from operations only managed to grow by 3%. 51job's profit of $0.23 a share -- or $0.38 a share on a adjusted basis. That's at the midpoint of its earlier adjusted profit forecast. 





There are now 302,000 unique employers leaning on 51job to fill open positions, 5% more than a year earlier. Revenue is growing a lot faster than companies on its Rolodex, a good sign that it's succeeding on its goals of increasing customer spend and cross-selling other human resource services. Average revenue per online user has now posted year-over-year growth for four consecutive quarters. 
51job sees steadiness in the Chinese job market, but it remains to be seen what the country's decision to replace business tax for valued-added tax -- a move that went into effect earlier this month across all industries -- will have on the hiring scene. It will have a slight impact in revenue recognition on 51job's end.
51job's guidance for the current quarter calls for an adjusted profit between $0.36 a share and $0.39 a share -- just like the first quarter -- on $83.7 million to $86.8 million in revenue. That's not exciting on either front. Flat sequential earnings on an uptick in revenue implies that margins will continue to contract on a quarter-to-quarter basis. 51job's revenue growth will follow $80.2 million that it rang up in revenue a year earlier. Even at the high end it would nix 51job's string of quarters of double-digit year-over-year growth to four periods. Growth is slowing at 51job, but at least it's still growing.

SHANGHAI, Feb. 22, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- 51job, Inc. (Nasdaq:    JOBS) ("51job" or the "Company"), a leading provider of integrated human resource services in China, announced today its unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year of 2016 ended December 31, 2016.








Fourth Quarter 2016 Financial Highlights:

Online recruitment services revenues increased 15.0% over Q4 2015 to RMB423.8 million (US$61.0 million) 
Other human resource related revenues increased 11.8% over Q4 2015 to RMB270.4 million (US$38.9 million), which reflected the impact of a value-added tax ("VAT") policy change effective May 1, 2016 
Gross margin of 70.8% compared with 71.6% in Q4 2015 
Income from operations increased 12.2% over Q4 2015 to RMB209.7 million (US$30.2 million) 
Fully diluted earnings per share were RMB3.45 (US$0.50) 
Excluding share-based compensation expense, gain from foreign currency translation and change in fair value of convertible senior notes, as well as the related tax effect of these items, non-GAAP adjusted fully diluted earnings per share were RMB3.61 (US$0.52), exceeding the Company's guidance range

Fiscal Year 2016 Financial Highlights:

Total revenues increased 12.9% over 2015 to RMB2,372.7 million (US$341.7 million) 
Gross margin of 71.6% compared with 72.3% in 2015 
Income from operations increased 7.8% over 2015 to RMB611.8 million (US$88.1 million) 
Fully diluted earnings per share were RMB9.68 (US$1.39) 
Excluding share-based compensation expense, gain from foreign currency translation and change in fair value of convertible senior notes, as well as the related tax effect of these items, non-GAAP adjusted fully diluted earnings per share were RMB12.13 (US$1.75) 
Cash and short-term investments increased to RMB6,080.4 million (US$875.8 million) as of December 31, 2016

Commenting on the results, Rick Yan, President and Chief Executive Officer of 51job, said, "While we delivered solid financial results in 2016, the year was even more noteworthy in our minds for the progress we made on product development and the diversification of our engagement points with both employers and job seekers. Our online service offerings are more innovative and comprehensive than ever following a refresh of the flagship 51job.com portal, the enhancement of our search engine methodology, and the introduction of employee referral and candidate background check services. We believe our strengthened value proposition to users will not only elevate recruitment compatibility and effectiveness, but also provide additional fuel to drive online customer spending and sales productivity over time. In 2017, we will continue to maintain our long-standing discipline in balancing investments and returns, incubate and pilot new products and platforms, and further establish 51job as the most complete HR services provider in China."
Fourth Quarter 2016 Unaudited Financial Results
Total revenues for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2016 were RMB694.2 million (US$100.0 million), an increase of 13.6% from RMB610.8 million for the same quarter in 2015.
Online recruitment services revenues for the fourth quarter of 2016 were RMB423.8 million (US$61.0 million), representing a 15.0% increase from RMB368.6 million for the same quarter of the prior year. The growth was driven by an increase in the number of unique employers utilizing the Company's online services, which was partially offset by lower revenue per unique employer. The number of unique employers increased 17.3% to 337,104 in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared with 287,419 in the same quarter of the prior year due to strong customer acquisition. Although the pricing of like-for-like services was generally unchanged over the past year, average revenue per unique employer decreased 2.0% in the fourth quarter of 2016 as compared with the same quarter in 2015. This was primarily due to robust new customer growth which outpaced and offset the effect of greater spending by existing customers, as well as a higher level of average revenue per unique employer in the fourth quarter of the prior year that benefitted from the acquisition of Yingjiesheng.com in 2015.
Other human resource related revenues for the fourth quarter of 2016 increased 11.8% to RMB270.4 million (US$38.9 million) from RMB241.8 million in the same quarter of 2015. The increase was primarily due to greater usage and growth of seasonal campus recruitment, business process outsourcing and training services. However, this growth was partially offset by the impact from the implementation of a VAT policy change effective May 1, 2016 that resulted in a reduction in the amount of revenues recorded.
Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2016 increased 13.6% to RMB486.6 million (US$70.1 million) from RMB428.4 million for the same quarter of the prior year. Gross margin, which is gross profit as a percentage of net revenues, was 70.8% in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared with 71.6% in the same quarter in 2015.
Operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2016 increased 14.7% to RMB276.8 million (US$39.9 million) from RMB241.4 million for the same quarter of 2015. Sales and marketing expenses for the fourth quarter of 2016 increased 18.2% to RMB203.3 million (US$29.3 million) from RMB172.0 million for the same quarter of the prior year primarily due to higher employee compensation expenses and headcount additions. General and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2016 increased 6.0% to RMB73.6 million (US$10.6 million) from RMB69.4 million for the same quarter of the prior year primarily due to higher employee compensation and office expenses.
Income from operations for the fourth quarter of 2016 increased 12.2% to RMB209.7 million (US$30.2 million) from RMB187.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. Operating margin, which is income from operations as a percentage of net revenues, was 30.5% in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared with 31.3% in the same quarter of 2015. Excluding share-based compensation expense, operating margin would have been 33.5% in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared with 34.7% in the same quarter of 2015.
The Company recognized a gain from foreign currency translation of RMB1.6 million (US$0.2 million) in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared with a loss of RMB21.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 primarily due to the impact of the change in exchange rate between the Renminbi and the U.S. dollar on the Company's U.S. dollar cash deposits and U.S. dollar-denominated convertible senior notes issued in 2014.
In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company recognized a mark-to-market, non-cash gain of RMB4.1 million (US$0.6 million) associated with a change in fair value of convertible senior notes compared with a loss of RMB18.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.
The effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2016 decreased to 14.6% compared with 21.1% in the fourth quarter of 2015 as a result of non-tax deductible items, primarily the change in fair value of convertible senior notes, which comprised a smaller portion of the income before income tax base in the fourth quarter of 2016 than in the comparable year-ago period, as well as adjustments to income tax expense for the full year 2016 to reflect actual income tax due. The effective tax rate on non-GAAP results in the fourth quarter of 2016 was 13.7% compared with 15.8% in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Net income attributable to 51job for the fourth quarter of 2016 was RMB203.4 million (US$29.3 million) compared with RMB141.8 million for the same quarter in 2015. Fully diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2016 were RMB3.45 (US$0.50) compared with RMB2.45 for the same quarter in 2015.
In the fourth quarter of 2016, total share-based compensation expense was RMB20.1 million (US$2.9 million) compared with RMB20.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Excluding share-based compensation expense, gain/loss from foreign currency translation and change in fair value of convertible senior notes, as well as the related tax effect of these items, non-GAAP adjusted net income attributable to 51job for the fourth quarter of 2016 increased 7.9% to RMB217.9 million (US$31.4 million) compared with RMB201.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. Non-GAAP adjusted fully diluted earnings per share were RMB3.61 (US$0.52) in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared with RMB3.40 in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Fiscal Year 2016 Unaudited Financial Results
Total revenues in 2016 were RMB2,372.7 million (US$341.7 million), an increase of 12.9% from RMB2,101.9 million in 2015.
Online recruitment services revenues in 2016 were RMB1,547.1 million (US$222.8 million), representing a 14.1% increase from RMB1,356.4 million in 2015. Unique employers using the Company's online recruitment services grew 13.3% to 460,811 in 2016 from 406,880 in 2015. An employer who purchases online services multiple times or in multiple quarters throughout the fiscal year is counted as one unique employer for the annual total. Average revenue per unique employer increased 0.7% in 2016 compared with 2015.
Print advertising revenues in 2016 was nil. As of December 31, 2015, the Company ceased all print advertising services.
Other human resource related revenues in 2016 grew 11.5% to RMB825.6 million (US$118.9 million) from RMB740.1 million in 2015. The increase was partially offset by the VAT policy change that went into effect in May 2016.
Income from operations in 2016 increased 7.8% to RMB611.8 million (US$88.1 million) from RMB567.7 million in 2015.
Net income attributable to 51job in 2016 was RMB566.0 million (US$81.5 million) compared with RMB618.1 million in 2015. Fully diluted earnings per share in 2016 were RMB9.68 (US$1.39) compared with RMB10.41 in 2015.
Excluding share-based compensation expense, gain/loss from foreign currency translation and change in fair value of convertible senior notes, as well as the related tax effect of these items, non-GAAP adjusted net income attributable to 51job in 2016 increased 4.1% to RMB721.2 million (US$103.9 million) from RMB692.7 million in 2015. Non-GAAP adjusted fully diluted earnings per share were RMB12.13 (US$1.75) in 2016 compared with RMB11.64 in 2015.
As of December 31, 2016, cash and short-term investments totaled RMB6,080.4 million (US$875.8 million) compared with RMB4,950.9 million as of December 31, 2015. Short-term investments consist of certificates of deposit with original maturities from three months to one year.
Business Outlook
Based on current market conditions and factoring in the VAT policy change as well as seasonality related to the Chinese New Year holiday, the Company's total revenues target for the first quarter of 2017 is in the estimated range of RMB595 million to RMB615 million (US$85.7 million to US$88.6 million). Excluding share-based compensation expense, any gain or loss from foreign currency translation, and any mark-to-market gain or loss associated with a change in fair value of convertible senior notes, as well as the related tax effect of these items, the Company's non-GAAP fully diluted earnings target for the first quarter of 2017 is in the estimated range of RMB2.55 to RMB2.75 (US$0.37 to US$0.40) per share. The Company expects total share-based compensation expense in the first quarter of 2017 to be in the estimated range of RMB22 million to RMB23 million (US$3.2 million to US$3.3 million).
Recent Transactions
The Company has recently completed three transactions for a total consideration of RMB248.9 million (US$36.8 million), which were funded from the Company's existing cash resources. The Company continues to actively pursue several investment opportunities.
VAT Policy Change
Effective May 1, 2016, in accordance with regulations announced by the PRC Ministry of Finance and State Administration of Taxation, VAT replaced business tax in all industries in China. Because the business tax-to-VAT transition for the Company's online recruitment services revenues was completed in 2015, these regulations primarily affected the Company's other human resource related revenues. The Company ceased paying business tax on total revenues and instead started paying VAT on May 1, 2016. The Company's other human resource related revenues have been negatively affected due to this policy change, which impacts the direct comparability between future and previously reported total revenue and net revenue figures.
Currency Convenience Translation
For the convenience of readers, certain Renminbi amounts have been translated into U.S. dollars at the rate of RMB6.9430 to US$1.00, the noon buying rate on December 30, 2016 in New York for cable transfers of Renminbi as set forth in the H.10 weekly statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board.
Conference Call Information
The Company's management will hold a conference call at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time on February 22, 2017 (9:00 a.m. Beijing / Hong Kong time zone on February 23, 2017) to discuss its fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016 financial results, operating performance and business outlook.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), 51job uses non-GAAP financial measures of income before income tax expense, income tax expense, adjusted net income, adjusted net income attributable to 51job and adjusted earnings per share, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude share-based compensation expense, gain/loss from foreign currency translation and change in fair value of convertible senior notes, as well as the related tax effect of these items. The Company believes excluding share-based compensation expense and its related tax effect from its non-GAAP financial measures is useful for its management and investors to assess and analyze the Company's core operating results as such expense is not directly attributable to the underlying performance of the Company's business operations and do not impact its cash earnings. The Company believes excluding gain/loss from foreign currency translation and change in fair value of convertible senior notes, as well as the related tax effect, from its non-GAAP financial measures is useful for its management and investors as such translation or mark-to-market gain/loss is not indicative of the Company's core business operations and will not result in cash settlement nor impact the Company's cash earnings. 51job also believes these non-GAAP financial measures excluding share-based compensation expense, gain/loss from foreign currency translation and change in fair value of convertible senior notes, as well as the related tax effect of these items, are important in helping investors to understand the Company's current financial performance and future prospects and to compare business trends among different reporting periods on a consistent basis. The presentation of these additional measures should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results or as being comparable to results reported or forecasted by other companies. The non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to GAAP measures in the attached financial statements.

 Notes:

 statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board. 


 (2) Includes share-based compensation expense of RMB3,339 and RMB3,518 (US$507) for the three months ended  


 December 31, 2015 and 2016, respectively. 


 (3) Includes share-based compensation expense of RMB2,869 and RMB3,025 (US$436) for the three months ended

 of the convertible senior notes was excluded in the computation of diluted earnings per share for the three months 


 ended December 31, 2015 and 2016 because the effect would be anti-dilutive.

Fully diluted earnings per share were RMB1.84 (US$0.28) 
Excluding share-based compensation expense, loss from foreign currency translation and change in fair value of convertible senior notes, as well as the related tax effect of these items, non-GAAP adjusted fully diluted earnings per share were RMB2.89 (US$0.43), exceeding the Company's guidance range

Commenting on the results, Rick Yan, President and Chief Executive Officer of 51job, said, "Strategic initiatives we began last year to dedicate efforts and resources to increasing online customer engagement and spending continue to make solid progress. In addition to average revenue per unique employer realizing its sixth consecutive period of year-over-year improvement, we also saw a faster pace of customer count growth in the third quarter. The cross-selling of our other value-added HR services, especially our HR outsourcing services, maintained good momentum, although revenue recognition, and thus comparisons to prior periods, have been and will continue to be impacted by the VAT transition until mid-2017. Looking forward, we stay focused on strengthening our value proposition to both job seekers and employers with a wider range of services, and further cementing our market leadership in the HR industry in China."
Third Quarter 2016 Unaudited Financial Results
Total revenues for the third quarter ended September 30, 2016 were RMB595.0 million (US$89.2 million), an increase of 13.3% from RMB525.0 million for the same quarter in 2015.
Online recruitment services revenues for the third quarter of 2016 were RMB398.5 million (US$59.8 million), representing a 16.5% increase from RMB342.0 million for the same quarter of the prior year.  The growth was driven by an increase in the number of unique employers utilizing the Company's online services as well as the realization of higher revenue per unique employer. The number of unique employers increased 13.1% to 334,401 in the third quarter of 2016 compared with 295,683 in the same quarter of the prior year due to new customer additions. Although the pricing of like-for-like services was generally unchanged over the past year, average revenue per unique employer increased 3.0% in the third quarter of 2016 as compared with the same quarter in 2015 primarily due to improved up-selling efforts that resulted in the purchase of multiple and/or higher value online services by customers.
Print advertising revenues for the third quarter of 2016 was nil. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had ceased all print advertising services.
Other human resource related revenues for the third quarter of 2016 increased 8.2% to RMB196.6 million (US$29.5 million) from RMB181.6 million in the same quarter of 2015.  The increase was primarily due to greater usage of business process outsourcing services.  However, this growth was partially offset by the impact from the implementation of a VAT policy change effective May 1, 2016 that resulted in a reduction in the amount of revenues recorded.
Gross profit for the third quarter of 2016 increased 15.3% to RMB421.5 million (US$63.2 million) from RMB365.4 million for the same quarter of the prior year. Gross margin, which is gross profit as a percentage of net revenues, was 71.5% in the third quarter of 2016 compared with 71.2% in the same quarter in 2015.
Operating expenses for the third quarter of 2016 increased 19.1% to RMB274.6 million (US$41.2 million) from RMB230.6 million for the same quarter of 2015.  Sales and marketing expenses for the third quarter of 2016 increased 23.8% to RMB204.5 million (US$30.7 million) from RMB165.2 million for the same quarter of the prior year primarily due to higher employee compensation expenses, headcount additions and greater advertising expenses.  General and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2016 increased 7.3% to RMB70.1 million (US$10.5 million) from RMB65.4 million for the same quarter of the prior year primarily due to higher employee compensation and office expenses.
Income from operations for the third quarter of 2016 increased 8.9% to RMB146.8 million (US$22.0 million) from RMB134.9 million for the third quarter of 2015. Operating margin, which is income from operations as a percentage of net revenues, was 24.9% in the third quarter of 2016 compared with 26.3% in the same quarter of 2015. Excluding share-based compensation expense, operating margin was 28.5% in the third quarter of 2016 compared with 30.2% in the same quarter of 2015.
The Company recognized a loss from foreign currency translation of RMB0.02 million (US$0.003 million) in the third quarter of 2016 compared with RMB35.2 million in the third quarter of 2015 primarily due to the impact of the change in exchange rate between the Renminbi and the US dollar on the Company's US dollar cash deposits and US dollar-denominated convertible senior notes issued in 2014.
In the third quarter of 2016, the Company recognized a mark-to-market, non-cash loss of RMB42.5 million (US$6.4 million) associated with a change in the fair value of convertible senior notes compared with a gain of RMB54.5 million in the third quarter of 2015.
Other income in the third quarter of 2016 included local government financial subsidies of RMB23.0 million (US$3.4 million) compared with RMB16.0 million in the third quarter of 2015.
Net income attributable to 51job for the third quarter of 2016 was RMB108.0 million (US$16.2 million) compared with RMB165.9 million for the same quarter in 2015.  Fully diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2016 were RMB1.84 (US$0.28) compared with RMB2.62 for the same quarter in 2015.
In the third quarter of 2016, total share-based compensation expense was RMB21.4 million (US$3.2 million) compared with RMB20.1 million in the third quarter of 2015.
Excluding share-based compensation expense, loss from foreign currency translation and change in fair value of convertible senior notes, as well as the related tax effect of these items, non-GAAP adjusted net income attributable to 51job for the third quarter of 2016 was RMB171.9 million (US$25.8 million) compared with RMB166.8 million for the third quarter of 2015.  Non-GAAP adjusted fully diluted earnings per share were RMB2.89 (US$0.43) in the third quarter of 2016 compared with RMB2.82 in the third quarter of 2015.
Nine Months 2016 Unaudited Financial Results
Total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were RMB1,678.5 million (US$251.7 million), an increase of 12.6% from RMB1,491.1 million for the same period in 2015. Income from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased 5.6% to RMB402.1 million (US$60.3 million) from RMB380.7 million for the same period in 2015.
Net income attributable to 51job for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was RMB362.5 million (US$54.4 million) compared with RMB476.2 million for the same period in 2015. Fully diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was RMB6.22 (US$0.93) compared with RMB7.33 for the same period in 2015.
Excluding share-based compensation expense, loss from foreign currency translation and change in fair value of convertible senior notes, as well as the related tax effect of these items, non-GAAP adjusted net income attributable to 51job for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was RMB503.3 million (US$75.5 million) compared with RMB490.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Non-GAAP adjusted fully diluted earnings per share were RMB8.51 (US$1.28) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with RMB8.25 in the same period in 2015.
As of September 30, 2016, cash and short-term investments totaled RMB5,635.3 million (US$845.1 million) compared with RMB4,950.9 million as of December 31, 2015. Short-term investments consist of certificates of deposit with original maturities from three months to one year.
Business Outlook
Based on current market conditions and factoring in the VAT policy change, the Company's total revenues target for the fourth quarter of 2016 is in the estimated range of RMB680 million to RMB700 million (US$102.0 million to US$105.0 million). Excluding share-based compensation expense, any gain or loss from foreign currency translation and change in fair value of convertible senior notes, as well as the related tax effect of these items, the Company's non-GAAP fully diluted earnings target for the fourth quarter of 2016 is in the estimated range of RMB3.05 to RMB3.25 (US$0.46 to US$0.49) per share. The Company expects total share-based compensation expense in the fourth quarter of 2016 to be in the estimated range of RMB22 million to RMB23 million (US$3.3 million to US$3.4 million).
VAT Policy Change
Effective May 1, 2016, in accordance with recently announced regulations by the PRC Ministry of Finance and State Administration of Taxation, VAT replaced business tax in all industries in China. Because the business tax-to-VAT transition for the Company's online recruitment services revenues was completed in 2015, the recently announced regulations primarily affected the Company's other human resource related revenues. The Company ceased paying business tax on total revenues and instead started paying VAT on May 1, 2016. The Company expects its other human resource related revenues will be negatively affected due to this policy change, which will impact the direct comparability between future and previously reported total revenue and net revenue figures.
Currency Convenience Translation
For the convenience of readers, certain Renminbi amounts have been translated into U.S. dollars at the rate of RMB6.6685 to US$1.00, the noon buying rate on September 30, 2016 in New York for cable transfers of Renminbi as set forth in the H.10 weekly statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), 51job uses non-GAAP financial measures of income before income tax expense, income tax expense, adjusted net income, adjusted net income attributable to 51job and adjusted earnings per share, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude share-based compensation expense, loss from foreign currency translation and change in fair value of convertible senior notes, as well as the related tax effect of these items. The Company believes excluding share-based compensation expense and its related tax effect from its non-GAAP financial measures is useful for its management and investors to assess and analyze the Company's core operating results as such expense is not directly attributable to the underlying performance of the Company's business operations and do not impact its cash earnings. The Company believes excluding loss from foreign currency translation and change in fair value of convertible senior notes, as well as the related tax effect, from its non-GAAP financial measures is useful for its management and investors as such translation or mark-to-market loss is not indicative of the Company's core business operations and will not result in cash settlement nor impact the Company's cash earnings. 51job also believes these non-GAAP financial measures excluding share-based compensation expense, loss from foreign currency translation and change in fair value of convertible senior notes, as well as the related tax effect of these items, are important in helping investors to understand the Company's current financial performance and future prospects and to compare business trends among different reporting periods on a consistent basis. The presentation of these additional measures should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results or as being comparable to results reported or forecasted by other companies. The non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to GAAP measures in the attached financial statements.

 Notes: 







 (1) The conversion of Renminbi amounts into U.S. dollar amounts is based on the noon buying rate of RMB6.6685 


 to US$1.00 on September 30, 2016 in New York for cable transfers of Renminbi as set forth in the H.10 weekly 


 statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board. 


 (2) Diluted earnings per share is calculated in accordance with the "if converted" method. This includes the add-back 


 of interest expense of RMB8,815 and RMB9,353 (US$1,403) related to the convertible senior notes to the numerator 


 of non-GAAP adjusted net income attributable to 51job for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, 


 respectively. The maximum number of 4,035,672 potentially converted shares related to the convertible senior notes 


 was added to the denominator of diluted common shares for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016. 


 (3) Diluted earnings per share is calculated in accordance with the "if converted" method. This includes the add-back 


 of interest expense of RMB25,995 and RMB27,679 (US$4,151) related to the convertible senior notes to the numerator 


 of non-GAAP adjusted net income attributable to 51job for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, 


 respectively. The maximum number of 4,035,672 potentially converted shares related to the convertible senior notes
