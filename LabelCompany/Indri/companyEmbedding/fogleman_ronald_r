Biography[edit]
Air Force career[edit]
A 1963 graduate from the United States Air Force Academy, he holds a master's degree in military history and political science from Duke University. A command pilot and a parachutist, he amassed more than 6,800 flying hours in fighter, transport, tanker and rotary wing aircraft. He flew 315 combat missions and logged 806 hours of combat flying in fighter aircraft. 80 of his missions were as a "Misty FAC" in the F-100F Super Sabre at Phù Cát Air Base between 25 December 1968 and 23 April 1969.[1]
Fogleman was shot down in Vietnam in 1968, while piloting a F-100. He was rescued by clinging to an AH-1 Cobra helicopter that landed at the crash site.[2]
In early assignments he instructed student pilots, performed combat duty as a fighter pilot and high-speed forward air controller in Vietnam and Thailand, taught history at the Air Force Academy and conducted flight operations in Europe—including duty as an F-15 Eagle aircraft demonstration pilot for international airshows. He commanded an Air Force wing, an air division, a numbered air force, a major command and a unified command.
Fogleman was the first graduate of the United States Air Force Academy to advance to Chief of Staff of the Air Force. During his tenure, he introduced a simplified code of conduct for Airmen, which remains in use today. Called the "Air Force Core Values", the code demands "Integrity First, Service Before Self, and Excellence in All We Do."
General Fogleman retired on September 1, 1997.
Bosnian War Controversy in June 1995[edit]
During the Bosnian War NATO Forces were establishing a no-fly-zone. On 2 June two patrolling US F-16 aircraft of that operation came under attack by a Serbian SA-6 surface-to-air missile launch system. One plane was consequently hit and the pilot, Scott O'Grady ejected. Minutes after the landing, Serbian forces were closing in on his position, but he managed to escape and radioed for help on the 4th day, transmitting intermittent to lessen the chance of detection. These radio calls were picked up by US Forces.
General Ronald Fogleman, at the time Air Force Chief of Staff told press reporters during a promotion ceremony that "intermittent" transmissions were picked up. An "enraged" NATO official described this with "I was dumbfounded he said that" and "I mean, why not just announce to the bad guys, 'We think he's alive and kicking, and we hope we find him before you do'?" according to information published in the TIME magazine.[3]
However this 'leak' did not thwart a US Marine rescue operation involving several aircraft and helicopters that was launched later. Although the rescue forces came under small arms fire and missiles were fired by shoulder-held surface-to-air launchers on the way back, O'Grady was successfully extracted.[4]
Post-Air Force career[edit]
He currently has a seat on the Boards of Directors of Alliant Techsystems, AAR Corporation, Mesa Air Group, Inc., Tactical Air Support, Inc., World Air Holdings, Inc., and the Tauriga Sciences Inc.'s Business Advisory Board[1][5][6] He is also on the board of advisors of the Code of Support Foundation, a nonprofit military services organization.[7]
On November 11, 2009, General Fogleman was appointed Chairman of the Board of Directors at Alliant Techsystems Inc., following the retirement of ATK Chairman and CEO Dan Murphy.
As a Boeing consultant, Fogleman said that the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II will not be a combat proven aircraft until it receives the Block 3F software in the early 2020s.[8]

2013 – General Ronald R Fogleman, USAF (Ret) 
By A/TA Contributor on November 1, 2013  
General Ronald R Fogleman, USAF (Ret)
Ronald R. Fogleman was born in January 1942, in Lewistown, PA, and graduated from Juniata Joint High School, Mifflintown, PA, in 1959. Four years later he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree from the U.S. Air Force Academy and a commission as a second lieutenant. He completed pilot training in September 1964 at Vance Air Force Base, Okla., and stayed on for three more years as a flight training instructor and examiner. After a six-month stint in combat crew training in F-100s at Luke AFB, Ariz., he joined the 510th Tactical Fighter Squadron in June 1968 as a fighter pilot stationed at Bien Hoa Air Base, South Vietnam. On 12 September, Fogleman was shot down by multiple hits from small arms fire. He ejected over hostile territory and hid on the ground from the enemy that was as close as 20 yards. He was picked up by a Cobra helicopter and rode on the outside until reaching the safety of a Special Forces camp. The next day he went out again on one of the 240 combat missions he flew while stationed in Vietnam.
He returned stateside in 1969 to attend Duke University, where he earned a Master of Arts degree in military and political science in 1970. He taught at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colo., as an associate professor of history. He then was stationed in Thailand, where he served as an F-4 pilot, instructor pilot and commander of the Laredo forward air controller flight, completing an additional 75 combat missions. In August 1974, he was reassigned to the Air Reserve Personnel Center in Colorado as chief of rated assignments.
After completing Army War College in 1976, Fogleman, now a lieutenant colonel, was assigned to the 36th Tactical Fighter Wing at Bitburg Air Base, West Germany, as assistant deputy commander for operations. During that stint, his unit became the first operational F-15 aircraft wing stationed outside the continental United States. In February 1978, he took on the duties of deputy commander for operations for the 32nd Tactical Fighter Squadron at Camp New Amsterdam, Holland. While at those European posts, Fogleman maintained mission-ready status with an additional duty as the United States Air Forces in Europe F-15 aircraft demonstration pilot, performing at many international air shows.
His next assignments were staff and command positions at Hill AFB, Utah, Headquarters Tactical Air Command, Langley AFB, Va.; MacDill AFB, Fla.; and Davis-Monthan AFB, Ariz.
Fogleman was promoted to brigadier general in October 1985, and five months later he went to the Pentagon as deputy director of programs and evaluation. Two years later he became director of that same organization, as well as chairman of the Air Staff Board at the Pentagon. As a lieutenant general in July 1990, he held command positions at Osan AB, Korea. In August 1992, he became Commander in Chief of U.S. Transportation Command and commander of Air Mobility Command at Scott AFB, Ill., where he was promoted to four-star status. Finally, he returned to the Pentagon in October 1994 as chief of staff of the United States Air Force.
He retired from active duty on Sept. 1, 1997.
General Ronald R. Fogleman’s selfless devotion and advocacy of the profession of arms and the defense of the United States of America are without equal. He was the driving force behind developing the Air Force’s core values of integrity first, service before self, and excellence in all we do. He lived by these values and expected all Airmen to do the same. His advancement of air mobility enabled the development of today’s unrivaled United States’ (U.S.) mobility air forces. As the Commander in Chief, United States Transportation Command, he was responsible to the Secretary of Defense for the nation’s defense transportation requirements. He exercised peacetime and combat command over service components from the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Commander, Air Mobility Command (AMC), he provided operationally trained, equipped and mission-ready air mobility forces to support U.S. requirements and the warfighting commanders. He was instrumental in constructing AMC’s core capabilities of aerial refueling, airlift and aeromedical evacuation as well as many other innovative programs. General Fogleman’s visionary leadership established the framework necessary for U.S. Air Forces to provide a global, long-range plan to transform the U.S. Air Force into the premier air and space force of the 21st century.
Leadership, Job Performance, And Noteworthy Accomplishments
On September 12, 1968, during his initial operational assignment with the 510th Tactical Fighter Squadron at Bien Hoa Air Base, South Vietnam, General Fogleman was shot down by multiple hits while conducting operations. He ejected over hostile territory and evaded enemy capture for hours, hiding from enemy patrols that approached as close as 20 yards to his position. General Fogleman was picked up by a Cobra helicopter in the area of his crash site. Lacking internal seating to carry passengers, he rode on the outside of the helicopter until reaching the safety of a Special Forces camp many miles away. Unaffected by this ordeal, General Fogleman flew one of his 240 Vietnam combat missions the very next day. In total, General Fogleman flew 315 combat missions and acquired over 800 combat hours as an F-100 Forward Air Controller and F-4E pilot. His exceptional courage in the face of hostile forces was recognized with the award of the Silver Star and two Distinguished Flying Crosses. General Fogleman also received the Purple Heart for injuries he received while ejecting from his crippled aircraft.
He continued this type of outstanding performance throughout his career. He was responsible for many firsts and role model programs and operations. For example as th e Commander, United States Transportation Command, he developed the command’s Joint Transportation Reser ve Unit (JTRU), the first multi-service r eserve unit established within the DOD into a “role model” for other commands to achieve Total Force integration. General Fogleman pioneered the initiative of joint service reserve training within USTRANSCOM tha t ultimately qualified many JTRU reserve members for full participation in USTRANSCOM Command Center activities. This innovative approach set a new st andard of excellence and enabled reser ve personnel to work side by side with their active duty counterparts as required by the Goldwater-Nichols Act. General Fogleman also directed and shepherded the establishment of the Joint Intelligence Center Transportation (JICTRANS). This consolidated intelligence facility produced tightly focused, predictive intelligence to meet critical joint planning and execution community needs. His leadership enabled United States Transportation Command to increase responsiveness to warfighters during the crises in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Somalia and Rwanda.
General Fogleman also led DOD efforts to develop and establish joint and service intermodal container doctrine. Analyzing the Mobility Requirements Study (MRS) and MRS Bottom-Up Review, he directed the development of containers uniquely required for the DOD container fleet. General Fogleman is also credited with USTRANSCOM’s design and development of a versatile joint container adaptable for all services. Working with the chief executive officers of the maritime industry, he began the process of reengineering and reinvigorating the Sealift Rediness Program to ensure a more orderly transition from peacetime contingencies to wartime. In addition, General Fogleman laid the foundation for a new era of DOD-civilian cooperation by initiating a program to develop a military/civilian, joint-use, intermodal facility to enhance commercial operations and be available for force projection in contingencies. Combining r esources of the military and commercial industry benefitted the Defense Tansportation System (DTS), and it served as a model for joint-use activities into the twenty-first century. Through his direct involvement, General Fogleman solved one of the major force projection deficiencies identified in the MRS. He identified the requirement for a West Coast Containerized Ammunition Port to the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) as one of the critical elements for timely force projection. His hands-on involvement ensured its funding throughout the Program Objective Memorandum (POM) process. He fostered closer working relationships with the Maritime Administration, raising the readiness of Ready Reserve Force vessels to its highest level in history.
General Fogleman’s vision and understanding of the significance of ITV in movement of cargo and passengers resulted in his declaration of 1994 as the “Year of In-Transit Visibility.” His perception of the need for In-Transit Visibility (ITV) became the catalyst for development of a DOD plan that spelled out an operational concept based on customer ITV requirements. These concepts form the basis for the blueprint in the design of an automated ITV capability at the “ready” for use in peace or war.
He elevated to the warfighting CINCs’ attention the paramount importance of Joint Logistics Over-the-Shore (JLOTS) as a capability necessary in the absence of fixed or degraded port facilities. Until then, JLOTS operations planning and training were receiving marginal attention. As a result of General Fogleman’s involvement, warfighti ng CINCs could now identify their operational plan requirements for JLOTS, and a five-year JLOTS exercise plan was incorporated in the JCS Joint Training Master Schedule.
General Fogleman was in the forefront of identifying and resolving funding issues crucial to the DTS. He was given the responsibility for total financial control of all common user transportation assets. This meant he had to create a joint financial structure from three service-specific financial operations. He faced four immediate leadership and managerial challenges: integration of programming, budget formulation, budget organization development, and staffing the budget execution. He met these challenges brilliantly, and his efforts resulted in submission of the first-ever DBOF-T budget and Program Objective Memorandum. He institutionalized a logical, solid system of program analysis and financial management that became well respected throughout the defense transportation industry.
General Fogelman was also the first Commander of Air Mobility Command and Air Force Academy graduate to achieve the position of Chief of Staff of the Air Force. As CSAF, General Fogleman worked tirelessly to strengthen Joint relationships while asserting Airmen should be proud of their shared heritage. He fervently communicated the message of being part of a “team within a team.” Through his leadership he inspired, created and hosted the first world-wide conference of air chiefs, bringing together 87 air chiefs to discuss how air and space forces could create a more stable and peaceful world.
Focused on the future, he decided how the U.S. Air Force would engage emerging global threats. Moreover, General Fogleman expanded the definition of global presence to include not only air, land and sea forces, but space forces and information-based capabilities. In addition, he recognized the fundamental need for a reaffirmation of the Air Force to its core values. With the publication of The Little Blue Book, General Fogleman began a concerted campaign to reshape the organizational environment to be more responsive and accountable. The construct of the new environment was specifically designed to assist in traversing stressful and turbulent times characterized by significant force structure reductions and increased operations tempo following the end of the Cold War. His shrewd leadership still spans the spectrum of current Air Force and Air Mobility Command operations and is integral to many of the very successful programs the U.S. Air Force values today.
Significant Contributions To The Advancement Of Air Mobility
During his tenure as Commander, United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) and Commander Air Mobility Command, General Fogleman provided crucial direction, guidance, and support to over 150 Joint deployment operations and exercises including strategic and commercial lift for deployment, sustainment, and redeployment of forces.
Additionally, General Fogleman’s astute leadership was essential to the success of Operation Uphold Democracy as he oversaw the mobility support required for restoring the ousted democratic government of Haiti. Other significant operations where he significantly influenced the outcome and contributed to the advancement of air mobility included: Desert Sortie (redeployment of Desert Shield/Desert Storm forces); movement of Patriot missiles to Korea; GTMO (support of Haitian migrants at Guantanamo AB, Cuba).
Seeking to continually improve the mobility air forces and defense transportation system, General Fogleman directed a bottom-up review of the airlift channel process. This massive review involved the commanders, services, and other governmental agencies and resulted in a $315 million annual savings to the 350-channel system, primarily from reduction of channel frequency. This initiative improved efficiency and cost savings by reducing C-141 flying hours, thereby extending the aircraft’s life until a new core aircraft became fully operational.
General Fogleman orchestrated the development of a single, comprehensive transportation and traffic management publication for DOD, the Defense Transportation Regulation, divided into passenger, cargo, mobility, and personal property parts. This aggressive action reduced 2,200 pages of regulation by 50 percent while maintaining a quality, easy-to-use policy and procedural guide for the traffic managers throughout the worldwide Defense Transportation System.
Assessing the rapidly changing strategic environment and its impact upon the DOD, General Fogleman set out to conceptualize the Defense Transportation System of the future to support national security and warfighting strategies of the next century. Under his leadership, the command established a vision in a bold report, The “Ought To Be” Defense Transportation System for the Year 2010. The report outlined how the forces of customers, business competition, and change would affect our nation’s future commercial and defense transportation systems. With the 2010 Vision articulated, General Fogleman then formed a team dedicated to developing the strategic plan required to smoothly transition the command toward the Defense Transportation System 2010 structure.
In addition, he led AMC’s reengineering of the aeromedical evacu ation program. His vision and decisive actions improved the way pa tients are regulated and evacuated throughout the world, resulting in the development of USTRANSCOM’s Regulating And Command & Control Evacuation System (TRACES). TRACES integrated the separate theater patient movement processes with those of the continental United States, fusing the processes into a centralized global system.
Significant Changes To The Air Mobility Mission, Culture, And History
His leadership proved critical in Operation Restore Hope which demonstrated the Global Reach of the U.S. Air Force and its mobility forces. A visionary strategist, General Fogleman conceived and directed an innovative use of aerial refueling, which substantially increased the flexibility and capability of airlift missions. His direction was vital in showcasing the ability of U.S. mobility forces to not only deliver weapons of war, but also project hope; presenting a caring nation providing humanitarian relief to Rwandan refugees during Operation Support Hope. This exhibition of compassion extended to domestic relief operations for Hurricane Andrew, Typhoon Omas, Hurricane Iniki, flooding in the Midwestern United States and other humanitarian relief efforts.
Furthermore, General Fogleman actively guided the revitalization of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet program, which had suffered from a severe decline in civil aviation participation immediately following the Gulf War. General Fogleman also orchestrated the further integration of AMC and the Strategic Air Command into a combined air mobility command.
General Fogleman personally guided USTRANSCOM and Air Mobility Command in assuming a new medical mission, as mandated by DOD Directive 5154.6. As a result, USTRANSCOM greatly ex panded its medical regulatory and patient movement support to the unified commands and the services. Significantly improved global intransit visibility (ITV) of patients and command and control of intertheater patient movement are now hallmarks of the DOD system. Ultimately, this new mission allowed more patients to be evacuated during peak combat periods with less degradation to a commander’s sustained lift capability.
An additional by-product of the new medical mission was the merger of the Armed Services Medical Regulating Office and the Aeromedical Evacuation Coordination Center to form the Global Patient Movement Requirements Center (GPMRC). In addition to significantly increasing DOD’s ability to process patient movement, the GPMRC was designated as the first reinvention laboratory initiative at USTRANSCOM. Working concurrently with the Office of Assistant Secretary of Defense (Command, Control, Communications & Intelligence), General Fogleman led the command in reengineering the way patients are regulated and evacuated throughout the world as well as the subsequent redesign of the command and control system needed to incorporate the reengineered improvements. The result was “TRANSCOM’s Regulating And Command & Control Evacuation System” (TRAC2ES), which integrated the separate theater patient movement processes with those of the continental United States (CONUS) into a centralized global system. This system also decentralized execution to the outside of CONUS theaters and provided by-name patient ITV in both peace and war.
Deserving Of Induction
As the Air Force Chief of Staff, General Fogleman stabilized the service after the turmoil of reorganization and downsizing. He led the Air Force to new understandings of accountability and excellence, intensifying the commitment to personal integrity, service before self and excellence in every endeavor. Where others counseled silence on matters of fairness, he spoke out courageously on the national stage advocating for accountability and responsibility. As Commander, United States Transportation Command and Commander, Air Mobility Command, General Fogleman inspired and drove unprecedented organizational transformation that has lasting impact today and will continue into the future. His visionary style of leadership has proven invaluable to the United States’ mobility air force, as well as mobility air forces around the world.
Since his retirement from active duty in 1997, after 34 years of distinguished service, General Fogleman has remained a staunch supporter of the Air Force by continuing to serve on commissions that advise the nation on future defense needs. Donating his time and resources, he has been heavily involved in numerous fund-raising activities for the Air Force Memorial Association and demonstrated steadfast devotion to his alma mater and its ideals contributing countless hours of his time, talent, and financial resources to support the Academy’s mission and its cadets. General Fogleman served as Chairman of the Airlift/Tanker Association from 2004-2008. Throughout a lifetime of service to our great nation, General Fogleman greatly advanced the mission of air mobility and he espoused and lived by the core values of the United States Air Force: Integrity, Service, and Excellence.

Criticism Over Blast Leads Top Air Force General to Retire

By ERIC SCHMITTJULY 29, 1997

The top general of the Air Force said today that he would retire early, in part because he believed one or more Air Force officers would unfairly be held responsible for the terrorist attack in Saudi Arabia that killed 19 airmen last year, lawmakers and Pentagon officials said.The officer, Gen. Ronald R. Fogleman, said he would step down by Sept. 1, a year before his four-year term expires. General Fogleman, a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff since 1994, would become the first Air Force Chief of Staff to leave voluntarily before his tenure was up.General Fogleman, 56, a highly decorated Vietnam-era fighter pilot, has told associates in recent weeks that he would leave if Defense Secretary William S. Cohen punished Air Force commanders for failing to prevent the bombing, at the Khobar Towers housing complex in Dhahran.In a statement issued today, General Fogleman said his decision was intended to ''defuse the perceived confrontation between myself and Secretary Cohen.'' The general added, ''my values and sense of loyalty to the troops led me to the conclusion that I may be out of step.''

General Fogleman's early departure is the latest blow to the Air Force. The service is still reeling from criticism of its handling of the case of First Lieut. Kelly Flinn, the B-52 bomber pilot accused of adultery, and from Gen. Joseph W. Ralston's decision to withdraw from consideration as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff because of an adulterous affair in the mid-1980's. Continue reading the main story

Secretary Cohen is expected to announce this week whether he will discipline anyone for the Saudi disaster. A Pentagon inquiry last year singled out an Air Force commander, Brig. Gen. Terryl J. Schwalier, for failing to safeguard the complex adequately. But two Air Force reports concluded that the bombing was not the fault of General Schwalier.The Air Force has delayed promoting General Schwalier to two stars from one star pending Mr. Cohen's decision. Some lawmakers are urging the Defense Secretary to cancel General Schwalier's promotion, which would have the effect of ending his career.''Someone should be held accountable, shouldn't they?'' Senator Richard C. Shelby, an Alabama Republican who heads the Intelligence Committee, said in a recent interview.Secretary Cohen, aware of the reports of General Fogleman's possible retirement, had already started interviewing candidates before today's announcement, aides said, and will nominate a replacement soon.''I respect General Fogleman's personal decision to retire to pursue new opportunities after his service to the Air Force and to the nation,'' Mr. Cohen said in a terse statement issued at the Pentagon.General Fogleman angered some senior lawmakers and Pentagon officials with his rigid stance on Lieutenant Flinn's case. In testimony before the Senate Appropriations Committee in May, General Fogleman said that by focusing on the adultery charge lawmakers were losing sight of a more important issue.''This is an issue about an officer entrusted to fly nuclear weapons who disobeyed an order, who lied,'' General Fogleman said. ''That's what this is about.''

General Fogleman's blunt comments won cheers from many rank-and-file Air Force personnel but drew rebukes from senators and even some of the general's military lawyers who feared his statement might unduly influence a jury.''Fogleman had poisoned the well,'' said Senator Slade Gorton, a Washington Republican and former Air Force judge advocate.

For General Fogleman, a stocky 34-year veteran who graduated from the Air Force Academy, the last straw was the Khobar Towers case.The question of responsibility for the bombing on June 25, 1996, has caused deep strains in the armed forces, with generals and their civilian bosses debating whether Congress and the public hold the most prudent field commanders to unrealistically high standards.In 1995, General Fogleman won a reputation for holding Air Force personnel to higher standards after he grounded five officers and imposed administrative penalties on several others for their role in the downing of two Army helicopters over Iraq. Twenty-six people were killed when two Air Force F-15's mistakenly shot down the helicopters. One captain went to trial for his role in the accident, but he was acquitted.General Fogleman and other senior Air Force officials closed ranks in support of General Schwalier, criticizing the original Pentagon inquiry, headed by a retired four-star Army general, Wayne A. Downing.General Downing concluded that General Schwalier had focused too much on preventing a car bomb from penetrating the housing complex and not enough on the possibility that a terrorist would detonate a huge bomb just outside the perimeter fence.But two Air Force reports cited scores of preventive measures that General Schwalier took and concluded that the bomb was too large to defend against.The Air Force challenged the technical accuracy of General Downing's estimate that the bomb was about 5,000 pounds. Using Pentagon experts, the Air Force determined the bomb was equal to 20,000 to 30,000 pounds of explosives.

General Fogleman became increasingly frustrated with the handling of the case, first by then-Defense Secretary William J. Perry and his aides, then by Mr. Cohen. In the past several weeks, he talked with friends and associates about leaving.''General Fogleman hopes that by taking the burden on himself, it will quiet down the demands that others might be sanctioned who he does not believe should be sanctioned,'' said Senator Ted Stevens, an Alaska Republican who heads the Senate Appropriations Committee.Senator Stevens, who said he spoke to General Fogleman about the issue last week, said the general ''believes there are people who will be held accountable who had no ability to prevent'' the bombing.General Fogleman's frustration seeped down to lower levels. In the past few months, Air Force lawyers sympathetic to General Schwalier prepared on their own initiative a memorandum suggesting that General Downing had a financial conflict of interest with the inquiry.They said the general received a $10,000 consulting fee from the Science Applications International Corporation, a research and consulting company based in San Diego that makes anti-terrorist devices that the inquiry recommended and therefore could profit from the conclusions in General Downing's report. General Downing is also on the company's board of directors. The authors of the memorandum are not identified on the four-page paper.General Downing in an interview today strongly denied the memorandum's accusations and said the document attempted to ''create a smoke screen.'' Three senior Pentagon officials, including one familiar with an investigation into the matter by the Defense Department's inspector general, said they gave the accusations no credibility.

Biography[edit]
Air Force career[edit]
A 1963 graduate from the United States Air Force Academy, he holds a master's degree in military history and political science from Duke University. A command pilot and a parachutist, he amassed more than 6,800 flying hours in fighter, transport, tanker and rotary wing aircraft. He flew 315 combat missions and logged 806 hours of combat flying in fighter aircraft. 80 of his missions were as a "Misty FAC" in the F-100F Super Sabre at Phù Cát Air Base between 25 December 1968 and 23 April 1969.[1]
Fogleman was shot down in Vietnam in 1968, while piloting a F-100. He was rescued by clinging to an AH-1 Cobra helicopter that landed at the crash site.[2]
In early assignments he instructed student pilots, performed combat duty as a fighter pilot and high-speed forward air controller in Vietnam and Thailand, taught history at the Air Force Academy and conducted flight operations in Europe—including duty as an F-15 Eagle aircraft demonstration pilot for international airshows. He commanded an Air Force wing, an air division, a numbered air force, a major command and a unified command.
Fogleman was the first graduate of the United States Air Force Academy to advance to Chief of Staff of the Air Force. During his tenure, he introduced a simplified code of conduct for Airmen, which remains in use today. Called the "Air Force Core Values", the code demands "Integrity First, Service Before Self, and Excellence in All We Do."
General Fogleman retired on September 1, 1997.
Bosnian War Controversy in June 1995[edit]
During the Bosnian War NATO Forces were establishing a no-fly-zone. On 2 June two patrolling US F-16 aircraft of that operation came under attack by a Serbian SA-6 surface-to-air missile launch system. One plane was consequently hit and the pilot, Scott O'Grady ejected. Minutes after the landing, Serbian forces were closing in on his position, but he managed to escape and radioed for help on the 4th day, transmitting intermittent to lessen the chance of detection. These radio calls were picked up by US Forces.
General Ronald Fogleman, at the time Air Force Chief of Staff told press reporters during a promotion ceremony that "intermittent" transmissions were picked up. An "enraged" NATO official described this with "I was dumbfounded he said that" and "I mean, why not just announce to the bad guys, 'We think he's alive and kicking, and we hope we find him before you do'?" according to information published in the TIME magazine.[3]
However this 'leak' did not thwart a US Marine rescue operation involving several aircraft and helicopters that was launched later. Although the rescue forces came under small arms fire and missiles were fired by shoulder-held surface-to-air launchers on the way back, O'Grady was successfully extracted.[4]
Post-Air Force career[edit]
He currently has a seat on the Boards of Directors of Alliant Techsystems, AAR Corporation, Mesa Air Group, Inc., Tactical Air Support, Inc., World Air Holdings, Inc., and the Tauriga Sciences Inc.'s Business Advisory Board[1][5][6] He is also on the board of advisors of the Code of Support Foundation, a nonprofit military services organization.[7]
On November 11, 2009, General Fogleman was appointed Chairman of the Board of Directors at Alliant Techsystems Inc., following the retirement of ATK Chairman and CEO Dan Murphy.
As a Boeing consultant, Fogleman said that the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II will not be a combat proven aircraft until it receives the Block 3F software in the early 2020s.[8]

Biography[edit]
Air Force career[edit]
A 1963 graduate from the United States Air Force Academy, he holds a master's degree in military history and political science from Duke University. A command pilot and a parachutist, he amassed more than 6,800 flying hours in fighter, transport, tanker and rotary wing aircraft. He flew 315 combat missions and logged 806 hours of combat flying in fighter aircraft. 80 of his missions were as a "Misty FAC" in the F-100F Super Sabre at Phù Cát Air Base between 25 December 1968 and 23 April 1969.[1]
Fogleman was shot down in Vietnam in 1968, while piloting a F-100. He was rescued by clinging to an AH-1 Cobra helicopter that landed at the crash site.[2]
In early assignments he instructed student pilots, performed combat duty as a fighter pilot and high-speed forward air controller in Vietnam and Thailand, taught history at the Air Force Academy and conducted flight operations in Europe—including duty as an F-15 Eagle aircraft demonstration pilot for international airshows. He commanded an Air Force wing, an air division, a numbered air force, a major command and a unified command.
Fogleman was the first graduate of the United States Air Force Academy to advance to Chief of Staff of the Air Force. During his tenure, he introduced a simplified code of conduct for Airmen, which remains in use today. Called the "Air Force Core Values", the code demands "Integrity First, Service Before Self, and Excellence in All We Do."
General Fogleman retired on September 1, 1997.
Bosnian War Controversy in June 1995[edit]
During the Bosnian War NATO Forces were establishing a no-fly-zone. On 2 June two patrolling US F-16 aircraft of that operation came under attack by a Serbian SA-6 surface-to-air missile launch system. One plane was consequently hit and the pilot, Scott O'Grady ejected. Minutes after the landing, Serbian forces were closing in on his position, but he managed to escape and radioed for help on the 4th day, transmitting intermittent to lessen the chance of detection. These radio calls were picked up by US Forces.
General Ronald Fogleman, at the time Air Force Chief of Staff told press reporters during a promotion ceremony that "intermittent" transmissions were picked up. An "enraged" NATO official described this with "I was dumbfounded he said that" and "I mean, why not just announce to the bad guys, 'We think he's alive and kicking, and we hope we find him before you do'?" according to information published in the TIME magazine.[3]
However this 'leak' did not thwart a US Marine rescue operation involving several aircraft and helicopters that was launched later. Although the rescue forces came under small arms fire and missiles were fired by shoulder-held surface-to-air launchers on the way back, O'Grady was successfully extracted.[4]
Post-Air Force career[edit]
He currently has a seat on the Boards of Directors of Alliant Techsystems, AAR Corporation, Mesa Air Group, Inc., Tactical Air Support, Inc., World Air Holdings, Inc., and the Tauriga Sciences Inc.'s Business Advisory Board[1][5][6] He is also on the board of advisors of the Code of Support Foundation, a nonprofit military services organization.[7]
On November 11, 2009, General Fogleman was appointed Chairman of the Board of Directors at Alliant Techsystems Inc., following the retirement of ATK Chairman and CEO Dan Murphy.
As a Boeing consultant, Fogleman said that the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II will not be a combat proven aircraft until it receives the Block 3F software in the early 2020s.[8]

Cashing In: Ex-Officers Double As Paid Military ‘Mentors’ And Contractor Consultants    SHARE     TWEET     PIN-IT         UPI/Newscom By Justin Elliott Published December 30, 2009 4:35 am   Views                              Under a newly revealed arrangement that makes the famous “revolving door” seem quaint, retired military officers are simultaneously drawing paychecks both from the government and from private sector businesses gunning for Pentagon contracts, according to a USA Today investigation.A defense consulting firm out in Colorado called Durango Group, which helps companies obtain DOD contracts, sits at the center of this lucrative arrangement.About a quarter, or 15, of the retired officers who get a Durango paycheck are also paid by taxpayers in the military’s “mentor” program (at a rate of hundreds of dollars per hour), according to USA Today. They also get hefty military pensions, and many sit on the boards of defense contractors.Through their military work, these mentors have access to sensitive information that can be leveraged into unbeatable business advice for companies — Boeing, for example —  looking for government contracts, who in turn pay Durango for the privilege.  While the firm and officers might see this as synergy, others see it as an ethical breach. The watchdog group Public Citizen called it an “amazing conflict of interest” in an interview with USA Today.The story on Durango is the latest in an excellent USA Today series on the growing senior mentors program. The series has prompted Defense Secretary Bob Gates to order a review of the program.But Durango doesn’t seem embarrassed by the arrangement. It advertises its consultants’ special ties to the military on its Web site. Conflict of interest rules don’t apply because mentors are technically contractors for the military, not employees.Durango founder Gen. Ronald Fogleman, who retired as chief of staff of the Air Force in 1997, himself has worked as a senior mentor for the military.USA Today reports that in his capacity as a mentor, Fogleman took part in a major Air Force space war game in 2007. At that war game, new tech concepts including a long-range unmanned drone were tested out. Soon after, Boeing, one of Fogleman’s clients, announced it was developing such a drone for military uses.The whole story on Durango is here.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.
