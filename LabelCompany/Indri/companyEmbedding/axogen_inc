Avance® Nerve Graft is an off-the-shelf processed human nerve allograft intended for the surgical repair of peripheral nerve discontinuities. Through a proprietary cleansing process for recovered human peripheral nerve tissue, the graft preserves the essential inherent structure of the ECM while cleansing away cellular and noncellular debris.
Avance® Nerve Graft provides the following key advantages:

Three dimensional scaffold for bridging a nerve gap
Decellularized and cleansed extracellular matrixthat remodels into patient’s own tissue
No donor nerve surgery, therefore no comorbidities associated with an additional surgical site
Available in a variety of lengths and diameters to meet a range of gap lengths and anatomical needs
Supplied sterile with three years shelf life (kept frozen at or below -40º C/F)

 
NERVE MATTERS
AxoGen strives to broaden the research and knowledge base of peripheral nerve injury and repair by identifying what factors “matter” in nerve repair.  The links below provide information about how processing and structure of nerve repair options may affect outcomes:
Avance® Nerve Graft: Processing Matters
Avance® Nerve Graft: Structure Matters
 
REGULATORY CLASSIFICATION
Avance® Nerve Graft is a human tissue for transplantation. Avance® Nerve Graft is processed and distributed in accordance with US FDA requirements for Human Cellular and Tissue-based Products (HCT/P) under 21 CFR Part 1271 regulations, US State regulations and the guidelines of the American Association of Tissue Banks (AATB). Additionally, international regulations are followed as appropriate.
This graft is to be dispensed only by, or on the order of, a licensed physician.
INDICATIONS FOR USE 
Avance® Nerve Graft is processed nerve allograft (human) intended for the surgical repair of peripheral nerve discontinuities to support regeneration across the defect.
CONTRAINDICATIONS 
Avance® Nerve Graft is contraindicated for use in any patient in whom soft tissue implants are contraindicated. This includes any pathology that would limit the blood supply and compromise healing or evidence of a current infection.
WARNINGS 
Careful donor screening, laboratory testing, tissue processing, and gamma irradiation have been utilized to minimize the risk of transmission of relevant communicable diseases to the patient. As with any processed human donor tissue, Avance® cannot be guaranteed to be free of all pathogens. Do not reuse or re-sterilize Avance® Nerve Graft and do not refreeze product if thawed.

Corporate Profile


It’s time to rethink nerve repair.™
AxoGen (NASDAQ: AXGN) is a leading medical technology company dedicated to peripheral nerve repair. The company has created and licensed a unique combination of patented nerve repair technologies to change the standard of care for patients with peripheral nerve injuries. AxoGen's portfolio of regenerative medicine products is available in the United States, Canada and several other countries, and includes Avance® Nerve Graft, an off-the-shelf processed human nerve allograft for bridging severed nerves without the comorbidities associated with an additional surgical site, AxoGuard® Nerve Connector, a porcine submucosa extracellular matrix ("ECM") coaptation aid for tensionless repair of severed nerves, and AxoGuard® Nerve Protector, a porcine submucosa ECM product used to wrap and protect injured peripheral nerves and reinforce the nerve reconstruction while preventing soft tissue attachments.
Company Overview

Only company focused on peripheral nerve repair solutions
Addressing a $1.6B+ current market opportunity
Comprehensive product portfolio addresses all surgical peripheral nerve reconstruction needs
Pioneering sales and market strategy, solid execution plan
Poised for strong growth
75%+ gross margins
Barriers to competitive entry & growing body of clinical data
Long term expansion potential beyond current market

Our Market: AxoGen is a pioneer in the regenerative medicine market with a portfolio of products for peripheral nerve reconstruction. Our technologies provide an option for surgeons to reconstruct injured nerves without the comorbidities associated with a secondary surgical site. Further, they offer surgeons an opportunity to protect compressed nerves or reconstruct injured nerves. Our technologies are used by several surgical specialties and in peripheral nerves throughout the body.
Based on research and analysis, the U.S. market for the repair of transected peripheral nerves in the extremities exceeds $1.6 billion. AxoGen is actively targeting this market and expanding focus in OUS markets.
Our Current Focus

Upper Extremity
Lower Extremity
Carpal Tunnel Revision
Oral and Maxillofacial

AxoGen's future expansion opportunities include Facial Reconstruction, Podiatry, Breast Reconstruction, Prostatectomy, and Pain Management.
Market Research Reports

Analysis by an independent third party research group concluded that the US market for the repair of transected peripheral nerves in the extremities alone exceeds $1.6 billion. For further information on the analysis, click here .
Our Products: AxoGen's proprietary products and technologies are designed to overcome fundamental challenges in nerve reconstruction and offer off-the-shelf solutions to surgeons for a wide variety of peripheral nerve injuries.

Avance® Nerve Graft is a processed nerve allograft for bridging nerve discontinuities. Avance® Nerve Graft follows the guiding principle that the human body created the optimal nerve structure. The human nerve allograft is decellularized and processed resulting in a surgical implant with the natural structural pathways to guide axon regeneration. Avance® Nerve Graft is provided in a variety of diameters up to 5mm and a variety of lengths up to 70 mm, provides the flexibility to be used across joints and handles similarly to an autograft nerve without the comorbidities associated with an additional surgical site.
AxoGuard® Nerve Protector is a minimally processed, intact extracellular matrix derived from porcine small intestine submucosa (SIS) designed to wrap and protect injured peripheral nerves. AxoGuard® Nerve Protector can reinforce a coaptation site, wrap a partially severed or compressed nerve, and isolate tissue. AxoGuard® Nerve Protector can be used to wrap injured nerves up to 40 mm in length, easily conforms to and wraps the injured nerve, and minimizes the potential for soft tissue attachments and nerve entrapment by physically isolating the nerve. Further, it is strong, flexible and easy to suture.
AxoGuard® Nerve Connector is a minimally processed, extracellular matrix derived from porcine small intestine submucosa (SIS) designed as a coaptation aid for tensionless repair of transected or severed peripheral nerves. AxoGuard® Nerve Connector can be used to bridge gaps up to 5 mm in length and alleviates tension at the repair site. Further, it reduces the number of required sutures (vs. direct repair) and the potential for fascicular mismatch. AxoGuard® Nerve Connector is strong and flexible, easy to suture and semi-translucent which allows visualization of the underlying nerve.

Our Clinical Research: AxoGen invests in and supports clinical studies and programs to further the understanding and outcomes of peripheral nerve repair.

A Multicenter Retrospective Study of Avance® Nerve Graft Utilization, Evaluations and Outcomes in Peripheral Nerve Injury Repair (RANGER®). The RANGER® Study, the Avance® Nerve Graft registry, has completed the first data milestone and continues to enroll additional cases.
A Multicenter, Prospective, Randomized, Comparative Study of Hollow Nerve Conduit and Avance® Nerve Graft Evaluation Recovery Outcomes of the Nerve Repair in the Hand (CHANGE). The CHANGE Study is a pilot comparative study. Enrollment is now completed.
A Multicenter, Prospective, Randomized, Subject and Evaluator Blinded Comparative Study of Nerve Cuffs and Avance® Nerve Graft Evaluating Recovery Outcomes for the Repair of Nerve Discontinuities (RECON). The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the difference in functional recovery outcome between the study groups.
Cavernous Nerve Reconstruction Using Avance® Nerve Graft in Subjects Who Undergo Robotic Assisted Prostatectomy for Treatment of Prostate Cancer. This study is being conducted to assess the technical feasibility of robotic assisted implantation of Avance® Nerve Graft and the long term outcomes for continence and potency in men undergoing radical prostatectomy. Enrollment is now completed.

Our Pipeline: AxoGen will continue to work with leading researchers in an effort to further translate research into products that improve the standard of care for patients with peripheral nerve injuries. We believe this approach provides a path to continue on the leading edge in our field and to increase our overall potential for success and growth. AxoGen is engaged in a major initiative to build and further expand sales and marketing capabilities, and to increase acceptance and clinical adoption from the medical community.
Regulatory Information: AxoGen's products are subject to international, federal, state and local regulations as Healthcare Products. AxoGen meets the regulations for human tissue products and medical devices as required by the appropriate international and domestic regulatory agencies (i.e. FDA). Additionally, AxoGen is an accredited tissue bank with the American Association of Tissue Banks (AATB) and AxoGen is an ISO 13485 registered company.

FAQ




Who is AxoGen?AxoGen, Inc. is a regenerative medicine company focused on the development and commercialization of technologies for peripheral nerve reconstruction and regeneration. The Company has created and licensed a unique combination of patented technologies and offers a full portfolio of nerve repair and protection solutions for patients with peripheral nerve injuries.What products does AxoGen offer?AxoGen's products offer a full suite of surgical nerve reconstruction solutions including Avance® Nerve Graft, the only commercially available allograft nerve for bridging severed nerves without the comorbidities associated with a second surgical site, AxoGuard® Nerve Connector, a porcine submucosa ECM coaptation aid for tensionless repair of severed nerves, and AxoGuard® Nerve Protector, a porcine submucosa ECM product used to wrap and protect injured peripheral nerves and reinforce coaptation sites while preventing soft tissue attachments.How does AxoGen plan to maintain a competitive advantage in the peripheral nerve graft market?AxoGen provides a patent protected product suite that addresses the surgical peripheral nerve continuum. Avance® Nerve Graft is a product used in nerve reconstruction where the gap between the nerve ends is typically greater than 5mm. AxoGen developed Avance® Nerve Graft by following the guiding principle that the human body created the optimal nerve structure. Processed from recovered human peripheral nerve tissue, Avance® Nerve Graft provides the natural nerve structure of an autograft nerve but with the ease and availability of an off-the-shelf product.
AxoGuard® Nerve Protector minimizes the potential for soft tissue attachments and nerve entrapment by physically isolating the nerve during the healing process.
AxoGuard® Nerve Connector is for gaps between the nerve ends up to 5mm and provides a coaptation aid for the reconstruction.
Both AxoGuard® Nerve Protector and AxoGuard® Nerve Connector provide the unique features of pliability, suturability, and translucence for visualization of the underlying nerve while allowing the patient's own cells to incorporate into the extracellular matrix to remodel and form a tissue similar to the nerve epineurium.
Through R&D, licensing or acquisition, AxoGen will also continue to expand its product offering with products that Bring the Science of Nerve Repair to Life.What is AxoGen, Inc.'s stock symbol?Our stock is traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol AXGN.Can I buy stock directly from AxoGen, Inc.?No, you will need to contact a licensed stock broker or use an online trading account.How can I buy stock in AxoGen, Inc.?Through a licensed stock broker or by using an online trading account.How do I change the address on my shareholder account?Through your brokerage account or by contacting our transfer agent.Where is AxoGen, Inc. located?13631 Progress Blvd. Suite 400 Alachua, FL 32615When is AxoGen, Inc.'s fiscal year end?December 31stWho is AxoGen, Inc.'s transfer agent?Wells Fargo Shareowner Services P.O.
