Historical Overview






 

What began as a small life insurance brokerage general agent study group in the early 1970’s has evolved into LifeMark Partners, an industry leading marketing and sales organization poised for continued growth.
It was at the Greenbrier Resort that Security Connecticut, one of the leading early brokerage industry companies, hosted a meeting of their General Agents.  Several of these attendees decided to begin to get together to share ideas for insurance sales and marketing as well as the business side of their fledgling agencies.  The first formal meeting of LIFE Inc. (Life Insurance for Everyone) was held in Pittsburgh, PA in June of 1976 and the original member agencies included Security House (Baltimore, MD), Life Plans (CT), Shaw American (Louisville, KY), Underwriters Brokerage Service (Pittsburgh, PA), Ambassador Insurance Agency (Boston, MA) and Imco Life Services (Southfield, MI).



Membership expanded over the years to a high of 17 member agencies.  And, while Life, Inc. maintained their study group presence and roots, they envisioned business opportunities and growth beyond their original charter.  It was in the early 1990’s as LifeMark Associates and later LifeMark Distributors that they embarked on an initiative to provide consulting services to carriers, one of which involved a project with United of Omaha to assist with their desire to enter the brokerage side of the life insurance business.  An additional project was for extensive annuity consulting for GECA in Seattle. 
This group understood that there was a major difference between a study group among friends and a successful business venture.  As a marketing organization, LifeMark Partners was introduced mid 1990’s with the goal to develop as a major sales and marketing force within our industry.  With Mende Lerner as the initial Chairman, Becky Wingate (a former Mutual of Omaha executive) was brought on board to help develop the business side of the organization with headquarters in Baltimore, MD.  Partners were added in a strategic fashion bringing significant production, geographic diversity and market expertise.  Under the initial leadership the organization developed a stellar reputation.  Michael Flynn, Malcolm Sklar and currently Mark Rosen followed Mende Lerner as Chairman.   When Becky Wingate moved on to other opportunities, LifeMark was fortunate to have Nancy Bosley available to step into the President’s role and help further the organization as a true leader within the industry.  LifeMark is now ably led by Bill Shelow, a brokerage industry veteran and former life insurance company president.
Members of LifeMark are well known leaders within their industry and respective communities and over the years, roughly half of the NAILBA Chairman have come from the LifeMark ranks.

BALTIMORE, Aug. 30, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- LifeMark Partners (www.LifeMarkPartners.com), one of the nation's largest independent national insurance marketing organizations, celebrates its 20-year anniversary as an IMO this fall. With roots in the life insurance industry extending 40 years, the company evolved from the study group LIFE Inc., formed in 1976. Recognizing the unique need for sales and marketing support to expand and enhance life insurance distribution, LifeMark Partners was formed in 1996 to provide comprehensive service to the brokerage general agency community. Currently, with 37 BGA Partners nationwide and a reach of more than 100,000 affiliated agents and advisors, LifeMark Partners celebrates this milestone through reflection on the past and with an eye towards the future of life insurance distribution. 








"With a dedicated focus on improving the distribution of life insurance, we pride ourselves on offering world-class resources to a top-tier group of Partner BGAs, and our longevity and success will always be due to the success of our Partners. We are fortunate to be the company they chose to have as a partner," said William Shelow, CLU®, ChFC®, CPCU®, LLIF, President and Chief Executive Officer, LifeMark Partners. One of the fundamental forces behind LifeMark Partners' success has been its continued investment in competitive resources to enhance the distribution of life insurance nationwide. As such, they have focused on three critical initiatives: Access. Expertise. Partnership. 
AccessLifeMark Partners enhances access as well as the underwriting process by partnering closely with their 20+ insurance carrier relationships and adds additional resources such as exclusive access to Swiss Re and Hannover Re Underwriting manuals as well as unique reinsurance arrangements and their own Medical Director. This competitive advantage is further enhanced with exclusive large capacity reinsurance access.
"Underwriting support as well as the underwriting process has been a huge focus for LifeMark," said Shelow. "Our ultimate goal is to help people of all walks of life get the insurance they need in the most streamlined manner possible."
ExpertiseLifeMark Partners' expertise in case design and product support comes from its 40 years of experience within the industry as well as collaboration with industry-leading technology providers, such as LifeTrends.  Proprietary policy review tools and advanced business succession and charitable planning strategies, also allows Partners to expand insurance distribution opportunities. 
PartnershipToday, the founding study group philosophy remains evident through the partnership of like-minded BGAs recognized for sharing best practices and growing their agencies together. LifeMark Partners provides Partners and their respective employees and affiliated advisors ongoing and diverse training opportunities throughout the year, as well as opportunity to connect, collaborate and share intellectual capital for effective strategies and continued growth of their agencies.
"While LifeMark Partners has been an industry success story throughout their 20 year history, I am most excited and encouraged with our prospects for the future," says Mark Rosen, CLU®, Chairman of the Board for LifeMark Partners. "LifeMark is constantly expanding on a truly impressive array of resources and distribution initiatives that will continue to enable partners be proactively positioned for growth and relevance in our constantly-changing marketplace for years to come."

MilestonesLifeMark Partners Inc. Celebrates 20 Years as an IMO
 
Attributes its Commitment to BGAs in Providing Access, Expertise and Partnership as the Foundation to its Success

Sept 2, 2016 – Baltimore, Md. – LifeMark Partners (www.LifeMarkPartners.com), one of the nation’s largest independent national insurance marketing organizations, celebrates its 20-year anniversary as an IMO this fall.
With roots in the life insurance industry extending 40 years, the company evolved from the study group LIFE Inc., formed in 1976. Recognizing the unique need for sales and marketing support to expand and enhance life insurance distribution, LifeMark Partners was formed in 1996 to provide comprehensive service to the brokerage general agency community. Currently, with 37 BGA Partners nationwide and a reach of more than 100,000 affiliated agents and advisors, LifeMark Partners celebrates this milestone through reflection on the past and with an eye towards the future of life insurance distribution.
“With a dedicated focus on improving the distribution of life insurance, we pride ourselves on offering world-class resources to a top-tier group of Partner BGAs, and our longevity and success will always be due to the success of our Partners. We are fortunate to be the company they chose to have as a partner,” said William Shelow, CLU®, ChFC®, CPCU®, LLIF, President and Chief Executive Officer, LifeMark Partners. One of the fundamental forces behind LifeMark Partners’ success has been its continued investment in competitive resources to enhance the distribution of life insurance nationwide. As such, they have focused on three critical initiatives: Access. Expertise. Partnership.
Access
LifeMark Partners enhances access as well as the underwriting process by partnering closely with their 20+ insurance carrier relationships and adds additional resources such as exclusive access to Swiss Re and Hannover Re Underwriting manuals as well as unique reinsurance arrangements and their own Medical Director. This competitive advantage is further enhanced with exclusive large capacity reinsurance access.
“Underwriting support as well as the underwriting process has been a huge focus for LifeMark,“ said Shelow. “Our ultimate goal is to help people of all walks of life get the insurance they need in the most streamlined manner possible.”
Expertise

LifeMark Partners’ expertise in case design and product support comes from its 40 years of experience within the industry as well as collaboration with industry-leading technology providers, such as LifeTrends. Proprietary policy review tools and advanced business succession and charitable planning strategies, also allows Partners to expand insurance distribution opportunities.
Partnership

LifeMark Partners provides Partners and their respective employees and affiliated advisors ongoing and diverse training opportunities throughout the year, as well as opportunity to connect, collaborate and share intellectual capital for effective strategies and continued growth of their agencies.
