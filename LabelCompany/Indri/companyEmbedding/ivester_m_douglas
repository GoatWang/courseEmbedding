Tone Deaf: Ivester Had All Skills Of a CEO but One: Ear for Political Nuance---Clumsy Handling of One Flap After Another Cost Him Coke Board's Confidence---How to Irritate the Europeans

By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Betsy McKay, Nikhil Deogun and
Joanne Lublin
 

12/17/1999 




ATLANTA -- The job of running a giant company like Coca-Cola Co. is
akin to conducting an orchestra.But M. Douglas Ivester, it seems, had a tin ear.

Just over two years ago, Mr. Ivester was widely considered the ideal
successor to Roberto Goizueta, the revered and long-serving chairman of
Coke. A brilliant and driven financial strategist, Mr. Ivester worked at
Mr. Goizueta's side for more than a decade and was the architect of much
of Coke's success during that time.Directors marveled at Mr. Ivester's intensity, his attention to even
minute details. Warren Buffett was fond of telling how he had once
noticed that his grandson's favorite pizza parlor in Omaha, Neb., served
Pepsi, and how he mentioned this to Mr. Ivester in passing -- only to
find that the next time he stopped in, the place was serving Coke. Mr.
Ivester "looks at anytime anyone swigs any beverage other than a Coke
product as a personal insult," said Mr. Buffett, whose Berkshire
Hathaway Inc. is Coke's biggest shareholder.After Mr. Goizueta's death in October 1997, Mr. Buffett expressed
nothing but confidence in Mr. Ivester. Mr. Goizueta's "greatest legacy
is the way he so carefully selected and then nurtured the future
leadership of his company," Mr. Buffett said. Other directors evidently
felt similarly. A board meeting to pick the new chairman and chief
executive lasted a mere 15 minutes.No great calamity has befallen the mighty company since then. The
company's earnings have been under pressure during his tenure, but a big
reason for that, the severe Asian economic downturn, was clearly not of
the CEO's making. Yet this month, the 52-year-old Mr. Ivester abruptly
announced he will step down in April, and about all he said by way of
explanation was that he had "come to believe our company will now best
be served by fresh leadership that will bring its own energy to bear."
The board quickly promoted Douglas Daft, who ran Coke's Middle and Far
East divisions, to president and chief operating officer and designated
him to succeed Mr. Ivester.The story of how this happened is one of powerful board members and
stockholders gradually coming to the conclusion that Coca-Cola was
headed down the wrong path under Mr. Ivester. It wasn't the obvious
problem of weakening earnings and a gyrating stock price, though Coke
has suffered those woes, but rather something more elusive: Mr.
Ivester's tone deafness in his handling of a series of small crises.Alone, none was so bad. But taken together, they worried the
12-member board, some of whose members felt that Mr. Ivester wasn't
listening to them. Mr. Ivester's way of handling controversies made the
company he loved seem insensitive and arrogant. Not only did his
personal image suffer, but, more troubling to the board members, the
image of the company suffered.And important people were watching Mr. Ivester's performance. People
like Mr. Buffett; Herbert A. Allen, a director and head of Allen & Co.,
a New York investment bank that is a large Coke shareholder; and Donald
Keough, Coke's former No. 2 and now Allen & Co.'s chairman.It isn't clear whether an ultimatum was ever given to Mr. Ivester,
although several people close to the company say none was. Instead, they
say, the CEO sized up the situation himself. He "knew he wasn't gaining
the confidence of people out there," one of these people notes.One of Mr. Ivester's worst missteps came in October and involved Carl
Ware, the chief of Coke's Africa division and its highest-ranking black
executive. Mr. Ivester decided on a management reorganization that meant
Mr. Ware would no longer report directly to the chief executive -- in
effect, a demotion. Such a move would need to be carefully handled by
any CEO, but especially the chief of Coca-Cola; the company faces an
employee lawsuit alleging racial discrimination.Through the back-and-forth of the well-publicized suit, Mr. Ware had
stood at Mr. Ivester's side, agreeing in May to be co-head of a
company-wide diversity committee. Mr. Ware, former president of
Atlanta's city council, is the face of Coca-Cola to much of the city and
was a symbol of how African-Americans could advance at Atlanta's most
famous company. Called one of the "12 most powerful blacks in corporate
America" by Ebony magazine, Mr. Ware was also one of a dozen executives
to join President Clinton on a trip to Africa in 1998. "This is a guy
you light candles around," says a person close to the board.So how did Mr. Ivester break the news to Mr. Ware? By telephone to
the executive, who was in Europe, say several people. Mr. Ware soon
announced his retirement, set for the end of next year. To board members
as well as some current and former executives, Mr. Ivester's handling of
the matter was ham-handed. "Ware was a big blunder," says a person close
to the company.Had this been the only misstep, Mr. Ivester might have survived. But
there had been other incidents, earlier in his tenure. His persistent
attempts, in the face of foreign-government opposition, to acquire
French soda company Orangina and the overseas business of Cadbury
Schweppes painted a bull's-eye on Coke for overseas regulators. Coke's
handling of a contamination scare in Belgium brought the company heavy
criticism in Europe.Then, Mr. Ivester discussed in an interview with a Brazilian
newsmagazine Coke's testing of wireless technology that would enable
vending machines to change prices based on the weather. Translation: the
hotter the weather, the higher-priced the Coke. To Mr. Ivester, the
accountant, the concept was just the law of supply and demand in action.
To the board, the ensuing flap was Murphy's Law at work.For a consumer-product company that, in the words of a person close
to the board, "is a giant image machine," the pummeling of Coke's image
was increasingly intolerable.All along, Mr. Ivester resisted directors' advice to name a No. 2
executive to help him with day-to-day duties and serve as a sounding
board for decisions. And just last month, he managed to anger Coke
bottlers by deciding to raise the price of soft-drink concentrate next
year by twice as much as usual.Some directors had known all along that Mr. Ivester was a little
rough around the edges, famous for a take-no-prisoners attitude. But
they expected him to grow into the more-statesmanlike role of chairman.
As board members of Coke, they were accustomed to plaudits during the
16-year Goizueta reign. Now, they began to get questions from ordinary
people asking, "What's wrong with Coke?""The directors aren't blind," says a person close to the board. They
started to think it was naive to suppose Mr. Ivester would develop, on
the job, CEO skills that he lacked. "It's like telling a person who
doesn't have a sense of humor to be funny," this person says, adding
that the conclusion began to form in some directors' minds that they had
picked "the wrong guy."There was never any complaint about Mr. Ivester's devotion to Coke.
He was a driven man. The son of a factory foreman from the tiny
cotton-mill town of New Holland, Ga., Mr. Ivester became an accountant
and joined Coke in 1979 after a stint as its outside auditor. Often
reporting to his office at seven in the morning and working seven days a
week, he quickly climbed through the ranks.He impressed both Mr. Goizueta and Mr. Keough with his financial
ingenuity and passion to succeed. After being named chief financial
officer in 1985 at the age of 37, he engineered a big consolidation of
Coke's bottlers that gave the company greater control over the bottling
system while wiping assets and debt off its balance sheet.Told he could either count money or earn it, he then chose the
operations side. He became head of the European business and then ran
the flagship U.S. business.Everything Mr. Ivester did he did by the book, studying management
texts and getting tutoring in skills that he lacked, such as marketing.
He kept a folder of articles on management and leadership, highlighted
and marked for follow-up reading. He kept handy a copy of "Life's Little
Instruction Book" (sample advice: "Keep a tight rein on your temper")
and a slim 1923 book called "Matters of Importance" (which advised, "Be
courteous, pleasant and always friendly to people you come in contact
with").Subordinates got a taste of his attention to detail when he gave all
U.S. employees laminated cards with numbers to call if they ever saw a
vending machine out of stock or anything else askew.Mr. Ivester's critics and fans always worried that he lacked the
engaging manner and diplomatic skills of the aristocratic Mr. Goizueta.
Without a ready wit to soften his aggressiveness, Mr. Ivester sometimes
came off as highhanded or ruthless. In his first speech to the
soft-drink industry after becoming president, he dismayed some listeners
by likening rival firms to parasites or sheep -- and Coke to a wolf. But
for every time Mr. Ivester "drew blood" with his comments or his style,
there was always Mr. Goizueta to "wipe it off," says a high-ranking
former executive.Although Mr. Ivester was Mr. Goizueta's choice as successor by the
early 1990s, Mr. Goizueta's 1994 decision to postpone his retirement
beyond age 65 was seen as a sign that Mr. Ivester needed more grooming.Then in October 1997, Mr. Goizueta died of lung cancer. Coke was in
just about the best shape in its 113-year history: It commanded a 50%
share of the world market for soft drinks, and the stock was a Wall
Street favorite. Mr. Ivester -- seemingly adept at handling both data
and people -- looked like the person to keep this string going. Fortune
magazine dubbed him the "prototype boss for the 21st century."Mr. Ivester's ways weren't Mr. Goizueta's. Where his illustrious
predecessor had remained aloof from the day-to-day business, Mr. Ivester
was hands-on. Board members urged him to recognize that Coke was too big
a company for one person to run without a second-in-command, but he said
he wanted to "de-layer" the organization and didn't need a "filter."
Instead of appointing a president, he himself kept in touch with 16
executives who reported to him directly.Despite the outward confidence, some people who know Mr. Ivester say
he was unsure he could follow in Mr. Goizueta's footsteps. For one
thing, he had been very close to his mentor. His mother, Ada Mae
Ivester, says he was "heartbroken" over Mr. Goizueta's death. She
recalls mentioning to her husband, on the day of Mr. Goizueta's funeral,
"Buck, he's never going to get through this."Another person says Mr. Ivester seemed to have felt most at ease as
No. 2 to Mr. Goizueta. Mr. Ivester "was very comfortable with him and
would have loved to have him stay on as chairman. He may not ever have
gotten over it."Mr. Goizueta had been gone scarcely two months when trouble hit the
long-invincible Coke empire. As Asian economies -- the key to Coke's
long-term growth -- imploded, analysts reduced their earnings estimates.
At a company that was renowned for its earnings predictability, estimate
cuts became a common event as the crisis spread to Russia and then to
Latin America. Given the cause of the troubles, investors and board
members didn't hold Mr. Ivester responsible.But a year into his job, they did start to wonder about some of his
decisions. Mr. Ivester's first big move as CEO was an attempt to acquire
Orangina from Pernod Ricard SA. While the price of $880 million was huge
for such a small brand, the board and Wall Street bought Mr. Ivester's
rationale that Coke could take this undeveloped brand and profitably run
it through Coke's massive distribution system. It seemed another adroit
strategic move by Mr. Ivester.By September 1998, it looked anything but adroit. The government of
France decided to reject the bid for the quintessentially French drink
after Coke rival PepsiCo Inc. argued that such a takeover would harm
soft-drink competition in France. Coke got early signals of the French
decision, and some people close to Mr. Ivester recommended he withdraw
the bid before the turndown was announced. Instead, Mr. Ivester plowed
ahead, ultimately losing the effort but managing to trigger news stories
in Europe suggesting that already-giant Coke was trying to take over the
soft-drink market. A Coke spokesman says the company was contractually
bound to pursue the acquisition until the French government made a final
decision."The company lost an incredible amount of credibility with Orangina,"
says one person close to the company. "It's not smart to give up all
your political credits for 10 cases of something."It was a similar story a few months later, in December 1998, when Mr.
Ivester sought to buy rival Cadbury Schweppes's overseas brands. The
effort was initially blocked in several countries, including Australia
and Mexico, again on the argument that Coke already had too much market
power.Although Coke got the deal done in 161 countries, Mr. Ivester had to
scale down the bid to exclude much of Europe. And not before more bad
press and a rapping of the knuckles by the European Union's competition
commissioner, who accused Coke of trying to circumvent the EU and "pull
the wool over our eyes."Finally, in four European countries, EU antitrust officials armed
with search warrants marched into offices of Coke and bottling
companies. For two days, they went through files looking for evidence
that Coke had abused its powerful market position. The matter is still
pending.Coke contends its dealings in Europe are legally free of antitrust
taint, but to many experts that isn't the point. "They took the view
that this was a legal process similar to FTC hearings in the U.S.," says
a person close to Coke. "They completely missed the point that it's
political."More evidence of Mr. Ivester's deafness to European political nuance
came during this year's contamination scare in Belgium and France, in
which more than 200 people complained of nausea and other symptoms after
drinking Coke products. Mr. Ivester, who was in Paris when the first
schoolchildren fell ill, flew home. In the first few days of the crisis,
while Coke officials declared that the products didn't pose a health
hazard, he kept silent.At least one director counseled him to get himself quickly to Belgium
and speak up. Mr. Ivester said he wanted to respect a request from the
Belgian health minister to keep the matter behind closed doors and not
use the press. But board members advised him not to believe a
politician. Sure enough, the health minister himself appeared on Belgian
television and criticized Coke.A few months later came another public-relations gaffe. Asked by a
Brazilian newsmagazine about Coke's testing of vending machines that
could change prices according to the weather, Mr. Ivester gave a
theoretical response that came across as both a defense of the
technology and a confirmation that it would hit the streets. "Coca-Cola
is a product whose utility varies from moment to moment," he said. "In a
final summer championship, when people meet in a stadium to have fun,
the utility of a cold Coca-Cola is very high. So it is fair that it
should be more expensive. The machine will simply make this process
automatic."A Coke spokesman says the remarks were taken out of context. Though
the company had tested the technology in a lab, it never had an
intention of introducing it, the spokesman says, and bottlers confirm
this. Nonetheless, the CEO's answer created a flap, seeming to cast the
company as one that wasn't customer-friendly.In October, directors who had long wanted Mr. Ivester to appoint a
No. 2 were relieved when he outlined plans to reduce the number of
executives reporting to him to six from 16. The new arrangement would
free the CEO from overseeing employee benefits, corporate aircraft and
many other mundane issues. Mr. Ivester told directors he would seek
their approval at the next board meeting in mid-December.Why wait? they replied. "I appreciate your support. Let's go," Mr.
Ivester told the board, according to one person.The board apparently failed to notice one ramification: Mr. Ivester
was about to push Mr. Ware, the executive overseeing the Africa
business, down a rung. He was among the 10 who would no longer report to
the CEO. When Mr. Ware then announced his retirement, "there was a lot
of criticism in the company about why it was necessary to make Carl lose
so much face, and what that meant about Doug's judgment," says a person
close to the situation.As these controversies unfolded, one person says, Mr. Ivester
occasionally talked of stepping down, wondering aloud if he was the
right man for the job. Mr. Ivester's mother -- who says she is "elated"
that he has given up the ultrastressful job -- says he had sometimes
talked about leaving. A Coke spokesman, though, says he never heard Mr.
Ivester express any desire to leave.The end came on Dec. 6, when Mr. Ivester announced that he will
voluntarily leave one of the most prestigious jobs in business next
April, after only 2 1/2 years, to give someone else a chance to try to
do it better. Says a person close to the board, "It was like a pitcher
who wasn't throwing any strikes and the bases are loaded. He finally
took himself out of the game."---Carrick Mollenkamp contributed to this article.---

Coca-Cola CEO Ivester to End Troubled Reign - latimes

YOU ARE HERE: LAT Home→Collections→ResignationsCoca-Cola CEO Ivester to End Troubled ReignBeverages: Resignation surprises investors, sending stock tumbling. Company veteran is named successor.December 07, 1999|GREG JOHNSON | TIMES STAFF WRITER


Coca-Cola Co.'s shares slumped more than 5% on Monday after the world's largest beverage company announced unexpectedly that Chairman and Chief Executive M. Douglas Ivester would resign in April after less than 2 1/2 years on the job.Ivester's resignation sparked immediate questions about whether the 52-year-old executive was opting out of the top job for personal reasons or whether he was being eased out by a board of directors upset with a high-profile series of operating missteps.Board members on Sunday named Douglas N. Daft, a 30-year Coke veteran credited with helping strengthen Coke's presence in Asia, as president and chief operating officer. Daft, 56, will be elected chairman and CEO after Ivester's retirement in April, according to the company.Ivester's departure marks the end of a brief chapter in the company's 113-year history, one plagued by setbacks in Europe and sluggish volume growth. Ivester had been handpicked to succeed former Coke Chairman Roberto Goizueta, who died of cancer in October 1997.A Coke spokesman said that Ivester called the special meeting Sunday at which he announced his plan to retire after the company's annual shareholder meeting in April. Several beverage industry watchers said the timing of Ivester's departure was unusual because the company seemed to have gotten its global act together."This really was a surprise," said Gary Hemphill, vice president of New York-based Beverage Marketing Corp. "While 1999 was an extremely trying year, [the resignation] is not something that we anticipated."Coke's stock, which has been struggling to rebound this year, fell $3.72 to $64.61 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday.Ivester, in a prepared statement, said it was "time for me to move on to the next stage of my life, and therefore, to put into place an orderly transition for this great company." In a letter to employees, Ivester said he had "come to believe our company will now best be served by fresh leadership that will bring its own energy to bear."Coca-Cola board member James B. Williams said in a statement that the board "has reluctantly accepted" the decision by Ivester, who will serve as a consultant.Some industry insiders questioned whether Ivester was the right executive to lead a company best known for its marketing prowess."Doug Ivester has had a bungled tenure in the company," said former Coke marketing head Peter Sealey, now a consultant and an adjunct marketing professor at UC Berkeley. Sealey, who was fired by Ivester in 1993, maintained that Coke's chairman "made a series of mistakes, and I think at a certain point, the board finally lost confidence and gave up on him."Shortly after Ivester took over as chairman, the company's overseas sales stalled in the wake of an Asian economic collapse and worldwide currency fluctuations. Coke's image was sullied--and Ivester's own reputation was damaged--last summer when 250 Europeans reported falling ill after drinking Coke products. Critics contend that Ivester should have maintained a higher profile in dealing with the product contamination incident.Ivester's plan to build revenue by acquisitions was derailed this past year when European regulators blocked Coke's bid for France's Orangina brand soda on antitrust grounds and forced the company to scale back a planned acquisition of Cadbury Schweppes' soft drink business.At the same time, Coke was being sued by former and current employees who alleged racial discrimination at the company's Atlanta headquarters.Still, analysts believed the outlook for Coke was positive. Merrill Lynch & Co. analyst Douglas Lane in November declared Coke "our top pick for 2000 as global gets good again. Underlying fundamentals are improving, and the stock's relative price-earnings ratio is at a 10-year low."But, observers say, Coke investors--represented by such well-known directors as Herbert A. Allen, Warren E. Buffett and Peter V. Ueberroth--might not have been willing to wait for Ivester to manage a return to Coke's traditional 7% to 8% annual volume growth. Coke's global volume grew 3% in the third quarter over the previous year and dropped 2% in the second quarter, mostly due to the European health scare.Ivester joined Coca-Cola in 1979. He was named chief financial officer in 1985 and soon became a trusted lieutenant for Goizueta, who was recognized as one of the world's most effective business leaders. Goizueta went against the grain--albeit with the board's blessing--by choosing the finance executive to run a company best known for its marketing. John Sicher, editor of Beverage Digest, a Bedford Hills, N.Y.-based newsletter, suggested that the market's dramatic reaction to word of Ivester's departure "was driven more by surprise, by the reaction to change, than anything to do with Doug Daft, who's a solid guy, a solid executive who gets much of the credit for building Coke sales in Asia, and who's well-regarded by bottlers."1 | 2 |  Next
