IN THE MATTER OF THE SECURITIES LEGISLATION OF ONTARIO (the "Jurisdiction") AND IN THE MATTER OF THE PROCESS FOR EXEMPTIVE RELIEF APPLICATIONS IN MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS AND IN THE MATTER OF ANGELLIST, LLC ("AngelList") and ANGELLIST ADVISORS, LLC ("ALA", collectively with AngelList, the "Filers")
DECISION
Background
The Filers operate an online platform that offers a number of services to start-up businesses that operate primarily in the technology sector (Start-ups), including services to facilitate venture capital and angel investing in Start-ups that meet certain criteria. All investors on the platform must qualify as an accredited investor (as defined in Canadian securities legislation) (Accredited Investors) and must also have prior experience in venture capital and angel investing, such that they have an understanding of the risks of investing in Start-ups through the platform.
In conjunction with ALA's application for registration in all of the provinces of Canada, ALA is seeking relief from certain requirements under the securities legislation of the Jurisdiction of the principal regulator (the Legislation). This decision (the Decision) has been considered in the context of the CSA Regulatory Sandbox (as defined below) initiative and is made on a time-limited, test case basis. This Decision is based on the unique facts and circumstances of the Filers.
ALA is currently registered in Ontario as a restricted dealer. The Filers previously applied for and received exemptive relief from the prospectus requirement in a decision of the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) (the Prior Commission Decision) and from certain registrant obligations in a decision of the Director (the Prior Director Decision) dated October 24, 2016 (together, the Prior Ontario decision) on terms substantially similar to this Decision.
Relief from registrant obligations

Representations
This Decision is based on the following facts represented by the Filers:

The Filers
3. ALA is registered as a restricted dealer in Ontario and has applied for registration as a restricted dealer in each other province of Canada.
4. ALA is a limited liability company formed under the laws of the state of Delaware. ALA is a subsidiary of AngelList, a limited liability company formed under the laws of the state of Delaware. A minority interest in ALA is held by AngelList EI, LLC (which is wholly-owned by employees of ALA or ALA's affiliates). The head offices of the Filers are in San Francisco, California, United States of America.
5. ALA is an "exempt reporting adviser" in the U.S. ALA relies on an exemption from SEC investment adviser registration requirements under sections 203(l) [venture capital fund adviser exemption] of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and related rules. As an exempt reporting adviser, ALA is subject to oversight by the SEC, including the requirement to pay fees to the SEC, to report annually certain information to the SEC and to have policies regarding the dissemination of material, non-public information and anti-fraud measures. ALA is also subject to review by the SEC.
6. The Filers are not registered as broker-dealers with the SEC under U.S. federal securities laws. The Filers rely on a no action letter issued to them by the SEC dated March 28, 2013 regarding the scope of their permitted activities in the U.S. without registering as broker-dealers in accordance with section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Filers also rely on the no action letter issued to FundersClub Inc. and FundersClub Management LLC by the SEC dated March 26, 2013 with respect to their activities as an exempt reporting adviser. The Filers also rely on section 201(c) of the JOBS Act.
7. AngelList Ltd., an affiliate of the Filers, is authorized by the Financial Conduct Authority to carry on the following limited regulated activities in the United Kingdom: arranging (bringing about) deals in investments, dealing in investments as agent, and making arrangements with a view to transactions in investments. Through a passport process, AngelList Ltd. is permitted to carry out its permitted activities to countries in the European Economic Area.
8. The Filers wish to offer certain of the services (as described below) to issuers and investors in Canada. As these services will involve the facilitation of trades in securities of issuers to Quality Investors for the purposes of venture capital and angel investing, ALA is registered as a restricted dealer in Ontario and wishes to become registered as a restricted dealer in each other province of Canada.
9. The Filers are seeking the Prospectus Relief Sought and the Registrant Obligations Relief Sought to allow Quality Investors and issuers resident in other Canadian provinces to access the Restricted Services (as defined below).
10. The Filers are not in default of securities legislation in any jurisdiction of Canada, subject to the matter to which this Decision relates. The Filers are in compliance in all material respects with U.S. and U.K. securities laws.
11. The Filers do not currently prepare financial statements that are audited. During the two year period to which this Decision relates, the Filers will be working towards providing the Principal Regulator with annual financial statements audited in accordance with U.S. generally acceptable accounting principles and standards.
Services
Public Services
12. AngelList operates an online networking website (the Platform) that allows start-ups, accelerators, incubators, angel investors and other individuals in the start-up sector (together, the Participants) to connect with each other and to raise their profile in the start-up community. The Platform is primarily aimed at technology or technology-enabled Start-ups.
13. Any Participant can post a profile on the Platform that contains general information about itself, including, as applicable, its products or services, and its management team (a Profile). A Profile is publicly available to anyone accessing the Platform. A Start-up may also post confidential information and grant access only to certain Participants.
14. After setting up a Profile, a Participant may request a connection by visiting another Participant's profile (the Connection Services). AngelList will confirm the relationship between the Participants. A verified connection is required in order for a Participant to send other Participants a message or request an introduction to other Participant's connections.
15. Any Start-up can also post job openings on the Platform and seek applicants from Participants on the Platform for such job openings (the Recruiting Services) (together with the Connection Services, the Public Services).
Restricted Area and Restricted Services
16. The Platform includes a password protected area (the restricted area). Participants must apply to enter the restricted area, and ALA only permits Accredited Investors to enter the restricted area.
17. Once Participants have been approved for access to the restricted area, they may further apply to access certain services, which are referred to below as Restricted Services. ALA only permits Quality Investors to access the Restricted Services. Based on the Filers' experience in the United States, approximately 30% of U.S. accredited investors that apply to access the Restricted Services meet ALA's Quality Investor standard and are approved to use the Restricted Services.
18. The Restricted Services consist of the following:

a. ALA allows both Start-ups and Lead Investors (as defined below) the ability to raise money for a specific Start-up by forming a syndicate of investors through the Platform (the Syndicate Services).
b. ALA provides a transaction update email to Quality Investors. ALA has an algorithm that uses objective criteria to identify Start-ups seeking to raise capital from a syndicate of investors and provides a list of these Start-ups to Quality Investors who request this information.
c. ALA offers a program for Quality Investors who plan to invest over USD$600,000 through the Platform (the Professional Investor Program). Under this program, ALA introduces these Quality Investors to Start-ups that do not wish to make it known publicly that they are raising capital through a syndicate.

19. In the U.S., accredited investors who are not Quality Investors may invest in diversified funds created by ALA (referred to as Funds) that invest in a wide variety of syndicates on the Platform. ALA is seeking registration only as a restricted dealer. ALA may, at a later date, wish to offer Canadian investors the opportunity to invest in the Funds. Prior to allowing Canadian investors the opportunity to invest in the Funds, ALA will apply for and obtain registration as required by the Principal Regulator and regulators in other Canadian jurisdictions.
Services to be Offered in Canada
20. AngelList proposes to make the Public Services available to participants.
21. ALA proposes to make the Syndicate Services available to:

a. Start-ups and Lead Investors (described below), and
b. Quality Investors,

subject to certain restrictions set out below.
22. ALA will make the Professional Investor Program available to Quality Investors who qualify as a "permitted client" as defined in section 1.1 of NI 31-103.
Syndicate Services
23. Syndicates can be formed by the founder or management of a Start-up itself or by an investor who is investing in a single Start-up, who wishes to make this investment opportunity available to other investors (co-investors) on the same terms and conditions, and who has been reviewed and approved by ALA as described in paragraphs 62 to 69 (a Lead Investor). Each syndicate only invests in securities of a single Start-up (a syndicate).
24. A Start-up or Lead Investor requests approval from ALA to establish the syndicate.
25. ALA reviews the request from the Start-up or Lead Investor and determines whether to allow the Start-up or Lead Investor to form a syndicate. In reviewing a request to form a syndicate, ALA reviews the Start-up for the following features:

a. Whether the Start-up is a growth-oriented technology or technology-enabled company that has the potential to develop into a large stand-alone business;
b. Whether the Start-up is focused on a product or service that will provide social, economic or environmental benefits or that is likely to meet a strong market demand; and
c. Whether, in ALA's opinion, the Start-up is likely to appeal to Quality Investors.

26. ALA will not permit reporting issuers or any public company in any other jurisdiction to form a syndicate on the Platform.
27. If ALA grants approval to form a syndicate, the Start-up or the Lead Investor, as applicable, completes and posts an investor note (the investor note) about the syndicate on the restricted area of the Platform. The investor note contains factual information about the proposed capital raise, the Start-up to be invested in, any co-investors, the risks associated with investing in the Start-up, past financing of the Start-up, and other key investment terms and conditions.
28. Interested Quality Investors may conduct due diligence on the Lead Investor and/or the Start-up. Quality Investors use their own judgement whether to invest in a syndicate.
29. Neither ALA nor the Lead Investor nor the Start-up:

a. provide specific recommendations or advice to particular Quality Investors about the suitability of an investment in a Start-up through an SPE (as defined below); or
b. recommend or solicit any particular purchase or sale by a Quality Investor of an SPE's (as defined below) securities.

30. Interested Quality Investors may submit non-binding requests for additional information through the Platform to either the Start-up or Lead Investor about the Start-up that is being syndicated.
31. If there is sufficient interest to proceed with closing a syndicate investment, ALA establishes a special purpose entity (SPE) to accept the funds from committed investors and to acquire the Start-up's securities. The SPE formed to invest in the Start-up is required under U.S. securities law to have 99 or fewer investors. For investments in Eligible Canadian Start-ups, for tax reasons Canadian investors may be aggregated into a parallel Canadian SPE. The parallel Canadian SPE will otherwise invest on identical terms and conditions to a standard SPE.
32. ALA has engaged an arms' length consulting and fund administration firm (the SPE Manager) to provide administrative services in relation to the SPEs. On behalf of ALA, the SPE Manager handles the formation and organization of each SPE, certain closing procedures for the syndicate investments, securities filings, ongoing administration, and winding up the SPE where applicable.
33. The first time a Quality Investor invests with a syndicate, prior to closing of that syndicate, the Quality Investor is asked to confirm his or her interest in investing in Start-ups generally, and to acknowledge a series of risk warnings including warnings as to risk of total loss of the investment, illiquidity of the securities and dilution risk, and the need for the Quality Investor to conduct his or her own due diligence on the Start-up. Detailed risk warning acknowledgements are not obtained from Quality Investors on subsequent investments; however, certain risks are acknowledged upon each Quality Investor's acceptance of the provisions of the Closing Documents (as defined below).
34. For each syndicate, prior to closing that syndicate, the Quality Investor is also asked to reconfirm its accredited investor status. If a Quality Investor indicates that its status has changed such that it is no longer an accredited investor, the investor is not permitted to invest with the syndicate and is not permitted to access the restricted area of the Platform. Quality Investors electronically agree to and sign the SPE's closing documents on the Platform and are provided with wire instructions for their investment amounts.
35. After a Quality Investor commits to making an investment with a syndicate, the Quality Investor receives the following documents: the SPE's operating or limited partnership agreement, the SPE's private placement memorandum, the subscription or purchase agreement for the purchase of securities of the SPE, an investor statement (which is a screen confirming how much the Quality Investor invested in the SPE and the corresponding investment by the SPE in the Start-up as of the specific date), a signature certificate (which is a screen showing the investor that documents have been digitally signed and a digital fingerprint provided for security reasons) and the investor note (collectively, the Closing Documents). The SPE Manager will retain the Closing Documents for eight years.
36. Either the Filers or SPE Manager will deliver electronically to the securities regulatory authority of each jurisdiction of Canada where a distribution occurs, any of the Closing Documents that constitute an offering memorandum (as defined under the Legislation). The Filers will inform the Start-up that the Start-up must deliver electronically to the securities regulatory authority of each jurisdiction of Canada where a distribution occurs a copy of any document that constitutes an offering memorandum (as defined under the Legislation) that has not already been delivered by the Filers or SPE Manager.
37. Prior to closing a syndicate, ALA uses a third party service (such as Blockscore or Jumio) to verify the identity of each Quality Investor. ALA also runs anti-money laundering and terrorist financing checks. The verification process and anti-money laundering and terrorist financing checks are performed on both individual and non-individual Quality Investors (entities). For non-individual Quality Investors, the Filers contact the investor by email to determine the identity of the individual principal(s) of the Quality Investor. AML and terrorist financing checks are performed through a politically exposed person (PEP) list and/or Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) list search. Similar verification processes and checks will be performed for Canadian investors.
38. ALA conducts a review of each Start-up's constating documents and Closing Documents to ensure they are consistent with the information in the Profile and the investor note, the results of any background checks and any accompanying materials or information provided to it by an investor, the Lead Investor and/or the Start-up and determines if the Closing Documents are complete, consistent and not misleading. If it appears to ALA that the Closing Documents are incomplete, inconsistent or misleading, ALA will require the Closing Documents to be corrected, made complete, or clarified.
39. Neither the Filers nor the SPE holds, handles or controls any investor or Start-up funds. The funds are held by and deposited in a single trust account that has been established by a FDIC-member U.S. bank in the name of the bank for the benefit of investors investing through the Platform. The Filers do not intermingle their own monies in this account.
40. Once all expected funds have been received by the bank, the bank notifies ALA. ALA then issues advice to the bank to initiate funds transfer to the Start-up.
41. All Quality Investors in the syndicate are e-mailed to inform them that the SPE investment, and the investment by the SPE in the Start-up, is finalized and to provide them with a copy of the final Closing Documents.
42. The Filers will utilize the same bank and procedures for investments in Eligible Canadian Start-ups completed on the Platform. Although initially the Platform will only support transactions denominated in U.S. dollars, the Filers plan to support transactions in Canadian dollars and utilize Canadian banking services as required for transactions in Canadian dollars.
43. Quality Investors have access to an individual account on the Platform where they may view information about the transaction and access copies of the Closing Documents. The Closing Documents will be retained and made available to Quality Investors through the Platform for at least eight years.
44. For their role in a syndicate, ALA and the Lead Investor will only receive compensation equal to a portion of the increase in value, if any, of the investment as calculated at the termination of the investment in the SPE (the Carried Interest), and will not receive any transaction-based compensation. None of the Filers, the Lead Investor, nor any of their officers or directors receive any other form of commission or transaction-based compensation related to the Restricted Services, including the Syndicate Services.
45. ALA requires that each investor in a syndicate pay a portion of the costs associated with the closing of the syndicate investment (such as legal fees) in proportion to the investor's investment.
46. Neither the syndicate nor the SPE borrows funds from investors or the public for any reason. The syndicate, the SPE and the Filers do not loan money or extend margin to investors that wish to invest in a Start-up as part of a syndicate.
47. The Filers do not facilitate any secondary trading of previously issued securities, whether originally issued to the members of a syndicate or otherwise.
48. From the date of the OSC decision to the date of this Decision, seven Start-ups have raised capital from a syndicate on the platform in reliance on the Prior Ontario Decision. The Filers are in compliance with all of the terms and conditions of the Prior Ontario Decision.
Professional Investor Program
49. ALA is involved with a number of syndicates in which the Start-up does not wish to disclose publicly that it is seeking funding (the Private Syndicates).
50. These Private Syndicates are only made available to Quality Investors who:

a. intend to invest over USD$600,000 in syndicates through the Platform;
b. invest, on average, at least USD$50,000 per month in syndicates;
c. sign a non-disclosure agreement with ALA; and
d. are able to make investment decisions in a timely manner.

51. ALA has automated functionality that matches between one to five Private Syndicates with the Quality Investor's selected objective criteria, based on filters that the Quality Investor selected when the Quality Investor signed up for the Professional Investor Program.
52. ALA provides the list of Private Syndicates to the Quality Investor.
53. The Quality Investor conducts its own due diligence on the Start-up of the Private Syndicate.
54. The Quality Investor will make its own decision as to which Private Syndicate to invest in. The same investment procedures that are used for a typical syndicate also apply to a Private Syndicate.
55. There are no fees for participating in the Professional Investor Program.
Participants
Investors
56. When opening an account with AngelList, each investor provides the Filers with the following information:

a. The category of accredited investor the investor meets, which for Canadian investors will correspond to the definition of accredited investor in Canadian securities legislation;
b. The amount the investor has budgeted for investing in Start-ups on the Platform;
c. The investor's net worth band (e.g., > $1 million, > $2 million, > $5 million, with currency being denominated in U.S. dollars). For Canadian investors, bands will be denominated in Canadian dollars;
d. The proportion of the investor's net worth that the investor's budget for investing in Start-ups represents; and
e. The investor's experience in investing in Start-ups or working for or with private equity firms and venture capital firms and the investor's connection to other investors and Start-ups on the Platform.

The above-listed information is retained on the Platform by the Filers for 8 years.
57. In addition to providing the information in paragraph 56, each investor acknowledges the following risks associated with investing in Start-ups generally when signing up to access the Public Services and Restricted Services:

a. Risk of loss of an investor's entire investment in a Start-up;
b. Illiquidity risk;
c. No due diligence of a Start-up is conducted by the Filers;
d. Dilution risk;
e. Risk of change in the Start-up's plans, markets and products; and
f. No recommendation or advice is provided by the Filers to the investor.

In addition:

g. Prior to making an investment, the investor must acknowledge that it will receive limited or no initial or ongoing information about the investment; and
h. The investor note will disclose any conflicts of interest that may exist.

The above-listed information is retained on the Platform or by ALA for 8 years.
58. ALA assesses each investor's experience and knowledge with respect to venture capital and angel investing based upon the following information:

a. The investor's previous venture capital and angel investments and the size of those investments (as declared by the investor);
b. The investor's connections to other founders and investors, and ALA's assessment of those founders and investors; and
c. ALA's judgement about an investor's previous venture capital and angel investing experience with other top investors and the investor's reputation.

59. Using a computer algorithm, ALA rates each investor on a scale of one to ten based on the information provided by the investor (a Quality Investor Score). Only investors with a Quality Investor Score of at least 6.5 out of 10 are approved by ALA as Quality Investors. In order to access the Restricted Services an investor must first be approved as a Quality Investor.
60. ALA does not initially approve an investor if the investor has an initial Quality Investor Score of less than 6.5 out of 10 or if the investor has indicated that he or she plans to invest more than 9% of his or her net worth in Start-ups. ALA may conduct a further review of these investors who are not initially approved. If ALA's manual review of the investor discloses information which would materially increase the investor's Quality Investor Score (for example, the investor has significant venture capital or angel investing experience that was not reflected on its profile on the Platform), the investor may be approved as a Quality Investor and permitted to invest in syndicates through the Platform.
61. In Canada, Accredited Investors that are not Quality Investors will not be permitted to invest as part of a syndicate through the Platform and will not be permitted access to the Restricted Services.
Lead Investors
62. Only Accredited Investors can apply to be Lead Investors. ALA retains the right and full discretion to determine whether a person may act as a Lead Investor.
63. ALA reviews a potential Lead Investor for previous experience related to venture capital and angel investing by reviewing the Lead Investor's activity on relevant social media and other websites (such as Crunchbase and Google).
64. ALA also reviews references provided by each Lead Investor related to the Lead Investor's prior Start-up investments.
65. If ALA is not satisfied that a Lead Investor has sufficient knowledge and experience related to Start-up and/or venture capital investing, ALA will also consider whether there is a Credible Investor involved in the syndicate and who is investing on the same terms and conditions as the investors in the syndicate.
66. Where ALA approves a Lead Investor to form a syndicate, ALA requires each Lead Investor to sign an agreement with ALA. For so long as the Lead Investor has an interest in the Start-up that the Lead Investor has syndicated, this agreement requires, among other things, the Lead Investor:

a. To assist ALA and the SPE Manager as necessary to allow ALA and the SPE Manager to comply with applicable regulatory requirements pertaining to the syndicate and the investment in the Start-up,
b. To provide ALA with information about the Start-up as required by ALA or the SPE Manager to service the syndicate, and
c. To provide ALA with written notice of certain events, including subsequent investment in the Start-up by the Lead Investor, sale or transfer of the Lead Investor's securities in the Start-up, and how the Lead Investor has voted.

67. Lead Investors are required to disclose all conflicts of interest to ALA and to potential Quality Investors. Conflicts of interest that must be disclosed include whether the Lead Investor invested in previous round of financing by the Start-up, is an employee or officer of the Start-up, or has family members working at the Start-up, any other circumstances judged by ALA to constitute conflicts or potential conflicts.
68. The Lead Investor invests either directly with the Start-up or alongside other investors in the syndicate on the same terms and conditions as the investors in the syndicate.
69. Prior to the closing of the syndicate, ALA conducts a background check on the Lead Investor (through a third party service provider), including criminal record, securities regulatory, AML, terrorist financing, and economic and political sanctions watch-lists.
Start-ups
70. ALA conducts background checks on the Start-up and each officer and director of the Start-up (through a third party service provider) before the close of a syndicate.
71. The background checks conducted by ALA include: criminal record, securities regulatory, AML, terrorist financing, and economic and political sanctions watch-lists.
72. ALA does not permit a syndicate to close, if any of the Start-up, its president or chief executive officer has pled guilty to or has been found guilty of an offence related to or has entered into a settlement agreement in a matter that involved fraud or securities violations or if the Start-up is bankrupt.
Additional Requirements
73. Canadian investors will only be permitted to invest in a Start-up that seeks to raise capital through a syndicate on the Platform in one of the following circumstances:

a. Permitted Clients. Canadian investors who qualify as permitted clients (as defined in section 1.1 of NI 31-103) and who waive the requirement for ALA to conduct a suitability assessment, in accordance with subsection 13.3(4) of NI 31-103, may invest in any syndicate on the Platform and participate in the Professional Investor Program.
b. The Start-up is participating in or within the past 24 months has successfully completed an Approved Incubator Program. Canadian Quality Investors may invest in syndicates where the Start-up is an Eligible Canadian Start-up that is participating in or has successfully completed an Approved Incubator Program.
c. Other Start-ups -- Subject to limits on the number of Canadian Quality Investors. Over the two-year period that this Decision relates to, up to a maximum of 1000 Canadian Quality Investors may invest with one or more syndicates that meet one of the following criteria:

i. The founder of the Start-up is an Experienced Founder.
ii. Either the Lead Investor of the syndicate or at least one investor in the Start-up that the syndicate is investing in, other than the Lead Investor, is a Credible Investor, and the syndicate is investing in the Start-up on the same terms and conditions as the Credible Investor.
iii. The Start-up has, within the previous three years, received funding from a federal, state, provincial or territorial government program that supports small business or Start-ups as part of its mandate, such as Business Development Bank of Canada, BDC Capital, the Investment Accelerator Fund, Ontario Centres of Excellence, the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario and Investissement Québec.

The 1000 Canadian Quality Investors limit is measured from the period commencing on the date of the OSC decision and ending on the expiry of this Decision.

4. The Filers ensure that securities are only distributed to investors in Canada in accordance with the terms, conditions, restrictions and requirements applicable to the accredited investor exemption as set out in Canadian securities legislation, except the requirements in subsections 2.3(6) and (7)) of NI 45-106 to obtain and retain a signed risk acknowledgement in the prescribed form.
5. For each distribution, either ALA, or the SPE Manager on behalf of ALA, will file a completed Form 45-106F1 Report of Exempt Distribution (Form 45-106F1) in accordance with Part 6 of NI 45-106 within 10 days of the date of the distribution and will reference the accredited investor exemption as set out in section 2.3 of NI 45-106 as the "Exemption relied on" in Schedule 1 of Form 45-106F1.
6. For each distribution by the SPE, if an offering memorandum (as defined under the Legislation) is provided by the SPE to investors resident in a jurisdiction of Canada, either ALA or the SPE Manager will deliver to the securities regulatory authority of each jurisdiction of Canada where the distribution occurs, a copy of the offering memorandum, or any amendment to a previously delivered offering memorandum, within 10 days of the date of the distribution.
7. For each distribution by the SPE made in reliance on this Decision, if an offering memorandum (as defined under the Legislation) is provided by the SPE to investors resident in a jurisdiction of Canada, ALA will ensure that the SPE provides to investors resident in a jurisdiction of Canada a contractual right of action against the SPE for rescission or damages that:

a. Is available to an investor who purchases a security offered by the offering memorandum during the period of distribution, if the offering memorandum contains a misrepresentation, without regard to whether the purchaser relied on the misrepresentation
b. Is enforceable by the investor delivering notice to the SPE

(i) In the case of an action for rescission, within 180 days after the date of the transaction that gave rise to the cause of action, or
(ii) In the case of an action for damages, before the earlier of

(A) 180 days after the investor first had knowledge of the facts giving rise to the cause of action, or
(B) three years after the date of the transaction that gave rise to the cause of action


c. Is subject to the defence that the investor had knowledge of the misrepresentation
d. In the case of an action for damages, provides that the amount recoverable

(i) Must not exceed the price at which the security was offered, and
(ii) Does not include all or any part of the damages that the SPE proves does not represent the depreciation in value of the security resulting from the misrepresentation, and

e. Is in addition to, and does not detract from, any other right of the purchaser.

8. The first trade in securities distributed in reliance on this Decision will be deemed to be a distribution that is subject to section 2.5 of National Instrument 45-102 Resale of Securities.
9. The Filers ensure that

a. The accredited investor status of each investor is verified when the investor first signs up to the Platform and verified again when the investor makes any investment through the Platform, and
b. Upon account opening, the investor acknowledges the risks as described above in paragraphs 56 and 57.

10. The Filers limit access to the Restricted Services to Quality Investors.
11. The Filers will immediately remove an investor from being able to access the Restricted Services if it knows or suspects that the investor is not an accredited investor (as defined in section 73.3(1) of the Act and NI 45-106).
12. The Filers ensure that Canadian investors invest in syndicates through the Platform in accordance with paragraph 73.
13. The Approved Incubator Programs are NEXT Canada (previously known as The Next 36), Creative Destruction Lab, York Entrepreneurship Development Institute's (YEDI) Incubator Track, Ontario Centres of Excellence's (OCE) Market Readiness Program and any other Approved Incubator Program from time to time.
14. ALA notifies the Principal Regulator in writing at least 30 days prior to any material change in either Filers' business operations or business model, including any material addition to or material modification to the Restricted Services.
15. The Filers notify the Principal Regulator promptly in writing of any regulatory action, criminal charges, or material civil actions initiated after the date of this Decision in respect of the Filers or any specified affiliate (as defined in Form 33-109F6 Firm Registration) of the Filers.

1. The Filers comply with the terms and conditions of the Decision with respect to the Prospectus Relief Sought.
2. Unless otherwise exempted by a further decision of the Principal Regulator, ALA complies with all of the terms, conditions, restrictions and requirements applicable to a registered dealer and to a registered individual under Canadian securities laws, including the Act and NI 31-103, and any other terms, conditions, restrictions or requirements imposed by a securities regulatory authority or regulator on ALA.
3. The Filers will deal fairly, honestly and in good faith with Participants.
4. The Filers, any representatives of the Filers, any Lead Investors, and any Start-ups do not provide recommendations or advice to any investor or prospective investor on the Platform.
5. The Filers ensure Lead Investors of a syndicate invest in the Start-up on the same terms and conditions as the syndicate.
6. The Filers ensure that any Start-up that raises capital in Canada through the Platform is not an investment fund and not a reporting issuer.

11. ALA will disclose any conflicts of interest as described in paragraph 67 to investors in the syndicate.
12. The Filers will immediately remove a Start-up from the Platform, and the posting of any syndicate in relation to such Start-up, if:

a. Either Filer makes a good faith determination that the business of the Start-up may not be conducted with integrity because of the past or current conduct of the Start-up or of the Start-up's directors, executive officers or promoters; and
b. Either Filer becomes aware that the Start-up is not complying with applicable securities legislation.

13. The Filers will immediately remove any Participant from the Platform or prohibit any person or company from accessing the restricted area of the Platform at the request of the Principal Regulator.
14. In addition to any other reporting required by law, including Form 45-106F1 Report of Exempt Distribution, the Filers provide the following information to the Principal Regulator on a quarterly basis:

a. The name of each Start-up that has raised capital in Canada through a syndicate on the Platform, the name of the associated SPE(s), whether the Start-up is an Eligible Canadian Start-up and the name of the Approved Incubator Program, and the total amount raised by the Start-up, and
b. The number of Canadian Accredited Investors that applied during the quarter to be approved as Quality Investors and the number who were approved by ALA as Quality Investors.

15. This Decision shall expire two years after the date of the Decision.
16. This Decision may be amended by the Principal Regulator from time to time upon prior written notice to the Filer.

AngelList Deals Will Soon Be Private (and Other Updates You’ll Want to Know)



Earlier this week, we sat down with Naval Ravikant, cofounder of five-year-old AngelList, a popular platform that matches startups with early-stage investors. Three million people, including 50,000 accredited investors, have created profiles on AngelList since its founding, and AngelList now uses that information to pair startups with capital, pair startup employees with employers and, more newly, pair startups with customers.
It’s become a big business, as well as a confusing one, Ravikant readily admits. And while we can’t report on one interesting new, performance-related wrinkle that’s coming soon, he walked us through many other stats and initiatives. Our chat has been edited for length and clarity.
TC: A few years ago, AngelList introduced Syndicates, essentially pop-up funds that allow angel investors to syndicate their investments in exchange for some upside. It was fairly transparent at the outset, but that’s been changing. Why?
NR: Seventy-five percent of the deals are now private, up from 45 percent a year ago. It’ll be default private soon because a lot of the hot deals tend to be private. Also, that public-private dichotomy is always really hard for entrepreneurs [in fundraising mode] to figure out, so they start associating our brand [with a place to share information publicly to accredited investors], which is a negative, so they don’t want to go on here. We might take a hit on liquidity by making the default private, but at the end of the day, it’s all about getting the high-quality companies.
TC: An investor, Gil Penchina, has built a big business on the platform. Are more leads starting to see a kind of of network effect?
NR: Gil is a unique case. He’s the one who’s always breaking the system. We’re more catering to operator-angels, meaning people who have operating jobs, or VPs at big companies or who’ve started their own startups. It’s people who aren’t professional VCs but who do four to six deals a year, investing in alumni and people they know.
TC: How many of them close a deal each month? And are the investors on the platform mostly based in Silicon Valley?
NR: We had 55 deals led by 41 leads close in June; we had 44 deals led by 38 leads close in July. The average for most leads on the platform is a couple of deals per year. As for demographics, I’d say over half [the people who lead deals on the platform] are in Silicon Valley.
TC: You’d said publicly somewhere that you were getting into special purpose vehicles, which come together quickly to invest in a single, later-stage company. Why would someone create an SPV on the platform?

Naval Ravikant on China Money into Silicon Valley: This Trickle Could Become a Tsunami



AngelList, the online platform that matches startups with early-stage investors, has grown by leaps and bounds since its 2010 founding — and so have its ambitions. In fact, the company, which already bills itself as both the biggest seed-stage firm in the world, and the world’s largest hiring platform for startups, also aims to become the biggest venture fund in the world.
Earlier this week, we sat down with cofounder Naval Ravikant at the firm’s swanky new, three-story digs in San Francisco’s Jackson Square, and as workmen shifted planks around the nearly completed ground-floor level, Ravikant caught us up to speed on a many aspects of what’s happening at AngelList.
We’ll have more on his overarching vision tomorrow. Today, we’re publishing a part of our conversation that centered one of the biggest drivers of AngelList’s current growth: the $400 million that CSC Group — one of the biggest private equity funds in China — committed to invest through AngelList roughly 10 months ago. (The WSJ billed it as the “largest single pool of funds devoted to early-stage startups—ever.”)
Ravikant shared how that relationship is evolving, and why he thinks CSC’s money is just the tip of the iceberg for both AngelList and Silicon Valley more broadly. Our chat has been edited for length and clarity.
TC: Let’s start at the beginning. Who is managing this $400 million from CSC?
NR: It’s a fund called CSC Upshot that’s managed by CSC’s Veronica Wu, who used to be a VP at Tesla Motors in Beijing; Ming Yeh, who’d spent the previous six years or so as a managing director at [Silicon Valley Bank] in Shanghai; and Tom Cole, a former partner at Trinity Ventures.
TC: How much have they invested in startups on AngelList so far?
NR: They’re on track to invest between $25 million and $40 million this year, with an average check size of $100,000.
TC: Wow, that’s quite a pace. How does the decision-making process work?
NR: We’ve built a dashboard for fund management, and all these managers [have signed nondisclosure agreements] so they get to see literally hundreds and hundreds of deals on AngelList. And they chat with each other and [with the lead investor’s approval], if enough people vote yes, the deal gets done.

Naval Ravikant on AngelList’s 2015 Game Plan
Last week, at StrictlyVC’s inaugural event, AngelList cofounder Naval Ravikant joked about the trials and tribulations of entrepreneurship. He also gave those gathered a comprehensive look at the near-term future of AngelList, a fast-moving, 22-person, San Francisco-based company that’s perhaps become best-known for its pop-up venture funds called Syndicates that allow angel investors to syndicate investments themselves. Indeed, according to Ravikant, more than 243 companies raised $104 million through the platform last year, making AngelList the “largest seed fund in the world.” And AngelList is hoping to double or triple those numbers this year.
More from our chat that evening, edited for length, here.
You say of the $104 million that your 15-month-old Syndicates program funneled toward startups last year, $7 million, or just less than 7 percent, was from institutions. Are you happy with that number?
No. [Laughs.] Obviously, institutional investors come later to the game. They need more certainty, more diligence. It takes more time.
A few venture firms now actively use Syndicates, including Foundry Group, which did something like 40 deals last year on your platform. Have you also talked with big mutual funds that now make big bets on later-stage startups and that might diversify even more by getting into earlier-stage investing?
They have no idea what this is. I’ve tried to explain it to them and it’s too bleeding edge for them. Sometimes we’re too far out ahead of the curve.
Where are these angels coming from – the Bay Area primarily?
A lot of them are [from the] Bay Area. A lot are entrepreneurs, angels, or maybe individual VC partners who are backing each other. We also have hedge fund managers, oil traders, people in the finance industry who have made some money but aren’t in Silicon Valley. There are definitely the dentists and radiologists, who the finance industry seems to hate – I don’t know why. And they do try and come on and we either reject them or we put them into [a new series of index funds] that are managed by us so they can invest in 100 startups at a time [and hedge their bets].
You have Syndicates. You have these index funds and other products. What do people use the most at AngelList?
Actually, [they mostly use] the recruiting site, which we started on a lark in early 2012 when we noticed that people were raiding failed companies on AngelList for employees. That’s by far the highest activity thing on the site, because everyone is looking to hire. We have around 7,000 companies recruiting on AngelList, of whom more than 3,000 log-in every single week and go through . . . 120,000 candidate profiles that are active.
Are you ever going to make money off those listings?
That’s the obvious source of cash. But it works because it’s free for the startups. If we do monetize that — and we’re running some experiments — it will be at the high end for people who have more money than time.
Last year, angel investor Gil Penchina raised $2.8 million via Syndicates to invest in Beepi, a used car marketplace, alongside DST Global. Was that the biggest syndicate to date by far?
We’ve had a couple of others that were over a million bucks. It’s relatively constrained because you’re gathering checks from individuals, so when you collect $2.8 million, that’s 90 different checks and wire transfers and so on, and we’re limited because we form a special purpose vehicle to invest in each company, and that SPV is limited to 99 unit holders by law. So I would not extrapolate and say, okay, $2.8 million today; tomorrow, it will be $10 million, then $20 million. It’s fun to think it could go to that range, but I don’t think so, not yet.
Penchina recently told the WSJ that he has poured his entire life savings into AngelList. Does that concern you? What if things go south for him?
That might have been an exaggeration. [Laughs.] But sure, it’s never good when someone loses their shirt, that’s true of any startup.
Has anyone come after you over a deal that didn’t go as expected?
No. In the entire history of AngelList, we’ve never had a single related case of fraud or a lawsuit threat. We follow the rules, we have a no-action letterfrom the SEC, we have disclaimers, we’re trying to deal only with sophisticated people. This is America, and anyone can sue you and someone eventually will. But so far so good.
How do you keep people from getting in over their heads?
We look at what angel investments they’ve done before, and if they don’t have a history of doing them, then we’ll run them through a questionnaire that asks them: What percentage of your net worth are you putting in, what kind of return do you expect, how liquid do you think these investments are, how big a basket of these do you think you need to assemble? And based on their responses, we’ll either reject them, we’ll cap the amount they can invest, or we’ll move them into one of the index funds and say, “You can put a small amount in here.” Or we’ll say, “Go offline, go to your local angel association and lose some money there, then come back to us.” The test we’re looking for is: have you lost money before.
How much of someone’s net worth would you advise investing in nascent startups? Up to 10 percent?
No, I would say anything more than 5 percent is probably silly. Obviously, I’m personally far more leveraged than that – I’m “all in” on startups — but that’s because I’m living in Silicon Valley and I’ve bought into the dream.

You talk a lot about the advantage of moving investing online. 
People like to think that it doesn’t create that much value, but we forget that when you move online, there are all kinds of things you cannot do offline. An example: By the end of this year, you’ll be able to go into Syndicates and say, “This person sourced the deal for me so I’m going to give this person carry. This is passive capital, so they’ll pay full freight. The pro rata will get gobbled up by following entities.” You can even start doing differential pricing. You can establish that the first $250,000 into a deal gets a 20 percent discount and the next $250,000 gets a 15 percent discount. It breaks that logjam of: Why should I be the first one to write a check into the company.
Online would also seem to play into this notion of continuous fundraising or rolling closes. Do you think that’s a sustainable trend? 
We’re going to see a lot more of it. Companies are getting much better at raising money whenever it’s available and they’ll raise it in dribs and drabs until they get to the scale or product-market fit where a VC will come in and write a $10 million check. I think it’s a natural trend and I do think it’s easier online than offline. We already enable it to an extent in that Syndicated deals can stay open for months and keep collecting capital if you want it to . . . My guess is that by the end of next year, it’ll be a common thing.
In the past, entrepreneurs had gotten a lot of advice from the venture side, which was kind of talking their own book, which was, “Get your ducks in a row and raise money once and get a good board member.” It’s all good advice, but it’s a little self-serving, whereas accelerators give almost the opposite advice, which is: “Go get the money right now, get it from anyone who will write you a check within reason, and keep taking money as long as you can and just don’t run out of cash.”
I’ve also seen you mention getting into secondaries. How serious were you? 
Yes, they’re becoming very popular now because household names like Uber and Airbnb and Dropbox are staying private longer and people are running around trading in the companies’ stock on the side. But it’s very tricky because [secondaries are] regulated in a very different way. Insider trading laws apply to secondaries; the companies often don’t want there to be secondary trades, so they have a right of first refusal. A lot of the secondary trades that are going on are in violation of the companies’ bylaws. A lot of them have counterparty risk, where you don’t actually run it through the company; you just get an IOU from someone who could skip town.
A lot of this going on right now. It’s possible that the amount of secondary trading going on in Silicon Valley under the covers is going to match the amount of primary financing soon. And if you look at the public markets like the Nasdaq or the NYSE, it’s almost all secondary. The IPOs are a tiny piece of the trades, and then it’s all secondary trading going back and forth. So it’s something that we’re looking at, but it’s very difficult, and because we’re so large and so watched, we have to do it by the book. We’re looking into it, but it’s a hard problem.
[Update: The original version of this story was titled: “In Silicon Valley, Secondary Deals Quietly Reaching ‘Primary’ Funding Levels.” Ravikant asked that we change it, given that our choice in wording was more predictive and certain than his original comments or intent. Our apologies to Ravikant and to readers.]








The Rolling Close: Here to Stay or Gone Tomorrow?



Venture capital was long a clubby, opaque industry, but AngelList and crowdfunding are two intertwined innovations that have since knocked that model onto its side. Now, another related twist looks poised to roil it again: the rolling close.
You’ve probably heard the term in recent years. A rolling close is what happens when a management team raises money within a certain window of time with no predetermined size for the “round.” Every amount invested is closed immediately at a set valuation, versus a traditional funding where a round isn’t closed until a predetermined minimum is raised.
The messaging service Snapchat is the highest-profile company to employ the model, closing $485 million from 23 investors over the course of nine months last year.
Last week, as TechCrunch reported, an eight-year-old, London-based film streaming service called MUBI closed on $15 million in similar fashion, raising the money from 49 investors over many months.
StrictlyVC is aware of two startups in San Francisco that are currently employing the same tactic.
You might think of it like crowdsourcing, without the middleman. “Whoever wires the money is in, and when you reach your target, you ‘close’ the round,” MUBI founder Efe Cakarel told TechCrunch.
Ramana Nanda, an associate professor at Harvard Business School, characterizes rolling closes as a product of a frothy market – full stop. It’s an “effective strategy for entrepreneurs in industries and at times when capital for startups is abundant and financing risk is low.”
As long as firms and investors can reasonably expect to continue raising money on good terms, Nanda says, they’re “less concerned about having a cash cushion in the event that things don’t go as well as expected, or because investors will not show up when the cash reserve runs low.”
Rolling closes are also tactical, argues Todd Chaffee, a managing director at Institutional Venture Partners, a Snapchat investor that wrote its first check to the company in 2013. “The formality of, ‘Let’s close this round, get back to business, and then raise another round'” isn’t always ideal for a fast-moving company, Chaffee says, calling rolling closes a “more fluid and dynamic approach.”
Still, there are downsides, including — presumably — managing investor relations. According to TechCrunch sources, Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel has been known to invite different parties to invest in Snapchat at different pre-money valuations. (TechCrunch says some investors funded Snapchat last year at a $10 billion valuation while others participated at a pre-money valuation that was closer to $20 billion.)
MUBI’s backers invested at the same pre-money valuation, but all while the company’s post-money valuation was rising, meaning that every subsequent investor in MUBI’s newest fundraise was getting less of the company for his or her money.
It was a “very transparent and fair process,” says Cakarel, who tells StrictlyVC that “new investors weighed [MUBI’s] increased ‘pre-money’ valuation against a company that was becoming better capitalized [and] that continued to grow its subscriber base significantly throughout the funding period.”
Little wonder that investors who are accustomed to traditional rounds — where everyone receives the same terms — aren’t sure what to make of the trend. “We haven’t seen this sort of financing/closing structure in the late stage,” says Paul Madera of the late-stage investment firm Meritech Capital, but we “generally wouldn’t be very comfortable with it,” he adds.
Hunter Walk, cofounder of the seed-stage firm Homebrew, says his firm has “occasionally participated” in rolling closes — in cases where the entrepreneurs are “herding cats a bit and want to put money to work right away from committed investors.” At the same time, he says, “It would give me pause at the seed stage to see a founder who tried to mark up the company several times during a round.”
The big question, of course, is whether rolling closes are here to stay. Only time will tell, but our guess is that they are — that they’re indicative of how private financings are moving toward a more market-based approach. After all, if there’s more demand for an issue, doesn’t it make sense to raise the price? Why should founders be forever bound to the artificial constraints of “rounds”?
As Cakarel puts it, “It was unimaginable, even eight years ago when I started MUBI, to do a round of $15 million from a bunch of individuals, each coming in with somewhere between $50,000 and $1 million in Silicon Valley.”
Cakarel isn’t saying he’s closing the door on VCs. “Raising institutional capital is also very attractive, and VCs can add a lot of value.” But he notes that “VCs are no longer the only option you have for this kind of capital. And this is good for entrepreneurs. Out of options, come good decisions.”

At Six Months, Syndicates is Maturing, Without Some Big Names



When AngelList launched its “syndicates” program last September, AllThingsD anointed one investor, Kevin Rose, as its “million dollar man.” The reason: within a week of AngelList making it possible for backers to put their money behind one individual, Rose collected more than $1.1 million in commitments.
Rose, a Google Ventures partner, told his 245 backers that he planned to participate in five seed investments per year on the platform. But six months later, he hasn’t invested in any. Both MG Siegler of Google Ventures and Path cofounder Dave Morin, who also quickly attracted hundreds of thousands of dollars to syndicate deals, haven’t pulled the trigger on anything, either.
Neither Google Ventures nor Morin responded to a request for comment. But AngelList cofounder Naval Ravikant has a theory based on his own investing experience. “I think some [investors] assembled syndicates but didn’t know what to do with them. I think some are scared because the platform is very transparent. [An investment] is going to be tracked. People will see the deal in detail. There’s no hiding anything, and it causes people to freeze up a bit.”
Some have painted another picture of why Rose may not be syndicating deals on the platform. One source cites a low volume of high-quality deals, while another says that if there’s enough demand for a startup’s seed round, there’s no reason to include a syndicate.
It seems entirely possible, too, that it’s harder for full-time VCs to justify their involvement with the platform until it’s better understood. Google Ventures, as a single LP fund, might also be struggling with whether to essentially create a separate management company around one of its partners.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, Ravikant rejects each one of these ideas, noting that both venture firms and LPs are showing increased interest in syndicates, including Maiden Lane, a new fund backed institutional investors that will invest both directly in syndicates and in direct investment opportunities found elsewhere on AngelList’s platform.
Ravikant further insists the quality of the deals being syndicated is “actually quite good.” He points to AltSchool, a year-old, San Francisco-based company that’s creating a brand-new network of schools. On Tuesday, the company announced that it has raised $33 million in Series A funding led by Founders Fund and Andreessen Horowitz. Among AltSchool’s other, earlier investors is former Wikia CEO Gil Penchina, who syndicated the investment on AngelList.
Ravikant also notes that syndicate leads can choose whether information about a deal will be made available to the general AngelList investor community or to specific backers only, suggesting that some of the program’s best startups are being funded under the radar. He highlights Ben Davenport, whose mobile messaging startup, Beluga, was acquired by Facebook and turned into Facebook Messenger. Davenport recently syndicated an investment in NYBX, a New York-based company focused on cryptocurrencies. By design, his backers are serious Bitcoin investors only, and “unless you were one of Ben’s LPs,” says Ravikant, you didn’t see it.
I ask Hunter Walk of the venture firm Homebrew about his experience with the platform. Last September, his firm led a $2.1 million investment in the shipping startup Shyp, some of which came from a syndicate led by entrepreneur-author Tim Ferriss. It created a lot of press at the time for Shyp, but in retrospect, was it worth it? Walk says it was. “Tim was able to assemble a great set of angels – some known, some new to investing – but we saw his participation as strategic.”
AngelList’s syndicates program is “still very much in beta, so going slow,” says Ravikant. “I don’t think [the program] will be hitting its stride until next year.”
In the meantime, he says, there’s “a lot more demand than we can run. Fundamentally, something is working.”







With Little Notice, Seed-Stage Valuations Begin Falling



A widely held belief in Silicon Valley is that valuations are still on a one-way trajectory toward the sky, with founders firmly in the driver’s seat.
But the reality for seed-stage companies may be a bit more dire than that — and getting worse by the month.
According to the research firm CB Insights, both average and median seed-stage valuations have fallen since last year, with the average valuation dropping from $2.2 million to $1.7 million and median valuation falling even more precipitously, from $1.7 million to just .6 million.
Data from AngelList, a matchmaking service for investors and seed-stage entrepreneurs, also shows declining valuations. According to AngelList, which tracks thousands of startups in its system, the average seed-funded company’s valuation dropped from $3.9 million in the third quarter of 2012 to $3.6 million in the third quarter of this year. That isn’t a massive dip, but AngelList founder Naval Ravikant tells me that “by the time [a shift in one direction] shows up in the averages, it’s pretty pronounced.”
A recent quarterly venture capital report out of Pitchbook, which operates a subscription-only database of private equity and VC deals paints a rosier picture. Pitchbook found that median pre-money valuations for seed-stage, VC-funded companies have nearly doubled over the last three years — from $3.2 million in 2010 to $5.2 million through the first three quarters of 2013.
Still, this same report observed that lofty valuations are only making it harder for companies to raise Series A rounds. Pitchbook further noted that the rise of valuations can’t go on endlessly, suggesting there will likely be more flat and down rounds in coming years.
Ravikant — noting that “everyone’s dataset is incomplete” — suggests the future is now. Though he can’t pinpoint exactly when things began trending downward, he thinks valuations “kind of peaked around the Facebook IPO, when it turned out to be less than people thought it would be.”
According to Ravikant, there “hasn’t been a mass exodus out” out of the seed-stage investing market, mainly because “people still believe some percentage of your portfolio should be early-stage. But there’s increased recognition” that it’s a tough racket, with many angels suffering from investor fatigue and suddenly becoming more realistic about the chances of their portfolio companies receiving follow-on investments.
There will always be a market for the most promising seed-stage startups, in other words. But evidence from CB Insights and AngelList suggests that for entrepreneurs just setting out, the road ahead looks bumpy.

AngelList’s Naval Ravikant on His Syndicates Program, Two Months In



Entrepreneurs Naval Ravikant and Babak Nivi have already done much to reshape the startup investing landscape with AngelList, their now four-year-old networking site that has largely replaced coffee meetings with Internet-based matchmaking. 
In September, AngelList introduced another game-changer — its Syndicates program, which allows angel investors to syndicate investments themselves, work for which they receive carry. (An angel who syndicates a deal earns 15 percent of any upside, while AngelList collects 5 percent.)
Though Syndicates is still nascent, I caught up with Ravikant yesterday afternoon to see who has begun using it and how it’s doing generally. Our chat has been edited for length.
Can you give us a sense of the activity you’re seeing on Syndicates?
I’d estimate that something like $5 million has moved through the platform already, with several million more dollars [committed but not yet closed]. About 24 deals have closed, and others are in various stages of closing.
Do the deals involve many of the same people or are you seeing fairly disparate groups?
A bit of both. Some people are using it more promiscuously to diversify their portfolio. Others are doing deals because the know the lead backer well and it’s a trust relationship. For example, you see [Path CEO and former Facebook exec] Dave Morin and other Facebook alums co-investing together and backing each other.
Is anyone using the platform who you didn’t anticipate would?
The biggest surprise has been VC interest. The response has been the highest from angels, but we’re in advanced stages of talking about how to do syndicates with four firms, and numerous others are using the platform as a way to scout out deals. As with their scout programs, they’re backing their portfolio CEOs when those CEOs go and find and fund great companies.
Will we see a day when a person can raise $20 million via Syndicates to invest across numerous startups?
The way it’s set up right now, you can [invest] deal by deal…So we’ll hold funds in escrow for one deal. What we’re not doing is [managing a] 10-year commitment. If [Google Ventures partner] Kevin Rose has $2 million in backing, that’s $2 million [for one] deal. But he can drop people, or they can drop out of the syndicate, any time.
Has Kevin Rose made an investment through the platform yet? 
There are three Google Ventures partners who have a lot of syndicate backing but haven’t done a deal yet.
This whole thing seems like a great financial proposition for everyone but you. Is that true?
The idea isn’t to make money in the short term. But yes, today, it’s a money loser. We take 5 percent of [any upside] so if a lead invests $100,000 personally in a company, then raises another $1 million off Syndicates, we get carry off that $1 million, or $50,000 [if the company sells for $10 million]. But most Syndicates are in the $250,000 or $300,000 to $750,000, so at the lower end, that’s about $10,000 for us. Meanwhile, our out-of-pocket fees – to set up the funds, handle customer accounting [and so forth] are $12,000. So we’re basically paying $12,000 for $10,000 in future profit.
Why do it then?
Because longer term, we think we can bring LLC costs down to $5,000. And as syndicate sizes grow, it starts to become marginally profitable.
In the meantime, are you quietly investing a fund for anyone right now? At one point, you were talking about doing that after you’d invested a $20 million angel fund, Hit Forge.
I’ve been offered to raise another; [Hit Forge included stakes in] Uber, Twitter and Stack Overflow. But investing is [just a side hobby] now, and I’m making all my investments through Syndicates. I get to follow my best friends into deals, and I don’t mind paying them for carry if it means I don’t have [as many] coffee meetings.

Three New Types of AngelList Syndicates I Hope to See
Sunday Conversation #6: Chris Dixon, Andreessen Horowitz
How AngelList Syndicates could actually hurt some angels, help some VCs








The Case for More Transparency on AngelList



Last week, AngelList, the hugely popular platform that connects entrepreneurs with accredited investors, introduced what many have heralded as a game-changing new twist to its business. Called its Syndicate program, AngelList now allows angel investors to syndicate investments themselves, work for which they will receive carry. (An angel who syndicates a deal will earn 15 percent of any upside, while AngelList will collect 5 percent.) 
If some of these syndicates involve the same groups of investors, and those groups morph into venture funds, don’t be surprised. As some angels have said on social media since AngelList announced its new program, it might allow many of the “best” angels to strengthen their brands and, potentially, move up the investing food chain.
And there’s no reason why angels shouldn’t be able to extract more leverage from their investments, particularly if they’re willing to manage a big syndicate or serve on a company’s board.
Still, while the syndicate program seems like a well-considered start, AngelList might think about providing some public accounting of the track records of its various syndicate leaders. As the gossip site Valleywag pointed out in its inimitable way yesterday, without a structure that manages to disclose something about the investors’ IRRs, the program seems likely to degenerate into a popularity contest. Much of AngelList’s matchmaking still rests on “social proof,” which isn’t quite the same thing as cash on cash returns.
Last week, for example, author and entrepreneur Tim Ferriss raised $350,000 for a logistics startup called Shyp in 53 minutes. Ferriss’ fundraising prowess is impressive, and nobody is prejudging Shyp, but it’s hard not to be skeptical about investments that are closed in less than an hour.
Most VCs wouldn’t wish their fundraising process on their worst enemy, but it does help them demonstrate their qualifications and commitment to the investment process to both their investors and their fellow partners. Through vetting their PPMs with Cambridge Associates, undergoing lengthy and arduous roadshows with family offices and pension funds, and sacrificing a large amount of their own capital – typically 3 percent – in order to launch their funds, venture investors let it all hang out. (Yes, there are top-tier funds that are able to raise funds by picking up the phone a few times, but that’s the exception not the norm.) By the time a firm has raised a fund, they have left a trail of evidence testifying to the work they will put into an investment. Can the same be said of Ferriss?
Obviously, AngelList doesn’t need to replicate the venture business – it’s large enough as it is. But in the interests of both entrepreneurs and the syndicates themselves, it might be time for AngelList to adopt an objective ratings process, one that would provide everyone with more insight into an investor’s qualifications than just his or her Klout score. No doubt it would make an already promising initiative even better.

							AngelList Review						


ANGELLIST REVIEW
◙ ANGELLIST REVIEW SUMMARY
√ Raising Funds for Startups
√ Startups don’t pay for syndicate investments
√ Investors pay 0-25% deal carry to the syndicate lead, and 5% deal carry to AngelList
√ Invest in 100 Startups with one Investment

 
◙ SUPPORTED PROJECTS

Project Categories:
The are tens of startup categories. Most popular categories include IT Startups, Consumer Electronics, Media, Healthcare, Education and Finance.
Public Fundraising
Adding your startup or funding round to AngelList doesn't affect whether you are raising publicly or privately. Fundraising activity on AngelList is only visible to logged in, accredited investors. If you announce your raise publicly (for example, by social media or to your company's newsletter), you will need to collect evidence from all investors to verify their accredited investor status.
Accredited investors
An individual in the U.S. is said to be accredited if he has $200k or more in income for the past 2 years (or $300k with a spouse), with the expectation of similar earnings this year; or $1m in net assets (assets minus debts).
How are the investors on AngelList verified
All the investors have stated that they are accredited. You should verify that every investor you raise money from is accredited, whether or not you use AngelList. And you should treat each investor you meet on AngelList as if you just met them on the street.
Limits on AngelList investor account

Newer investors who can’t claim several confirmed startup investments or fund partnerships already may be capped at $25K per investment (and $150K in total).


 
◙ SUPPORTED COUNTRIES FOR SYNDICATED STARTUPS
These are the terms for US and Non-US startups.
 
--How can a Startup be syndicated on AngelList

(1) First, you must have a syndicate lead
(2) You must also be a US S corporation, C corporation or LLC corporation
(3) UK corporations also qualify

--Non-US companies can raise money publicly

Non-U.S. startups can take advantage of public fundraising, as long as they comply with their local regulations and US regulations

 

◙ WHO IS ANGELLIST
AngelList is a platform helping startups raising money online. It was found in Jan 2010 by Babak Nivi and Naval Ravikant. 
The Service is operated and provided by AngelList LLC based in the US, 16 Maiden Lane, San Francisco CA 94108. 
Angellist has made more than 7,500 introductions {between 800 start-ups and 1,200 investors}.

 
◙ ANGELLIST COST OF SERVICES
Startups don’t pay for syndicate investments. 
Investors pay 0-25% deal carry to the syndicate lead, and 5% deal carry to AngelList. 
Investors also pay the out-of-pocket costs for each investment—currently $8K in the US and £8,300 in the UK. These costs are paid to third parties such as state regulatory agencies, payment processors and accountants—AngelList does not profit from these fees.
The lead and AngelList do not receive carry until the syndicate investors’ investments and out-of-pocket costs are returned.

 
◙ ANGELIST TRENDING PROJECTS
How AngelList Trending Work
Trending is based on indications of interest from candidates and investors. In other words, when a lot of high-quality candidates or investors say they want to meet the startup, in a short period of time, this startup trends. The “quality” of the person that is indicating interest matters. Quality is measured by track record—the valuation of the startups a person has invested in, founded, worked at, etc.

 
◙ ANGELIST SYNDICATES -HOW IT WORKS?
A syndicate allows investors to participate in a lead investor's deals. In exchange, investors pay the lead carry. Investors get access to deals, leads get carry and startups get more capital with fewer meetings.

Investors get access to a lead's investments and benefit from her experience in picking and managing investments. Investors can also invest as little as $1K.
Leads get carry for their investments. They can invest 5–10x their typical investment amount, which gives them access to more deals and allows them to lead more deals. They may also get major investor rights. Finally, leads get access to syndicate investors who are often experts in the startup’s market.
Startups get more capital with fewer meetings. They get the attention of a lead who is making a large investment. They get access to the syndicate investors’ networks without putting each one on the cap table. And they can easily collect many small investments. 

Legal structure of a syndicate

Syndicate investors don't invest directly in a company. They invest in a special purpose fund that is created specifically for each investment. This fund then invests in the company. The corporate form of the fund is an LLC.
The fund is managed by Assure Fund Management and advised by AngelList Advisors, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AngelList. The lead also serves as a contractor of AngelList Advisors. 
The lead does not invest through the fund but is required to disclose to AngelList Advisors how she votes, or if she buys or sells shares. 
If there is a lead, the fund will usually vote with the lead unless she has a conflict of interest or there are other unusual circumstances. If there is no lead, the fund will usually vote with the majority of other shareholders
99-investor limit

Due to securities regulations, syndicates can only accept 99 investors in a deal.
A small number of investments support qualified purchasers who are exempt from this requirement. 
Qualified purchasers include individuals with $5M in investment assets and companies with $25M in investment assets. A syndicate deal can accept up to 2000 qualified purchasers at the same time as 99 accredited, but not qualified, investors.



 
◙ INVESTORS
Investors information rights

Syndicate investors receive less information than direct investors. An AngelList entity or the lead will distribute the following documents to investors when they invest in a syndicate deal:

Documents related to the fund’s formation such as its operating agreement, PPM and subscription agreement.
General terms of the investment, if the company permits. Templates of deal documents signed by the fund may also be made available to investors. 
Qualitative updates on the company status, if available. This is high-level information similar to the information VCs provide to their LPs. For example, it may include information about the company’s customers or financing. It will generally not include any figures.
Any information investors need for taxes, such as K-1s, is distributed annually.

How Investors receive their profits
You will receive your profits, if any, when the company is acquired or has an IPO. There may also be other opportunities for the syndicate to sell its shares.
When there is an exit opportunity, AngelList Advisors, in consultation with the lead, will advise the syndicate fund regarding the best time to sell the syndicates’ shares. The decision to sell the shares is then made by Assure Fund Management. This will generally happen soon after the shares become liquid. If there are any profits, they are distributed to the syndicate investors.
The syndicate fund, like all investors, is bound by restrictions with the company and can only sell shares in certain situations.
How investing in a syndicate differ from investing in a VC fund
Syndicates are intended to complement, not replace VC funds. Differences include:

Syndicate investors can opt out of any deal or stop investing any time
Syndicates have much lower minimums
Syndicates are available to the general (accredited) public
Leads typically personally invest more per deal than GPs
Syndicates use deal carry
Syndicates do not charge management fees


 
◙ INVESTOR'S FUNDING ACCOUNTS
Investor's Funding Information
Investor accounts are free
Funds are stored at Silicon Valley Bank, funds are FDIC-insured
Investors can increase or decrease their investment in a particular deal. Any change is subject to approval by the lead. Investors can also opt out of any deal.
An investor account only requires a minimum balance in the case of a syndicate. The minimum balance is equal to the largest backing amount.
 
Withdraw funds from investor's account to bank account takes 3-7 days.
