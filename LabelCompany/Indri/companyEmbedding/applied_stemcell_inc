Treatment Available Now
Parkinson's Breakthrough


Cutting Edge Stem Cell Therapy
Painless Procedure
Limited Space Available
Commonly, significant positive results are seen in 3 to 6 months














Parkinson’s Treatment










Treatment
The treatment performed at our clinics is a breakthrough medical procedure where Stem Cells (cellular building blocks) are usually administered intravenously and subcutaneously (under the skin) in Parkinson's patients. The whole procedure takes approximately one hour and has no known negative side effects.

Following the treatment, the Fetal Stem Cells will travel throughout the body, detecting damaged cells and tissue and attempts to restore them. The Fetal Stem Cells can also stimulate existing normal cells and tissues to operate at a higher level of function, boosting the body’s own repair mechanisms to aid in the healing process. These highly adaptive cells then remain in the body, continually locating and repairing any damage they encounter.
Safety

As with any medical treatment, safety should be of the highest priority. The Stem Cells used in our treatment undergo extensive screening for possible infection and impurities. Utilizing tests more sophisticated than those regularly used in the United States for Stem Cell research and transplant. Our testing process ensures we use only the healthiest cells to enable the safest and most effective Fetal Stem Cell treatment possible. And, unlike other types of Stem Cells, there is no danger of the body’s rejection of Fetal Stem Cells due to the fact they have no antigenicity (cellular fingerprint). This unique quality eliminates the need for drugs used to suppress the immune system, which can leave a patient exposed to serious infections.
Results
With over 3000 patients treated, Stem Cell Of America has achieved positive results with a wide variety of illnesses, conditions and injuries. Often, in cases where the diseases continued to worsen, our patients have reported substantial improvements following the Stem Cell treatment.

Commonly, positive changes are seen between three to six months post treatment in Parkinson's patients.
To view follow up letters from patients, please visit the patient experiences page on our website.

All statements, opinions, and advice on this page is provided for educational information only. It is not a substitute for proper medical diagnosis and care. Like all medical treatments and procedures, results may significantly vary and positive results may not always be achieved. Please contact us so we may evaluate your specific case.

 Frequently Asked Questions



Frequently Asked Questions
Does the Stem Cell treatment have any age requirements?
No, Stem Cell Of America accepts patients of all ages.
How much does the treatment cost?
There are multiple factors in determining the cost of treatment. Please contact us to have your case evaluated.
Does health insurance cover any portion of the treatment cost?
No, the treatment is not covered by private or public health insurance.
Do you accept patients from outside of the United States?
Yes, we routinely accept patients from Canada, England, Australia and other countries all over the world.
Is the Stem Cell treatment administered by Stem Cell Of America safe?
Yes, the cells are tested for 14 different criteria, including viral, bacterial, and fungal infections, as well as viability. Moreover, we use PCR DNA testing, which is far more sophisticated and expensive than the screening tests routinely used in the United States for other Stem Cell treatments.
Will my body reject the Fetal Stem Cells?
No, Fetal Stem Cellsare “immune privileged”.  This means that you can give the cells to any patient without matching, use of immunosuppressive drugs and without rejection. Therefore they will not cause adverse reactions in the patient, such as graft-versus-host disease.  Because of this special property of the cells there is no risk of rejection or adverse reaction, which can leave the body vulnerable to serious diseases and infection.
Does your Stem Cell Treatment have any side effects?
Our Fetal Stem Cell treatment has no known negative side effects.
What diseases and conditions is the Stem Cell treatment available for?
A partial list of disease and conditions that Stem Cell of America has successfully treated includes:

Alzheimer's
Arthritis
Autism
Brain Damage
Cancer
Cerebral Palsy
Chronic Pain
Cystic Fibrosis
Diabetes
Epilepsy
Fibromyalgia
Heart Disease
Kidney Disease
Liver Disease
Lung Disease
Lupus
Multiple Sclerosis
Muscular Dystrophy
Parkinson's
Seizures
Spinal Cord Injury
Stroke
and others

Due to the rapid advances in Stem Cell science, some diseases or conditions may not be listed. Please contact us to get additional information.
How quickly will I see results after the Stem Cell treatment?
Every person is of course different. Each of our body’s healing mechanisms work at a unique pace as they are influenced by many factors. Commonly, significant positive changes are seen between three to six months post treatment. At times, these changes can occur in as little as weeks or even days after receiving treatment.
How many Stem Cell treatments will I need?
After the first treatment, the Fetal Stem Cells will continue to proliferate and repair. Some patients choose to receive treatment more than one time to expedite the healing process. The decision is yours. If you decide to repeat the treatment, usually a waiting period of 6 months is recommended.
How do the Fetal Stem Cells actually work to bring about healing?
Fetal Stem Cells are the cellular building blocks of the 220 cell types within the body. The Fetal Stem Cells used by Stem Cell Of America remain in an undifferentiated state and therefore are capable of becoming any tissue, organ or cell type within the body.
Fetal Stem Cells also release Cytokines. Cytokines are cell-derived, hormone-like polypeptides that regulate cellular replication, differentiation, and activation. Cytokines can bring normal cells and tissues to a higher level of function, allowing the body’s own healing mechanisms to partner with the transplanted Fetal Stem Cells for repair and new growth.
How many people have been treated with my specific disease or condition?
In the past 2 decades, Stem Cell Of America has arranged for the treatment of over three thousand patients with Fetal Stem Cells. The number of patients continues to grow. Please contact us to get specific information on a disease or condition.
Where are you located?
Stem Cell Of America has offices in the United States and a treatment center in Mexico.

CRISPR Genome Editing for Cell Lines
Genomic Engineering in cell lines is a versatile tool for studying gene function, designing diseases models, biopharmaceutical research, drug discovery and many other applications. Applied StemCell is excited to present our cell line services including genome engineering, gene editing, and knock-in cell lines. To date, methods of gene insertion in human stem cells (viral vectors, transposons, or plasmids) are mostly random insertions subject to silencing and disrupting internal genes, inefficient, multiple copies, loss of expression after differentiation, and have limitations with the insert DNA size. Nuclease-based methods, particularly the CRISPR-Cas9 method, offer an efficient way of controlled gene insertion. However, creating double strand breaks also can have negative consequences including cellular toxicity, off-target recombination, and sequence alterations near the target site. Visit our CRISPR services page for more specific information on CRISPR-Cas9 Gene Editing services.
TARGATT Genome Editing for Cell Lines

Site-specific integrases, such as the TARGATT™ method, offer an attractive method for precise gene addition in human stem cells. Integrases such as phiC31 and Bxb1 catalyze recombination between two non-identical sites, attB and attP. This feature, along with lack of a corresponding excisionase activity, makes the recombination reaction unidirectional and efficient. With this method, “master” human stem cell lines were constructed to contain a “docking site” of attPs. The attP sites were directed to a “safe harbor” genomic locus that was shown to provide robust transcription in all cell types previously in the mouse study. These docking-site-ready (DSR) cells can be used to insert any genes of interest in a fast, simple and site-specific manner with high efficiency (100% with selection). This new DSR master cell line system combines integrases with novel open chromatin loci and ensures efficient, uniform, and robust gene expression.

Site-Specific!
Applied Stem Cell Inc.’s proprietary TARGATT™ Technology enables highly efficient site-specific gene integration in mammalian cells and animals. This technology uses PhiC31 integrase to insert any gene of interest into a specific docking site that was pre-engineered into an intergenic and transcriptionally active genomic locus. Applied StemCell can create site-specific knock-in mice for you in as fast as 3 months. Using our novel TARGATT™ system, a gene of interest can be inserted at a well-characterized, transcriptionally-active locus in the mouse genome with guaranteed transgene expression. Tissue-specific and/or ubiquitous expression options are available. The TARGATT™-mice are available in 2 backgrounds: FVB and C57BL6J).  Please contact us to discuss your project plan.  
Advantages of TARGATT™ Technology  

High integration efficiency mediated by PhiC31 integrase reduces time and cost
Site-specific integration at a pre-selected genomic locus eliminates position effect and ensures high expression levels of the transgene
Integration at intergenic region ensures that no internal genes are interrupted
Single copy gene integration eliminates repeat-induced gene silencing and genomic instability
Site-specific integration allows a precise comparison of the effects of the transgenes among different lines.

TARGATT™ Technology can be utilized for a variety of applications including reporter gene expression, gene knockdown and disease models.

Applied StemCell, Inc., offers various services related to animal models including conventional transgenic rat, transgenic rats, and phenotype analysis. Applied StemCell, Inc. has an AAALAC accredited animal facility and all mice and rats are generated within the USA.  
TARGATT™ transgenic rats  
Our TARGATT™ technology uses PhiC31 integrase to insert any gene of interest into a docking site, that has been pre-engineered in an intergenic and transcriptionally active genomic locus with guaranteed transgene expression. Applied StemCell, Inc. can create cost-effective, site-specific knock-in rats for you in as little as 7-9 months. This technology can be utilized for a variety of applications including reporter gene expression, gene knock-down and disease models.   
CRISPR/Cas9 knock-in, knock-out, conditional knock-out rats  
Cas9-CRISPR method will be used to generate rat models that contain point mutation(s), small reporter insertions and conditional knockouts. The CRISPR/Cas9 system uses the Cas9 nuclease to facilitate RNA-guided site-specific DNA cleavage. The system consists of two components: (1) mammalian codon-optimized version of the Cas9 protein carrying a nuclear localization signal to ensure nuclear compartmentalization in mammalian cells; (2) guide RNAs (gRNAs) to direct Cas9 protein to sequence-specifically cleave the targeted DNA. The advantage of CRISPR/Cas9 over ZFNs or TALENs is its scalability and multiplexibility in that multiple sites within the mammalian genome can be simultaneously modified, providing a robust, high-throughput approach for gene editing in mammalian cells.   
Applied StemCell, Inc. can generate CRISPR/Cas9 transgenic rats in as little as 7-9 months.   
BACTERIAL ARTIFICIAL CHROMOSOME (BAC)  
Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes (BACs) are ultra-low copy vectors that can hold up to 300 kb of genomic fragments, making them ideal vectors for introduction of entire genes including the regulatory regions into the rat genome. BAC transgenic rats are similar to other knock-in models in the expression pattern of the gene of interest, except that the BAC is randomly integrated in the genome as a transgene. Applied StemCell can create a BAC knock-in and conditional knock-in rat models for you.  
Our services include:
BAC design and cloning strategy
Cloning and sequence validation of the BAC tailor-made to your specifications
Pronuclear microinjection of BAC into rat embryos
Genotyping  
Alternatively, you can choose to have us do the BAC modification strategy and cloning, and you can do the pronuclear injections and transgenic rat screening yourself.  
Please contact us so we can help you plan your projects and give in-depth detail on transgenic rat and additional services we offer to streamline your research.

Site-specific transgenic rats are gaining importance as a preferred in vivo model for researchers who seek better representation of human genetics and physiology. Their similarity to human physiology and pathology makes them a better in vivo model than mice for the study of cardiovascular, diabetics, neurological, psychiatric and autoimmune dysfunctions.  
Using Applied StemCell, Inc's., proprietary TARGATT™ and CRISPR/Cas9 technologies, we can generate site-specific transgenic rats in as little as 7 months. The novel TARGATT™ system uses PhiC31 integrase to insert any gene of interest into a specific docking site that was pre-engineered into an intergenic and transcriptionally active genomic locus.   
Advantages of the TARGATT™ system:  

High integration efficiency mediated by PhiC31 integrase-  reduces time and cost
Site-specific integration at a pre-selected genomic locus - eliminates position effect and ensures high expression levels of the transgene
Integration at intergenic region - ensures that no internal genes are interrupted
Single copy gene integration - eliminates repeat-induced gene silencing and genomic instability
Site-specific integration allows a precise comparison of the effects of the transgenes among different lines.

Treatment Available Now
Parkinson's Breakthrough


Cutting Edge Stem Cell Therapy
Painless Procedure
Limited Space Available
Commonly, significant positive results are seen in 3 to 6 months














Parkinson’s Treatment










Treatment
The treatment performed at our clinics is a breakthrough medical procedure where Stem Cells (cellular building blocks) are usually administered intravenously and subcutaneously (under the skin) in Parkinson's patients. The whole procedure takes approximately one hour and has no known negative side effects.

Following the treatment, the Fetal Stem Cells will travel throughout the body, detecting damaged cells and tissue and attempts to restore them. The Fetal Stem Cells can also stimulate existing normal cells and tissues to operate at a higher level of function, boosting the body’s own repair mechanisms to aid in the healing process. These highly adaptive cells then remain in the body, continually locating and repairing any damage they encounter.
Safety

As with any medical treatment, safety should be of the highest priority. The Stem Cells used in our treatment undergo extensive screening for possible infection and impurities. Utilizing tests more sophisticated than those regularly used in the United States for Stem Cell research and transplant. Our testing process ensures we use only the healthiest cells to enable the safest and most effective Fetal Stem Cell treatment possible. And, unlike other types of Stem Cells, there is no danger of the body’s rejection of Fetal Stem Cells due to the fact they have no antigenicity (cellular fingerprint). This unique quality eliminates the need for drugs used to suppress the immune system, which can leave a patient exposed to serious infections.
Results
With over 3000 patients treated, Stem Cell Of America has achieved positive results with a wide variety of illnesses, conditions and injuries. Often, in cases where the diseases continued to worsen, our patients have reported substantial improvements following the Stem Cell treatment.

Commonly, positive changes are seen between three to six months post treatment in Parkinson's patients.
To view follow up letters from patients, please visit the patient experiences page on our website.  
Contact us to get more information on this breakthrough treatment.
Disclaimer
All statements, opinions, and advice on this page is provided for educational information only. It is not a substitute for proper medical diagnosis and care. Like all medical treatments and procedures, results may significantly vary and positive results may not always be achieved. Please contact us so we may evaluate your specific case.

 Frequently Asked Questions



Frequently Asked Questions
Does the Stem Cell treatment have any age requirements?
No, Stem Cell Of America accepts patients of all ages.
How much does the treatment cost?
There are multiple factors in determining the cost of treatment. Please contact us to have your case evaluated.
Does health insurance cover any portion of the treatment cost?
No, the treatment is not covered by private or public health insurance.
Do you accept patients from outside of the United States?
Yes, we routinely accept patients from Canada, England, Australia and other countries all over the world.
Is the Stem Cell treatment administered by Stem Cell Of America safe?
Yes, the cells are tested for 14 different criteria, including viral, bacterial, and fungal infections, as well as viability. Moreover, we use PCR DNA testing, which is far more sophisticated and expensive than the screening tests routinely used in the United States for other Stem Cell treatments.
Will my body reject the Fetal Stem Cells?
No, Fetal Stem Cellsare “immune privileged”.  This means that you can give the cells to any patient without matching, use of immunosuppressive drugs and without rejection. Therefore they will not cause adverse reactions in the patient, such as graft-versus-host disease.  Because of this special property of the cells there is no risk of rejection or adverse reaction, which can leave the body vulnerable to serious diseases and infection.
Does your Stem Cell Treatment have any side effects?
Our Fetal Stem Cell treatment has no known negative side effects.
What diseases and conditions is the Stem Cell treatment available for?
A partial list of disease and conditions that Stem Cell of America has successfully treated includes:

Alzheimer's
Arthritis
Autism
Brain Damage
Cancer
Cerebral Palsy
Chronic Pain
Cystic Fibrosis
Diabetes
Epilepsy
Fibromyalgia
Heart Disease
Kidney Disease
Liver Disease
Lung Disease
Lupus
Multiple Sclerosis
Muscular Dystrophy
Parkinson's
Seizures
Spinal Cord Injury
Stroke
and others

Due to the rapid advances in Stem Cell science, some diseases or conditions may not be listed. Please contact us to get additional information.
How quickly will I see results after the Stem Cell treatment?
Every person is of course different. Each of our body’s healing mechanisms work at a unique pace as they are influenced by many factors. Commonly, significant positive changes are seen between three to six months post treatment. At times, these changes can occur in as little as weeks or even days after receiving treatment.
How many Stem Cell treatments will I need?
After the first treatment, the Fetal Stem Cells will continue to proliferate and repair. Some patients choose to receive treatment more than one time to expedite the healing process. The decision is yours. If you decide to repeat the treatment, usually a waiting period of 6 months is recommended.
How do the Fetal Stem Cells actually work to bring about healing?
Fetal Stem Cells are the cellular building blocks of the 220 cell types within the body. The Fetal Stem Cells used by Stem Cell Of America remain in an undifferentiated state and therefore are capable of becoming any tissue, organ or cell type within the body.
Fetal Stem Cells also release Cytokines. Cytokines are cell-derived, hormone-like polypeptides that regulate cellular replication, differentiation, and activation. Cytokines can bring normal cells and tissues to a higher level of function, allowing the body’s own healing mechanisms to partner with the transplanted Fetal Stem Cells for repair and new growth.
How many people have been treated with my specific disease or condition?
In the past 2 decades, Stem Cell Of America has arranged for the treatment of over three thousand patients with Fetal Stem Cells. The number of patients continues to grow. Please contact us to get specific information on a disease or condition.
Where are you located?
Stem Cell Of America has offices in the United States and a treatment center in Mexico.
