Barnes Group Inc. to Acquire Gammaflux L.P.


03/06/2017

Download this Press Release (PDF)




Gammaflux L.P. is a Leading Supplier of Hot Runner Temperature and
        Sequential Valve Gate Control Systems to the Plastics Industry


Acquisition Furthers Barnes Group as a Leader in the Plastic
        Injection Molding Technology Market


 BRISTOL, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
      Barnes Group Inc. (NYSE: B), a global industrial and aerospace
      manufacturer and service provider, today announced it has entered into a
      definitive agreement to acquire privately held Gammaflux L.P., a leading
      supplier of hot runner temperature and sequential valve gate control
      systems to the plastics industry.
    

      Gammaflux is headquartered in Sterling, Virginia and has offices in
      Illinois and Germany. While primarily serving the plastic injection
      molding industry, the company also provides temperature control
      solutions for blow molding, extrusion, and thermoforming applications.
      Its end markets include packaging, electronics, automotive, medical, and
      household products.
    

      “We look forward to adding Gammaflux control systems to our Molding
      Solutions business,” said Scott A. Mayo, Senior Vice President of Barnes
      Group Inc. and President, Barnes Industrial. “Gammaflux adds
      technologically advanced, hot runner temperature control systems to our
      existing product portfolio, which enable molders to achieve precise
      temperature control of the injection molding process within the mold.
      This will ensure high quality parts in the most critical molding
      applications. These capabilities, when combined with Barnes Group’s
      leading hot runner, complex mold, and sensor technologies, create an
      unsurpassed offering to our customers in the plastic injection molding
      industry.”
    

      The transaction is anticipated to close in the second quarter of 2017,
      subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions, and is not
      material to Barnes Group’s consolidated financial position or liquidity.
      Following the closing, Gammaflux will operate as a business within
      Barnes Group’s Industrial Segment, in the Molding Solutions strategic
      business unit, which includes leading technology-based businesses
      Synventive, Männer, Thermoplay, Priamus, and recently acquired FOBOHA.
      With a comprehensive portfolio of technologies and value-added services,
      Barnes Group delivers premium tool-based solutions to customers across a
      broad spectrum of injection molding applications.

      Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking
      statements address our expected future operating and financial
      performance and financial condition, and often contain words such as
      "anticipate," "believe," "expect," "plan," "strategy," "estimate,"
      "project," and similar terms. These forward-looking statements do not
      constitute guarantees of future performance and are subject to a variety
      of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ
      materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. These

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
