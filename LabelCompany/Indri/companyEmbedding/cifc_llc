Welcome to Partner DataLink for CIFC LLC.  We are dedicated to providing our partners with quick and easy access to tax package information.





Your Tax Year 2016 CIFC LLC Tax Package is now available. 

IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR TAX YEAR 2016: 

On November 21, 2016, F.A.B. Partners successfully completed its acquisition of CIFC LLC.  Under the terms of this agreement, CIFC investors were entitled to receive $11.36 per share in cash as sale consideration. 

As a result of the acquisition on November 21, 2016, CIFC LLC ceased to be a publicly traded limited liability company and its shares are no longer listed or traded on NASDAQ.  CIFC LLC investors were treated as having sold their CIFC LLC shares to F.A.B. Partners which is reflected on the Ownership Schedule included in this Tax Package.  The sale of shares to F.A.B. Partners reduces your ownership in CIFC LLC to zero.



Prior to the November transaction, CIFC LLC was a publicly traded limited liability company classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Partnerships generally are not subject to federal or state income tax. The annual income, gains, losses, deductions, or credits of the partnership flow through to its investors, who report the allocated share of these amounts on their tax returns as though the investor had incurred these items directly.  The sale of your CIFC LLC shares to F.A.B Partners likely resulted in a gain or loss that should be considered when preparing your tax return.  Such gain or loss is not reported on the enclosed Schedule K-1.  Please consult your tax advisor regarding your personal tax situation.



Here's what you can do on this site:


View your tax schedules 
Download your tax package     
Print your prior year tax package(s), if applicable 
By contacting our call center you may request the following changes:

Correct your account information including name, address and type of account
Correct dates, transaction types and units by transaction 
Add missing transactions 
Delete incorrect transactions 





If you have any questions regarding your tax package, please contact us using one of the methods provided in the Contact Information section.

NEW YORK and JERSEY, Aug. 19, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- CIFC LLC (NASDAQ:   CIFC), a U.S. private debt investment manager, and F.A.B. Partners ("F.A.B."), an alternative investment platform, today announced that CIFC and an affiliate of F.A.B. have entered into a definitive merger agreement under which F.A.B. will acquire CIFC for approximately $333 million in cash. 








Under the terms of the merger agreement, CIFC shareholders will be entitled to receive $11.46 in cash per share – $11.36 per share as consideration in the merger, plus a $0.10 per share distribution detailed below – representing a premium of more than 60% over CIFC's closing share price on August 19, 2016, and a premium of approximately 160% over the January 27, 2016 closing share price, the day prior to CIFC's announcement of its pursuit of strategic alternatives to accelerate the growth of its business. The CIFC Board has declared a cash distribution of $0.10 per share to be paid on September 12, 2016 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 31, 2016.  
Founded in 2005 and based in New York, CIFC is a $14 billion private debt manager specializing in U.S. corporate loan strategies. CIFC has over 75 employees, including more than 30 dedicated investment professionals.  The firm serves more than 200 institutional investors globally and is one of the largest managers of collateralized loan obligations ("CLOs") in North America.
F.A.B. is a global alternative investment platform that focuses on originating, structuring and actively managing investments across geographies and asset classes.  F.A.B. was founded by Michele Faissola, Dalinc Ariburnu and Nizar Al-Bassam, each of whom has significant capital markets and investment management experience.
Jeffrey S. Serota, Chairman of CIFC's Board, stated: "We are pleased to have reached this agreement with F.A.B., which follows a thorough review of strategic and financial alternatives that generated interest from over a dozen suitors.  Our Board concluded that this offer maximizes value for our shareholders and is in the best interests of our investors and clients."
Stephen Vaccaro, Co-President and Chief Investment Officer of CIFC, added, "We have spent the past 10 years building a robust and scalable U.S. private debt business. With the support of F.A.B., our company embarks on a new chapter of growth and product line expansion. We are thrilled to be able to tap into the extensive experience F.A.B. can contribute to our platform and regard F.A.B. as ideally positioned to help CIFC serve its clients, broaden its product offerings and achieve new milestones."
"CIFC is a leading private debt investment platform and one of the largest CLO managers in the industry and we are thrilled that this acquisition marks our first foray into the U.S. credit markets," said Michele Faissola, Co-Founding Partner of F.A.B. "CIFC's highly experienced investment team, institutional infrastructure and blue-chip client base, make them an ideal partner for us as we look to access the U.S. market for our clients. Our clients are committed to capitalizing on both current and future investment opportunities in the U.S. and we view CIFC as our beachhead into these exciting opportunities." 
Nizar Al-Bassam, Co-Founding Partner of F.A.B., added, "With this acquisition, we are thrilled to be backing a strong management team which we have gotten to know well throughout the strategic process. The depth and breadth of the team Steve and his partner, Oliver Wriedt, have built was a key consideration in our decision to choose the CIFC platform as our first major investment geared at accessing the U.S. market. We are looking forward to working alongside them to lead CIFC through its next phase of growth and development."
F.A.B. has secured the capital backing for the acquisition of CIFC from Supreme Universal Holdings Ltd, a company controlled by Qatar's royal family. 
The transaction has been approved by CIFC's Board of Directors. Columbus Nova, CIFC's majority shareholder, has agreed to vote its shares in favor of the transaction. The transaction, which is subject to approval by CIFC's shareholders, the satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, is expected to close this calendar year. 
J.P. Morgan Securities LLC is serving as exclusive financial advisor to CIFC and Dechert LLP and Latham & Watkins LLP are serving as legal counsel.  Moelis & Company LLC is acting as exclusive financial advisor to F.A.B., and Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP and Ernst & Young LLP are serving as legal advisor and accounting & tax advisor, respectively.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
