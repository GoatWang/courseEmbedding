Description



        		Other Notes
				
				

        For life science research only. Not for use in diagnostic procedures.
        

        		Principle
				
				

        BCIP is the AP-substrate which after dephosphorylation reacts further to give a dark-blue indigo dye as an oxidation product. INT is the oxidant producing a red dye.
        

        		Preparation Note
				
				

Working solution: Preparation of 10 ml Staining SolutionBring the stock solution to 15 to 25 °C until all components are dissolved.Add 75 μl of the stock solution to 10 ml 0.1 M Tris-buffer, pH 9.5, 0.05 M MgCl2, 0.1 M NaCl.Note: Prepare the staining solution shortly before use.Preparation of Additional Solutions RequiredBlocking solution: Dissolve 0.5 g Blocking Reagent in 100 ml TBS, pH 7.5, by heating to 50 to 60 °C (1 hour). Dissolving the components can be accelerated by sonication or by incubation in a microwave oven.Information Note: The solution remains turbid.
        

        		Physical form
				
				

        Solution of 33 mg/ml INT (2-[4-iodophenyl]-3-[4-nitrophenyl]-5-phenyltetrazolium chloride) and 33 mg/ml BCIP (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate, toluidine-salt in DMSO)
        

        		Application
				
				

        INT/BCIP Stock Solution is used for the sensitive detection of alkaline phosphatase (AP) in blotting protocols, that includes: • Southern blot• Western blot• immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistryIt has been used for colorogenic in situ hybridization.


        		General description
				
				

        BCIP (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl phosphate) is the AP (alkaline phosphatase)-substrate which after dephosphorylation reacts further to give a dark-blue indigo dye as an oxidation product. INT (iodonitrotetrazolium) is the oxidant producing a red dye. The reaction product has a reddish-brown color and is insoluble in water.
