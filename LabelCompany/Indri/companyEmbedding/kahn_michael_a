I was particularly impressed by Michael’s technical understanding of the product; he did a great job of providing technical guidance and oversight, as well as prioritizing activities of simultaneous projects with both internal and external engineering teams.  His level of dedication to the team and the project earned him great respect and he was able to contribute at the strategic level as well as manage the technical oversight as the project advanced.  Michael also provided a high level of collaboration with both our team and the external engineering teams.  I thoroughly enjoyed working with him.See moreSee lessIn the ever changing role of technical leadership for a budding business Michael was able to provide the needed high level planning and technical leadership as well as bringing a willingness and capability to get in the trenches to find a solution or drive to a root cause as issues arose.  Throughout this time Michael was directly involved in most of the technical work that was going on but was also skilled at identifying when other resources could be leveraged to great advantage and never showed hesitation to delegate where it made sense.  Michael is a positive asset to any team he is a part of and I would gladly work with him again in the future.See moreSee lessSign up to see who recommended MichaelGroupsElectrical & Computer Engineers | Big Data, Cloud, Mobile, Web, IoT, Wearable, ...Intermec AlumniElectronics EE Jobs EEE Software Engineer Tech Instrumentation Semiconductor ElectronicsJobs.comEmbedded Systems GroupEngineering Career Opportunities (Jobs & Employment)Electronic hardware/software(firmware) designers(CHIPRIGHT.COM Sponsors this group)Firmware / Embedded SoftwareSee 2 moreTechnical Project Manager JobsLinked:SeattleSee lessView Michael’s full profile to...See who you know in commonGet introducedContact Michael directlyView Michael’s Full ProfileNot the Michael you’re looking for?

Merit Industries, Inc. v. JVL Corporation: Represented JVL over the course of a five-year case in which Merit alleged JVL’s entire product line infringed three Merit patents. A federal jury found that none of JVL’s current products infringed any Merit patent, invalidated many of the asserted claims and denied Merit’s demand for lost profits, awarding instead only a token sum (less than seven percent of what was sought) for reasonable royalties for infringement by a subset of JVL’s past products.
Analog Devices, Inc. v. Linear Technology Corporation; Represented Linear Technology in a patent infringement action relating to various patents on analog integrated circuitry. Along with denying that it had infringed any of Analog’s three asserted patents, our client counterclaimed for patent infringement based on eight of Linear’s U.S. patents. We settled the matter favorably for our client.
VLT, Inc. v. Lucent Technologies, Inc.: Represented Lucent in a patent infringement action concerning a patent related to voltage regulator circuits. We settled the matter favorably for our client.
