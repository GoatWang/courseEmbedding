Regulatory and Accounting Data
Content and Data







                Regulation-ready data            

Bloomberg Regulatory & Accounting Products enable risk, compliance, asset managers, insurers accountants and other financial organizations to navigate the increasingly complex liquidity, regulatory and accounting disclosure environment.
Bloomberg solutions help firms leverage their data capital to ease the burden of regulatory compliance while remaining confident the data they use is regulation-ready. By feeding high-quality data to multiple enterprise systems, risk departments can ensure proper risk management at the firm and portfolio-level. And because Bloomberg’s Regulatory & Accounting Products leverage the same data integrated into the Bloomberg Terminal, risk and compliance operations can expect data consistency.








                Trading and monitoring            

Trading and monitoring
Global regulations put in place over the last decade emphasize the need for trade compliance throughout the trade lifecycle. Regulators are asking firms to perform pre-trade analysis, execute trades in a transparent manner, and perform post-trade checks.
BASEL III | Collateral Tagging Solution
Basel III mandated global standards on the levels and types of collateral banks are required to hold, as well as segregation arrangements designed to ensure timely and accurate separation of collateral for non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives.
Bloomberg’s Collateral Tagging solution provides customers with an efficient mechanism to determine, classify and comply with the collateral eligibility requirements of the non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives margin rule across various global regimes. The solution is based on extrapolating the regulatory requirements, regulatory expertise and industry feedback, thus providing a standardized, accurate and consistent classification and haircut for eligible collateral across the industry, eliminating the guesswork for the firms’ capital and collateral managers.
Dodd-Frank/Volcker Rule | Covered Funds Solution
The Volcker Rule requires all U.S. banks and foreign banking organizations (FBOs) to divest ownership interest in “covered funds”. These funds may include hedge funds, private equity funds, collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) and other securitizations.
Bloomberg’s Covered Funds solution helps institutions identify covered funds affected by the Volcker Rule quickly and efficiently with minimal manual effort. Built in conjunction with industry stakeholders, our identification solution uses nearly 30 data fields to automatically extract pertinent details from Securitization, CLO and CDO deal documents, and classify securities against the requirements of the Volcker Rule covered funds regulations.
MiFID II | MiFID II Transparency Solution
MiFID II aims to increase transparency in the fixed income and OTC markets, as well as improve business and investor protection practices.
Bloomberg’s MiFID II transparency solution provides an automated data feed with 120 fields covering approximately seven million instruments across numerous asset classes, helping support firms’ MiFID II obligations for both pre- and post-trade transparency.

                Capital and liquidity            

In an effort to ensure that firms reduce systemic risk, regulators have imposed stricter risk management and capital adequacy measures. Firms are now required to calculate and manage capital ratios; perform risk calculation and reporting; carry out stress tests based on the scenarios prescribed by SEC 22e-4, CCAR, FINRA and ECB/EBA guidelines; classify eligible liquid assets; and quantify liquidity risk to support liquidity ratio calculations (e.g. LCR and NSFR).
SEC 22e-4 | Liquidity Assessment Solution
Bloomberg Liquidity Assessment (LQA) is an award-winning solution that enables you to quantitatively evaluate market liquidity across multiple asset classes, including government and agency debt, corporate bonds, municipal bonds, global equities and ETFs. Bloomberg LQA meets the regulatory requirements of SEC 22e-4 and adds value to risk management and investment processes, using a data-driven approach so you can evaluate liquidity across your enterprise. Covering 1.1 million global securities, LQA provides the fund industry with a best-practice approach to assess market liquidity and to consistently evaluate, manage and report liquidity risk across multi-asset-class portfolios.
BASEL III | High-Quality Liquid Assets Solution
One of the key reforms of Basel III is the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) that requires banks to hold an adequate amount of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) that can be converted easily and immediately into cash in private markets.
Bloomberg’s HQLA solution offers a set of data points to assist clients in complying with Basel III’s LCR requirements and regulatory reporting (e.g. FR 2052a reporting in the U.S. and Common Reporting (COREP) in the EU). This data, which firms can also leverage for calculating their standardized credit risk capital requirements, is available via Bloomberg’s enterprise data feed, which supports both batch requests as well as bulk offerings. Our HQLA solution is scalable and can be customized to clients’ specific needs.
BASEL III | Central Bank Eligibility Solution
Among major central banks, there are no consistent standards for securities accepted as eligible collateral. Some central banks provide detailed lists of eligible securities while others offer only basic guidelines.
Central Bank Eligibility (CBE) data from Bloomberg eliminates the need for this repetitive, manual process. It provides essential details about all securities accepted as collateral by 14 major global central banks. Bloomberg updates the list of eligible assets daily with haircuts and delivers a consolidated enterprise data feed for each asset category. The data is also available on a per-security basis.
BASEL III | SSFA for Securitizations
All banks with more than $50 billion in total assets must adopt the SSFA to calculate risk and capital adequacy. The new requirements measure a combination of the collateral performance and structural integrity of every securitization, including mortgage- and asset-backed securities.
Bloomberg’s solution assists banks in calculating risk-weights and capital adequacy requirements in accordance with U.S. Basel III Simplified Supervisory Formula Approach. It provides the final securitization risk weight factor (SRWF) for non-agency MBS, CMBS and ABS. SSFA calculations are extremely data-intensive, requiring both structural and collateral database as well as the ability to compute very large amounts of data.
Bloomberg’s SSFA uses the 11 data fields needed to calculate the securitization risk weight factor for RMBS, CMBS and ABS according to Basel III. Bloomberg offers SSFA analytics on more than 100,000 structured products across RMBS, CMBS and ABS. This information can be provided in a bulk push delivery for wider coverage and as a per-security pull (on Terminal) for targeted security populations
Solvency II | Solvency II Solution
Solvency II requires EU insurers to assess different types of balance sheet risks and maintain a minimum solvency level.
Bloomberg’s solution delivers the data fields required for the QRT reporting of the asset exposures. The solution combines high quality reference data with proven expertise in Solvency II taxonomy, giving insurers a faster and more cost effective way of maintaining Pillar III compliance. The solution provides approximately 130 data fields that are mapped to the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority’s (EIOPA) Quantitative Reporting Templates (QRT) for insurers. These fields are also mapped to the Tripartite template, so that insurers’ asset managers can also provide data for Pillar III reporting. The data is delivered on a per-security basis.
FRTB | FRTB Solution
The Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB) is the biggest global sell-side regulatory change in more than two decades, completely overhauling the framework for market risk. The pressure is on for hundreds of banks to decide on an FRTB solution in 2017 in order to gain regulatory approval before the 2019 deadline.
A comprehensive suite of solutions enables you to meet all aspects of the FRTB requirements, ranging from calculation engines to “real price” data repositories. Whether you require FRTB-ready data, a reliable risk analytics engine, or a full end-to-end workflow, Bloomberg can customize a package to meet your needs. New capabilities include regulatory capital calculations for both standardized and internal model approaches, as well as risk factor mapping and modellable risk factor determination—all powered by Bloomberg pricing and market data.
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) | CCA Calculation Services Solution
Due to heightened regulatory standards the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) either mandates (for complex banks) or suggests (for non-complex banks) usage of both primary/champion models as well as benchmark/challenger models in the Capital Planning Process.
Bloomberg supports specific quantitative components of Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) by allowing customers to utilize Bloomberg Calculation Service to input their own custom data for each scenario and leverage Bloomberg’s Market Leading Analytics to get back critical modeled data, such as projected cash flows, that are required for CCAR stress testing.








                Tax and accounting            

To maintain transparency in capital markets, regulators require firms to provide detailed information on their trading systems; trade and valuation reporting; capital plan; and accounting approaches. This is mandated globally, from SEC and FINRA in the U. S. to EBA and ESMA in Europe, with regulations including EMIR, AIFMD, Form PF, EBA Prudent Valuation and more.
IFRS 9 | SPPI and Expected Credit Loss Solution
In July 2014, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, replacing IAS 39. The standard updates the model for balance sheet classification and measurement of financial instruments, impairment of financial securities, and hedge accounting. IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted.
Bloomberg’s IFRS 9 SPPI Test solution assists clients in performing the contractual cash flows test required by the updated IFRS 9 classification and measurement model. The solution automates the process of reviewing individual security prospectuses and legal documents by scanning over 70 unique security attributes for each financial instrument and identifying potentially non-SPPI features or cash flows.
Intesa Sanpaolo Selects Bloomberg IFRS 9 SPPI Data to Streamline Adoption of New Accounting Standard. View the press announcement.
Our Expected Credit Loss (ECL) accounting solution saves you significant time, money and manpower, not as a one-off, but continuously, as credit risk models need to be validated and enhanced annually. With Bloomberg, you no longer need to hire large numbers of credit risk personnel, build credit risk models or bolster the accounting department’s resources to interpret and implement IFRS 9 components. Bloomberg’s ECL solution is an implementation-ready product that provides the necessary transparency to management.
IAS / GAAP | Fair Value Hierarchy Leveling Tool Solution
Effective 2011, any reporting entity that is subject to IAS (International Accounting Standards) or U.S. GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) has to disclose assets in the fair value hierarchy.
Bloomberg’s Fair Value Hierarchy Leveling Tool (FVHL Tool) enables clients to customize and store their own rules to determine fair value leveling results, either 1, 2 or 3, at a certain point in time, while aligning with the high quality, independent evaluated price provided by Bloomberg Valuation Service (BVAL). The market data used to drive the FVHL Tool is the identical underlying data used by BVAL to price each fixed income security. The FVHL Tool helps clients respond to the accounting requirements set forth by ASC 820 and IFRS 13 as they extend beyond the original fair value reporting standards FAS 157 and IAS 39.
ASC 820 & IFRS 13| Pricing Transparency Solution
The accounting standards ASC 820 Fair Value Measurement in the U.S. and IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement internationally require increased disclosures around the sources, inputs and methodology used to calculate the fair value of financial instruments presented in the financial statements. A key component of both of these standards is the requirement for companies to include a “leveling” table in the notes to the financial statements, which classifies all investments presented at fair value as Level 1, 2 or 3, based on the significance of unobservable inputs.
Bloomberg’s Pricing Transparency & Leveling tools provide an objective, consistent and defensible solution for many of the regulatory and accounting issues facing our clients today by exposing the underlying market data used in the BVAL pricing models.
IRS Section 871(m) Solution
The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulation under Section 871(m) requires withholding on certain notional principal contracts, derivatives and other equity-linked instruments with payments that reference dividends on U.S. equity securities and indices. Withholding is required when those amounts are paid to a non-U.S. person. Contracts linked to equity indexes are deemed to be in scope based on whether the index is categorized as “qualified” or “non-qualified”. In addition, the delta of a contract at issuance (the ratio comparing the change in price of an underlying asset to the change in price of a derivative) must be 0.8 or higher.
Discover how 871(m) will impact your day-to-day operations. Bloomberg’s data solution for 871(m) facilitates identification of in-scope instruments, providing high quality delta calculations and test indices for qualification.
Stamp Act Solution
Handling taxes imposed by global authorities can be a serious challenge for financial firms. Many international broker dealers and wealth managers, for example, deal with tax-eligible securities on behalf of clients but remain responsible for remitting payments to relevant authorities. To streamline this process, firms first need an efficient and dependable way to identify tax- and levy-eligible instruments and map them to security databases. This requires both a comprehensive security master database and the ability to monitor daily fluctuations in eligibility as new listings and de-listings take place.
Bloomberg’s Stamp Tax solution helps financial firms identify eligible instruments quickly, accurately and dynamically. Drawing on Bloomberg’s vast data resources, this solution provides updated eligibility data at the security level. It offers complete mapping between the relevant tax datasets and our comprehensive reference database, which helps ensure extensive coverage of eligible securities. With this daily file, firms gain access to the data required to calculate payments properly, comply with tax requirements and avoid unexpected liability.
FATCA Solution
The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) requires foreign financial institutions (FFIs) to register and report information about U.S. taxpayers to the IRS. In addition, FFIs must either withhold tax on transactions that involve specific eligible instruments or pay an equivalent penalty.
The Bloomberg FATCA withholding solution offers a more streamlined approach for FFIs. Drawing on our unparalleled data resources—including industry-standard terms and conditions, corporate actions and entity data—the solution provides FATCA-specific, security-level details for instruments across fixed income, equity, muni and mortgage asset classes. Consolidating this data in one solution helps firms identify affected instruments quickly and accurately.
