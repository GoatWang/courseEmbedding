Testimonials

“Our company has been so satisfied with the quality of the food produced, and the fantastic service from everybody at Abbruzzi’s. From the order taking to the finished product, Abbruzzi’s is second to none! Their hot foods are so delicious, there are never any leftovers! People go back for seconds and thirds! And the hoagies and salads are so fresh and so delicious, there is never any food to clean up! There is no comparison! Abbruzzi’s is #1 in our book! Thank you, Abbruzzi’s!”
— Rosalyn D. O’Hara, Cannon Solutions America
“A friendly market with one of the best Italian hoagies I’ve ever gotten in South Jersey. Anybody who knows about hoagies knows that it’s not just having high-quality meats, but the bread is one of the most important parts of the sandwich and they get it right on both parts. While waiting for my order I was tempted by the selection of side dishes at the counter and ready to heat stromboli. They also have a nice selection of cheeses and other Italian delicacies. I just went in for a sandwich and left with a bag full. It really reminded me of a little slice of South Philly.”
— Joseph R.  Yelp Review
“I’m not one for the chain sub shops & try to keep my money local. As a transplanted New Yorker from the Bronx, I figured it had to be good with a name like Abbruzzi’s. I tried their 10″ Original Abbruzzi’s Special with prosciutto, sopresatta, provolone, roasted peppers & tomatoes. I was not disappointed. My only wish is that I should have ordered 2. Looking forward to my next lunchtime excursion to try something new.”
— Rob S.  Yelp Review
“I am drooling while writing this review.  It’s everything you could want in a sandwich – roasted peppers, broccoli rabe, roasted pork, garlic, and great bread.  Took coworkers here since I am the “find us lunch” guy.  I wanted to show off some good subs to one of my coworkers who only had heard about jersey food.  This place rocks, that’s all there is to say.  The only thing I found weird was each of us were asked to use cash instead of cc, which I can see because of the charges, but still.  Don’t miss this place if you’re in the area and never tried it.”
— Greg O.  Yelp Review
“The hoagies are excellent. Not as big as Primos but the rolls and ingredients are as good as they come. Hot roast pork sandwich  is great too. Great strombolis especially the prosciutto roasted peppers and cheese.”
— Paul W.  Yelp Review

Reference NPI Information

Description





                                NPI
                            

                                1629034905
                            

                                10-position all-numeric identification number assigned by the NPS to uniquely identify a health care provider.
                            



                                Entity Type
                            

                                Individual
                            

                                Code describing the type of health care provider that is being assigned an NPI. Codes are:

1 = (Person): individual human being who furnishes health care;
2 = (Non-person): entity other than an individual human being that furnishes health care (for example, hospital, SNF, hospital subunit, pharmacy, or HMO).





                                Is Sole Proprietor
                            

                                N
                            

                                Indicate whether provider is a sole proprietor.

A sole proprietor is the sole (the only) owner of a business that is not incorporated; that unincorporated business is a sole proprietorship.
In a sole proprietorship, the sole proprietor owns all of the assets of the business and is solely liable for all of the debts of the business.
There is no difference between a sole proprietorship and a sole proprietor; they are legally a single entity: an individual.
In terms of NPI assignment, a sole proprietor is an Entity type 1 (Individual) and is eligible for only one NPI (the sole proprietorship business is not eligible for its own NPI).
As an individual, a sole proprietorship cannot be a subpart and cannot have subparts. (See NPI Final Rule for information about subparts.)
A sole proprietorship may or may not have employees.
Often, the IRS assigns an EIN to a sole proprietorship in order to protect the sole proprietor's SSN from disclosure in claims or on W-2s. NPPES does not capture a sole proprietorship's EIN.
Many types of health care providers could be sole proprietorships (for example, group practices, pharmacies, home health agencies).

                                The last name of the provider (if an individual). If the provider is an individual, this is the legal name. This name must match the name on file with the Social Security Administration (SSA). In addition, the date of birth must match that on file with SSA.

The First, Middle, Last and Credential(s) fields allow the following special characters: ampersand, apostrophe, colon, comma, forward slash, hyphen, left and right parentheses, period, pound sign, quotation mark, and semi-colon.

Nice comfy T shirt



July 23, 2017 by


FirstReviewer




I love how this T shirt fit to my body. I want to have a one which nicely hug my body. However, the material contains 7% spandex which makes the t shirt feel weird. Anyhow, I will still keep this one.
