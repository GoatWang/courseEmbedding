THE CERTIFICATES

Section 3.1 Initial
Certificate Ownership . Since the formation of the Trust by the
contribution by the Depositor pursuant to Section 2.5 ,
the Depositor has been the sole beneficial owner of the
Trust.

Section 3.2 Book-Entry
Certificates .

(a) Each of the Certificates, upon
original issuance, shall be issued in the form of Exhibit A
hereto, representing Definitive Certificates.

(b) At the election of the
Certificateholder, the Definitive Certificates issued pursuant to
Section 3.2(a) may be exchanged for Book-Entry
Certificates, to be delivered to the Owner Trustee, as agent for
the Clearing Agency, by, or on behalf of, the Trust. The Book-Entry
Certificates shall be issued in an aggregate nominal principal
amount of $100,000, and all beneficial interests in the Book-Entry
Certificates shall be owned, in the minimum principal amount of
$1,100 and integral multiples of $1 in excess thereof. The Trust
shall not issue any Certificate that would cause the aggregate
nominal principal amount of all Certificates to exceed $100,000, or
100 units, without the prior written consent of all
Certificateholders. No distributions of moneys to the
Certificateholders under the Basic Documents shall be deemed to
reduce the nominal principal amount of any Certificate prior to
payment in full of all Notes; provided , however ,
that the final aggregate $100,000 distributed to the
Certificateholders under the Basic Documents upon final
distribution of the Trust Estate and termination of the Trust
pursuant to Section 7.1 shall be deemed to repay the
aggregate nominal principal amount of the Certificates in full; and
provided , further , that any failure to pay in full
the nominal principal amount of a Certificate on such final
distribution date shall not result in any recourse to, claim
against or liability of any Person for such shortfall. Any amounts
payable to the Certificateholders on or in respect of the
Certificates under the Basic Documents shall be paid and allocated
to the various Certificateholders ratably based on their respective
Percentage Interests. Such Book-Entry Certificates shall initially
be registered on the Certificate Register in the name of the
Certificate Depository (initially, Cede & Co.), and no
Certificate Owner shall receive a Definitive Certificate
representing such Certificate Owner’s interest in such
Book-Entry Certificate, except as provided in
Section 3.12 . After such time as Book-Entry
Certificates have been issued and unless and until Definitive
Certificates have been issued to the applicable Certificateholders
pursuant to Section 3.12 in exchange for the Book-Entry
Certificates:

(i) the provisions of this Section
shall be in full force and effect;
 
5



(ii) the Certificate Registrar, the
Paying Agent and the Owner Trustee shall be entitled to deal with
the Clearing Agency for all purposes of this Agreement (including
the payment of amounts payable under the Basic Documents and the
giving of instructions or directions hereunder) as the sole
Certificateholders, and shall have no obligation to the Certificate
Owners;

(iii) to the extent that the
provisions of this Section conflict with any other provisions of
this Agreement, the provisions of this Section shall
control;

(iv) the rights of Certificate
Owners shall be exercised only through the Clearing Agency and
shall be limited to those established by law and agreements between
or among such Certificate Owners and the Clearing Agency or the
Clearing Agency Participants or Persons acting through Clearing

Agreement, unless and until Definitive Certificates are issued
pursuant to Section 3.12 , the initial Clearing Agency
shall make book-entry transfers among the Clearing Agency
Participants and receive and transmit payments due under the Basic
Documents with regard to the Certificates to such Clearing Agency
Participants;

(v) whenever this Agreement requires
or permits actions to be taken based upon instructions or
directions of Certificateholders evidencing a specified Percentage
Interest, the Clearing Agency shall deliver instructions to the
Owner Trustee only to the extent that it has received instructions
to such effect from Certificate Owners or Clearing Agency
Participants or Persons acting through Clearing Agency Participants
owning or representing, respectively, such required percentage of
the beneficial interest in the Book-Entry Certificates;

(vi) owners of a beneficial interest
in a Book-Entry Certificate shall not be entitled to have any
portion of a Book-Entry Certificate registered in their names and
shall not be considered to be the Certificateholders of any
Book-Entry Certificates under this Trust Agreement; and

(vii) payments on a Book-Entry
Certificate shall be made to the Clearing Agency, or its nominee,
as the registered owner thereof, and none of the Trust, the Owner
Trustee or the Paying Agent shall have any responsibility or
liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments
made on account of beneficial ownership interests in a Book-Entry
Certificate or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any
records relating to the beneficial ownership interests.

(c) Notwithstanding any provision to
the contrary herein, so long as a Book-Entry Certificate remains
outstanding and is held by or on behalf of the Clearing Agency,
transfers of a Book-Entry Certificate, in whole or in part, shall
only be made in accordance with Section 3.4 . Subject
to Section 3.4 , transfers of a Book-Entry Certificate
shall be limited to transfers of such Book-Entry Certificate in
whole, but not in part, to a nominee of the Clearing Agency or to a
successor of the Clearing Agency or such successor’s
nominee.

(d) In the event that a Book-Entry
Certificate is exchanged for one or more Definitive Certificates
pursuant to Section 3.12 , such Certificates may be
exchanged for one another only in accordance with the provisions of
this Agreement and with such procedures as may be from time to time
adopted by the Trust and the Owner Trustee.

(e) The Certificates shall represent
the entire beneficial interest in the Trust. The Certificates shall
be executed on behalf of the Trust by manual or facsimile signature
of a Responsible Officer of the Owner Trustee. Certificates bearing
the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were, at the
time when such signatures shall have been affixed, authorized to
sign on behalf of the Trust, shall be duly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable beneficial interests in the Trust, notwithstanding
that such individuals or any of them shall have ceased to be so
authorized prior to the authentication and delivery of such
Certificates or did not hold such offices at the date of
authentication and delivery of such Certificates.

(f) The Certificates shall be
typewritten, printed, lithographed or engraved or produced by any
combination of these methods (with or without steel engraved

Certificates, as evidenced by their execution of such Certificates.
The Certificates shall be issued in fully-registered form in the
minimum denomination of a 1.10% Percentage Interest.

(g) The terms of the Certificates
set forth in Exhibit A shall form part of this Agreement.
Certificate Owners, by their acceptance of a beneficial interest in
a Book-Entry Certificate, shall be deemed to have made the
representations and agreements set forth in Exhibit A . Each
transferee of a beneficial interest in a Certificate shall deliver
an undertaking letter in the form attached hereto as Exhibit
C to the Owner Trustee and the Depositor.

Section 3.3 Execution,
Authentication and Delivery . Concurrently with the sale of the
Receivables to the Trust pursuant to the Trust Sale and Servicing
Agreement, the Owner Trustee shall cause a single Certificate
representing the entire beneficial interest in the Trust to be
executed on behalf of the Trust, authenticated and delivered to or
upon the written order of the Depositor, signed by its chairman of
the board, its president or any vice president, without further
limited liability company action by the Depositor. Such Certificate
shall be issued to and held by the Depositor, as the initial
Certificateholder. No Certificate shall entitle its holder to any
benefit under this Agreement, or shall be valid for any purpose,
unless there shall appear on such Certificate a certificate of
authentication substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit
A , executed by the Owner Trustee or the Owner Trustee’s
authenticating agent, by manual signature. Such authentication
shall constitute conclusive evidence that such Certificate shall
have been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. All
Certificates shall be dated the date of their
authentication.

Section 3.4 Registration of
Certificates; Registration of Transfer and Exchange of
Certificates .

(a) The Certificate Registrar, as an
agent of the Trust, shall keep or cause to be kept, at the office
or agency maintained pursuant to Section 3.8 , a
Certificate Register in which, subject to such reasonable
regulations as it may prescribe, the Owner Trustee shall provide
for the registration of Certificates and of transfers and exchanges
of Certificates as provided herein. BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware
shall be the initial Certificate Registrar. Upon any resignation of
a Certificate Registrar, the Owner Trustee shall promptly appoint a
successor
 
7


or, if it elects not to make such an
appointment, assume the duties of Certificate Registrar. The
entries in the Certificate Register shall be conclusive absent
manifest error, and the Trust and Owner Trustee shall treat each
Person whose name is recorded in the Certificate Register pursuant
to the terms hereof as a Certificateholder hereunder for all
purposes of this Trust Agreement. This Section 3.4
shall be construed so that the Certificates under this Trust
Agreement are at all times maintained in “registered
form” within the meaning of Section 5f.103-1(c) of the
United States Treasury Regulations. The Certificate Registrar shall
record (a) the Percentage Interest in all of the assets of and
the right to distributions from the Trust evidenced by each
Certificate and (b) all distributions made to each
Certificateholder with respect to the Trust’s
assets.

(b) Any Certificateholder may at any
time, without consent of the Noteholders, sell, transfer, convey or
assign in any manner its rights to and interests in the
Certificates (including its right to distributions from the Reserve
Account), provided that: (A)(i) such transfer, conveyance or
assignment is made to the Depositor or such entity pledges its
rights and interests in the Certificates or (B) (i) such
action will not result in a reduction or withdrawal of the rating
of any class of Notes, (ii) such transferee or assignee agrees
to take positions for tax purposes consistent with the tax
positions agreed to be taken by the Certificateholder,
(iii) the conditions set forth in Section 3.4(g)

connection with any transfer of less than all of the interests in
the Certificates, the transferor and transferee shall specify the
respective interests in the Certificates to be held by the
transferor and transferee, which interests may be determined by a
formula or on any other basis agreed by the transferor and
transferee; and provided , further , that no Retained
Certificate shall be sold, transferred, conveyed or assigned unless
counsel satisfactory to the Owner Trustee and the Certificate
Registrar has rendered an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that
(1) such sale, transfer, conveyance or assignment by the
Depositor would not cause the Trust to fail to qualify as a grantor
trust for United States federal income tax purposes and
(2) all Retained Notes will be characterized as indebtedness
for United States federal income tax purposes, provided ,
that the opinion required by clause (2)  shall not be
required if, prior to the date of the effectiveness of such sale,
transfer, conveyance or assignment by the Depositor, the Owner
Trustee and the Certificate Registrar have received an Opinion of
Counsel to the effect that all Retained Notes will be characterized
as indebtedness for United States federal income tax purposes. In
addition, (i) such sale, pledge or other transfer is made to a
person whom the transferor reasonably believes is a
“qualified institutional buyer” (as defined in Rule
144A), acting for its own account (and not for the account of
others) or as a fiduciary or agent for others (which others also
are “qualified institutional buyers”) to whom notice is
given that the sale, pledge or other transfer is being made in
reliance on Rule 144A, (ii) such sale, pledge or other
transfer occurs outside of the United States to a Non-U.S. Person
in accordance with Rule 903 or Rule 904 of Regulation S of the
Securities Act and that person delivers any necessary
certifications pursuant to this Agreement, or (iii) such sale,
pledge or other transfer is otherwise made in a transaction exempt
from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, in which
case, (A) the Owner Trustee shall require that both the
prospective transferor and the prospective transferee certify to
the Owner Trustee and the Depositor in writing the facts
surrounding such transfer, which certification shall be in form and
substance satisfactory to the Owner Trustee and the Depositor, and
(B) the Owner Trustee shall require a written opinion of
counsel (which shall not be at the expense of the Depositor, the
Administrator, the Servicer, the Trust or the Owner Trustee),
satisfactory to the Depositor and the Owner Trustee to the effect
that such transfer will not violate the Securities Act. The Owner
Trustee may conclusively rely upon advice of the Depositor in
reviewing the form and substance of the certifications and opinions
required by Section 3.4(b)(B)(iii).
 
8



(c) In the event that the Depositor
is no longer the sole Certificateholder, the Administrator will
promptly prepare amendments (subject to the provisions regarding
amendments in the applicable Basic Documents) to the Basic
Documents to the extent necessary to reflect the establishment of
the Certificate Distribution Account and the making of
distributions to the Certificateholders and such other matters as
shall be agreed between the Depositor and the Owner Trustee. The
expense of the foregoing amendments shall be paid by the
Administrator.

(d) Upon surrender for registration
of transfer of any Certificate at the office or agency maintained
pursuant to Section 3.8 , the Owner Trustee shall
execute on behalf of the Trust, authenticate and deliver (or shall
cause its authenticating agent to authenticate and deliver), in the
name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new
Certificates of a like aggregate Percentage Interest in the Trust
dated the date of authentication by the Owner Trustee or any
authenticating agent.

(e) At the option of a Holder,
Certificates may be exchanged for other Certificates of a like
aggregate Percentage Interest in the Trust, as shown on the
applicable Certificates, upon surrender of the Certificates to be
exchanged at the office or agency maintained pursuant to
Section 3.8 . Whenever any Certificates are so
surrendered for exchange, the Owner Trustee shall execute on behalf
of the Trust, authenticate and deliver (or shall cause its
authenticating agent to authenticate and deliver) one or more
Certificates dated the date of authentication by the Owner Trustee
or any authenticating agent. Such Certificates shall be delivered
to the Holder making the exchange.

(f) Every Certificate presented or
surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall be
accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form
satisfactory to the Owner Trustee and the Certificate Registrar
duly executed by the Holder or his attorney duly authorized in
writing and such other documents and instruments as may be required
by Section 3.4(b) . Each Certificate surrendered for
registration of transfer or exchange shall be canceled and
subsequently destroyed or otherwise disposed of by the Owner
Trustee or Certificate Registrar in accordance with its customary
practice.

(g) The Owner Trustee or the
Certificate Registrar may require payment of a sum sufficient to
cover any tax or governmental charge that may be imposed and any
other expenses of the Owner Trustee in connection with any transfer
or exchange of Certificates.

(h) The Certificates may not be
acquired by or for the account of a Benefit Plan other than an
“insurance company general account,” as defined in
Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption 95-60, whose underlying
assets include less than 25% plan assets and for which the purchase
and holding of Certificates is eligible and satisfies all
conditions for relief under Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption
95-60. The Certificates also may not be acquired by or for the
account of an employee benefit plan or plan that is not subject to
the provisions of Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code
(including non-U.S. or governmental plans) if such acquisition
would result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under, or a
violation of, any applicable law that is substantially similar to
Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code.

(i) Each Certificateholder that is a
United States person (as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the

Administrator on or prior to the date such person becomes a
Certificateholder under this Agreement (and from time to time
thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Owner Trustee, Paying
Agent, or the Administrator), executed originals of Internal
Revenue Service Form W-9 certifying that such Certificateholder is

W-8ECI, and to the extent such Certificateholder is not the
beneficial owner of the Certificate, Internal Revenue Service Form

a United States person (as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of
the Code) and provides an Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or
W-8BEN-E, as applicable (or Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY
accompanied with a Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or
W-8BEN-E, as applicable) under this Section 3.4(i) in
order to claim the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest
under Section 881(c) of the Code (instead of, for example,
claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United
States is a party), such Certificateholder (or in the case of a
Certificateholder providing such Internal Revenue Service Form
W-8IMY, the beneficial owner of the Certificate) hereby represents
and warrants that it is not a (i) “bank” within
the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code,
(ii) “10 percent shareholder” of the Trust within
the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code or

beneficial owner of a Certificate that would be subject to U.S.
federal withholding tax imposed by FATCA if such person were to
fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA
(including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of
the Code, as applicable), shall deliver to the Owner Trustee,
Paying Agent, Administrator or any person designated by any of the
foregoing (individually or collectively as the context may require,
the “ FATCA Administrator ”) at the time or
times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably
requested by the FATCA Administrator such documentation prescribed
by applicable law (including as prescribed by
Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional
documentation reasonably requested by the FATCA Administrator to
comply with FATCA and to determine that such Certificateholder or
beneficial owner of a Certificate has complied with such
person’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount
to deduct and withhold from such payment to such person.

(k) No transfer of a Certificate
shall be permitted if such transfer is effected through an
established securities market or secondary market (or the
substantial equivalent thereof) within the meaning of
Section 7704 of the Code and any regulation
thereunder.
 
10



(l) Each transferee of a Certificate
understands that the Certificates are being offered only in a
transaction not involving any public offering in the United States
within the meaning of the Securities Act, none of the Certificates
have been or will be registered under the Securities Act, and, if
in the future the transferee decides to offer, resell, pledge or
otherwise transfer the Certificates, such Certificates may only be
offered, resold, pledged or otherwise transferred in accordance
with this Agreement and the applicable legend on such Certificates
set forth below.

(m) Each transferee of a Certificate
understands that an investment in the Certificates involves certain

(a) If (i) any mutilated
Certificate is surrendered to the Certificate Registrar, or the
Certificate Registrar receives evidence to its satisfaction of the
destruction, loss or theft of any Certificate, and (ii) there
is delivered to the Certificate Registrar, the Owner Trustee and
the Trust such security or indemnity as may be required by them to
hold each of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the
Certificate Registrar or the Owner Trustee that such Certificate
has been acquired by a protected purchaser, the Owner Trustee shall
execute on behalf of the Trust and the Owner Trustee shall
authenticate and deliver (or shall cause its authenticating agent
to authenticate and deliver), in exchange for or in lieu of any
such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate, a
replacement Certificate of a like aggregate Percentage Interest in
the Trust, as shown on the Certificate; provided ,
however , that if any such destroyed, lost or stolen
Certificate, but not a mutilated Certificate, shall have become or
within seven (7) days shall be payable, then instead of
issuing a replacement Certificate the Owner Trustee may make
distributions to such destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate when so
payable.

(b) If, after the delivery of a
replacement Certificate or payment in respect of a destroyed, lost
or stolen Certificate pursuant to Section 3.5(a) , a
protected purchaser of the original Certificate in lieu of which
such replacement Certificate was issued presents for payment or
distribution such original Certificate, the Owner Trustee shall be
entitled to recover such replacement Certificate (and any
distributions or payments made with respect thereto) or such
payment or distribution from the Person to whom it was delivered or
any Person taking such replacement Certificate from such Person to
whom such replacement Certificate was delivered or any assignee of
such Person, except a protected purchaser, and shall be entitled to
recover upon the security or indemnity provided therefor to the
extent of any loss, damage, cost or expense incurred by the Owner
Trustee in connection therewith.

(c) In connection with the issuance
of any replacement Certificate under this Section 3.5 ,
the Owner Trustee may require the payment by the Holder of such
Certificate of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other
governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any
other reasonable expenses (including the fees and expenses of the
Owner Trustee and the Certificate Registrar) connected
therewith.

(d) Any duplicate Certificate issued
pursuant to this Section 3.5 in replacement of any
mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate shall constitute
an original additional beneficial interest in the Trust, whether or
not the mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate shall be
found at any time or be enforced by anyone, and shall be entitled
to all the benefits of this Agreement equally and proportionately
with any and all other Certificates duly issued
hereunder.

(e) The provisions of this
Section 3.5 are exclusive and shall preclude (to the
extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the
replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen
Certificates.

Section 3.6 Persons Deemed
Certificateholders . Subject to the provisions of
Section 3.4 herein, prior to due presentation of a Certificate
for registration of transfer, the Owner Trustee or the Certificate
Registrar may treat the Person in whose name any Certificate shall
be
 
13


registered in the Certificate Register as the
Certificateholder of such Certificate for the purpose of receiving
distributions pursuant to Article V and for all other
purposes whatsoever, and neither the Owner Trustee nor the
Certificate Registrar shall be affected by any notice to the
contrary.

Section 3.7 Access to List
of Certificateholders’ Names and Addresses . The
Certificate Registrar shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the
Servicer and the Depositor, within fifteen (15) days after
receipt by the Certificate Registrar of a request therefor from the
Servicer or the Depositor in writing, a list of the names and
addresses of the Certificateholders as of the most recent Record
Date. Each Holder, by receiving and holding a Certificate, shall be
deemed to have agreed not to hold any of the Servicer, the
Depositor, the Certificate Registrar or the Owner Trustee
accountable by reason of the disclosure of its name and address,
regardless of the source from which such information was
derived.

Section 3.8 Maintenance of
Corporate Trust Office . The Owner Trustee shall maintain an
office or offices or agency or agencies where Certificates may be
surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange and where
notices and demands to or upon the Owner Trustee in respect of the
Certificates and the Basic Documents may be served. The Owner
Trustee initially designates its office located at 301 Bellevue
Parkway, 3rd Floor, Wilmington, Delaware 19809, as its principal
office for such purposes. The Owner Trustee shall give prompt
written notice to the Depositor, to the Servicer and to the
Certificateholders of any change in the location of the Certificate
Register or any such office or agency.

Section 3.9 Appointment of
Paying Agent . Except as otherwise provided in
Section 5.2 , the Paying Agent shall make distributions
to Certificateholders from the Certificate Distribution Account
pursuant to Section 5.2 and shall report the amounts of
such distributions to the Owner Trustee and the Servicer;
provided , however , that no such reports shall be
required so long as the Depositor is the sole Certificateholder.
Any Paying Agent shall have the revocable power to withdraw funds
from the Certificate Distribution Account for the purpose of making
the distributions referred to above. The Owner Trustee may revoke
such power and remove the Paying Agent if the Owner Trustee
determines in its sole discretion that the Paying Agent shall have
failed to perform its obligations under this Agreement in any
material respect. The Paying Agent shall initially be BNY Mellon
Trust of Delaware, and any co-paying agent chosen by BNY Mellon
Trust of Delaware. BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware shall be permitted
to resign as Paying Agent upon thirty (30) days’ written
notice to the Owner Trustee. If BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware shall
no longer be the Paying Agent, the Owner Trustee shall appoint a
successor to act as Paying Agent (which shall be a bank or trust
company). The Owner Trustee shall cause such successor Paying Agent
or any additional Paying Agent appointed by the Owner Trustee to
execute and deliver to the Owner Trustee an instrument in which
such successor Paying Agent or additional Paying Agent shall agree
with the Owner Trustee that as Paying Agent, such successor Paying
Agent or additional Paying Agent shall hold all sums, if any, held
by it for payment to the Certificateholders in trust for the
benefit of the Certificateholders entitled thereto until such sums
shall be paid to such Certificateholders. The Paying Agent shall
return all unclaimed funds to the Owner Trustee and upon removal of
a Paying Agent such Paying Agent shall also return all funds in its
possession to the Owner Trustee. The provisions of Sections
6.3 , 6.6 , 6.7 and 6.9 shall apply to the
Owner Trustee also in its role as Paying Agent or Certificate
Registrar for so long as the Owner Trustee shall act as Paying
Agent or Certificate Registrar and, to the extent
 
14


applicable, to any other paying agent,
certificate registrar or authenticating agent appointed hereunder.
Any reference in this Agreement to the Paying Agent shall include
any co-paying agent unless the context requires
otherwise.

Section 3.10 Depositor as
Certificateholder . The Depositor in its individual or any
other capacity may become the owner or pledgee of Certificates and
may otherwise deal with the Owner Trustee or its Affiliates as if
it were not the Depositor.

Section 3.11 Rule 144A
Information . The Depositor shall, during any period in which a
purchaser of the Certificates holds such Certificate and in which
the Depositor is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act, make available, upon request, to any holder of such
Certificates in connection with any sale thereof and any
prospective purchaser of Certificates from such holder, the
information specified in Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Act.

Section 3.12 Definitive
Certificates . If (i) the Administrator advises the Owner
Trustee in writing that the Clearing Agency is no longer willing or
able to properly discharge its responsibilities with respect to the
Book-Entry Certificates and the Trust is unable to locate a
qualified successor; (ii) the Administrator, at its option,
advises the Owner Trustee in writing that it elects to terminate
the book-entry system through the Clearing Agency; or
(iii) Certificate Owners representing beneficial interests
aggregating at least a majority of the Percentage Interests in the
Trust advise the Clearing Agency in writing that the continuation
of a book-entry system through the Clearing Agency is no longer in
the best interests of the Certificate Owners, then the Clearing
Agency shall notify all Certificate Owners and the Owner Trustee of
the occurrence of any such event and of the availability of
Definitive Certificates to Certificate Owners requesting the same.
Upon surrender to the Owner Trustee of the typewritten Certificate
or Certificates representing the Book-Entry Certificate by the
Clearing Agency, accompanied by registration instructions, the
Trust shall execute and the Owner Trustee shall authenticate the
Definitive Certificates in accordance with the instructions of the
Clearing Agency. None of the Trust, the Certificate Registrar or
the Owner Trustee shall be liable for any delay in delivery of such
instructions and may conclusively rely on, and shall be protected
in relying on, such instructions. Upon the issuance of Definitive
Certificates, the Owner Trustee shall recognize the Holders of the
Definitive Certificates as Certificateholders.

Section 3.13 Notices to
Clearing Agency . Whenever a notice or other communication to
the Certificateholders is required under this Agreement, unless and
until Definitive Certificates shall have been issued to the owner
of a Certificate pursuant to Section 3.12 , the Owner
Trustee shall give all such notices and communications specified
herein to be given to the Certificateholders to the Clearing
Agency, and shall have no obligation to the beneficial owner of a
Certificate.

Section 3.14 Restrictions on
Note Acquisitions . Neither a member of any “expanded
group” (as defined in proposed Treasury Regulation
Section 1.385-1(b)(3)) that includes the Trust or a
Certificate Owner nor a “controlled partnership” (as
defined in proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.385-1(b)(1))
of such expanded group shall acquire any Notes from the Trust, any
Affiliate, or through the marketplace prior to obtaining an Opinion
of Counsel stating that (i) the acquisition or reacquisition
of such Note will not cause the Trust, initially upon such
acquisition or subsequent to the acquisition, to be classified as
an association or publicly traded
 
15


partnership treated as a corporation for federal
income tax purposes and will not cause the Note to be
recharacterized as stock pursuant to proposed Treasury Regulations
under section 385 of the Code or otherwise cause the Trust not to
be classified as a grantor trust. The preceding sentence shall not
apply to (i) any U.S. corporate member of the same U.S.
corporate affiliated group (as defined in Section 1504 of the
Code) filing a consolidated federal income tax return that includes
the Trust or every applicable Certificate Owner (the “Trust
Consolidated Group”) or (ii) a partnership all of the
partners of which are U.S. corporate members of the Trust
Consolidated Group. No member of any “expanded group”
that includes the Trust or Certificate Owner (as defined in
proposed Treasury Regulation § 1.385-1(b)(3)) or
“controlled partnership” of such expanded group (as
defined in proposed Treasury Regulation § 1.385-1(b)(1)) shall
transfer any Notes outside the expanded group prior to obtaining an
Opinion of Counsel stating that the transfer of such Note will not
cause the Trust to be classified as an association or publicly
traded partnership treated as a corporation for federal income tax
purposes and will not cause the Note to be recharacterized as stock
pursuant to proposed Treasury Regulations under section 385 of the
Code or otherwise cause the Trust not to be classified as a grantor
trust.

ARTICLE V

APPLICATION OF TRUST FUNDS;
CERTAIN DUTIES

Section 5.1 Establishment of
Certificate Distribution Account .

(a) Except as otherwise provided in
Section 5.2 , the Servicer, for the benefit of the
Certificateholders, shall establish and maintain in the name of the
Trust an Eligible Deposit Account known as the Capital Auto
Receivables Asset Trust 2016-2 Certificate Distribution Account
(the “ Certificate Distribution Account ”),
bearing an additional designation clearly indicating that the funds
deposited therein are held for the benefit of the
Certificateholders.

(b) The Certificateholders shall
possess all right, title and interest in and to all funds on
deposit from time to time in the Certificate Distribution Account
and in all proceeds thereof. Except as otherwise provided herein,
in the Indenture or in the Trust Sale and Servicing Agreement, the
Certificate Distribution Account shall be under the sole dominion
and control of the Owner Trustee or the Paying Agent for the
benefit of the Certificateholders. If, at any time, the Certificate
Distribution Account ceases to be an Eligible Deposit Account, the
Owner Trustee (or the Servicer on behalf of the Owner Trustee, if
the Certificate Distribution Account is not then held by the Owner
Trustee or an Affiliate thereof) shall within ten
(10) Business Days (or such longer period, not to exceed
thirty (30) calendar days, as to which each Rating Agency may
consent) establish a new Certificate Distribution Account as an
Eligible Deposit Account and shall transfer any cash or any
investments to such new Certificate Distribution
Account.

Section 5.2 Application of
Trust Funds .

(a) On each Distribution Date, the
Owner Trustee or the Paying Agent shall distribute to the
Certificateholders, on a pro rata basis, amounts equal to the
amounts deposited in the Certificate Distribution Account pursuant
to Section 4.06 and Section 4.07 of the Trust Sale and
Servicing Agreement on or prior to such Distribution Date. Funds
received by the Owner Trustee or the Paying Agent by 1:00 p.m.
(Eastern time) on any Distribution Date will be distributed to the
Certificateholders on such Distribution Date. Each of the Owner
Trustee and the Paying Agent shall use its best efforts to
distribute any funds received after 1:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on any
Distribution Date to the Certificateholders as soon as reasonably
possible, but neither the Owner Trustee nor the Paying Agent shall
be liable if such funds are not distributed until the next Business
Day. Any funds received by the Owner Trustee or the Paying Agent
after 1:00 p.m. (Eastern time) shall be held uninvested in the
Certificate Distribution Account until distributed to the
Certificateholders, and neither the Owner Trustee nor the Paying
Agent shall be liable for any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or anything else to the contrary in this Agreement or the
other Basic Documents, if and for so long as Certificates
representing in the aggregate a 100% beneficial interest in the
Trust are held by the Depositor, (i) no Certificate
Distribution Account shall be required to be established or
maintained and (ii) all distributions and payments on the
Certificates (including the final distribution as contemplated by
Section 7.1(c) hereof) required hereunder or under the
Trust Sale and Servicing Agreement shall be made directly to the
Depositor by the Indenture Trustee (whether or not the Trust Sale
and Servicing Agreement otherwise contemplates deposit into the
Certificate Distribution Account) and the Owner Trustee shall have
no duty or liability to see to such distribution.

(b) On each Distribution Date, the
Owner Trustee shall send to each Certificateholder the statement
provided to the Owner Trustee by the Servicer pursuant to
Section 4.09(a) of the Trust Sale and Servicing Agreement on
such Distribution Date; provided that no such statement
shall be required to be sent by the Owner Trustee if and for so
long as the Depositor is the sole Certificateholder.
 
18



(c) If any withholding tax is
imposed on the Trust’s payment (or allocations of income) to
a Certificateholder, such tax shall reduce the amount otherwise
distributable to the Certificateholder in accordance with this
Section 5.2 ; provided that the Owner Trustee or
the Paying Agent shall not have an obligation to withhold any such
amount if and for so long as the Depositor is the sole
Certificateholder. The Owner Trustee or the Paying Agent is hereby
authorized and directed to retain from amounts otherwise
distributable to the Certificateholders sufficient funds for the
payment of any tax that is legally payable by the Trust (but such
authorization shall not prevent the Owner Trustee or the Paying
Agent from contesting any such tax in appropriate proceedings and
withholding payment of such tax, if permitted by law, pending the
outcome of such proceedings). The amount of any withholding tax
imposed with respect to a Certificateholder shall be treated as
cash distributed to such Certificateholder at the time it is
withheld by the Trust and remitted to the appropriate taxing
authority. If there is a possibility that withholding tax is
payable with respect to a distribution (such as a distribution to a
non-U.S. Certificateholder), the Owner Trustee or the Paying Agent
may in its sole discretion withhold such amounts in accordance with
this Section 5.2(c) . If a Certificateholder wishes to
apply for a refund of any such withholding tax, the Owner Trustee
or the Paying Agent shall reasonably cooperate with such
Certificateholder in making such claim so long as such
Certificateholder agrees to reimburse the Owner Trustee or the
Paying Agent for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred.

(d) If the Indenture Trustee holds
escheated funds for payment to the Trust pursuant to
Section 3.3(e) of the Indenture, the Owner Trustee
shall, upon notice from the Indenture Trustee that such funds
exist, submit on behalf of the Trust an Issuing Entity Order to the
Indenture Trustee pursuant to Section 3.3(e) of the
Indenture instructing the Indenture Trustee to pay such funds to or
at the order of the Depositor.

Section 5.3 Method of
Payment . Subject to Section 7.1(c) , distributions
required to be made to Certificateholders on any Distribution Date
shall be made to each Certificateholder of record on the related
Record Date by wire transfer, in immediately available funds, to
the account of such Holder at a bank or other entity having
appropriate facilities therefor, if such Certificateholder shall
have provided to the Certificate Registrar appropriate written
instructions at least five (5) Business Days prior to such
Distribution Date or if not, by check mailed to such
Certificateholder at the address of such Certificateholder
appearing in the Certificate Register.

Section 5.4 Accounting and
Reports to the Certificateholders, the Internal Revenue Service and
Others . The Owner Trustee shall maintain (or cause to be
maintained) the books of the Trust on a calendar year basis on the
accrual method of accounting, deliver to each Certificateholder, as
may be required by the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations or
otherwise, such information as may be required to enable each
Certificateholder to prepare its federal income tax return, file
such tax returns relating to the Trust and make such elections as
may from time to time be required or appropriate under any
applicable State or federal statute or rule or regulation
thereunder so as to maintain the Trust’s characterization as
an entity described in Section 2.11 for federal income
tax purposes, cause such tax returns to be signed in the manner
required by law and collect or cause to be collected any
withholding tax as described in
 
19


and in accordance with
Section 5.2(c) with respect to income or distributions
to Certificateholders. The Owner Trustee (or, if the Depositor is
the sole Certificateholder, the Administrator) shall annually cause
to be sent to each Certificateholder a separate statement setting
forth each such Certificateholder’s share of items of income,
gain, loss, deduction or credit and will instruct each such
Certificateholder to report such items on its federal income tax
return. The Owner Trustee (or, if the Depositor is the sole
Certificateholder, the Administrator) shall prepare or cause to be
prepared the returns and information required by Treasury
Regulations Section 1.671-5, as well as any other applicable
provisions of law, to be provided and filed, as applicable, in the
manner prescribed therein.

Section 5.5 Signature on
Returns; Other Tax Matters . The Owner Trustee shall sign on
behalf of the Trust any and all tax returns of the Trust, unless
applicable law requires a Certificateholder to sign such documents,
in which case such Certificateholder hereby agrees to sign such
document and to cooperate fully with the reasonable requests of the
Owner Trustee with respect thereto.

insurance policies or any other agreement or instrument relating to
any of them.

ARTICLE III

ADMINISTRATION AND SERVICING OF
RECEIVABLES

SECTION 3.01 Duties of the
Servicer .

(a) The Servicer is hereby appointed
and authorized to act as agent for the Owner of the Receivables and
in such capacity shall manage, service, administer and process
collections on the Receivables with reasonable care, using that
degree of skill and attention that the Servicer exercises with
respect to comparable motor vehicle related receivables that it
services for itself or others. The Servicer hereby accepts such
appointment and authorization and agrees to perform the duties of
Servicer with respect to the Receivables set forth herein and in
the Further Transfer and Servicing Agreements.

(b) The Servicer’s duties
shall include collection and posting of all payments, responding to
inquiries of Obligors, investigating delinquencies, sending billing
statements to Obligors, policing the collateral, including
remarketing repossessed and returned Financed Vehicles, accounting
for collections and furnishing monthly and annual statements to the
Owner of any Receivables with respect to distributions, generating
federal income tax information and performing the other duties
specified herein. Subject to the provisions of
Section 3.02 (including the provisions regarding
“Permitted Modifications” set forth therein) and the
limitations set forth in Section 3.07(a)(iii) ), the
Servicer shall follow its customary standards, policies and
procedures and shall have full power and authority, acting alone,
to do any and all things in connection with such managing,
servicing, administration and collection as set forth
herein.
 
4



(c) Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the Servicer is hereby authorized and empowered
by the Owner of the Receivables, pursuant to this
Section 3.01 , to execute and deliver, on behalf of all
Interested Parties, or any of them, any and all instruments of
satisfaction or cancellation, or of partial or full release or
discharge, and all other comparable instruments, with respect to
the Receivables and the Financed Vehicles (including proceeds). The
Servicer is hereby authorized to (i) commence, in its own name
or in the name of the Owner of such Receivable a legal proceeding,
whether through judicial process or (with respect to repossession
of a Financed Vehicle) non-judicial process, (ii) participate
in a voluntary or involuntary liquidation proceeding to enforce a
Liquidating Receivable or Receivable as contemplated by
Section 3.03 , (iii) enforce all obligations of
the Seller, the Servicer, CARI or the Issuing Entity under this
Agreement and under the Further Transfer and Servicing Agreements
or (iv) commence or participate in a legal proceeding
(including a bankruptcy case) relating to or involving a Receivable
or a Liquidating Receivable. If the Servicer commences or
participates in such a legal proceeding in its own name, the
Servicer is hereby authorized and empowered by the Owner of the
Receivables pursuant to this Section 3.01 to obtain
possession of the related Financed Vehicle and immediately and
without further action on the part of the Owner or the Servicer,
the Owner of such Receivable shall thereupon automatically assign
in trust such Receivable and the security interest in the related
Financed Vehicle to the Servicer for the benefit of the Interested
Parties immediately prior to such legal or liquidation proceeding
for purposes of commencing or participating in any such proceeding
as a party or claimant. Upon such automatic assignment, the
Servicer will be, and will have all the rights and duties of, a
secured party under the UCC and other applicable law with respect
to such Receivable and the related Financed Vehicle. At the
Servicer’s request from time to time, the Owner of a
Receivable assigned under this Section 3.01 shall
provide the Servicer with evidence of the assignment in trust for
the benefit of the Interested Parties as may be reasonably
necessary for the Servicer to take any of the actions set forth in
the following sentence.

(d) The Servicer is hereby
authorized and empowered by the Owner of a Receivable to execute
and deliver in the Servicer’s name any notices, demands,
claims, complaints, responses, affidavits or other documents or
instruments in connection with any such proceeding. Any Owner of
Receivables shall furnish the Servicer with any powers of attorney
and other documents and take any other steps which the Servicer may
deem necessary or appropriate to enable the Servicer to carry out
its servicing and administrative duties under this Agreement and
the Further Transfer and Servicing Agreements. Except to the extent
required by the preceding two sentences, the authority and rights
granted to the Servicer in this Section 3.01 shall be
nonexclusive and shall not be construed to be in derogation of the
retention by the Owner of a Receivable of equivalent authority and
rights.

SECTION 3.02 Collection of
Receivable Payments . The Servicer shall make reasonable
efforts to collect all payments called for under the terms and
provisions of the Receivables as and when the same shall become due
and shall follow such collection practices, policies and procedures
as it follows with respect to comparable motor vehicle related
receivables that it services for itself or others in connection
therewith (the “ Established Collection Procedures
”). Subject to the limitations provided in
Section 3.07(a)(iii) (which limitations shall remain in
effect at all times), the Servicer is hereby authorized to make any
Permitted Modifications (as defined below) without the prior
consent of the Owner of such Receivable. The Servicer is not
authorized to, and shall not, make or grant any
extensions,
 
5


rebates, deferrals, alterations, amendments or
adjustments on a Receivable (collectively, “ Receivable
Modifications ”) unless such Receivable Modification is a
Permitted Modification. “ Permitted Modification
” means any Receivable Modification made pursuant to the
Established Collection Procedures with respect to which at least
one of the following conditions has been or will be satisfied:
(i) the Receivable Modifications, individually and
collectively, considering all Receivable Modifications proposed to
be made to such Receivable, are ministerial in nature (such as, by
way of example, the change of payment dates due from an Obligor to
a different day in the month, waiver of any prepayment charge or
late payment charge, or waiver of other fees that may be collected
in the ordinary course of servicing the Receivable); (ii) the
Servicer, in response to a request made by an Obligor and pursuant
to the Established Collection Procedures, provides for extensions
or deferrals of payments with respect to the related Receivable to
the extent that the following conditions all apply: (a) such
extensions or deferrals will not exceed 90 days in the aggregate
during any 12-month period; (b) such extensions or deferrals
will not exceed 180 days in the aggregate during the life of such
Receivable; and (c) the Servicer believes that such extensions
or deferrals are appropriate or necessary to preserve the value of
such Receivable and to prevent the Receivable from going into
default (or where such Receivable is already in default, to prevent
the Receivable from becoming further impaired); (iii) the
Servicer provides for extensions or deferrals of payment with
respect to a Receivable which is in default and which the Servicer
believes are appropriate or necessary to preserve the value of such
Receivable and to prevent such Receivable from becoming further
impaired; or (iv) the Servicer has delivered an opinion to the
Issuing Entity to the effect that such Receivable Modifications
will not cause the Issuing Entity to fail to qualify as a grantor
trust for United States federal income tax purposes.

SECTION 3.03 Realization Upon
Liquidating Receivables . The Servicer shall use reasonable
efforts, consistent with its customary practices, policies and
procedures, to repossess or otherwise comparably convert the
ownership or gain control of any Financed Vehicle that it has
reasonably determined should be repossessed or otherwise converted
following a default under the Receivable secured by the Financed
Vehicle. The Servicer is authorized to follow such customary
practices, policies and procedures as it follows with respect to
comparable motor vehicle related receivables that it services for
itself or others, which customary practices, policies and
procedures may include reasonable efforts to realize upon any
recourse to Dealers, selling the related Financed Vehicle at public
or private sale and the taking of other actions by the Servicer in
order to realize upon such a Receivable. The Servicer is hereby
authorized to exercise its discretion consistent with its customary
practices, policies and procedures and the terms of the Basic
Documents, in servicing Liquidating Receivables so as to maximize
the net collection of those Liquidating Receivables, including the
discretion to choose to sell or not to sell any of the Liquidating
Receivables itself on behalf of the Depositor or any other Owner.
The Servicer shall not be liable for any such exercise of its
discretion made in good faith and in accordance with such servicing
procedures. The foregoing is subject to the provision that, in any
case in which the Financed Vehicle shall have suffered damage, the
Servicer shall not expend funds in connection with any repair or
towards the repossession of such Financed Vehicle unless it shall
determine in its discretion that such repair or repossession shall
increase the proceeds of liquidation of the related Receivable by
an amount greater than the amount of such expenses. The Servicer
shall be entitled to receive Liquidation Expenses with respect to
each Liquidating Receivable at such time as the Receivable becomes
a Liquidating Receivable (or as may otherwise be provided in the
Further Transfer and Servicing Agreements).
 
6



SECTION 3.04 Maintenance of
Insurance Policies . The Servicer shall, in accordance with its
customary practices, policies and procedures, require that each
Obligor shall have obtained physical damage insurance covering the
Financed Vehicle as of the execution of the related Receivable. The
Servicer shall, in accordance with its customary practices,
policies and procedures, track such physical damage insurance with
respect to each Receivable.

SECTION 3.05 Maintenance of
Security Interests in Vehicles . The Servicer shall, in
accordance with its customary practices, policies and procedures
and at its own expense, take such steps as are necessary to
maintain perfection of the security interest created by each
Receivable in the related Financed Vehicle. The Owner of each
Receivable hereby authorizes the Servicer to re-perfect such
security interest on behalf of such Owner, as necessary because of
the relocation of a Financed Vehicle, or for any other
reason.

SECTION 3.06 Covenants,
Representations and Warranties of the Servicer . As of the
Closing Date, the Servicer hereby makes the following
representations, warranties and covenants on which CARI relies in
accepting the Receivables hereunder and pursuant to the First Step
Receivables Assignment, and on which the Issuing Entity shall rely
in accepting such Receivables and executing and delivering the
Securities under the Further Transfer and Servicing
Agreements.

(a) The Servicer covenants that from
and after the closing hereunder:

(i) Liens in Force . Except

(ii) No Impairment . The
Servicer shall do nothing to impair the rights or security interest
of CARI or any Interested Party in and to the Purchased Property;
and

(iii) No Modifications . The
Servicer shall not amend or otherwise modify any Receivable such
that the Amount Financed, the Annual Percentage Rate, or the number
of originally scheduled due dates is altered or such that the last
scheduled due date occurs after the Final Scheduled Distribution
Date.

(b) Upon the execution of this
Agreement and the Further Transfer and Servicing Agreements, the
Servicer represents and warrants to the Issuing Entity and CARI
that as of the Closing Date:

Standing . The Servicer has been duly formed and is validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of its State of
incorporation, with power and authority to own its properties and
to conduct its business as such properties are presently owned and
such business is presently conducted;

(ii) Due Qualification . The
Servicer is duly qualified to do business as a foreign entity in
good standing, and has obtained all necessary licenses and
approvals, in all jurisdictions in which the ownership or lease of
property or the conduct of its business (including the servicing of
the Receivables) requires or shall require such
qualification;

(iii) Power and Authority .
The Servicer has the power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement and the Further Transfer and Servicing Agreements
and to carry out the terms of such agreements; the Servicer has the

performance of this Agreement and the Further Transfer and
Servicing Agreements have been duly authorized by the Servicer by
all necessary corporate action;

(iv) Binding Obligation . The
Further Transfer and Servicing Agreements and this Agreement, when
duly executed and delivered, shall constitute the legal, valid and
binding obligations of the Servicer enforceable in accordance with
their respective terms, except as enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, or other similar laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights in general and
by general principles of equity, regardless of whether such
enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at
law;

(v) No Violation . The
