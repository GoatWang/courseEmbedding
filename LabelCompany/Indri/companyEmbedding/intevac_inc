The Company's segments include Thin-film Equipment and Photonics. Intevac is engaged in the design and development of thin-film processing systems. Its platforms are designed for manufacturing of substrates with thin-film properties, such as the hard drive media, display cover panel (DCP), and solar photovoltaic (PV) markets. Intevac is engaged in developing high-sensitivity digital sensors, cameras and systems that primarily serve the defense industry. It provides integrated digital night vision imaging systems for the United States military.Thin-film Equipment SegmentThe Company designs, manufactures, markets and services capital equipment used to deposit thin films and lubricants onto substrates to produce magnetic disks that are used in hard disk drives. It develops equipment to deposit optically transparent thin films onto DCPs typically found on consumer and automotive electronic products. Intevac is involved in marketing a Scratch Protection (SP) coating known as Optical Diamond-like-Carbon (oDLC) utilizing its production-proven carbon film technology that is also used on hard disk drive media. It offers products for wafer-based crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cell manufacturing processes. It provides two vacuum process application technologies for solar cell manufacturing, one utilizes Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) technology for the deposition of thin films onto c-Si wafers, and the other utilizes ion implantation, which changes the electrical characteristics of the c-Si solar cell.Thin film equipment products include 200 Lean Disk Sputtering System, 200 Lean Etch and Deposition System, AccuLuber Disk Lubrication System, INTEVAC VERTEX System, INTEVAC MATRIX Implant System, ENERGi Implant System and INTEVAC MATRIX System.

Its EBAPS sensors can be integrated with optics, electronics, software and displays based upon customer specifications and requirements.The Company's products include Helicopter Pilotage, Fixed Wing Aircraft Pilotage, Long-Range Target Identification, Soldier Mobility, Rifle Sight and others. Intevac provides a night-vision camera with a 2.0 mega-pixel resolution EBAPS module, which is turret-mounted on the Apache helicopter. Intevac provides night-vision cameras with 2.0 mega-pixel resolution EBAPS module, which is integrated with the F-35 fighter pilot's helmet and enables the pilot to have enhanced night vision incorporating navigational and tactical information. Intevac provides the Laser Illuminated Viewing and Ranging (LIVAR) shortwave-infrared camera for long range military night time surveillance systems that can identify targets at distances of up to 20 kilometers. Photonics' LIVAR camera is incorporated into long range target identification systems manufactured by a defense contractor. The head-mounted digital imaging systems are focused on allowing low-light level and thermal imagery to be viewed individually or to be overlaid. Intevac provides head-mounted displays for applications in Virtual Reality (VR), simulation, training, and wireless weapon sights. The Company provides EBAPS modules that are integrated by its customers into a weapon sight attached to weaponry, including rifles for night time aiming and targeting.Photonics products are manufactured at Intevac's facilities in California. Photonics segment manufactures sensors, cameras, integrated camera systems, and near-eye display systems using manufacturing techniques and equipment. Photonics' MicroVista product line of commercial compact and lightweight low-light Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) cameras provide high sensitivity in the ultraviolet, visible or NIR regions of the spectrum for use in industrial inspection, bio-medical and scientific applications.The Company competes with Canon Anelva, Applied Materials, Centrotherm Photovoltaics, Amtech, Jusung, Von Ardenne, Harris Corporation, L-3 Communications, Rockwell-Collins, Kopin and Six 15 Technologies.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
