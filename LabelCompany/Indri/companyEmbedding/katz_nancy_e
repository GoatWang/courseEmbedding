NeuroMetrix Names Nancy E. Katz to Board of Directors






December 17, 2010 12:29 PM Eastern Standard Time



WALTHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--NeuroMetrix, Inc. (Nasdaq: NURO) announced today that Nancy E. Katz was 
      appointed to the Company’s Board of Directors.
    


      Ms. Katz is a marketing innovator focused on diabetes care and with over 
      twenty years of experience in the healthcare industry. Most recently 
      Nancy was Senior Vice President, Bayer Diabetes Care – North America 
      where she led a turnaround of this $1.2B business. Previously, she was 
      President and Chief Executive Officer of Calypte Biomedical Corporation, 
      a manufacturer of HIV diagnostics, President of Zila Pharmaceutical, 
      Inc, a manufacturer of oral care products, and held senior marketing 
      positions with the Lifescan division of Johnson & Johnson (blood glucose 
      diabetes products), Schering-Plough Healthcare Products, and with 
      American Home Products. She has served on the Boards of Directors of 
      Neoprobe Corporation, Calypte Biomedical Corporation, LXN Corporation 
      and Pepgen Corporation.
    

      “We are very pleased to welcome Nancy to the Board,” said Shai N. Gozani 
      M.D., PhD., President and Chief Executive Officer of NeuroMetrix. “Her 
      perspective on diabetes care and experience marketing into the diabetes 
      sector is very relevant as we work toward a successful 2011 launch of 
      NC-stat-SL, our rapid, point-of-care test for diabetic neuropathy.”
    

      “I look forward to contributing to NeuroMetrix at this important 
      juncture,” said Nancy E. Katz. “NeuroMetrix is developing a novel 
      solution to an unmet medical need in a crucial area of diabetic care: 
      the early identification and monitoring of diabetic neuropathy, which is 
      among the most common long term complications of diabetes. The NC-stat 
      SL has impressed me as an elegant product which will promote earlier 
      detection and thereby intervention than might otherwise occur under 
      current practice.”
    

      About NeuroMetrix
    

      NeuroMetrix is a science-based health care company transforming patient 
      care through neurotechnology. We develop and market innovative products 
      for the detection, diagnosis, and monitoring of peripheral nerve and 
      spinal cord disorders such as those associated with diabetes, carpal 
      tunnel syndrome, lumbosacral disc disease and spinal stenosis. For more
