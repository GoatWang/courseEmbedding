Von Duprin: A pioneer in cross bar exit security
A mainstay in public buildings for decades Von Duprin's safety products are known for their unparalleled quality and performance.  From innovative exit devices to electronic access control solutions and accessories, Von Duprin never compromises when security is at stake. In fact, an independent study of more than 100 commercial facilities across the U.S. documented that Von Duprin exit devices require significantly less maintenance over a 30-year period than any other brand.  The quality of Von Duprin’s exit devices provides confidence and peace of mind in critical moments.

About Allegion


At Allegion, we help keep people safe and secure where they live, work and visit. With more than 25 brands sold in almost 130 countries across the globe, we specialize in security around the doorway and beyond: everything from residential and commercial locks, door closer and exit devices, steel doors and frames to access control and workforce productivity systems.
At the core of our $2 billion business is the knowledge and experience of the 9,500+ dedicated employees behind our brands. We help our customers navigate their toughest security challenges, and we help builders and property owners differentiate themselves by providing innovative and secure solutions. Operational excellence is a key part of what we do for our customers, and is a focus for our employees. Our trained specification writers and experts not only help our customers adhere to codes and standards – we help advocate for and raise those security standards in the first place, in markets around the world.
While mechanical hardware is the foundation of our business and will always be at the core of what we do, we recognize that the future of the security industry lies in addressing the needs of an increasingly connected world. Electronic solutions don’t replace our mechanical products – they make them more powerful. That’s why our core strength in mechanical security, when combined with digital, mobile and interconnected electronic solutions – and our expertise in style and design – makes us a leader in our markets.

Realization of Advanced Laboratory


From setting vial to starting analysis, all the procedures are performed via the equipment.
The operations in the laboratory are minimized and free of errors.
The system status can be supervised even from outside the laboratory.
More efficient use of laboratory space.









Achieving Easier Operation

Uniform graphical user interfaces between system and workstation allow intuitive operations regardless of experience level and increase the operation availability of the i-Series. The browser functions in LabSolutions bring rapid processing of large amount of data, realtime statistical calculation and easy confirmation of anomalous values, enabling more efficient data processing. 









Smart Features Increase Work Efficiency

The i-Series saves lab operators time and energy. Combined with the LabSolutions automated functions, it reliably completes analyses under specified procedures. In addition, the E-mail notification feature allows you to focus on other work, without worrying about analysis end time.
