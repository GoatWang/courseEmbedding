About LIPITOR
An overview of brand-name LIPITOR
What is LIPITOR?
LIPITOR is a prescription medicine called a statin that lowers cholesterol in your blood. It lowers the LDL-C (“bad” cholesterol) and triglycerides in your blood. It can raise your HDL-C (“good” cholesterol) as well.
How the cholesterol-lowering medicine of LIPITOR works
The body uses an enzyme in the liver to make cholesterol.
LIPITOR blocks this enzyme and less cholesterol is made.
As a result, the liver picks up more cholesterol from the bloodstream and lower levels of cholesterol end up in the blood.
LIPITOR has 20 years of experience
LIPITOR is backed by more than 20 years of clinical experience.
More than 29 million people in the United States have filled their LIPITOR prescription since 2002.
LIPITOR has been studied in more than 400 ongoing and completed clinical trials.

Most frequently asked LIPITOR Savings Program questions

What is the LIPITOR Savings Card?
The LIPITOR Savings Card allows certain eligible patients to get a 30-day supply of LIPITOR for $30. Other patients may be eligible to pay as little as $4 a month, depending on their insurance. It may work if you have insurance, are on Medicare Part D, or have no insurance at all, and is valid for every prescription or refill through December 31, 2018.
How does the LIPITOR Savings Card work?
Once the card is activated, present it to your pharmacist when you drop off your prescription or request a refill.
During the payment process, the pharmacist will run your card, and your out-of-pocket cost will be either $30 or $4, depending upon your eligibility.
Visit  LIPITOR.com to see how much you may pay.
Who is eligible to use the LIPITOR Savings Card?
This offer is for non-Medicaid patients, aged 18 and older, living in the United States and Puerto Rico. This offer is not available to residents of Massachusetts, or to patients who have federal or state health insurance coverage, except for Medicare Part D. Medicare Part D patients may use the LIPITOR Savings Card, but cannot use their benefit in conjunction with the card.
What does the LIPITOR Savings Card cost?
It is free to sign up and requires no membership fees.
How much will I pay using the LIPITOR Savings Card?
Eligible insured patients whose plans cover LIPITOR up to a $130 out-of-pocket cost will pay $4 for a 30-day supply;
Eligible insured patients whose plans do not cover LIPITOR, or do not cover it over the $130 out-of-pocket cost, will pay $30 for a 30-day supply;
Eligible uninsured patients, as well as Medicare Part D patients, will pay $30 for a 30-day supply.
If you are not sure if your insurance company covers LIPITOR, you may contact them to find out how LIPITOR is covered under your specific plan.
How much will I pay for a 60/90-day prescription with the LIPITOR Savings Card?
Depending on your cost ($4 or $30 for a 30-day supply), you will pay amounts directly related to the prescription duration you are purchasing. Therefore, if your out-of-pocket cost is $4, you will pay $8 for a 60-day supply and $12 for a 90-day supply. If your out-of-pocket cost is $30, you will pay $60 for a 60-day supply and $90 for a 90-day supply of LIPITOR.
Where can I use my LIPITOR Savings Card?
You can use your card at any participating pharmacy. To find a pharmacy that has recently accepted a LIPITOR card, visit our Pharmacy Finder at LIPITOR.com.
What happens if my local pharmacy does not have LIPITOR in stock?
If your local pharmacy does not carry LIPITOR, you may ask if it’s possible for them to order the brand for earliest possible pick-up. Make sure you leave enough time to fill your prescription so you don’t miss a dose and continue to take your medication as prescribed by your doctor.
Can I use the LIPITOR Savings Card on a previously filled prescription?
No, the LIPITOR Savings Card can only be used for new prescriptions that are filled after you have activated the card.
If I am eligible for the $30 co-pay and I am a Medicare Part D patient, can I use my insurance in combination with the LIPITOR Savings Card?
No. Medicare Part D patients may participate in the LIPITOR Savings Program, but cannot use any part of their Medicare Part D prescription benefit for LIPITOR during the term of this offer.
How does someone get a LIPITOR Savings Card?
It’s easy. To see if you are eligible, answer a few questions in the Get a Card section of LIPITOR.com or call our toll-free number, 1-877-375-6620.

CellCept® Co-pay Card Terms and Conditions





WHO IS CELLCEPT FOR?
CellCept® (mycophenolate mofetil) is a medicine given by prescription to people who had a kidney, heart or liver transplant. CellCept can help prevent rejection of the new organ.
Your body's immune system can tell that the new heart, liver or kidney is different and tries to reject it. CellCept is taken along with other anti-rejection medicines to help control your immune system. They help keep it from "rejecting" the transplant.
Follow your doctor's exact orders for taking CellCept and all other medicines.
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT INFORMATION I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT CELLCEPT?


Pregnant women who take CellCept have a higher chance of losing the baby during the first 3 months of pregnancy. There also is a higher chance the baby will have birth defects.
You should have one pregnancy test immediately before starting CellCept and another pregnancy test 8 to 10 days later. Pregnancy tests should be repeated during routine follow-up visits with your doctor. Talk to your doctor about the results of all of your pregnancy tests.
If you are a woman who can get pregnant, you must use acceptable birth control during your entire CellCept therapy, and continue birth control for 6 weeks after you stop taking CellCept, unless you choose to abstain from sexual intercourse with a man completely. Talk to your doctor about other birth control methods that you can use while taking CellCept.
If you plan to become pregnant, talk with your doctor. You and your doctor can decide if other medicines to prevent rejection may be right for you.
If you become pregnant while taking CellCept, do not stop taking CellCept. Call your doctor right away. In certain situations, you and your doctor may decide that taking CellCept is more important to your health than the possible risks to your unborn baby.


				You and your doctor should report your pregnancy to
				
Mycophenolate Pregnancy Registry (1-800-617-8191)



		The purpose of this registry is to gather information about the health of you and your baby.
	
Taking CellCept with other anti-rejection medicines may raise your chance of getting an infection. It may raise your chance of getting cancer of the immune system (lymphoma) or other cancers, such as skin cancer. Talk with your doctor right away if you have any signs of infection such as fever, tiredness, headache, redness of skin/wound or swollen lymph glands. Tell your doctor about any changes in your skin.

		CellCept weakens the body's immune system and affects your ability to fight infections. Serious infections, possibly leading to death, can happen with CellCept. These serious infections can include:
		

				Viral infections. Certain viruses can live in your body and cause active infections when your immune system is weak. These viruses or infections may include:

Cytomegalovirus (CMV), shingles, other herpes infections. CMV can cause serious tissue and blood infections.
BK virus. This virus can damage the kidney. It can cause the new kidney to fail.
Hepatitis B and C viruses. Hepatitis viruses can affect how your liver works. Talk to your doctor about how hepatitis viruses may affect you.


Brain infection called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). PML can be fatal. Symptoms include clumsiness, weakness that keeps getting worse, not being able to move or use one side of the body, and changes in vision, speech or personality (such as not caring about things that you usually care about and confusion).
Fungal infections. Yeasts and other types of fungal infections can happen with CellCept and can cause serious tissue and blood infections



WHO SHOULD NOT TAKE CELLCEPT?

You should not use CellCept if you have ever had an allergic reaction to CellCept or any of its ingredients. Please discuss this with your doctor.

WHAT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION SHOULD I KNOW ABOUT CELLCEPT?


People taking high doses of CellCept each day may have a decrease in blood counts, including white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets.
Your doctor will do blood tests before you start taking CellCept and during therapy with CellCept to check your blood cell counts.
Tell your doctor right away if you have any signs of infection, or any unexpected bruising or bleeding, unusual tiredness, lack of energy, dizziness or fainting.

Cases of bleeding in the stomach or intestines that required hospitalization have been reported. Early signs of bleeding may include stomach pain, blood in your stool, or dark, sticky stools. Tell your doctor if you have any digestive problems, such as ulcers.
People taking CellCept should not take live vaccines. Some vaccines may not work as well during treatment with CellCept.
Tell your doctor about all the medicines you are taking including prescription and nonprescription medicines, vitamins and herbal supplements.
Tell your doctor if you have phenylketonuria (PKU). CellCept Oral Suspension contains aspartame (a source of phenylalanine).

WHAT ARE THE MOST COMMON SIDE EFFECTS FROM CELLCEPT?


The most common side effects include: diarrhea, vomiting, pain, stomach area pain, swelling of the lower legs, ankles and feet, and high blood pressure.
These are not all of the possible side effects of CellCept. Tell your doctor about any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away.


This important safety information does not take the place of talking with your doctor about your medical condition or your treatment. Talk with your doctor if you have any questions about your health problems or treatment.
Please see full Prescribing Information, including Boxed WARNING and Medication Guide, for additional Important Safety Information.

WHO IS CELLCEPT FOR?
CellCept® (mycophenolate mofetil) is a medicine given by prescription to people who had a kidney, heart or liver transplant. CellCept can help prevent rejection of the new organ.
Your body's immune system can tell that the new heart, liver or kidney is different and tries to reject it. CellCept is taken along with other anti-rejection medicines to help control your immune system. They help keep it from "rejecting" the transplant.
Follow your doctor's exact orders for taking CellCept and all other medicines.
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT INFORMATION I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT CELLCEPT?


Pregnant women who take CellCept have a higher chance of losing the baby during the first 3 months of pregnancy. There also is a higher chance the baby will have birth defects.
You should have one pregnancy test immediately before starting CellCept and another pregnancy test 8 to 10 days later. Pregnancy tests should be repeated during routine follow-up visits with your doctor. Talk to your doctor about the results of all of your pregnancy tests.
If you are a woman who can get pregnant, you must use acceptable birth control during your entire CellCept therapy, and continue birth control for 6 weeks after you stop taking CellCept, unless you choose to abstain from sexual intercourse with a man completely. Talk to your doctor about other birth control methods that you can use while taking CellCept.
If you plan to become pregnant, talk with your doctor. You and your doctor can decide if other medicines to prevent rejection may be right for you.
If you become pregnant while taking CellCept, do not stop taking CellCept. Call your doctor right away. In certain situations, you and your doctor may decide that taking CellCept is more important to your health than the possible risks to your unborn baby.


				You and your doctor should report your pregnancy to
				
Mycophenolate Pregnancy Registry (1-800-617-8191)



		The purpose of this registry is to gather information about the health of you and your baby.
	
Taking CellCept with other anti-rejection medicines may raise your chance of getting an infection. It may raise your chance of getting cancer of the immune system (lymphoma) or other cancers, such as skin cancer. Talk with your doctor right away if you have any signs of infection such as fever, tiredness, headache, redness of skin/wound or swollen lymph glands. Tell your doctor about any changes in your skin.

		CellCept weakens the body's immune system and affects your ability to fight infections. Serious infections, possibly leading to death, can happen with CellCept. These serious infections can include:
		

				Viral infections. Certain viruses can live in your body and cause active infections when your immune system is weak. These viruses or infections may include:

Cytomegalovirus (CMV), shingles, other herpes infections. CMV can cause serious tissue and blood infections.
BK virus. This virus can damage the kidney. It can cause the new kidney to fail.
Hepatitis B and C viruses. Hepatitis viruses can affect how your liver works. Talk to your doctor about how hepatitis viruses may affect you.


Brain infection called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). PML can be fatal. Symptoms include clumsiness, weakness that keeps getting worse, not being able to move or use one side of the body, and changes in vision, speech or personality (such as not caring about things that you usually care about and confusion).
Fungal infections. Yeasts and other types of fungal infections can happen with CellCept and can cause serious tissue and blood infections



WHO SHOULD NOT TAKE CELLCEPT?

You should not use CellCept if you have ever had an allergic reaction to CellCept or any of its ingredients. Please discuss this with your doctor.

WHAT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION SHOULD I KNOW ABOUT CELLCEPT?


People taking high doses of CellCept each day may have a decrease in blood counts, including white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets.
Your doctor will do blood tests before you start taking CellCept and during therapy with CellCept to check your blood cell counts.
Tell your doctor right away if you have any signs of infection, or any unexpected bruising or bleeding, unusual tiredness, lack of energy, dizziness or fainting.

Cases of bleeding in the stomach or intestines that required hospitalization have been reported. Early signs of bleeding may include stomach pain, blood in your stool, or dark, sticky stools. Tell your doctor if you have any digestive problems, such as ulcers.
People taking CellCept should not take live vaccines. Some vaccines may not work as well during treatment with CellCept.
Tell your doctor about all the medicines you are taking including prescription and nonprescription medicines, vitamins and herbal supplements.
Tell your doctor if you have phenylketonuria (PKU). CellCept Oral Suspension contains aspartame (a source of phenylalanine).

WHAT ARE THE MOST COMMON SIDE EFFECTS FROM CELLCEPT?


The most common side effects include: diarrhea, vomiting, pain, stomach area pain, swelling of the lower legs, ankles and feet, and high blood pressure.
These are not all of the possible side effects of CellCept. Tell your doctor about any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away.


This important safety information does not take the place of talking with your doctor about your medical condition or your treatment. Talk with your doctor if you have any questions about your health problems or treatment.

What is CellCept?
CellCept® (mycophenolate mofetil) is a prescription medicine for people who have had a kidney, heart, or liver transplant. CellCept can help prevent rejection of the transplanted organ.
CellCept is available in multiple formulations for adults and children who have had a transplant

Capsules
Tablets
Oral Suspension

Not actual size and may not represent exact color.
CellCept is used with other medicines called cyclosporines and corticosteroids. These medicines work together to prevent rejection of your transplanted organ.
CellCept has been used safely and works in children who have had a kidney transplant as it does in adults. It is not known if CellCept is safe and works in children who have had a heart or liver transplant.
What is organ transplant rejection?
Rejection happens when your immune system thinks your transplanted organ is foreign and attacks it.
During rejection, the transplanted organ doesn't work as well as it should. This doesn't mean that it will stop working completely, and it doesn't mean that you will always lose your transplanted organ. If you have any concerns or questions about organ rejection, talk to your transplant team.

Why CellCept?
CellCept is one of many anti-rejection medicines (also called immunosuppressive medicines) prescribed to help patients prevent rejection of their transplanted organ. After your transplant, you may take several of these medicines to suppress your immune system so that it won't attack your transplanted organ.

					Some organization health care providers are made up of components that furnish different types of health care or have separate physical locations where health care is furnished. These components and physical locations are not themselves legal entities, but are part of the organization health care provider (which is a legal entity).
					A covered organization provider may decide that its subparts (if it has any) should have their own NPI numbers. If a subpart conducts any HIPAA standard transactions on its own (e.g., separately from its parent), it must obtain its own NPI number.

                    Hospitals can reduce the risk of infection after surgery by making sure they provide
                    care that’s known to get the best results for most patients. Here are some examples:

Giving the recommended antibiotics at the right time before surgery
Stopping the antibiotics within the right timeframe after surgery
Maintaining the patient’s temperature and blood glucose (sugar) at normal levels
Removing catheters that are used to drain the bladder in a timely manner after surgery.


                    Hospitals can also reduce the risk of cardiac problems associated with surgery by:

Making sure that certain prescription drugs are continued in the time before, during,
                        and just after the surgery. This includes drugs used to control heart rhythms and
                        blood pressure.
Giving drugs that prevent blood clots and using other methods such as special stockings
                        that increase circulation in the legs.





                    An acute myocardial infarction (AMI), also called a heart attack, happens when one
                    of the heart’s arteries becomes blocked and the supply of blood and oxygen to part
                    of the heart muscle is slowed or stopped. When the heart muscle doesn’t get the
                    oxygen and nutrients it needs, the affected heart tissue may die. These measures
                    show some of the standards of care provided, if appropriate, for most adults who
                    have had a heart attack.




                    Pneumonia is a serious lung infection that causes difficulty breathing, fever, cough
                    and fatigue. These measures show some of the recommended treatments for pneumonia.
                    Read more information about pneumonia care.




                    Heart Failure is a weakening of the heart's pumping power. With heart failure, your
                    body doesn't get enough oxygen and nutrients to meet its needs. These measures show
                    some of the process of care provided for most adults with heart failure. Read more
                    information about heart failure.




                    Asthma is a chronic lung condition that causes problems getting air in and out of
                    the lungs. Children with asthma may experience wheezing, coughing, chest tightness
                    and trouble breathing.




                    "30-Day Mortality" is when patients die within 30 days of their admission to a hospital.
                    The information that follows shows the death rates for each hospital compared to
                    the U.S. National Rate. The rates take into account how sick patients were before
                    they were admitted to the hospital.




                    "30-Day Readmission" is when patients who have had a recent hospital stay need to
                    go back into a hospital again within 30 days of their discharge. Below, the rates
                    of readmission for each hospital are compared to the U.S. National Rate. The rates
                    take into account how sick patients were before they were admitted to the hospital.
                    Read more information about hospital readmission measures.




                    These measures give you information about hospitals' use of medical imaging tests
                    for outpatients based on the following:

Protecting patients’ safety, such as keeping patients’ exposure to radiation and
                        other risks as low as possible.
Following up properly when screening tests such as mammograms show a possible problem.
Avoiding the risk, stress, and cost of doing imaging tests that patients may not
                        need.


                    The information shown here is limited to medical imaging facilities that are part
                    of a hospital or associated with a hospital. These facilities can be inside or near
                    the hospital, or in a different location. This information only includes medical
                    imaging done on outpatients. Medical imaging tests done for patients who have been
                    admitted to the hospital as inpatients aren’t included.
                

                    These measures are based on Medicare claims data.




                    HCAHPS (Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems) is a national
                    survey that asks patients about their experiences during a recent hospital stay.
                    Use the results shown here to compare hospitals based on ten important hospital
                    quality topics.




                    Hospital Acquired Conditions are serious conditions that patients may get during
                    an inpatient hospital stay. If hospitals follow proper procedures, patients are
                    less likely to get these conditions. Medicare doesn’t pay for any of these conditions,
                    and patients can’t be billed for them, if they got them while in the hospital. Medicare
                    will only pay for these conditions if patients already had them when they were admitted
                    to the hospital.




                    Serious Complications are based on how often adult patients had certain serious,
                    but potentially preventable complications related to medical or surgical inpatient
                    hospital care.




                    Deaths for Certain Conditions are based on how many patients with these conditions
                    died while they were in the hospital.

About LIPITOR
An overview of brand-name LIPITOR
What is LIPITOR?
LIPITOR is a prescription medicine called a statin that lowers cholesterol in your blood. It lowers the LDL-C (“bad” cholesterol) and triglycerides in your blood. It can raise your HDL-C (“good” cholesterol) as well.
How the cholesterol-lowering medicine of LIPITOR works
The body uses an enzyme in the liver to make cholesterol.
LIPITOR blocks this enzyme and less cholesterol is made.
As a result, the liver picks up more cholesterol from the bloodstream and lower levels of cholesterol end up in the blood.
LIPITOR has 20 years of experience
LIPITOR is backed by more than 20 years of clinical experience.
More than 29 million people in the United States have filled their LIPITOR prescription since 2002.
LIPITOR has been studied in more than 400 ongoing and completed clinical trials.

Most frequently asked LIPITOR Savings Program questions

What is the LIPITOR Savings Card?
The LIPITOR Savings Card allows certain eligible patients to get a 30-day supply of LIPITOR for $30. Other patients may be eligible to pay as little as $4 a month, depending on their insurance. It may work if you have insurance, are on Medicare Part D, or have no insurance at all, and is valid for every prescription or refill through December 31, 2018.
How does the LIPITOR Savings Card work?
Once the card is activated, present it to your pharmacist when you drop off your prescription or request a refill.
During the payment process, the pharmacist will run your card, and your out-of-pocket cost will be either $30 or $4, depending upon your eligibility.
Visit  LIPITOR.com to see how much you may pay.
Who is eligible to use the LIPITOR Savings Card?
This offer is for non-Medicaid patients, aged 18 and older, living in the United States and Puerto Rico. This offer is not available to residents of Massachusetts, or to patients who have federal or state health insurance coverage, except for Medicare Part D. Medicare Part D patients may use the LIPITOR Savings Card, but cannot use their benefit in conjunction with the card.
What does the LIPITOR Savings Card cost?
It is free to sign up and requires no membership fees.
How much will I pay using the LIPITOR Savings Card?
Eligible insured patients whose plans cover LIPITOR up to a $130 out-of-pocket cost will pay $4 for a 30-day supply;
Eligible insured patients whose plans do not cover LIPITOR, or do not cover it over the $130 out-of-pocket cost, will pay $30 for a 30-day supply;
Eligible uninsured patients, as well as Medicare Part D patients, will pay $30 for a 30-day supply.
If you are not sure if your insurance company covers LIPITOR, you may contact them to find out how LIPITOR is covered under your specific plan.
How much will I pay for a 60/90-day prescription with the LIPITOR Savings Card?
Depending on your cost ($4 or $30 for a 30-day supply), you will pay amounts directly related to the prescription duration you are purchasing. Therefore, if your out-of-pocket cost is $4, you will pay $8 for a 60-day supply and $12 for a 90-day supply. If your out-of-pocket cost is $30, you will pay $60 for a 60-day supply and $90 for a 90-day supply of LIPITOR.
Where can I use my LIPITOR Savings Card?
You can use your card at any participating pharmacy. To find a pharmacy that has recently accepted a LIPITOR card, visit our Pharmacy Finder at LIPITOR.com.
What happens if my local pharmacy does not have LIPITOR in stock?
If your local pharmacy does not carry LIPITOR, you may ask if it’s possible for them to order the brand for earliest possible pick-up. Make sure you leave enough time to fill your prescription so you don’t miss a dose and continue to take your medication as prescribed by your doctor.
Can I use the LIPITOR Savings Card on a previously filled prescription?
No, the LIPITOR Savings Card can only be used for new prescriptions that are filled after you have activated the card.
If I am eligible for the $30 co-pay and I am a Medicare Part D patient, can I use my insurance in combination with the LIPITOR Savings Card?
No. Medicare Part D patients may participate in the LIPITOR Savings Program, but cannot use any part of their Medicare Part D prescription benefit for LIPITOR during the term of this offer.

CellCept® Co-pay Card Terms and Conditions





WHO IS CELLCEPT FOR?
CellCept® (mycophenolate mofetil) is a medicine given by prescription to people who had a kidney, heart or liver transplant. CellCept can help prevent rejection of the new organ.
Your body's immune system can tell that the new heart, liver or kidney is different and tries to reject it. CellCept is taken along with other anti-rejection medicines to help control your immune system. They help keep it from "rejecting" the transplant.
Follow your doctor's exact orders for taking CellCept and all other medicines.
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT INFORMATION I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT CELLCEPT?


Pregnant women who take CellCept have a higher chance of losing the baby during the first 3 months of pregnancy. There also is a higher chance the baby will have birth defects.
You should have one pregnancy test immediately before starting CellCept and another pregnancy test 8 to 10 days later. Pregnancy tests should be repeated during routine follow-up visits with your doctor. Talk to your doctor about the results of all of your pregnancy tests.
If you are a woman who can get pregnant, you must use acceptable birth control during your entire CellCept therapy, and continue birth control for 6 weeks after you stop taking CellCept, unless you choose to abstain from sexual intercourse with a man completely. Talk to your doctor about other birth control methods that you can use while taking CellCept.
If you plan to become pregnant, talk with your doctor. You and your doctor can decide if other medicines to prevent rejection may be right for you.
If you become pregnant while taking CellCept, do not stop taking CellCept. Call your doctor right away. In certain situations, you and your doctor may decide that taking CellCept is more important to your health than the possible risks to your unborn baby.


				You and your doctor should report your pregnancy to
				
Mycophenolate Pregnancy Registry (1-800-617-8191)



		The purpose of this registry is to gather information about the health of you and your baby.
	
Taking CellCept with other anti-rejection medicines may raise your chance of getting an infection. It may raise your chance of getting cancer of the immune system (lymphoma) or other cancers, such as skin cancer. Talk with your doctor right away if you have any signs of infection such as fever, tiredness, headache, redness of skin/wound or swollen lymph glands. Tell your doctor about any changes in your skin.

		CellCept weakens the body's immune system and affects your ability to fight infections. Serious infections, possibly leading to death, can happen with CellCept. These serious infections can include:
		

				Viral infections. Certain viruses can live in your body and cause active infections when your immune system is weak. These viruses or infections may include:

Cytomegalovirus (CMV), shingles, other herpes infections. CMV can cause serious tissue and blood infections.
BK virus. This virus can damage the kidney. It can cause the new kidney to fail.
Hepatitis B and C viruses. Hepatitis viruses can affect how your liver works. Talk to your doctor about how hepatitis viruses may affect you.


Brain infection called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). PML can be fatal. Symptoms include clumsiness, weakness that keeps getting worse, not being able to move or use one side of the body, and changes in vision, speech or personality (such as not caring about things that you usually care about and confusion).
Fungal infections. Yeasts and other types of fungal infections can happen with CellCept and can cause serious tissue and blood infections



WHO SHOULD NOT TAKE CELLCEPT?

You should not use CellCept if you have ever had an allergic reaction to CellCept or any of its ingredients. Please discuss this with your doctor.

WHAT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION SHOULD I KNOW ABOUT CELLCEPT?


People taking high doses of CellCept each day may have a decrease in blood counts, including white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets.
Your doctor will do blood tests before you start taking CellCept and during therapy with CellCept to check your blood cell counts.
Tell your doctor right away if you have any signs of infection, or any unexpected bruising or bleeding, unusual tiredness, lack of energy, dizziness or fainting.

Cases of bleeding in the stomach or intestines that required hospitalization have been reported. Early signs of bleeding may include stomach pain, blood in your stool, or dark, sticky stools. Tell your doctor if you have any digestive problems, such as ulcers.
People taking CellCept should not take live vaccines. Some vaccines may not work as well during treatment with CellCept.
Tell your doctor about all the medicines you are taking including prescription and nonprescription medicines, vitamins and herbal supplements.

CellCept® Co-pay Card Terms and Conditions





WHO IS CELLCEPT FOR?
CellCept® (mycophenolate mofetil) is a medicine given by prescription to people who had a kidney, heart or liver transplant. CellCept can help prevent rejection of the new organ.
Your body's immune system can tell that the new heart, liver or kidney is different and tries to reject it. CellCept is taken along with other anti-rejection medicines to help control your immune system. They help keep it from "rejecting" the transplant.
Follow your doctor's exact orders for taking CellCept and all other medicines.
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT INFORMATION I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT CELLCEPT?


Pregnant women who take CellCept have a higher chance of losing the baby during the first 3 months of pregnancy. There also is a higher chance the baby will have birth defects.
You should have one pregnancy test immediately before starting CellCept and another pregnancy test 8 to 10 days later. Pregnancy tests should be repeated during routine follow-up visits with your doctor. Talk to your doctor about the results of all of your pregnancy tests.
If you are a woman who can get pregnant, you must use acceptable birth control during your entire CellCept therapy, and continue birth control for 6 weeks after you stop taking CellCept, unless you choose to abstain from sexual intercourse with a man completely. Talk to your doctor about other birth control methods that you can use while taking CellCept.

WHO IS CELLCEPT FOR?
CellCept® (mycophenolate mofetil) is a medicine given by prescription to people who had a kidney, heart or liver transplant. CellCept can help prevent rejection of the new organ.
Your body's immune system can tell that the new heart, liver or kidney is different and tries to reject it. CellCept is taken along with other anti-rejection medicines to help control your immune system. They help keep it from "rejecting" the transplant.
Follow your doctor's exact orders for taking CellCept and all other medicines.
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT INFORMATION I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT CELLCEPT?


Pregnant women who take CellCept have a higher chance of losing the baby during the first 3 months of pregnancy. There also is a higher chance the baby will have birth defects.
You should have one pregnancy test immediately before starting CellCept and another pregnancy test 8 to 10 days later. Pregnancy tests should be repeated during routine follow-up visits with your doctor. Talk to your doctor about the results of all of your pregnancy tests.
If you are a woman who can get pregnant, you must use acceptable birth control during your entire CellCept therapy, and continue birth control for 6 weeks after you stop taking CellCept, unless you choose to abstain from sexual intercourse with a man completely. Talk to your doctor about other birth control methods that you can use while taking CellCept.
If you plan to become pregnant, talk with your doctor. You and your doctor can decide if other medicines to prevent rejection may be right for you.
If you become pregnant while taking CellCept, do not stop taking CellCept. Call your doctor right away. In certain situations, you and your doctor may decide that taking CellCept is more important to your health than the possible risks to your unborn baby.


				You and your doctor should report your pregnancy to
				
Mycophenolate Pregnancy Registry (1-800-617-8191)



		The purpose of this registry is to gather information about the health of you and your baby.
	
Taking CellCept with other anti-rejection medicines may raise your chance of getting an infection. It may raise your chance of getting cancer of the immune system (lymphoma) or other cancers, such as skin cancer. Talk with your doctor right away if you have any signs of infection such as fever, tiredness, headache, redness of skin/wound or swollen lymph glands. Tell your doctor about any changes in your skin.

		CellCept weakens the body's immune system and affects your ability to fight infections. Serious infections, possibly leading to death, can happen with CellCept. These serious infections can include:
		

				Viral infections. Certain viruses can live in your body and cause active infections when your immune system is weak. These viruses or infections may include:

Cytomegalovirus (CMV), shingles, other herpes infections. CMV can cause serious tissue and blood infections.
BK virus. This virus can damage the kidney. It can cause the new kidney to fail.
Hepatitis B and C viruses. Hepatitis viruses can affect how your liver works. Talk to your doctor about how hepatitis viruses may affect you.


Brain infection called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). PML can be fatal. Symptoms include clumsiness, weakness that keeps getting worse, not being able to move or use one side of the body, and changes in vision, speech or personality (such as not caring about things that you usually care about and confusion).
Fungal infections. Yeasts and other types of fungal infections can happen with CellCept and can cause serious tissue and blood infections



WHO SHOULD NOT TAKE CELLCEPT?

You should not use CellCept if you have ever had an allergic reaction to CellCept or any of its ingredients. Please discuss this with your doctor.

WHAT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION SHOULD I KNOW ABOUT CELLCEPT?


People taking high doses of CellCept each day may have a decrease in blood counts, including white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets.
Your doctor will do blood tests before you start taking CellCept and during therapy with CellCept to check your blood cell counts.
Tell your doctor right away if you have any signs of infection, or any unexpected bruising or bleeding, unusual tiredness, lack of energy, dizziness or fainting.

Cases of bleeding in the stomach or intestines that required hospitalization have been reported. Early signs of bleeding may include stomach pain, blood in your stool, or dark, sticky stools. Tell your doctor if you have any digestive problems, such as ulcers.

What is CellCept?
CellCept® (mycophenolate mofetil) is a prescription medicine for people who have had a kidney, heart, or liver transplant. CellCept can help prevent rejection of the transplanted organ.
CellCept is available in multiple formulations for adults and children who have had a transplant

Capsules
Tablets
Oral Suspension

Not actual size and may not represent exact color.
CellCept is used with other medicines called cyclosporines and corticosteroids. These medicines work together to prevent rejection of your transplanted organ.
CellCept has been used safely and works in children who have had a kidney transplant as it does in adults. It is not known if CellCept is safe and works in children who have had a heart or liver transplant.
What is organ transplant rejection?
Rejection happens when your immune system thinks your transplanted organ is foreign and attacks it.
During rejection, the transplanted organ doesn't work as well as it should. This doesn't mean that it will stop working completely, and it doesn't mean that you will always lose your transplanted organ. If you have any concerns or questions about organ rejection, talk to your transplant team.

Why CellCept?
CellCept is one of many anti-rejection medicines (also called immunosuppressive medicines) prescribed to help patients prevent rejection of their transplanted organ. After your transplant, you may take several of these medicines to suppress your immune system so that it won't attack your transplanted organ.

You can expect that once you bring up the topic of ED, your doctor can take it from there. So here are some ways to break the ice when he asks how everything’s going: 
1. "I have trouble sometimes in bed. Could it be ED?"
2. "I think I might have ED. What can I do about it?"
3. "Could VIAGRA work for me?" 
Help make the most of your VIAGRA Talk.
By asking questions about VIAGRA and ED, you can help your doctor get the information he needs to find out if you have ED and to decide if VIAGRA is right for you.

Watch out for VIAGRA offers with “no prescription.”  





















 
Don't be fooled by counterfeit VIAGRA.






Counterfeits aren’t just a cheap knock-off of a proven product; they’re illegal, potentially harmful fakes. It’s hard to tell where or how they were made—or even what’s inside them.
 









WATCH:
A counterfeit epidemic
 










VIAGRA is one of the most counterfeited drugs in the world. 
In March 2011, Pfizer Global Security studied the search results for the term "buy VIAGRA" to see how many online pharmacies were selling counterfeit VIAGRA. 
The study was conducted using the top 2 search engines over a 5-day period. During this time, 22 unique sites consistently appeared among the top search results claiming to sell VIAGRA manufactured by Pfizer. Pfizer Global Security then ordered VIAGRA from these sites and tested the chemical composition of the pills.

Learn how to safely buy online.
Make sure that when you buy VIAGRA online, you get real VIAGRA. Many of the sites that claim to sell VIAGRA online are actually selling potentiallydangerous counterfeits.


3.2-watch-online-scams.jpg





 Follow these steps: 
1 Make sure the website requires a valid prescription. It’s illegal to sell VIAGRA without a prescription from a qualified healthcare professional.
2 Make sure you see a U.S. address and phone number. This can help you make sure the website is not selling unregulated medication from overseas.
3 Check if they claim to sell “generic VIAGRA” for ED. The FDA has never approved the so-called “generic VIAGRA” for ED you see for sale online. It could be counterfeit and may cause you harm.
4 VIAGRA only comes in 3 doses. 25 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg. VIAGRA is a tablet. Any other form, like “fast-dissolving,” “extra-strength,” “soft-tab,” or “VIAGRA for Women” is not FDA-approved.
5 Look for Verified Internet Pharmacy Practice Sites® (VIPPS®). A VIPPS® accreditation ensures the website you are purchasing from is secure and reliable.

Selected Safety Information About ZEPATIER® (elbasvir and grazoprevir) tablets



WARNING: RISK OF HEPATITIS B VIRUS (HBV) REACTIVATION IN PATIENTS COINFECTED WITH HCV AND HBV

Test all patients for evidence of current or prior HBV infection by measuring hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) before initiating treatment with ZEPATIER. HBV reactivation has been reported in HCV/HBV coinfected patients who were undergoing or had completed treatment with HCV direct-acting antivirals and were not receiving HBV antiviral therapy. Some cases have resulted in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death. Monitor HCV/HBV coinfected patients for clinical and laboratory signs of hepatitis flare or HBV reactivation during HCV treatment and post-treatment follow-up. Initiate appropriate patient management for HBV infection as clinically indicated.
HBV reactivation has been reported in HBsAg positive patients and also in patients with serologic evidence of resolved HBV infection (ie, HBsAg negative and anti-HBc positive). The risk of HBV reactivation may be increased in patients receiving some immunosuppressant or chemotherapeutic agents. HBV reactivation is characterized as an abrupt increase in HBV replication manifesting as a rapid increase in serum HBV DNA level. In patients with resolved HBV infection, reappearance of HBsAg can occur. Reactivation of HBV replication may be accompanied by hepatitis, ie, increases in aminotransferase levels and, in severe cases, increases in bilirubin levels, liver failure, and death can occur.

Contraindications: ZEPATIER is contraindicated in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C). ZEPATIER is also contraindicated with inhibitors of OATP1B1/3 that are known or expected to signifiantly increase grazoprevir plasma concentrations (eg, atazanavir, darunavir, lopinavir, saquinavir, tipranavir, cyclosporine), strong CYP3A inducers (eg, carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin, St. John’s Wort), and efavirenz.
Risks Associated with RBV Combination Treatment: If ZEPATIER is administered with RBV, the contraindications, warnings and precautions, adverse reactions, and dosing for RBV also apply to this combination regimen. Refer to the RBV prescribing information.
Increased Risk of ALT Elevations: Elevations of ALT to >5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) occurred in 1% of subjects, generally at or after treatment week 8. These late ALT elevations were typically asymptomatic and most resolved with ongoing or completion of therapy. Perform hepatic lab testing on patients prior to therapy, at treatment week 8, and as clinically indicated. For patients receiving 16 weeks of therapy, perform additional hepatic lab testing at treatment week 12.
Patients should be instructed to consult their health care professional without delay if they have onset of fatigue, weakness, lack of appetite, nausea and vomiting, jaundice, or discolored feces. Consider discontinuing ZEPATIER if ALT levels remain persistently >10 times ULN. Discontinue ZEPATIER if ALT elevation is accompanied by signs or symptoms of liver inflammation or increasing conjugated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, or INR.

Risk of Adverse Reactions Due to Drug Interactions: Coadministration of ZEPATIER is not recommended with certain strong CYP3A inhibitors (eg, oral ketoconazole or the cobicistat-containing regimens of elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir [disoproxil fumarate or alafenamide]). The concomitant use of ZEPATIER with these drugs may lead to greater exposure to ZEPATIER.
ZEPATIER may increase concentrations of certain drugs. Do not exceed atorvastatin 20 mg/daily or rosuvastatin 10 mg/daily when given with ZEPATIER. If ZEPATIER is given with fluvastatin, lovastatin, or simvastatin, give the lowest statin dose necessary and closely monitor for statin-associated adverse events. If ZEPATIER and tacrolimus are coadministered, frequent monitoring of tacrolimus whole blood concentrations, changes in renal function, and tacrolimus-associated adverse events is recommended.

Risk of Reduced Therapeutic Effect Due to Drug Interactions: The concomitant use of ZEPATIER and certain drugs may cause significant decrease of elbasvir and grazoprevir plasma concentrations, which may lead to reduced therapeutic effect of ZEPATIER and possible development of resistance. Coadministration of ZEPATIER is not recommended with moderate CYP3A inducers (eg, nafcillin, bosentan, etravirine, modafinil).
Adverse Reactions: In subjects receiving ZEPATIER for 12 weeks, the most commonly reported adverse reactions of all intensity (≥5% in placebo-controlled trials) compared to placebo were fatigue, headache, and nausea. In subjects receiving ZEPATIER with RBV for 16 weeks, the most commonly reported adverse reactions of moderate or severe intensity (≥5%) were anemia and headache.

Before prescribing ZEPATIER, please read the accompanying Prescribing Information, including the Boxed Warning about the risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation in patients coinfected with HCV and HBV. The Patient Information also is available.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
