OUR LEGACY: THEN & NOW







Bovie Medical today is a leading maker of medical devices and supplies as well as the developer of J-Plasma®, a patented new plasma-based surgical product that is a transformational tool for surgeons.








It all began with far simpler technology.
The company was born in the late 1970s as a manufacturer of disposable penlights for the medical industry. The success of this line prompted the development and manufacture of battery-operated, tubular products, with the same type of assembly manufacturing technologies. A new line of cauteries was also a success.
Good design and manufacturing combined with smart marketing and excellent customer service moved the company forward.
As Bovie Medical grew, requests from the industry drove our design and development teams to manufacture and distribute additional products. Bovie Medical now sets the standard for surgical center and hospital-based electrosurgical generators and accessories with a full range of state-of-the-art models.




In the late 1990’s Bovie acquired the rights to J-Plasma which utilizes a gas ionization process to produce a stable, focused beam of plasma that provides surgeons with greater precision, minimal invasiveness and an absence of conductive currents through the patient during surgery.
With further development to included the addition of a retractable blade, which allows it to function as a cutting tool that leaves behind almost no collateral thermal injury.
Still in the early stages of commercialization, we believe J-Plasma will be a transformational product across a wide range of surgical specialties.
Today, the legacy of Bovie continues as we design and develop the most advanced electrosurgery generators and accessories and advanced energy devices to meet the needs of today’s surgeon.

QUALITY SYSTEM: SERVICE








Warranty and repair information
Bovie Medical Corporation is proud to state that we have a fully staffed service and repair organization dedicated to responding to our customer’s concerns by supplying fast turn around on repairs and courteous service representatives. We are also pleased to announce that we have generators available on a temporary or loaner basis. These units are supplied at no charge to our customers when units are under warranty and at a small nominal charge for units which are no longer under warranty.







WARRANTY
Bovie Medical Corporation has a four year warranty on our standard Aaron and Bovie Electrosurgical Generator lines from the date of sale. To compensate for time to sell the generator we’ve added a 6 month grace period to the warranty period. Essentially, you have a warranty period of 4 years and 6 months from the date of manufacture.
WHEN WAS YOUR UNIT BUILT?
The date manufactured is coded within the serial number of the generator. The decode is in the following form: AA or BV are the leading characters followed by a two digit work week, then the two digit year and then followed by a unique number in the series of units built that week. An example: AA3407010 would be an Aaron series unit, it was the tenth (10th) unit built in the thirty-fourth (34th) work week of 2007.
TROUBLESHOOTING TIPS
1) The best tip requires some planning. Have a spare pencil, a spare patient return cord and spare patient return pad or plate on hand. This will aid troubleshooting so that you can try another pencil and or the patient return cord and or return pad to see if the same problem is occurring. These three items are the items that will most generally wear out first. By preparing ahead, you can troubleshoot the unit yourself and should one of the three items or all three be bad you can get your generator operational much quicker.
2) No power to the unit. Be sure to fully insert the power plug into the back of the unit. On several unit these plugs fit very snuggly and require more pressure to fully seat the plug into the outlet on the generator.
3) Unit showing split pad error. Make sure the split pad is in contact with the patient’s skin. The generator is designed to sense the “impedance” associated with skin contact. On a trial basis you can connect the split pad to your arm, leg or even the palm of your hand.




HOW TO CONTACT US
Send an email to: service@Boviemed.com
– or –
Call the main number at 800-537-2790 or locally 727-384-2323
(ask for customer service).
Tell them you have a malfunctioning unit, explain what is happening (that so we know what to look for in the repair) and give us the serial number located on the back of the unit. Tell us what it’s not doing or is doing that is wrong.
WHY TELL US THIS HISTORY?
Telling us what is wrong with your unit make the repairs much faster. We can focus immediately on what the problem is rather than having to fully test the unit and deduce what’s not right with the unit. Never fear that we will miss something; we always fully test each unit after repair or troubleshooting to make sure the unit performs to the specification. We expect each unit that leaves the service and repair group will perform to manufacturing specifications, no exceptions.

Company history[edit]
Bovie Medical takes its name from Dr. William T. Bovie, an American scientist and inventor who is credited with inventing the electrosurgical generator in 1926.[1] Today, U.S.-headquartered Bovie Medical develops and manufactures advanced energy devices for use in open, laparoscopic and robotic procedures, with a full line of office, surgery center and hospital-based electrosurgical generators and accessories marketed through Bovie’s own brands and on a private label basis to distributors worldwide. The company also designs, develops and manufactures electrosurgical equipment for medical device manufacturers through original equipment manufacturing (OEM) agreements, and continues to add product lines through its distributor network.[2]
Bovie went public in 1983 and is listed on the NYSE under the symbol BVX.
Bovie manufactures J-Plasma a key product within their advanced energy portfolio. This product was 510k approved in 2012, received a CE Mark in 2014 and commercialized in 2014.[3] J-Plasma offers a high level of precision with a high level of control and safety. In addition to the surgical clinical benefits J-Plasma has been proven to offer benefits of Cold Atmospheric Plasma (CAP) in wound healing and treatment of cancer.[4]
In December 2013, Robert L. Gershon was appointed Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of Directors.
J-Plasma® and the Bovie® Ultimate™ Operating Room Generator have been recognized by the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons (SLS) as an Innovative Product of the Year for three consecutive years: 2014, 2015 and 2016.[5]

Company history[edit]
Bovie Medical takes its name from Dr. William T. Bovie, an American scientist and inventor who is credited with inventing the electrosurgical generator in 1926.[1] Today, U.S.-headquartered Bovie Medical develops and manufactures advanced energy devices for use in open, laparoscopic and robotic procedures, with a full line of office, surgery center and hospital-based electrosurgical generators and accessories marketed through Bovie’s own brands and on a private label basis to distributors worldwide. The company also designs, develops and manufactures electrosurgical equipment for medical device manufacturers through original equipment manufacturing (OEM) agreements, and continues to add product lines through its distributor network.[2]
Bovie went public in 1983 and is listed on the NYSE under the symbol BVX.
Bovie manufactures J-Plasma a key product within their advanced energy portfolio. This product was 510k approved in 2012, received a CE Mark in 2014 and commercialized in 2014.[3] J-Plasma offers a high level of precision with a high level of control and safety. In addition to the surgical clinical benefits J-Plasma has been proven to offer benefits of Cold Atmospheric Plasma (CAP) in wound healing and treatment of cancer.[4]
In December 2013, Robert L. Gershon was appointed Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of Directors.
J-Plasma® and the Bovie® Ultimate™ Operating Room Generator have been recognized by the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons (SLS) as an Innovative Product of the Year for three consecutive years: 2014, 2015 and 2016.[5]
