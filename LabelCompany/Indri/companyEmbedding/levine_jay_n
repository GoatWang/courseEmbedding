Jay Levin


Born
New York


Occupation
Newspaper editor, writer, entrepreneur


Jay Levin is an American journalist who was founder, editor and CEO of the LA Weekly, one of the seminal newspapers of the weekly alternative press in the United States, until 1992. Currently he is founding President of The Big EQ Campaign, a non-profit organization that has undertaken a mass marketing campaign to mobilize the public to mandate that social and emotional learning skills be included in every schools curricum.

Early life[edit]
Jay Levin was born in New York, the son of a tool-and-die maker.
Career[edit]
Jay Levin is best known as the founder of the LA Weekly, of which he was editor-in-chief and president for many years before selling what he had grown to be the largest and most successful city weekly in the country. Levin put together an investment group that included actor Michael Douglas, Burt Kleiner, Joe Benadon and Pete Kameron. The publication's first issue featured a group of female comedians, including the then-little known Sandra Bernhard, on its cover. Subsequent issues featured exposés on the Los Angeles basin's air quality and U.S. interventionism in Central America. The LA Weekly was also notable for its coverage of independent cinema and the Los Angeles music scene.
Levin retained many of the writers he had brought to the Free Press and hired Joie Davidow to edit the arts and entertainment section. Davidow produced a comprehensive calendar section and explored undiscovered fashion districts, discovering new designers.
In 1985, the LA Weekly launched a glossy magazine, L.A. Style, which Davidow edited. L.A. Style was sold to American Express Publishing Co. in 1988 and merged with Buzz magazine in 1993.[1]
By 1990, the LA Weekly achieved a circulation of 165,000, making it the largest urban weekly in the US.
Post-LA Weekly[edit]
Levin stepped down as president of the LA Weekly in 1992 in order to found a progressive cable TV network and was succeeded by Michael Sigman as publisher and Kit Rachlis as editor. The newspaper was sold to Stern Publishing, owner of the Village Voice, in 1994; in October 2005, it was sold to the Phoenix, Arizona-based Village Voice Media. In September 2012, it was transferred to the Denver-based Voice Media Group in a management buyout.[2]
Levin founded the start-up progressive channel, Planet Central TV, and a website and magazine called Real Talk L.A.[3]
Recent career[edit]
For the last 15 years Levin has split his time between starting, growing or turning around media properties such as TheFix.com; and on life coaching focused on teaching life mastery; helping people reorient their lives, careers and relationships without spending years in therapy. Most recently he has been working with 15 to 20 CEOs on becoming socially conscious and effective managers while helping them elevate the bottom-line performance of their businesses and grow their companies.
Based on his knowledge of the positive effects of Life skills training, Levin early in 2016 launched The Big EQ Campaign to galvanize the public around schools including daily curriculum education for students and staff in emotional management and in relationship and co-creativity social skills – to the profound benefit of children, teens, adults, the schools themselves, and society and business (the economy) as a whole. When training in EQ development is combined with training in the skills to relate empathically to and communicate well with others, and to make cogent decisions, the familiar term used in academic circles for such overall life skills training is “Social and Emotional Learning,” known as SEL.
The Campaign argues that evidence shows that SEL skills and capacities can have on a person’s life, ability to learn, and long-term success. So much so that SEL (which includes EQ development) has the potential to elevate society as a whole - in the form of better relationships all around, less conflict, and more productive and healthier individuals, workplaces, institutions and communities. SEL training tends to dissipate violence, racism, hard drug usage and other forms of anti-social mindsets and behaviors while improving academic and life-long success and lowering criminal justice, mental and physical health and other social costs.
Over the years Levin has worked with hundreds of individuals one-on-one. Encouraged by clients, he also began offering courses to hundreds of people in Life Elevation, relationships and leadership. Highly successful in terms of reorienting people’s lives, careers and inner and outer relations for the better, the courses (like his personal coaching) allow individuals to learn systems they can use to benefit themselves - in effect, participants, including CEOS, learn to become their own coaches. Along with gaining mastery of inner emotional and mental demons, participants gain a sophisticated and necessary education in the realities of human inter-reaction and selfhood that the culture fails to provide en masse. Participants report learning tools that give them more confidence in nearly every situation and which make them better able to cope when challenged.[4]

Springleaf Financial Services Announces Appointment of Jay Levine as 
      New President and CEO and Retirement of Frederick W. Geissinger






September 13, 2011 06:08 PM Eastern Daylight Time



EVANSVILLE, Ind.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Springleaf Financial Services (Springleaf) announced today that its 
      board of directors has appointed Jay Levine as the new President and 
      Chief Executive Officer (CEO), effective October 1, 2011, and that 
      President and CEO Frederick W. Geissinger will retire from the Company, 
      effective October 1, 2011.
    


      Mr. Levine has more than 25 years of experience in the financial 
      services industry. He recently served as CEO at RBS Greenwich Capital 
      and created one of the most important fixed income trading institutions 
      during his tenure there. Earlier at Salomon Brothers, Mr. Levine was 
      responsible for building a market for a number of innovative mortgage 
      products that extended housing finance to a broader range of borrowers.
    

      Upon his new appointment Mr. Levine commented, “It is my strong belief 
      that all the makings of success are in place here at Springleaf. The 
      Company has an exceptional management team and almost 6,000 world class 
      professionals throughout our branch network. The recent demise of many 
      of Springleaf’s competitors, combined with the enormous needs of the 
      American consumer, creates a compelling market opportunity for 
      Springleaf.”
    

      Mr. Geissinger began his tenure as CEO of Springleaf Financial Services 
      16 years ago. Under Mr. Geissinger’s leadership, Springleaf has become a 
      leading financial services company. During the past decade and a half, 
      the Company was acquired by American International Group, grew assets to 
      a record $25 billion and expanded internationally. Mr. Geissinger 
      successfully led the Company through the recent financial crisis and 
      through the recent sale of an 80% interest in Springleaf to one of 
      Fortress Investment Group’s managed funds in November 2010.
    

      Reflecting on his tenure Mr. Geissinger remarked, “We have all led this 
      Company through the worst financial crisis in our lifetimes and together 
      we have built what I believe is one of the best finance companies in the 
      United States. I am very proud of our accomplishments.”
    

      “Thanks to Rick’s leadership, and the efforts of thousands of Springleaf 
      employees, our Company has strengthened its position as a national 
      leader in the financial services industry. On behalf of the board, I 
      would like to recognize and thank Rick for these and so many other 
      accomplishments," said incoming Springleaf CEO, Mr. Levine.
