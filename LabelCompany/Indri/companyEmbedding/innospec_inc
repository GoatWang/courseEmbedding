Oilfield Services

Drilling Completions Production Midstream 





Oilfield Services
In the oil and gas industry, perfect chemistry is everything. Whether it’s optimizing your drilling, completions or production challenges, safeguarding people and the environment, or providing a highly successful client-supplier relationship, Innospec Oilfield Services (IOFS) has the chemistry you’re looking for. 
As a global specialty chemical company, Innospec is focused on developing and delivering the best possible technologies—combined with the high level of service vital to support your North America E&P operations. Through its recent acquisitions, IOFS division provides a full suite of specialty products and services to support drilling, completions, production and midstream projects in all major U.S. oil and gas basins.





Drilling
In the drilling process, fluids are used for several reasons preventing formation fluids from entering the wellbore, keeping the bits cool and clean, carrying cuttings to the surface, suspending cuttings and preventing loss circulation.  Innospec Oilfield Services (IOFS) offers the products, application knowledge and understanding of oil and gas production necessary to increase the efficiency of all types of drilling operations.





Completions
In the completions process, we challenge conventional thinking by developing key relationships with suppliers and customers to co-develop proprietary fluid systems—systems that, in most cases, promote using fewer chemicals. The result: helping you do more with less while simultaneously enhancing results.





Production
In the production process, our professionals are committed to providing advanced products and application techniques to meet the chemical challenges associated with energy production. To that end, our fully equipped regional laboratories are just one of the differentiating services that set us apart.



 

Midstream
In the midstream process, ensuring asset integrity and flow assurance are critical to the day-to-day operations of any pipeline system.  With over five decades of industry experience, Innospec Oilfield Services (IOFS) helps customers achieve their operational goals while maintaining strict compliance in all areas of the midstream market.

Production plants are located in multiple countries including UK, France, Germany, Philippines, and the United States.
The company has around 1300 employees located in 20 countries.

Strata Control was acquired in December 2013 in Oilfield Drilling Specialties.
Chemsil Silicones and Chemtec were acquired in September 2013 in Personal Care.
Bachman Services was acquired in November 2013 in Oilfield Production Specialties.
Independence Oilfield Chemicals was acquired in November 2014 in Oilfield Chemicals.
Innospec divested its Aroma Chemicals business to Emerald Kalama in July 2015.

Criminal activities[edit]
In 2007 US authorities alerted the UK SFO to Innospec's activities which had come to their attention via a UN committee and a complaint filed with SEC involving their Iraqi agents and former company executives.[2] In a 2010 investigation by The Guardian and Guardian Films, Innospec, while trading as company Octel, was revealed to have been bribing officials in Iraq and Indonesia with millions of dollars in order to continue using TEL as a fuel additive, which causes brain damage in children through elevated lead levels.[3] The company negotiated a global settlement, although this was condemned by Lord Justice Thomas of the UK during sentencing.[4] Innospec has a new management team in place who have introduced new compliance procedures.[citation needed] In October 2014 the convictions of Miltiades Papachristos and Dennis Kerrison for conspiracy to corrupt were upheld against appeals.[5] The company was released from its Monitor supervision and successfully completed its parole period in early 2015.
