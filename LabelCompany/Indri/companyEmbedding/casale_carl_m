“CHS is clearly a company in motion. And when it comes to creating value for our owners, our goal is to stay in motion.”
About Casale: Born and raised near Portland, Ore., Casale received a bachelor’s degree in agricultural economics from Oregon State University and an executive MBA from Washington University in St. Louis. He joined CHS in early 2011 after working for the Monsanto Co. for 26 years, rising to executive vice president and chief financial officer.
Personal file: Casale operates a family-owned blueberry farm with his wife near Aurora, Ore., which has done business with area cooperatives for generations.
What’s big in 2015: CHS will begin the three-year construction of the Spiritwood fertilizer manufacturing plant near Jamestown, N.D. At nearly $3 billion, it will be the largest investment in the company’s history, and will provide fertilizer products mainly to Minnesota, the Dakotas, Montana and Canada. The plant will enable the Inver Grove Heights-based company to manufacture fertilizer for the first time, using the region’s natural gas reserves, and supply it to growers through wholesale customers and the company’s own retail facilities. The company is also investing more than $400 million to increase efficiency and diesel production at its refinery in Laurel, Mont. — one of two that it owns. The CHS brand may become more familiar in the coming year: The company purchased naming rights for the new regional downtown ballpark for the St. Paul Saints baseball team, slated to open in March as CHS Field.
Final word: “To be a leader at CHS means several things: A relentless focus on helping our owners grow. Integrity and accountability. A learning culture. We’re putting those in place so the CHS culture is sustainable and can be regenerated with every successive generation of leadership that comes through.”
TOM MEERSMAN

“CHS is clearly a company in motion. And when it comes to creating value for our owners, our goal is to stay in motion.”
About Casale: Born and raised near Portland, Ore., Casale received a bachelor’s degree in agricultural economics from Oregon State University and an executive MBA from Washington University in St. Louis. He joined CHS in early 2011 after working for the Monsanto Co. for 26 years, rising to executive vice president and chief financial officer.
Personal file: Casale operates a family-owned blueberry farm with his wife near Aurora, Ore., which has done business with area cooperatives for generations.
What’s big in 2015: CHS will begin the three-year construction of the Spiritwood fertilizer manufacturing plant near Jamestown, N.D. At nearly $3 billion, it will be the largest investment in the company’s history, and will provide fertilizer products mainly to Minnesota, the Dakotas, Montana and Canada. The plant will enable the Inver Grove Heights-based company to manufacture fertilizer for the first time, using the region’s natural gas reserves, and supply it to growers through wholesale customers and the company’s own retail facilities. The company is also investing more than $400 million to increase efficiency and diesel production at its refinery in Laurel, Mont. — one of two that it owns. The CHS brand may become more familiar in the coming year: The company purchased naming rights for the new regional downtown ballpark for the St. Paul Saints baseball team, slated to open in March as CHS Field.
Final word: “To be a leader at CHS means several things: A relentless focus on helping our owners grow. Integrity and accountability. A learning culture. We’re putting those in place so the CHS culture is sustainable and can be regenerated with every successive generation of leadership that comes through.”
TOM MEERSMAN

Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement.

What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.
