Feb 2017Corporate Presentation






Welcome to Amarc Resources Ltd.
Amarc is a British Columbia-based mineral exploration and development company focused on developing the IKE Project, an exciting new porphyry copper deposit discovery in British Columbia ("BC"). Amarc is led by an experienced management team with a demonstrated history of advancing exploration and development projects and delivering outstanding value to shareholders. The company is publicly traded in Canada on the TSX Venture Exchange (AHR) and in the United States on the Over the Counter Bulletin Board (AXREF).

Amarc has made a significant copper-molybdenum-silver discovery at its IKE project located in the heartland of the province's copper mining industry. Assay results received from an initial nine hole (5,400 metre) diamond drill program have confirmed the presence of an important porphyry deposit. The nine discovery drill holes intersected chalcopyrite and molybdenite mineralization from surface and over a broad area, measuring 1,200 metres east-west by 600 metres north-south and to a depth of approximately 500 metres. Mineralization at IKE remains open in all lateral directions and to depth. The discovery holes and post-drilling geological, geochemical and geophysical surveys completed outwards from the drilled area indicate that the IKE porphyry system has the potential for important-scale resource volumes. 

Amarc has secured additional mineral claims in the IKE area to cover other compelling deposit targets and potential infrastructure sites.

A comprehensive corporate and technical business plan is being implemented to efficiently move IKE forward.

Metals & Mining Company Research Reports


Mining companies, as a rule, carry out such activities as the discovery of reserves, their mining and processing.  Various geological materials are mined – be it coal, gold or silver ore, chromite, salt, and a far more. Some companies specialize on certain products (e.g. metals or minerals), but the industry behemoths offer goods belonging to different product categories.  
Companies active in the mining industry vary according to the size and types of their operations.  Nevertheless, the market is dominated by manufacturers receiving over USD 500 million in revenues annually. BHP Billiton, Vale, Rio Tinto, Shenhua and Suncor are amid companies determining the path of the industry. 
The Catalogue is full of innumerable research reports containing profiles of the major and minor companies involved in metals and mining industries. Besides containing all-inclusive profiles of metals and mineral companies, reports offer unique data on companies’ strengths and weaknesses, financial performance, recent developments and future prospects. Detailed discussions of legal and political framework, product offerings and key competitors are also available in the research studies.
