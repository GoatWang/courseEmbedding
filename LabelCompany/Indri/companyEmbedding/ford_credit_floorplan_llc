These systems may become damaged in a crash. The paired mobile phone must be connected to SYNC, and the 911 Assist feature enabled, in order for 911 to be dialed. When the feature is ON, 911 Assist uses your paired and connected mobile phone to assist occupants to contact emergency services by dialing 911 if your airbag deploys or, on certain vehicles, if the emergency fuel pump shut-off is activated. Aftermarket on-board diagnostic devices may interfere with various vehicle systems including Vehicle Health Report and 911 Assist. To avoid interference, remove the device or contact the device maker for more information on compatibility.

Ladies and
Gentlemen:

Exchange Commission (the “ Commission ”) and

Annex through the representatives (the “
Representatives ”) signing this Agreement on behalf of
themselves and such underwriters (the Representatives and the other

Appendix A to the Sale and Servicing Agreements (defined

”) will be or have been sold by Ford Motor Company, a
Delaware corporation (“ Ford ”), to Ford Motor
Credit Company LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“
Ford Credit ”), pursuant to a sale and assignment

”) between Ford and Ford Credit. All Receivables have been or

Agreement ”), each as further described in the Terms
Annex. A back-up servicer will perform back-up servicing functions

to an administration agreement (the “ Administration
Agreement ”) among Ford Credit, the Trust and the
Indenture Trustee.


     In order to
perfect the security interest of the Indenture Trustee in certain
accounts, the Trust, the Indenture Trustee and the financial
institution acting as the securities intermediary have entered into
an account control agreement (the “ Control Agreement
”) and have or will enter into a series specific account
control agreement (the “ Series 2011-2 Control
Agreement ”).


     The Trust
Agreement, the Sale and Assignment Agreement, the Receivables
Purchase Agreements, the Sale and Servicing Agreements, the Back-up
Servicing Agreement, the Indenture, the Administration Agreement,
the Control Agreement and the Series 2011-2 Control Agreement
are collectively referred to as the “ Basic Documents
.” The Basic Documents and this Agreement are collectively
referred to as the “ Transaction Documents
.”


     The Depositors
have prepared and filed with the Commission under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the “ Securities Act
”), and the rules and regulations of the Commission under the
Securities Act (the “ Rules and Regulations ”),
a registration statement on Form S-3 (having the registration
number stated in the Terms Annex), including a form of prospectus
and all amendments that are required as of the date of this
Agreement relating to the Publicly Registered Notes and the
offering of notes from time to time in accordance with
Rule 415 under the Securities Act. The registration statement,
as amended, has been declared effective by the Commission. Such
registration statement, as amended at the time of effectiveness,
including all material incorporated by reference therein, is
referred to in this Agreement as the “ Registration
Statement .” The Depositors also have filed with, or will
file with, the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) (“
Rule 424(b) ”) under the Securities Act a
prospectus supplement relating to the Publicly Registered Notes
(the “ Prospectus Supplement ”). The prospectus
relating to the Publicly Registered Notes in the form first
required to be filed to satisfy the condition set forth in Rule
172(c) under the Securities Act is referred to as the “
Base Prospectus ,” and the Base Prospectus as
supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement required to be filed to
satisfy the condition set forth in Rule 172(c) under the Securities
Act is referred to as the “ Prospectus .” Any
reference in this Agreement to the Registration Statement, any
preliminary prospectus used in connection with the offering of the
Publicly Registered Notes described in the Terms Annex (the “
Preliminary Prospectus ”) or the Prospectus will be
deemed to refer to and include any exhibits thereto and any
documents incorporated by reference therein, as of the effective
date of the Registration Statement or the date of such Preliminary
Prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be.


     At or prior to the
time that the Representatives first entered into “contracts
of sale” (within the meaning of Rule 159 under the
Securities Act, the “ Contracts of Sale ”) with
investors in the Publicly Registered Notes, which time will be
specified in the Terms Annex (such time, the “ Time of
Sale ”), the Depositors have prepared the Preliminary
Prospectus and the information (including any
“free-writing

2



 


prospectus,” as defined pursuant to
Rule 405 under the Securities Act (a “ Free Writing
Prospectus ”)) listed in the Terms Annex under
“Time of Sale Information” (collectively, the “
Time of Sale Information ”). If, subsequent to the
initial Time of Sale, the Depositors and the Representatives
determine that the original Time of Sale Information included an
untrue statement of material fact or omitted to state a material
fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading and the Representatives advise the Depositors that
investors in the Publicly Registered Notes have elected to
terminate their initial Contracts of Sale and enter into new
Contracts of Sale, then the “ Time of Sale ”
will refer to the time of entry into the first new Contract of Sale
and the “ Time of Sale Information ” will refer
to the information available to purchasers at the time of entry
(prior to the Closing Date) into the first new Contract of Sale,
including any information that corrects such material misstatements
or omissions (such new information, the “ Corrective
Information ”) and the Terms Annex will be deemed to be
amended to include such Corrective Information in the Time of Sale
Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the purposes of
Section 7, in the event that an investor elects not to
terminate its initial Contract of Sale and enter into a new
Contract of Sale, “ Time of Sale ” will refer to
the time of entry into such initial Contract of Sale and “
Time of Sale Information ” with respect to Publicly
Registered Notes to be purchased by such investor will refer to
information available to such purchaser at the time of entry into
such initial Contract of Sale.

misleading; provided that such Depositor makes no
representation and warranty with respect to any statements or
omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with information

officer’s certificate dated the Closing Date of the Chairman

after reasonable investigation, the representations and warranties
of the Servicer contained in each Sale and Servicing Agreement and
of Ford Credit contained in each Receivables Purchase Agreement are
true and correct in all material respects and that Ford Credit has
complied with all agreements and satisfied all conditions to be
performed by it or satisfied by it under such agreements in all
material respects.


     (ii) Each
Depositor, in which such officer will state that, to his or her
knowledge after reasonable investigation, the representations and
warranties of such Depositor contained in the Trust Agreement, each
Sale and Servicing Agreement and each Receivables Purchase
Agreement are true and correct in all material respects, and that
such Depositor has complied with all agreements and satisfied all
conditions to be performed by it or satisfied by it under such
agreements in all material respects.


     (d) 
Officer’s Certificates as to Conditions Precedent. The
Representatives will have received as of the Closing Date an
officer’s certificate signed by the Chairman of the Board,
the President, an Executive Vice President, the Treasurer or any
Assistant Treasurer of each Depositor representing and warranting
that the representations and warranties of such Depositor in this
Agreement are true and correct in all material respects, and that
such Depositor has complied with all agreements and satisfied all
conditions to be performed by it or satisfied by it under this
Agreement in all material respects.


     (e)  No
Material Adverse Change . Since the dates as of which
information is given in the Preliminary Prospectus, as amended or
supplemented, there has not occurred any material adverse change,
or any development involving a prospective material adverse change,
in or affecting particularly (i) the business or assets of
either Depositor, or any material adverse change in the financial
position or results of operations of either Depositor or
(ii) the business or assets of Ford Credit and its
subsidiaries considered as a whole, or any material adverse change
in the financial position or results of operations of Ford Credit
and its subsidiaries considered as a whole, otherwise than as set
forth or contemplated in the Prospectus, which in any case makes it
impracticable or inadvisable in the Representatives’
reasonable judgment to proceed with the public offering or the
delivery of the Publicly Registered Notes on the terms and in the
manner contemplated in the Prospectus.


     (f)  War
Out; Market Out . Subsequent to the execution and delivery of
this Agreement:


     (i) (A) there
will not have occurred a declaration of a general moratorium on
commercial banking activities by either the Federal or New York
State authorities or a material disruption in the securities
settlement or clearance systems in the United States, which
moratorium or disruption remains in effect and which, in the
Representatives’ reasonable judgment, substantially impairs
the Underwriters’ ability to settle the transaction;
provided that the exercise of such judgment will take into
account the availability of alternative means for settlement and
the likely duration of such moratorium or disruption with the
understanding that if the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission or with respect to a banking moratorium, the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System or New York State banking
authority, as applicable, has unequivocally stated prior to the
Closing Date that the resumption of such systems will occur within
three Business Days of the scheduled Closing Date for the Publicly
Registered Notes, the ability to settle the transaction will not be
deemed to be substantially impaired and (B) the United States
will not have become engaged in hostilities which have resulted in
the declaration of a national emergency or a declaration of war,
which makes it impracticable or inadvisable, in the
Representatives’ reasonable judgment, to proceed with the
public offering or the delivery of the Publicly Registered Notes on
the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus as
amended or supplemented; and

9



 


     (ii) there will
not have occurred (A) any suspension or limitation on trading
in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange or the
National Association of Securities Dealers National Market system,
or any setting of minimum prices for trading on such exchange or
market system, (B) any suspension of trading of any securities
of Ford Motor Company on any exchange or in the over-the-counter
market or (C) any material outbreak or material escalation of
hostilities involving the engagement of armed conflict in which the
United States is involved or (D) any material adverse change
in the general economic, political, legal, tax, regulatory or
financial conditions or currency exchange rates in the United
States (whether resulting from events within or outside the United
States) which, in the Representatives’ view has caused a
substantial deterioration in the price and/or value of the Publicly
Registered Notes, that in the case of clause (A), (B), (C) or
(D), in the mutual reasonable determination of the Representatives
and Ford Credit, the effect of any such event or circumstance makes
it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering
or the delivery of the Publicly Registered Notes on the terms and
in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or
supplemented.

NEW DEVELOPMENTS

Received approval from the Rating Agencies to add medium and heavy
truck lines, fleet lines, and Dealer Development dealerships to the Trust

Origination, servicing, approval authority, underwriting and risk
monitoring for these assets are identical to standard wholesale

Payment rates and dealer risk ratings for the additional assets (in
aggregate) are in line with the Trust

New assets will be subject to concentration limits set in agreement with
the rating agencies

2% of the Trust balance for medium and heavy truck

4% of the Trust balance for fleet

4% of the Trust balance for Dealer Development dealerships

New assets represent about $650 million (about 4.5% of the Trust balance),
and are currently planned to be added to the Trust in July 2008

  Securitization Overview
  U.S. Wholesale Business Overview




�







WHOLESALE BUSINESS OVERVIEW

Wholesale financing is a cornerstone product for Ford Credit.  It builds
dealer satisfaction, develops long-term relationships, and delivers a
consistent source of profitability to the Company

Financing is provided to approximately 4,600 dealerships in the U.S.
including:

Ford-franchised dealers selling Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury brands -
Ford Credit is the primary source of financing for these dealers

Other Ford Trustmark brand dealers including Mazda and Volvo

Non-Ford dealers - primarily affiliated with Ford-franchised dealers



�







2007 ACCOMPLISHMENTS

All Branches were integrated into Business Centers during 2007

Each Business Center has a centralized credit file preparation
and risk analysis department (Dealer Credit)

Dealers will continue to be served by sales personnel located in
their markets; consolidated operations will provide dealers with
extended hours of service and faster contract approvals

Consolidation facilitated continued enhancements to our risk
processes

Reallocation of credit resources to shift focus and resources
from the stronger dealers to the weaker dealers

Creation of ICU risk classification

New dealer credit organization will enhance risk analysis,
reduce variability, and continue to capture the synergies with
the field sales organization

UNDERWRITING - Dealer Risk Rating

A proprietary model is used to assign a risk rating to each dealer

Large sample size and significant historical experience have been
analyzed to identify key indicators that predict a dealer's ability to meet its
financial obligations

Includes capitalization and leverage, liquidity and cash flow,
profitability and credit history

Dealer risk ratings categorized in the following groups:

Group I - strong to superior financial metrics

Group II - fair to favorable financial metrics

Group III - marginal to weak financial metrics

Group IV - poor financial metrics, may be uncollectible

Other - Includes dealers that have no dealer risk rating because Ford
Credit only provides in-transit financing for such dealer




�







16

UNDERWRITING - Dealer Risk Rating



�







UNDERWRITING - Credit Lines

Wholesale financing is provided under established credit lines - a dealer
may have multiple credit lines including new, used, medium and heavy
truck or fleet

New vehicle lines

Generally set and adjusted based on a 60-day vehicle supply - does not
represent a credit commitment

Line size is a guideline, not a strict credit limit - most dealers are
permitted to exceed their lines but this will trigger more extensive
monitoring

Used vehicle lines

Generally set and adjusted based on a 30-day vehicle supply - does not
represent a credit commitment

Line size is a strictly monitored credit limit



�







WHOLESALE FINANCE PLANS

Wholesale financing is provided under the following general finance plans:

Factory purchases - vehicle purchases directly from manufacturer

Direct wholesale purchases - vehicle purchases other than from the
manufacturer (dealer trades, off-lease vehicles, customer trade-ins)

Wholesale transfers - vehicle transfers between dealers

Auction purchases - vehicle purchases from eligible auctions

In-transit period financing




�







IN-TRANSIT PERIOD FINANCING

For Ford, Lincoln and Mercury dealers, Ford Credit provides financing
during the in-transit period - the time between the factory release of the
vehicle and its delivery to the dealer

At factory release, dealer is invoiced by Ford

The in-transit receivable is sold and assigned to Ford Credit ("true sale")

In connection with the sale and assignment, Ford agrees to pay Ford
Credit an adjustment fee for the in-transit period (currently prime rate plus
0.30%)

The in-transit receivable is the obligation of the dealer; the adjustment fee
is the obligation of Ford

In-transit receivables will vary as a percentage of the Trust due to
seasonality



�







GENERAL WHOLESALE FINANCE TERMS

Advance rates

New (untitled) vehicles - 100% of invoice amount, including destination
charges and dealer holdback (currently approximately 3% of MSRP)

Auctioned vehicles - auction price plus auction fee

Used vehicles - up to 100% of wholesale value (as determined by
selected trade publications)

Interest rate

Generally prime rate plus 1.00%

Payment terms

Principal due generally upon sale of related vehicle

Interest and other administrative charges payable monthly in arrears

BUSINESS CENTER ACTIONS

If the Business Center discovers any issues in its monitoring of a dealer, it
may:

Continue discussion with the Ford sales division

Increase audit frequency

Meet with owners/guarantors

Utilize "Blueprint for Success" for comparative dealership
benchmarking

Increase risk rating to trigger more extensive monitoring

Review curtailment options

Schedule a working capital audit

Schedule a field credit review

File liens on property of guarantors

Require consignment agreements



�







STATUS DECLARATION

A dealer status is declared when:

Dealer does not satisfy an SOT condition discovered during an audit

Dealer fails to pay principal or interest

Dealer bankruptcy

Any other circumstances that warrant immediate action

The Business Center may then:

Suspend credit lines

Maintain Ford Credit personnel on site

Collect titles and keys

Secure dealer inventory

Issue demand letters



�







CHARGE-OFF PROCEDURES

If the Business Center does not believe that the dealer can work out of a
status situation, Ford Credit will:

Liquidate vehicles and any available secondary assets to obtain
greatest value

Continue collection efforts against personal and corporate guarantors

In liquidation, inventory is disposed through the following channels:

Transfer of vehicles to other dealers

Transfer of vehicles to the manufacturer

Sale of vehicles at auction




�







WHOLESALE PORTFOLIO PERFORMANCE

Average principal receivables balance is the average of the monthly average principal balances (based on daily balances)
for the period indicated.

Net losses in any period are gross losses, including actual losses and estimated losses, less any recoveries, including
actual recoveries and reductions in the amount of estimated losses, in each case, for such period. Recoveries include
amounts received from any related security in addition to the underlying vehicles.

Liquidations represent monthly cash payments and charge-offs that reduce the outstanding principal balance of a
receivable.

For the non-annual periods, the percentages are annualized.

Beginning in the second quarter 2006, data on Volvo brand vehicles is included.

Historical wholesale losses show the positive effect of Ford Credit's
processes and the experience of Ford Credit's personnel

SAFE HARBOR

Statements included or incorporated by reference herein may constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements
are based on expectations, forecasts and assumptions by Ford Motor Credit Company LLC ("Ford Credit", "we" or "us") management and involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that
could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation:

Automotive Related:

� Continued decline in market share of Ford Motor Company ("Ford");

� Continued or increased price competition for Ford vehicles resulting from industry overcapacity, currency fluctuations or other factors;

� An increase in or acceleration of market shift away from sales of trucks, sport utility vehicles, or other more profitable vehicles, particularly in the United States;

� A significant decline in industry sales and our financing of those sales, particularly in the United States or Europe, resulting from slowing economic growth, geo-political events or other factors;

� Lower-than-anticipated market acceptance of new or existing Ford products;

� Continued or increased high prices for or reduced availability of fuel;

� Adverse effects from the bankruptcy or insolvency of, change in ownership or control of, or alliances entered into by a major competitor;

� Economic distress of suppliers that has in the past or may in the future require Ford to provide financial support or take other measures to ensure supplies of components or materials;

� Work stoppages at Ford or supplier facilities or other interruptions of supplies;

� Single-source supply of components or materials;

� The discovery of defects in Ford vehicles resulting in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns or increased warranty costs;

� Increased safety, emissions (e.g., CO2), fuel economy or other (e.g., pension funding) regulation resulting in higher costs, cash expenditures and/or sales restrictions;

� Unusual or significant litigation or governmental investigations arising out of alleged defects in Ford products or otherwise;

� A change in Ford's requirements for parts or materials where it has entered into long-term supply arrangements that commit it to purchase minimum or fixed quantities of certain parts or
materials, or to pay a minimum amount to the seller ("take-or-pay contracts");

� Adverse effects on our results from a decrease in or cessation of government incentives;

� Adverse effects on Ford's operations resulting from geo-political or other events;

� Substantial negative operating-related cash flows for the near- to medium-term affecting Ford's ability to meet its obligations, invest in its business or refinance its debt;

� Substantial levels of indebtedness adversely affecting Ford's financial condition or preventing Ford from fulfilling its debt obligations (which may grow because Ford is able to incur substantially
more debt, including additional secured debt);

Ford Credit Related:

� Inability to access debt or securitization markets around the world at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts due to additional credit rating downgrades, market volatility, market disruption or
otherwise;

� Higher-than-expected credit losses;

� Increased competition from banks or other financial institutions seeking to increase their share of financing Ford vehicles;

� Collection and servicing problems related to our finance receivables and net investment in operating leases;

� Lower-than-anticipated residual values or higher-than-expected return volumes for leased vehicles;

� New or increased credit, consumer or data protection or other regulations resulting in higher costs and/or additional financing restrictions;

� Changes in Ford's operations or changes in Ford's marketing programs could result in a decline in our financing volumes;

General:

� Labor or other constraints on Ford's or our ability to restructure its or our business;

� Substantial pension and postretirement healthcare and life insurance liabilities impairing Ford's or our liquidity or financial condition;

� Worse-than-assumed economic and demographic experience for postretirement benefit plans (e.g., discount rates, investment returns, and health care cost trends);

� Currency or commodity price fluctuations; and

� Changes in interest rates.

We cannot be certain that any expectations, forecasts or assumptions made by management in preparing these forward-looking statements will prove accurate, or that any projections will be realized. It is
to be expected that there may be differences between projected and actual results. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of their initial issuance, and we do not undertake any
obligation to update or revise publicly any forwardlooking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. For additional discussion of these risk factors, see Item 1A of Part I
of our 2006 10-K Report and Item 1A of Part I of Ford's 2006 10-K Report.

The vehicle's electrical system (including the battery), the wireless service provider's signal and a connected mobile phone must all be available and operating for 911 Assist to function properly. These systems may become damaged in a crash. The paired mobile phone must be connected to SYNC, and the 911 Assist feature enabled, in order for 911 to be dialed. When the feature is ON, 911 Assist uses your paired and connected mobile phone to assist occupants to contact emergency services by dialing 911 if your airbag deploys or, on certain vehicles, if the emergency fuel pump shut-off is activated. Aftermarket on-board diagnostic devices may interfere with various vehicle systems including Vehicle Health Report and 911 Assist. To avoid interference, remove the device or contact the device maker for more information on compatibility.
