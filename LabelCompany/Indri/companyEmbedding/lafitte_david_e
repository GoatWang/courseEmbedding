Deckers Brands Moves M&A Expert Lafitte to COO Role
January 21, 2015 - Newswire







Tweet







Deckers Brands, which owns the Ugg, Teva, Sanuk, Ahnu and Hoka One One brands, has appointed David E. Lafitte chief operating officer (COO), effective Feb. 2. Lafitte previously served as the company’s general counsel and replaces Zohar Ziv, who retired from the company on Jan. 16, 2015.
“Building on four decades of growth and expansion across our organization, we have evolved into a company with a portfolio of brands distributed globally through multiple channels, supported by a larger and more complex infrastructure,” said Angel Martinez, president, chief executive officer and chair of the board of directors. “David has been a key member of our management team during a period of significant expansion. He is a natural leader and team player and has demonstrated an ability to navigate the many facets of our fast-growing and evolving business. We will benefit from his experience and deep knowledge gained from working with a wide range of companies in diverse industries, particularly as we look to drive best practices and further innovate our manufacturing, IT and inventory management functions.”
“I’m looking forward to expanding my role with our seasoned management team at this exciting time in the company’s history,” said Lafitte, pictured to the right. “Deckers is developing a compelling consumer-centric global business model that is supported by a diverse portfolio of brands, a culture of innovation and a commitment to fostering engaging, convenient and seamless shopping experiences for consumers. I am excited to contribute to further building on a first-class infrastructure and supporting our strategic expansion.”
Lafitte has served as general counsel of Deckers since January 2012 and also was a shareholder in the law firm, Stradling, Yocca, Carlson & Rauth, P.C. where he was a member of the firm’s board of directors and executive committee. He specialized in corporate and securities law with an emphasis on public and private mergers and acquisitions, venture capital financings, securities offerings and technology licensing. He has been recognized in the Best Lawyers in America for Corporate Law for the past seven years. He received a J.D. from Tulane University and a bachelor’s degree from University of Colorado.
Deckers Brands portfolio of brands includes Ugg, Teva, Sanuk, Tsubo, Ahnu, Mozo, and Hoka One One. The company’s products are sold in more than 50 countries and territories through select department and specialty stores, 138 Company-owned and operated retail stores, and select online stores, including Company-owned websites.
