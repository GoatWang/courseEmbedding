Top Left Box Every company experiences short term financing needs at some time. Rapid growth, expansion, changes in an industry’s economic cycle can all lead to a situation where a business needs more financing than a traditional bank can provide.
Top Right Box We are experts in innovative and proven financing solutions that provide business lines of credit to help you realize your growth potential. Asset based loans offer fast, flexible, and easy to manage options that meet your working capital needs.
Main Site Image 
Bottom Left Box Since 1994, Advance Capital, Inc., has provided asset based loans that are tailored to the specific needs of existing businesses and new businesses. Many times banks are limited in extending credit to existing companies and new companies that do not fit the profile of a mature, established enterprise.
Traditional commercial lending practices will often not provide small business lines of credit in situations where the company has:

Cash flow issues
Low profitability
Insufficient operating history
Breached a loan covenant
High leverage

Bottom Right Box At Advance Capital we offer the flexibility and creativity of asset based loans and business lines of credit where banks often will not. Accounts receivable financing and inventory financing use the investments and assets you already have to deliver the working capital your business needs.
Our asset based loans feature:


Competitive rates
Flexible options

Why Choose Us 


Advance Capital Management > How We Can Help > Why Choose Us 

Why Choose Us?
Choosing a Financial Adviser is one of the most important decisions of your financial life. The person you select will have a direct effect on your financial future. It’s hard to know what qualifications matter, who to trust and how to move forward.
We understand. Advance Capital Management has spent nearly three decades building trust with our clients and an excellent reputation in the marketplace.
Most of our clients need answers to several questions before they‘re ready to commit to a relationship with one of our financial advisers. Below are the most common concerns that our clients share with us.
Trust
Trust is often the biggest influencer in the decision to work with a Financial Adviser. You need to know that the person you select will act in your best interests at all times. The best way to ensure this is to hire a Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) firm which functions as a fiduciary. A fiduciary is obligated by law to act and make recommendations that are always in the client’s best interests. Advance Capital Management is proud to be a fiduciary organization.
Expertise
While there are no guarantees, it’s important to select a registered investment advisor firm with the expertise and proven background to demonstrate capability. Track record and longevity are good indicators that an RIA firm is credible. Our results have been verified as in compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS).
Advance Capital Management has been helping people manage their financial lives for nearly three decades. We were recognized as one of the top ten largest money managers in Michigan by Crain’s Detroit Business.
Cost
There are different fee structures available in the industry. Many non-fiduciary financial advisers are obligated to sell certain investment products and receive compensation from those they sell—even if they may not be appropriate for your overall financial goals.
When making your selection, look for a firm that is upfront and transparent about their pricing. Advance Capital Management follows a low pricing model.
About Advance Capital Management

Create The Plan 


Advance Capital Management > Explore Our Process > Create The Plan 

Creating a retirement plan is a complex and in-depth process. There are a lot of decisions to make and it is important to consider all the different nuances that make up a comprehensive financial plan.
That’s what we’re here for. An Advance Capital Management adviser will listen to you and walk with you through each decision. You can count on our advisers for their knowledge, experience and unwavering commitment to you and your best interest.
Starting Your Retirement Plan
Once you’ve gathered your information, we’ll create a retirement plan that works for you. Together we’ll determine the asset allocation, cash flow and the monthly withdrawal rate you’ll need to achieve your retirement goals. We’ll also consider additional items during the planning phase, including:

What strategy will best preserve capital throughout your retirement
Potential risks and how to mitigate the effect of any economic crises
Your time horizon for reaching your goals
Your personal risk tolerance

At the end of this stage, you’ll receive a comprehensive financial plan that’s tailored to you. We’ll sit with you and review it in detail to make sure that you understand are comfortable with every aspect of it.
What Comes Next
Once your plan is created, we will continually monitor your investment performance and advise you of recommendations. Find out more about our monitoring strategy.
