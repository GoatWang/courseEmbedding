Forward-Looking Statements


This press release includes forward-looking statements. These 
      statements relate to, among other things, projections of operational 
      volumetrics and improvements, growth projects, cash flows and capital 
      expenditures. We have used the words "anticipate,” "believe," "could," 
      "estimate," "expect," "intend," "may," "plan," "predict," "project," 
      "should," "will," "potential," and similar terms and phrases to identify 
      forward-looking statements in this press release. Although we

      based are reasonable, any of these assumptions could prove to be 
      inaccurate and the forward-looking statements based on these assumptions 
      could be incorrect. Our operations involve risks and uncertainties, many 
      of which are outside our control, and any one of which, or a combination 
      of which, could materially affect our results of operations and whether 
      the forward-looking statements ultimately prove to be correct. Actual 
      results and trends in the future may differ materially from those 
      suggested or implied by the forward-looking statements depending on a 
      variety of factors which are described in greater detail in our filings 
      with the SEC. Please see our Risk Factor disclosures included in our 
      Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2013 filed
