        (408) 273-7000
    






I like much more Eddie Bauer but my boyfriend has also a membership card of this store, so he always get me things that I love! The excuse: hey, lets check out those 20% off deals! And surely, there is always a shirt with the metallic inside that keep your super warm anywhere...and that matches with the color of my sunglasses:) Impossible not to get a good deal back home. I think they should hire a better stylist to put the clothes in a more attractive way and not so much as 'outlet display'. At least I like to buy things that are displayed in an attractive manner. This store lacks the wow factor but still has everything I want every time I go and service has always been good.







No problem.  Needed to return an online item and it was done with a smile. I was on hold for 15 minutes trying to see if the Columbia outlet near where I live would take it, since I was returning Sorel shoes.  I hung up because 15 minutes is too long to wait for an answer. Here they were pleasant, took it and give me my money back. It's a large store with a big selection. I would definitely come here to shop if I didn't have the friends and family discount, which always makes it cheaper for me to shop online but I don't want to pay return shipping if it doesn't work out.







I have never been so upset with a company.  I live in the desert and I bought a coat to go to Buffalo in January.  I purchased the coat on January 7 and paid extra for 2 day shipping.  It is now 10 days later and the coat has not arrived.  I was told by Customer Care that there was a snow storm that delayed my coat.  I was not informed of the delay and missed my chance to buy another coat   I don't have enough balance on my card to purchase another coat and I'm cold.  AWFUL!!!!!!!







They close at 9 and we were there 8:53 to pay for a jacket we decided and they didn't let us in. Bad customer service and not follow the operation time. Lazy employee....







Employee Norman has great customer service. He honored and did a price adjustment since one of the jackets wasn't coming up 50% but there was a sign that said 50% off - didn't give me any hassle and was kind and friendly.







I had a horrible experience here when I tried to do an exchange last week .There was  one rude  guy in the counter doing all the return.He constantly kept complaining about customers trying to do return to the other guy in the counter infront of the other customers .We went for an exchange , the guy turned us away after half  hour wait ,even though we had all the receipts and tags .Keep off from this store and take your business elsewhere unless you like to be yelled at.

I like much more Eddie Bauer but my boyfriend has also a membership card of this store, so he always get me things that I love! The excuse: hey, lets check out those 20% off deals! And surely, there is always a shirt with the metallic inside that keep your super warm anywhere...and that matches with the color of my sunglasses:) Impossible not to get a good deal back home. I think they should hire a better stylist to put the clothes in a more attractive way and not so much as 'outlet display'. At least I like to buy things that are displayed in an attractive manner. This store lacks the wow factor but still has everything I want every time I go and service has always been good.

No problem.  Needed to return an online item and it was done with a smile. I was on hold for 15 minutes trying to see if the Columbia outlet near where I live would take it, since I was returning Sorel shoes.  I hung up because 15 minutes is too long to wait for an answer. Here they were pleasant, took it and give me my money back. It's a large store with a big selection. I would definitely come here to shop if I didn't have the friends and family discount, which always makes it cheaper for me to shop online but I don't want to pay return shipping if it doesn't work out.

I have never been so upset with a company.  I live in the desert and I bought a coat to go to Buffalo in January.  I purchased the coat on January 7 and paid extra for 2 day shipping.  It is now 10 days later and the coat has not arrived.  I was told by Customer Care that there was a snow storm that delayed my coat.  I was not informed of the delay and missed my chance to buy another coat   I don't have enough balance on my card to purchase another coat and I'm cold.  AWFUL!!!!!!!

They close at 9 and we were there 8:53 to pay for a jacket we decided and they didn't let us in. Bad customer service and not follow the operation time. Lazy employee....

Employee Norman has great customer service. He honored and did a price adjustment since one of the jackets wasn't coming up 50% but there was a sign that said 50% off - didn't give me any hassle and was kind and friendly.

I had a horrible experience here when I tried to do an exchange last week .There was  one rude  guy in the counter doing all the return.He constantly kept complaining about customers trying to do return to the other guy in the counter infront of the other customers .We went for an exchange , the guy turned us away after half  hour wait ,even though we had all the receipts and tags .Keep off from this store and take your business elsewhere unless you like to be yelled at.

2774 Livermore Outlets DrSte 3170Livermore, CA 94551


        (925) 273-6156
    






We are fans of Columbia Sportswear Company.  This branch at the San Francisco Premium Outlet mall in Livermore, CA is no exception.

It is one of the larger stores that we have patronized.  More inventory choices makes for greater selection.  Store was well organized and clean.  Staff was helpful and answered our questions.  We scored some terrific deals at their Clearance sections!

Recommend checking out this Columbia store for your sportswear needs.







Great inventory.  I love their Omni tech clothing line. 

Great savings if you shop when they've got a holiday savings like President's weekend, Thanksgiving weekend, etc.







Great deals! I got a fleece jacket for $20, originally priced at $60! They have a large selection for both men and women.







Leah the supervisor in charge today was INCREDIBLY RUDE to me. She displayed a total lack of customer service concerning my return. I understand your "policy," but you DO NOT address customers in the cold and unprofessional way that she did to me. I was simply asking for STORE CREDIT for an item purchased 20 days ago with which I have A RECEIPT AND THE CREDIT CARD USED FOR THE PURCHASE. She was incredibly cold and told me t go ahead and call her corporate office to complain.

DO NOT BUY ANYTHING IN THIS STORE or AT ANY COLUMBIA STORE, OR THAT MATTER. REI had the best return policy and sells Columbia items. They don't treat their customers like thieves and deviants EVER.







The workers here are very friendly and helpful. I was looking for a winter jacket but since Im always cold it would be an everyday jacket. I been eyeing this jacket for 2 months but decided to wait since it was still summer, but with the approach of winter coming a long and the announcement of 30 new stores I have decided to hit this outlet up again. 

I still don't agree with the name of this outlet as I don't think it would draw more people in let alone tourists. But I am glad I went on a whim with my friend and made a day out of it. They had a good sale at this time 25% off additionally. The jacket I wanted was priced at $169.99 with an additional 25% off it came down to $130 before taxes but at checkout it rang for $90!!!!   The cashier told me it was on sale because it was last year's style. SCORE!

The customer service here is superb. I asked for 2 different sizes and they were happy to assist me. Everyone I encountered was very friendly and accommodating and because of this I will always return!







This Columbia Sportswear Outlet is located inside the Livermore Premium Outlets and although yes they may have some sales and all my family and I never end up purchasing anything from this store.

They have nice clothing and all specifically for outdoors, but it's just that prices here are too freaking high!!!! This is a pretty expensive store, so the quality is good but it's just too expensive!!

It's worth taking a look I suppose though...







I have gotten my favorite jacket here and at an awesome price! I love the selection. Definitely better deals during the week.







A disappointment where an outdoor store carries so little men's choices. I was happy until walking in and seeing the less than a quarter of the store with men's clothing. So about 5 different pants, 8 different shirts, 5 different vest, and 20 different jackets. 

The rest is women's, children'sand accessories.







Im headed to truckee for my first snowboarding in 2 days..I'm doing last minute snow gear shopping..we actually drove from Daly City to Livermore with my friend to shop here..the store is nice, lots of discounted clothing, jackets, winter gear etc..from 25% to 40% off..everything seems to be well stocked..right now im actively yelping while inside this store ..five stars goes out to Jacqueline!! Whose excellent customer service, politeness, honesty and her desire to assist customers really made my first Columbia gear buying experience a pleasant one!! Thank you for helping me get my first snow pants..with this positive experience, I'll be a repeat Columbia costumer..oh yes their gear are also comfy and will keep you warm and dry..







The products are worth checking out!
Compared to North Face, this is a cheaper alternative that you can afford.

Pros:
-Great, big selection of items
-Good amount of staff on the floor
-Clean and well lit

Cons:
-Staff should be properly trained to where all general items are
("Where can I find the snow pants?" 'Sorry, I don't know') That doesn't help...

Tips:
-Last time I came in they hired a bunch of new college level workers, FOBs at the job. It was hard to find a worker who knew where selected items were
-Weekends have the best sales (Nothing during weekdays)
-College student discount with ID card







I"m not sure if it was a hit-or-miss thing...but i came here for the 1st time and was able to find a few items. They were good prices, much better prices I got from the North face.  I was able to find 2 jackets and a top and some shoes. I will return to get a couple of more items next time. I also went to the other outlet location but was unable to find anything so i believe this location has a much better stock.







When making a return with a receipt, if the cashier ask to see your ID, just show them,  Do Not hand your ID to them. The cashier will scan your ID without telling you beforehand. I am not sure what they will do with your info, and they will say it is protocol which is not a good explanation.







Amazing service Anthony and Levi are very knowledgeable and made me feel very comfortable with the purchases I made! 5 stars I'll be coming back soon







Pretty good selection of ski jackets when I went. I found a great deal on the jacket and ski pants I purchased. I also found a couple of other sweaters I liked for my weekend in the snow that were marked down. I signed up for their rewards program online the night before, and they were nice enough to honor the 10% discount (only valid in-store). 

The staff was friendly and helpful. I liked this store and plan to come back next time I need some more gear.







Meh, they didn't have anything that spectacular here & the prices were barely discounted.. You can find a better selection & better prices online.







If you catch a sale the prices are good.  The service is excellent; despite it being a crowded, crazy weekend the staff were cheerful and helpful.  The salesperson went into the back to pull the size I needed, which was not on the floor, and I got a lovely new gray fleece for 25 dollars.  I love my other Columbia fleece and wear it almost year round, so I'll use the new fleece a lot too.  The selection isn't outstanding but it's good enough.  I do recommend trying clothes on there if you are going to buy online, to get an idea of sizing.  I wear a size small in almost everything, but in Columbia clothes I am more comfortable in a medium, especially to have room to wear things under the jacket or fleece.







The best place to shop for outerwear in the East Bay.

Columbia Sportswear has super awesome technology meant to withstand all sorts of weather.

The people who work here are knowledgeable and friendly.

The prices are spectacular. I got a pair of SOREL boots for really cheap. Their clearance shoe table is always stocked.

In my opinion, Columbia is waaay better than Northface and the garments last that much longer.

With a new location out in the Tri-Valley, hikers, runners, and skiers alike will definitely find something for themselves.







Do you need sporty clothes?  How about outdoors clothes?  Then you should go to the Columbia outlet.  They had a good selection of new things and helpful people. 

The clothes were laid out like any store, nicely on racks.  The selection seemed very similar to what I would find at REI or otherwise, regular in season, normal clothes with a variety of sizes, at a significant discount.

I was asked if I needed help a few times.  They ended up starting a room in the fitting area for me and even brought other sizes when the clothes I had didn't fit. Of course I think the ratio of staff to guests was close to 1:1 when I went so they should pay attention!







Came here during a 4th of July weekend sale and this place was crazy! Tons of good deals, but it was hard to find your size since there were sooo many people around. The store was clean, but with lots of people = messy store. The line to the dressing room was ridiculously long, but people moved in an orderly fashion.

Overall,  I found great hiking pants and a sweater here all for less than $80. Great quality and good deals during an event. I would recommend shopping here  if you are at the outlets. Friendly staff and good lighting.







Check in tip: Last minute snow boarding gear shopping for spontaneous Tahoe trip!

I have been here a few times, they have good selection for winter and sports wear and other swag! 

I was able to get my snow pants for $79, that's 50% off from its original price!

We are fans of Columbia Sportswear Company.  This branch at the San Francisco Premium Outlet mall in Livermore, CA is no exception.It is one of the larger stores that we have patronized.  More inventory choices makes for greater selection.  Store was well organized and clean.  Staff was helpful and answered our questions.  We scored some terrific deals at their Clearance sections!Recommend checking out this Columbia store for your sportswear needs.

Great inventory.  I love their Omni tech clothing line. Great savings if you shop when they've got a holiday savings like President's weekend, Thanksgiving weekend, etc.

Leah the supervisor in charge today was INCREDIBLY RUDE to me. She displayed a total lack of customer service concerning my return. I understand your "policy," but you DO NOT address customers in the cold and unprofessional way that she did to me. I was simply asking for STORE CREDIT for an item purchased 20 days ago with which I have A RECEIPT AND THE CREDIT CARD USED FOR THE PURCHASE. She was incredibly cold and told me t go ahead and call her corporate office to complain.DO NOT BUY ANYTHING IN THIS STORE or AT ANY COLUMBIA STORE, OR THAT MATTER. REI had the best return policy and sells Columbia items. They don't treat their customers like thieves and deviants EVER.

The workers here are very friendly and helpful. I was looking for a winter jacket but since Im always cold it would be an everyday jacket. I been eyeing this jacket for 2 months but decided to wait since it was still summer, but with the approach of winter coming a long and the announcement of 30 new stores I have decided to hit this outlet up again. I still don't agree with the name of this outlet as I don't think it would draw more people in let alone tourists. But I am glad I went on a whim with my friend and made a day out of it. They had a good sale at this time 25% off additionally. The jacket I wanted was priced at $169.99 with an additional 25% off it came down to $130 before taxes but at checkout it rang for $90!!!!   The cashier told me it was on sale because it was last year's style. SCORE!The customer service here is superb. I asked for 2 different sizes and they were happy to assist me. Everyone I encountered was very friendly and accommodating and because of this I will always return!

This Columbia Sportswear Outlet is located inside the Livermore Premium Outlets and although yes they may have some sales and all my family and I never end up purchasing anything from this store.They have nice clothing and all specifically for outdoors, but it's just that prices here are too freaking high!!!! This is a pretty expensive store, so the quality is good but it's just too expensive!!It's worth taking a look I suppose though...

A disappointment where an outdoor store carries so little men's choices. I was happy until walking in and seeing the less than a quarter of the store with men's clothing. So about 5 different pants, 8 different shirts, 5 different vest, and 20 different jackets. The rest is women's, children'sand accessories.

Im headed to truckee for my first snowboarding in 2 days..I'm doing last minute snow gear shopping..we actually drove from Daly City to Livermore with my friend to shop here..the store is nice, lots of discounted clothing, jackets, winter gear etc..from 25% to 40% off..everything seems to be well stocked..right now im actively yelping while inside this store ..five stars goes out to Jacqueline!! Whose excellent customer service, politeness, honesty and her desire to assist customers really made my first Columbia gear buying experience a pleasant one!! Thank you for helping me get my first snow pants..with this positive experience, I'll be a repeat Columbia costumer..oh yes their gear are also comfy and will keep you warm and dry..

The products are worth checking out!Compared to North Face, this is a cheaper alternative that you can afford.Pros:-Great, big selection of items-Good amount of staff on the floor-Clean and well litCons:-Staff should be properly trained to where all general items are("Where can I find the snow pants?" 'Sorry, I don't know') That doesn't help...Tips:-Last time I came in they hired a bunch of new college level workers, FOBs at the job. It was hard to find a worker who knew where selected items were-Weekends have the best sales (Nothing during weekdays)-College student discount with ID card

I"m not sure if it was a hit-or-miss thing...but i came here for the 1st time and was able to find a few items. They were good prices, much better prices I got from the North face.  I was able to find 2 jackets and a top and some shoes. I will return to get a couple of more items next time. I also went to the other outlet location but was unable to find anything so i believe this location has a much better stock.

When making a return with a receipt, if the cashier ask to see your ID, just show them,  Do Not hand your ID to them. The cashier will scan your ID without telling you beforehand. I am not sure what they will do with your info, and they will say it is protocol which is not a good explanation.

Pretty good selection of ski jackets when I went. I found a great deal on the jacket and ski pants I purchased. I also found a couple of other sweaters I liked for my weekend in the snow that were marked down. I signed up for their rewards program online the night before, and they were nice enough to honor the 10% discount (only valid in-store). The staff was friendly and helpful. I liked this store and plan to come back next time I need some more gear.

If you catch a sale the prices are good.  The service is excellent; despite it being a crowded, crazy weekend the staff were cheerful and helpful.  The salesperson went into the back to pull the size I needed, which was not on the floor, and I got a lovely new gray fleece for 25 dollars.  I love my other Columbia fleece and wear it almost year round, so I'll use the new fleece a lot too.  The selection isn't outstanding but it's good enough.  I do recommend trying clothes on there if you are going to buy online, to get an idea of sizing.  I wear a size small in almost everything, but in Columbia clothes I am more comfortable in a medium, especially to have room to wear things under the jacket or fleece.

The best place to shop for outerwear in the East Bay.Columbia Sportswear has super awesome technology meant to withstand all sorts of weather.The people who work here are knowledgeable and friendly.The prices are spectacular. I got a pair of SOREL boots for really cheap. Their clearance shoe table is always stocked.In my opinion, Columbia is waaay better than Northface and the garments last that much longer.With a new location out in the Tri-Valley, hikers, runners, and skiers alike will definitely find something for themselves.

            Listed in Yelp 100 Challenge, Go out and shopify!


Do you need sporty clothes?  How about outdoors clothes?  Then you should go to the Columbia outlet.  They had a good selection of new things and helpful people. The clothes were laid out like any store, nicely on racks.  The selection seemed very similar to what I would find at REI or otherwise, regular in season, normal clothes with a variety of sizes, at a significant discount.I was asked if I needed help a few times.  They ended up starting a room in the fitting area for me and even brought other sizes when the clothes I had didn't fit. Of course I think the ratio of staff to guests was close to 1:1 when I went so they should pay attention!

Came here during a 4th of July weekend sale and this place was crazy! Tons of good deals, but it was hard to find your size since there were sooo many people around. The store was clean, but with lots of people = messy store. The line to the dressing room was ridiculously long, but people moved in an orderly fashion.Overall,  I found great hiking pants and a sweater here all for less than $80. Great quality and good deals during an event. I would recommend shopping here  if you are at the outlets. Friendly staff and good lighting.

About Columbia Sportswear Company

   Gertrude Boyle is called chairman and, occasionally, one tough mother. The nonagenarian and face of Columbia Sportswear's "tough mother" and "tested tough" ads heads one of the global powerhouses in the development, marketing, and distribution of active outerwear. Columbia's trademark Bugaboo parka with weatherproof shell put the company on the map in upscale outdoor wear. Columbia offers performance apparel for a variety of activities, as well as sportswear accessories, boots, and rugged footwear, sold under the Columbia, Mountain Hardwear, Sorel, prAna, and Montrail brands. Founded as a hat company in 1938, Columbia Sportswear is controlled by the Boyle family and run by president and CEO Tim Boyle, son of Gert.
   Operations

   Columbia Sportswear's operations are divided between two product categories: The largest category, apparel, accessories, and equipment, generated 78% of the company's total sales during 2015. Footwear, including Sorel brand boots, accounted for the rest.
  

   In the US, the sportswear maker operated 109 outlet stores, 24 branded retail stores, two employee stores, and five brand-specific e-commerce sites. The company had 241 concession-based, branded, outlet, and shop-in-shop locations in Japan and 169 additional such stores in Korea. It had a handful of retail stores in Canada, and 10 outlet retail stores in the EMEA region.
  
Geographic Reach

   Columbia Sportswear's products are sold in North America and 100 more countries worldwide. The company generated 63% of its sales in the US during 2015, while another 7% came from Canada. Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region (LAAP) -- which includes stores in Japan and Korea -- is the company's second-largest market behind North America, accounting for 20% of sales. Other markets include Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.
  
Sales and Marketing

   Columbia's products are primarily sold through 8,000-plus wholesale distributors to specialty outdoor and sporting goods stores and major retail chains. The company also sells directly to consumers through domestic and international banner retail outlets and stores (Columbia-operated and dealer-operated) as well as online. In countries where it does not trade, the Columbia sells to about two dozen independent distributors. Almost all of Columbia's items are made in Asia by independent manufacturers.
  

   The company uses a variety of media to market its products, including online advertising and social media sites, TV, and print.  It also sponsors events and operates branded and outlet retail stores in high-profile locations.
  

   Columbia has been boosting its advertising spend in recent years. It spent $120.8 million on advertising in 2015, up from $110.1 million and $78.1 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
  
Financial Performance

   Columbia Sportswear's sales and profits have been trending higher in recent years thanks to the success of its direct-to-consumer channel, which sells through company-operated retail stores and e-commerce sites.
  

   The sportswear maker's revenue jumped 11% to $2.33 billion during 2015 mostly thanks to a 21% jump in its US sales led by the wholesale business as retail customers ordered more fall season product (especially the Columbia, Sorel, and prAna brands) in advance. US direct-to-consumer sales were also up thanks to 16 net new retail store openings and stronger e-commerce sales. Sales in Canada were up 11% on better wholesale and direct-to-consumer sales, but were down by 5% and 10% in the LAAP and EMEA regions, respectively, entirely due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates (sales were essentially unchanged in the two regions after excluding FX).
  

   Double-digit revenue growth in 2015 drove Columbia Sportswear's net income up 27% to $174.3 million. The company's operating cash levels fell by nearly half to $95.1 million for the year mostly as the company built up its inventories, but also because of unfavorable working capital changes related to its accounts receivables and income taxes payables.
  
Strategy

   Columbia Sportswear has strategically expanded its geographic presence and product offerings through acquisitions, alliances, and licensing deals. The company typically acquires or partners with brands that move it into new and complementary consumer categories, especially ones that reduce its dependence on cold-weather products. In December 2015, for example, Columbia expanded into new clothing territory after forming an exclusive licensing agreement with Delta Galil Industries, which would begin developing, producing, and distributing performance-based underwear under the Columbia Sportswear brand.
  

   To expand the Columbia and Mountain Hardwear brands in China, Columbia in 2014 launched its 60-40 joint venture with Swire Resources, a subsidiary of trading conglomerate Swire Pacific. Swire operates some 70 Columbia banner retail stores and has exclusively sold both brands through a network of wholesale dealers since 2004. Swire has also distributed the brands in Hong Kong and Macau since 2002.
  
Mergers and Acquisitions

   In May 2014, Columbia Sportswear diversified its brand portfolio after buying prAna Living LLC and its prAna Lifestyle Apparel brand from owner Steelpoint Capital Partners for $188.5 million cash. The deal included seven company-owned retail stores, an e-commerce site, and direct-mail catalogue.

Columbia Sportswear retail store in Hong Kong


Columbia Sportswear Company is an American company that manufactures and distributes outerwear and sportswear. It was founded in 1938 by Paul Lamfrom, father of present chairperson Gert Boyle. The company is headquartered in Cedar Mill, Oregon, an unincorporated part of Washington County, Oregon, in the Portland metropolitan area near Beaverton. Columbia Sportswear also produces footwear, headgear, camping equipment, skiwear, and outerwear accessories. In 2001, it was the largest American seller of ski apparel.[4]

History[edit]
Columbia Sportswear began as a small, family-owned hat distributor. Present chairwoman Gert Boyle's parents, Paul and Marie Lamfrom, fled Nazi Germany in 1937 and immediately purchased a Portland hat distributorship. They became the Columbia Hat Company, named for the nearby Columbia River. In 1948, Gert married Neal Boyle, who became the head of the company. Frustrations over suppliers influenced the family to start manufacturing their own products. Columbia Hat Company became Columbia Sportswear Company in 1960.[5]
In 1970, Neal Boyle died following a heart attack. Gert and son Tim Boyle, then a University of Oregon senior, took over the operations of Columbia, rescuing it from bankruptcy.
Columbia's jackets featured waterproof fabric that was also breathable. Additionally, new jackets featured interchangeable shells and liners. Multiple wearing options and fabric technology fueled rapid sales growth.
Columbia became a publicly traded company in 1998.[2][6] It acquired footwear maker Sorel Corporation in 2000 and Mountain Hardwear in 2003. In 2006, Columbia acquired the Pacific Trail[7] and Montrail brands.[2][8]




Columbia Sportswear's company headquarters in Washington County, Oregon


In 2001, the company moved its headquarters from Portland to a site in an unincorporated part of Washington County,[9] in the Cedar Mill area and just outside the Beaverton city limits. The site on NW Science Park Drive has a Portland mailing address, but is not in Portland. In 2007, City of Portland officials attempted to convince Columbia Sportswear to move back to Portland,[10] but the company ultimately rejected the idea and said it would expand its existing headquarters instead.[9]
On June 15, 2008, Columbia Sportswear announced a three-year sponsorship of the cycling team formerly known as Team High Road and before that T-Mobile and Team Telekom. The sponsorship began on July 5, 2008 with the start of the Tour de France. The team's name was "Team Columbia". The sponsorship included both the men's and women's teams.[11]
On August 4, 2010, Columbia Sportswear Company signed an agreement to acquire OutDry Technologies S.r.l., which owns the intellectual property and other assets comprising the OutDry brand and related business, via a cash purchase from Nextec S.r.l., based near Milan, Italy. The transaction is expected to close during the third quarter of 2010, subject to customary closing conditions, and is not expected to have a material effect on the company's 2010 operating results.[12]
In March 2015, Bryan Timm was named company president, taking over that position from Tim Boyle, who remains CEO.[2]
Logo[edit]
The company logo has been noticed to resemble a swastika, but the fact that the company was founded by German Jews who fled Nazi Germany can be considered proof enough that the logo is not inspired by the Nazi symbol.[13]
Locations[edit]




Columbia's flagship store in downtown Portland, Oregon


Columbia Sportswear distributes its products in more than 72 countries and 13,000 retailers. Columbia also operates its own chain of retail stores, including its flagship store located in downtown Portland, Oregon.
Financial information[edit]
As of February 12, 2015, the company's market capitalization is about $4.13 billion,[citation needed] with 2014 net sales of $2.1 billion.[2]
Stock exchanges[edit]
Columbia Sportswear Company is publicly traded on NASDAQ with ticker symbol COLM.

Columbia Sportswear Company is an American company that manufactures and distributes outerwear and sportswear. It was founded in 1938 by Paul Lamfrom, father of present chairperson Gert Boyle. The company is headquartered in Cedar Mill, Oregon, an unincorporated part of Washington County, Oregon, in the Portland metropolitan area near Beaverton. Columbia Sportswear also produces footwear, headgear, camping equipment, skiwear, and outerwear accessories. In 2001, it was the largest American seller of ski apparel.[4]

History[edit]
Columbia Sportswear began as a small, family-owned hat distributor. Present chairwoman Gert Boyle's parents, Paul and Marie Lamfrom, fled Nazi Germany in 1937 and immediately purchased a Portland hat distributorship. They became the Columbia Hat Company, named for the nearby Columbia River. In 1948, Gert married Neal Boyle, who became the head of the company. Frustrations over suppliers influenced the family to start manufacturing their own products. Columbia Hat Company became Columbia Sportswear Company in 1960.[5]
In 1970, Neal Boyle died following a heart attack. Gert and son Tim Boyle, then a University of Oregon senior, took over the operations of Columbia, rescuing it from bankruptcy.
Columbia's jackets featured waterproof fabric that was also breathable. Additionally, new jackets featured interchangeable shells and liners. Multiple wearing options and fabric technology fueled rapid sales growth.
Columbia became a publicly traded company in 1998.[2][6] It acquired footwear maker Sorel Corporation in 2000 and Mountain Hardwear in 2003. In 2006, Columbia acquired the Pacific Trail[7] and Montrail brands.[2][8]




Columbia Sportswear's company headquarters in Washington County, Oregon


In 2001, the company moved its headquarters from Portland to a site in an unincorporated part of Washington County,[9] in the Cedar Mill area and just outside the Beaverton city limits. The site on NW Science Park Drive has a Portland mailing address, but is not in Portland. In 2007, City of Portland officials attempted to convince Columbia Sportswear to move back to Portland,[10] but the company ultimately rejected the idea and said it would expand its existing headquarters instead.[9]
On June 15, 2008, Columbia Sportswear announced a three-year sponsorship of the cycling team formerly known as Team High Road and before that T-Mobile and Team Telekom. The sponsorship began on July 5, 2008 with the start of the Tour de France. The team's name was "Team Columbia". The sponsorship included both the men's and women's teams.[11]
On August 4, 2010, Columbia Sportswear Company signed an agreement to acquire OutDry Technologies S.r.l., which owns the intellectual property and other assets comprising the OutDry brand and related business, via a cash purchase from Nextec S.r.l., based near Milan, Italy. The transaction is expected to close during the third quarter of 2010, subject to customary closing conditions, and is not expected to have a material effect on the company's 2010 operating results.[12]
In March 2015, Bryan Timm was named company president, taking over that position from Tim Boyle, who remains CEO.[2]
Logo[edit]
The company logo has been noticed to resemble a swastika, but the fact that the company was founded by German Jews who fled Nazi Germany can be considered proof enough that the logo is not inspired by the Nazi symbol.[13]
Locations[edit]




Columbia's flagship store in downtown Portland, Oregon


Columbia Sportswear distributes its products in more than 72 countries and 13,000 retailers. Columbia also operates its own chain of retail stores, including its flagship store located in downtown Portland, Oregon.
Financial information[edit]
As of February 12, 2015, the company's market capitalization is about $4.13 billion,[citation needed] with 2014 net sales of $2.1 billion.[2]
Stock exchanges[edit]
Columbia Sportswear Company is publicly traded on NASDAQ with ticker symbol COLM.

Columbia History





“IT'S PERFECT, NOW MAKE IT BETTER.”

This is the directive given by our very own tough mother, Chairman Gert Boyle. It’s the reason we’re constantly testing our products against every type of terrible, no good, day-ruining condition the skies of the mighty Pacific Northwest can dish out. Sure, it makes life hell for us, but it means great gear for you. So when she finally does use her famous stamp of approval, you know you’re duly equipped to stay outside long after the featherweights have retreated indoors.




 





A TESTED TOUGH HISTORY
Born and raised in Portland, Oregon, Columbia Sportswear Company has been making gear so that Pacific Northwesterners can enjoy the outdoors for more than 70 years. At the helm for over 40 years has been our Chairman, Gert Boyle. Her Tough Mother persona has grown Columbia into the global sportswear company that it is today—still based in Portland, still making no-nonsense apparel and footwear to keep you WARM, DRY, COOL and PROTECTED no matter what. Our unique Pacific Northwest heritage and Boyle family irreverence is what sets us apart from the competition.





We're a family business gone global. Chairman Gert Boyle's parents — German nationals who fled Nazi Germany in 1938 — purchased a small hat company upon their arrival in Portland and named it Columbia Hat Company, after the river that inspired their new home. This humble beginning was of huge significance to the family, marking new found freedom and a fresh start. Her husband later took over, and after he died Gert ran the show, going from housewife to executive overnight. Today, her son Tim Boyle is our longtime president and CEO. The family — like our business — has experienced its ups and downs, but enjoying the outdoors together has always been integral to its success.
Columbia is made up of real people who are as passionate about the outdoors as you are. And, while our products are available around the world, we're based in the great Pacific Northwest, where majestic forests frame volcanic mountains and a rugged coast.

Columbia History





“IT'S PERFECT, NOW MAKE IT BETTER.”

This is the directive given by our very own tough mother, Chairman Gert Boyle. It’s the reason we’re constantly testing our products against every type of terrible, no good, day-ruining condition the skies of the mighty Pacific Northwest can dish out. Sure, it makes life hell for us, but it means great gear for you. So when she finally does use her famous stamp of approval, you know you’re duly equipped to stay outside long after the featherweights have retreated indoors.




 





A TESTED TOUGH HISTORY
Born and raised in Portland, Oregon, Columbia Sportswear Company has been making gear so that Pacific Northwesterners can enjoy the outdoors for more than 70 years. At the helm for over 40 years has been our Chairman, Gert Boyle. Her Tough Mother persona has grown Columbia into the global sportswear company that it is today—still based in Portland, still making no-nonsense apparel and footwear to keep you WARM, DRY, COOL and PROTECTED no matter what. Our unique Pacific Northwest heritage and Boyle family irreverence is what sets us apart from the competition.





We're a family business gone global. Chairman Gert Boyle's parents — German nationals who fled Nazi Germany in 1938 — purchased a small hat company upon their arrival in Portland and named it Columbia Hat Company, after the river that inspired their new home. This humble beginning was of huge significance to the family, marking new found freedom and a fresh start. Her husband later took over, and after he died Gert ran the show, going from housewife to executive overnight. Today, her son Tim Boyle is our longtime president and CEO. The family — like our business — has experienced its ups and downs, but enjoying the outdoors together has always been integral to its success.
Columbia is made up of real people who are as passionate about the outdoors as you are. And, while our products are available around the world, we're based in the great Pacific Northwest, where majestic forests frame volcanic mountains and a rugged coast. This is where we hike, ride, fish, hunt, climb, camp, golf, paddle, run, and just enjoy fresh air with friends. Come join us.

I've tried using their unsubscribe form many times, but it does not work (probably because it thinks email addresses can't have a plus sign in them). Then, I opened 5 support tickets over the course of 2 months. Each time they told me they unsubscribed me, yet I still receive email from them.

I regret giving them my email, but I do not regret buying a jacket from them. It's one of my daily drivers.







My review is regarding Customer Service after placing an online order. 
I question the speed of delivery order and after two full weeks still no package.  I tied to trace it but it may no sense... Coming to California (on the west coast) package was in Chicago for several days.  When I question the 'Customer Care' rep I was told delivery is between 8-13 days.  I told her that was not what my email shipping notice informed me of.  I was basically told I had to wait! 
Still waiting package was now in Iowa again I'm on west coast as the company is too. 
After several rude email from 'Customer Care' rep I was still left with no answers or package.  So I went to the mall and purchase another Mother's Day gift. Finally after two PLUS weeks package arrived I know one reason it took so long the box was re-re-recycled and previous labels were not removed. Now at checkout I did NOT check box to recycle box.   Ask to speak with Supervisor still waiting all I received was another rude email for 'Customer Care' more like Customer careLESS rep.  
I really love Columbia clothing but I will look for another company.







Their products is a piece of junk, very poor quality, I bought a few thousand dollars worth of stuff for my whole families, we wore it for the first time and 3 of the coats stitches by the armpit came apart. Will never buy this piece sh*t again, waste my time returning it...Columbia need to Fired the CEO.







I have a pair of Columbia boots that are a few years old. They are a winter boot that I wear only in the snowiest of conditions. I will never by a pair of Columbia boots again, in fact I'll never by a Columbia product again. The seams tore out of these boots rendering them useless in the winter. I wrote Columbia, but got no response. These are boots supposedly made for the toughest conditions, like Columbias moto, "tested tough", yeah right, Do Not Buy Columbia Boots, and if you expect customer service don't by Columbia products at all. It's sad because I use to be a fan of Columbia products. When I go to buy winter boots in the future I'll get Sorels.







Lifetime warranty unless it's classified as a sportswear item, then it only has a one year warranty. So if the zipper stop falls off and so does the zipper make sure it happens within 364 days. Stuff happens, but then the company should step up and fix. Oh, I could mail back and they would evaluate and let me know, but probably not. 
On a small positive note, I did receive a quick and professional response to my email. But that didn't help fix my wife's jacket. Not satisfied.







Never again, I bought a light Columbia coat and the zipper jammed with my car keys inside. I had to cut the coat open to get my keys. I always give companies a second chance, I bought another jacket and the exact situation happened., keys in the pocket. I own a lot of coats, cheap and nice and these are the only brand that has failed me. I tried to return it and they told me to send it in postage on me and they will probably give you a new one. Never mind keep your bad product.







purchased a $60 backpack and after 4 weeks of use, my fourth grade son has a giant rip at the seam.   They want me to return it for a repair and to pay shipping!  They will pay the shipping if they determine it is warranted.  Obviously I can't wait the 4-6 weeks for my son to have a backpack.  I had to go and buy a Jansport.   Now I am suppose to pay $10 to ship it back to them and have them return a backpack I don't need or want.
They wouldn't even offer to pay for shipping!
Horrible customer service for defective and poor quality bag.







In general I've been a big fan of Columbia gear and especially their PFG line.  Out of 30 PFG shirts I own or have owned I had one of my TAMIAMI II PFG shirts have a neck tag go bad after a hot day fishing in the Louisiana Summer.  The tag got sticky and rubbed off on my neck.  I washed the shirt on cold/cold cycle like I always do and on removing it from the wash I noticed that the tag had transferred a rubbery residue to the collar of the shirt that wouldn't come off.  I emailed Columbia asking if they had a recommended treatment to remove this tag residue and was informed I should just mail it to the warranty dept. so I did.  The warranty dept. mailed it back with no notice and the package was left with just a sheet of paper indicating the warranty wouldn't cover my shirt?  All I want is a way to remove the tag residue and they must know a way!!!  This is so frustrating to have a perfectly good shirt ruined due to their goofy tag residue that should be easily removed by a known solvent to them that they won't share the information...







I was excited to make my first purchase on this website and I was very pleased to see my jacket was on sale. So I bought it on Saturday, eager to have it this week so I paid extra for "2 day shipping". On Tuesday the status check on the website simply said "processing". No eta of a delivery date or even shipping date.  I emailed customer service and didn't hear back. So Tuesday evening I called to inquire. They said its 2 OR 3 business days, after a 1 day processing. Ok fine. I would get it Wed or Thur. Wednesday came, Thursday came and still nothing. I did finally receive a UPS tracking number from them and when I tracked it I was given a delivery date of Thursday. But now its Friday and still nothing. I contacted UPS and they said they still haven't received the item to ship..? And I needed to contact the seller. So now I am sitting on the phone on hold. My initial wait time was estimated to be 25 minutes. Every few minutes a recording comes on to update my hold time, but my hold time is going up instead of down. Now its at 34 minutes..? I still never did receive an email response from their customer service. I'm a little stunned I thought Columbia was a decent brand, and the gear seems to be, but the online ordering and customer service is enough to make me go elsewhere, which I will be after receiving this jacket (whenever that will be).







I would put a big old Goose Egg (0) If I could!!!!  I want to be clear that I am reviewing the company customer service here, NOT the products.  The products have always been great, that's why what happened to me disheartens me even more.  :(

If you order from online, you should be aware that if your package is lost (or in my case stolen) while in transit with UPS or FED Ex, Columbia "customer service" becomes your worst nightmare.  They should call it Columbia service instead of customer service, because they don't treat you like a valued customer when this happens to you.  

I placed an order with a coat and mittens that they had on a great sale!  I tracked the package until it reached IL, and that is where it stopped, and my headache began!  I called Columbia (C) and told them that my package has not arrived by the ETA, and I was told that I need to wait at least 7 days past the ETA to see if it shows up.  Mind you, they have my $150.  They were willing and happy to take that, but I had no product!!  So, I patiently waited the 7 days, tracked the package again to the same distribution center in IL.  I called C back, and I was told that they would open up an investigation request.  They informed me that this could take 10-14 business days to complete.  So I asked, if I could have a refund or could they ship me a new package?  I was told that this is not their policy (by several other people as well in the company).  I was beside myself.  How could a company this huge treat me (a great frequent customer) as though it was my fault the package was lost.  they could have put a tracer on the package, and had (if found) it sent back to Columbia.  In the meantime, I should have gotten a new package and been thrilled w my purchase!  but NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.  It didn't end there.  I wrote email after email call after call, and I kept getting told that the investigation with UPS was not complete (I have a friend with UPS access who said the invest was already closed and she sent me the notes).  The notes said that they found the mittens (outside of the box), and the jacket was never found.  The jacket was marked stolen, and the mittens were shipped back to C.  You know what I was told at this point???!!!!  I had to wait for the mittens to arrive back to C!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I cant even tell you how livid I was!  Why do I have to wait for them to get the mittens back whne the invest. was closed and completed.  

I finally got my money back a month after I ordered.  Thanks Columbia!  You lost a great customer.  Thanks but no thanks for the offer of 20% off an order.  You are all heart!!!!







Horrible customer service. Order a jacket for son based on sizing cart (indicates runs bigger). Turned out it's smaller then sizing indicates so I called same day when receiving package. Asked for a exchange from small to medium and they still have other size on same color. Asked me to ship jacket back, So mailed next day. When returned and I checked tracking that return were back at Columbia about 2 working days later, Called customer service and and they told me the same color don't have size left besides large.







Beware--Columbia Customer Service may NOT repair or replace your item, but choose to give you a few dollars e-credit.  I asked for my item back but they recycle or donate them.
I did not know that was an option. I should have kept my item and  gotten it fixed  myself.  Now I have lost my great rain garment that looked simple to fix.  Seams splitting all over a garment that is worn a few times seems like a manufacturing error.







I returned a pair of hiking boots after 3 months of light use. The left boot sole came unglued and fell apart. I had to pay $20.00 to ship them back on top of the original purchase price. 3 weeks later, I got the boots back. Columbia re-glued them in a half assed way; you could see the gaps in the sole and toe piece- it was a joke! The letter that came back with the boots from "quality control" stated that the boots were out of the 1 year warranty period. I had included a copy of the receipt dated far less than 1 year. The boots were clearly defective, and still are. I threw them away. Because of the idiotic treatment I received, I would choose ANY name brand before a Columbia product. They could have done the right thing and gained a customer, but they chose to screw me. Nice work Columbia!







This company sucks.  Apparently in 2012 i placed an order for 388.50.  I returned some items as they were Christmas gifts and due to Columbia's inconsistent sizing, I had to send things back. Apparently now I am unable to place an order and so is everyone in my household including our apartment. There are three households st this residence and a  total of 8 different credit cards and they will not accept an order from any of them.  Even tried using a gift card and it will not go through. This is ridiculous.







I am flabbergasted by some of the bad reviews posted here.  Columbia sportswear has consistently been a winner for me.  I love that they offer good quality, REAL sportswear in plus sizes for women.  Their clothing is good quality, well fitting and BEAUTIFUL!  

I don't live in an area with a Columbia store, so I order online.  Even so, I have never purchased a product from this website that I needed to return.  And every single time I wear a Columbia garment, I get scads of comments and compliments from folks who want to know where I buy my clothes.  The last time i purchased a shirt from Columbia, my husband told me that I looked beautiful and said I should get one in each color they offered!  

As a plus sized woman, I have often felt victimized by companies who cater to people with hard-to-fit bodies;  charging premium prices for poor quality goods, simply because our choices are scarce.  I cannot express how much I appreciate a mainline business who makes quality garments in all sizes and treats their larger sized customers exactly the same as their smaller counterparts.  When I wear Columbia, I feel comfortable, beautiful and dressed appropriately for the Rocky Mountain region where I live.  

I heartily recommend Columbia!







Like several other notable, formerly proud, and once market leading companies (see Ray-Ban, Hoover Vacuum, et al.)Sorel has been purchased for it's brand cache and is systematically being transformed into a made in China (or Viet Nam) fashion focused, inferior product oriented, over priced corporate cash cow.  The heritage of quality and performance has been traded for return on investment.

My expensive Sorels lasted exactly one hour in the sub-zero January temperatures that we have suffered recently in the midwest, before they completely disintegrated.  I returned them to the factory, based on the instructions provided by the customer service person at Sorel, and the warranty evaluator rejected my claim.  Technically, they were out of the warranty period, but when you drop a buck fifty on a pair of winter boots, you expect them to out perform your daughter's Hello Kitty boots.  That wasn't the case.  
If you want an exceptional pair of extreme weather boots, grab a pair of US Army surplus "Mickey Mouse" boots manufactured by BATA.  They are  absolutey the warmest, most durable boots you'll ever own, and they're available all over the internet for bout $60.  Skip the junk that Columbia is cranking out in China and calling Sorel.







I used to like Columbia clothing as it was generally constructed of quality material. The last two purchases have completely changed my mind. I just spent $70 on a sweater that began to pill after just two washes. The last sweater I bought turned into a giant ball of pilly fuzz within a week. I'll not spend another nickel on anything made by this brand.







I disagree with the orange head review, Columbia is the bee's knees.

I bought a Bugaboo parka in 2008 from some rando sporting goods site and we had several good years together. Sadly, the zipper died and I needed to send it in for repair just in time for a cold snap and of course I have a trip to Iceland coming up as well. Womp womp.

So. Off to Oregon it went. Once I saw they received it I gave them a call to check on it and explain that I kinda needed it back and was answered by a lovely woman who listened to my plight and set about helping find a solution for me. She told me I was getting a replacement and we went through the options I had available to me, in less than half an hour a new coat was ordered and Columbia had made a huge fan out of me. 

A spankin new coat arrived at my office today and I love it. Columbia stands behind its products with great customer service, what more can you ask for?







They offer free shipping, but you have to pay for returns. There is not a choice to evenly exchange an item for a different size. You return the item for a refund and place a new order. The jacket I bought is now 1.5 times as much.







Bought a pair of mens Birke Trail light weight hikers on 2/17/15. Wore them maybe 20 times and the toe box failed and wore/tore through due to substandard suede. I sent them in to Columbia and they proceeded to loose them for two weeks after they received them. After numerous phone calls they finally found them and I was told in late April that they would get back to me ASAP once they were evaluated. Here is it 6/5/15 and I had heard nothing so I called and was put on hold for 10 minutes while the rep looked up the info. He them informed me that they could replace them and they were waiting for me to contact them. NOT what they told me back in late April. Either way they don't have the shoes I had purchased so they will replace them with a similar shoe and it will be another 2 weeks before I get them. Columbia used to be a great company, not any more. I will buy from anyone but them in the future. Most likely Lands End, North Face, etc.

I've tried using their unsubscribe form many times, but it does not work (probably because it thinks email addresses can't have a plus sign in them). Then, I opened 5 support tickets over the course of 2 months. Each time they told me they unsubscribed me, yet I still receive email from them.I regret giving them my email, but I do not regret buying a jacket from them. It's one of my daily drivers.

My review is regarding Customer Service after placing an online order. I question the speed of delivery order and after two full weeks still no package.  I tied to trace it but it may no sense... Coming to California (on the west coast) package was in Chicago for several days.  When I question the 'Customer Care' rep I was told delivery is between 8-13 days.  I told her that was not what my email shipping notice informed me of.  I was basically told I had to wait! Still waiting package was now in Iowa again I'm on west coast as the company is too. After several rude email from 'Customer Care' rep I was still left with no answers or package.  So I went to the mall and purchase another Mother's Day gift. Finally after two PLUS weeks package arrived I know one reason it took so long the box was re-re-recycled and previous labels were not removed. Now at checkout I did NOT check box to recycle box.   Ask to speak with Supervisor still waiting all I received was another rude email for 'Customer Care' more like Customer careLESS rep.  I really love Columbia clothing but I will look for another company.

I have a pair of Columbia boots that are a few years old. They are a winter boot that I wear only in the snowiest of conditions. I will never by a pair of Columbia boots again, in fact I'll never by a Columbia product again. The seams tore out of these boots rendering them useless in the winter. I wrote Columbia, but got no response. These are boots supposedly made for the toughest conditions, like Columbias moto, "tested tough", yeah right, Do Not Buy Columbia Boots, and if you expect customer service don't by Columbia products at all. It's sad because I use to be a fan of Columbia products. When I go to buy winter boots in the future I'll get Sorels.

Lifetime warranty unless it's classified as a sportswear item, then it only has a one year warranty. So if the zipper stop falls off and so does the zipper make sure it happens within 364 days. Stuff happens, but then the company should step up and fix. Oh, I could mail back and they would evaluate and let me know, but probably not. On a small positive note, I did receive a quick and professional response to my email. But that didn't help fix my wife's jacket. Not satisfied.

Never again, I bought a light Columbia coat and the zipper jammed with my car keys inside. I had to cut the coat open to get my keys. I always give companies a second chance, I bought another jacket and the exact situation happened., keys in the pocket. I own a lot of coats, cheap and nice and these are the only brand that has failed me. I tried to return it and they told me to send it in postage on me and they will probably give you a new one. Never mind keep your bad product.

purchased a $60 backpack and after 4 weeks of use, my fourth grade son has a giant rip at the seam.   They want me to return it for a repair and to pay shipping!  They will pay the shipping if they determine it is warranted.  Obviously I can't wait the 4-6 weeks for my son to have a backpack.  I had to go and buy a Jansport.   Now I am suppose to pay $10 to ship it back to them and have them return a backpack I don't need or want.They wouldn't even offer to pay for shipping!Horrible customer service for defective and poor quality bag.

In general I've been a big fan of Columbia gear and especially their PFG line.  Out of 30 PFG shirts I own or have owned I had one of my TAMIAMI II PFG shirts have a neck tag go bad after a hot day fishing in the Louisiana Summer.  The tag got sticky and rubbed off on my neck.  I washed the shirt on cold/cold cycle like I always do and on removing it from the wash I noticed that the tag had transferred a rubbery residue to the collar of the shirt that wouldn't come off.  I emailed Columbia asking if they had a recommended treatment to remove this tag residue and was informed I should just mail it to the warranty dept. so I did.  The warranty dept. mailed it back with no notice and the package was left with just a sheet of paper indicating the warranty wouldn't cover my shirt?  All I want is a way to remove the tag residue and they must know a way!!!  This is so frustrating to have a perfectly good shirt ruined due to their goofy tag residue that should be easily removed by a known solvent to them that they won't share the information...








Of MANY PFG shirts this one tag went bad/got sticky & left residue that won't come off.  Warranty Dept. denied claim?

I was excited to make my first purchase on this website and I was very pleased to see my jacket was on sale. So I bought it on Saturday, eager to have it this week so I paid extra for "2 day shipping". On Tuesday the status check on the website simply said "processing". No eta of a delivery date or even shipping date.  I emailed customer service and didn't hear back. So Tuesday evening I called to inquire. They said its 2 OR 3 business days, after a 1 day processing. Ok fine. I would get it Wed or Thur. Wednesday came, Thursday came and still nothing. I did finally receive a UPS tracking number from them and when I tracked it I was given a delivery date of Thursday. But now its Friday and still nothing. I contacted UPS and they said they still haven't received the item to ship..? And I needed to contact the seller. So now I am sitting on the phone on hold. My initial wait time was estimated to be 25 minutes. Every few minutes a recording comes on to update my hold time, but my hold time is going up instead of down. Now its at 34 minutes..? I still never did receive an email response from their customer service. I'm a little stunned I thought Columbia was a decent brand, and the gear seems to be, but the online ordering and customer service is enough to make me go elsewhere, which I will be after receiving this jacket (whenever that will be).

I would put a big old Goose Egg (0) If I could!!!!  I want to be clear that I am reviewing the company customer service here, NOT the products.  The products have always been great, that's why what happened to me disheartens me even more.  :(If you order from online, you should be aware that if your package is lost (or in my case stolen) while in transit with UPS or FED Ex, Columbia "customer service" becomes your worst nightmare.  They should call it Columbia service instead of customer service, because they don't treat you like a valued customer when this happens to you.  I placed an order with a coat and mittens that they had on a great sale!  I tracked the package until it reached IL, and that is where it stopped, and my headache began!  I called Columbia (C) and told them that my package has not arrived by the ETA, and I was told that I need to wait at least 7 days past the ETA to see if it shows up.  Mind you, they have my $150.  They were willing and happy to take that, but I had no product!!  So, I patiently waited the 7 days, tracked the package again to the same distribution center in IL.  I called C back, and I was told that they would open up an investigation request.  They informed me that this could take 10-14 business days to complete.  So I asked, if I could have a refund or could they ship me a new package?  I was told that this is not their policy (by several other people as well in the company).  I was beside myself.  How could a company this huge treat me (a great frequent customer) as though it was my fault the package was lost.  they could have put a tracer on the package, and had (if found) it sent back to Columbia.  In the meantime, I should have gotten a new package and been thrilled w my purchase!  but NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.  It didn't end there.  I wrote email after email call after call, and I kept getting told that the investigation with UPS was not complete (I have a friend with UPS access who said the invest was already closed and she sent me the notes).  The notes said that they found the mittens (outside of the box), and the jacket was never found.  The jacket was marked stolen, and the mittens were shipped back to C.  You know what I was told at this point???!!!!  I had to wait for the mittens to arrive back to C!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I cant even tell you how livid I was!  Why do I have to wait for them to get the mittens back whne the invest. was closed and completed.  I finally got my money back a month after I ordered.  Thanks Columbia!  You lost a great customer.  Thanks but no thanks for the offer of 20% off an order.  You are all heart!!!!

Horrible customer service. Order a jacket for son based on sizing cart (indicates runs bigger). Turned out it's smaller then sizing indicates so I called same day when receiving package. Asked for a exchange from small to medium and they still have other size on same color. Asked me to ship jacket back, So mailed next day. When returned and I checked tracking that return were back at Columbia about 2 working days later, Called customer service and and they told me the same color don't have size left besides large.

Beware--Columbia Customer Service may NOT repair or replace your item, but choose to give you a few dollars e-credit.  I asked for my item back but they recycle or donate them.I did not know that was an option. I should have kept my item and  gotten it fixed  myself.  Now I have lost my great rain garment that looked simple to fix.  Seams splitting all over a garment that is worn a few times seems like a manufacturing error.

I returned a pair of hiking boots after 3 months of light use. The left boot sole came unglued and fell apart. I had to pay $20.00 to ship them back on top of the original purchase price. 3 weeks later, I got the boots back. Columbia re-glued them in a half assed way; you could see the gaps in the sole and toe piece- it was a joke! The letter that came back with the boots from "quality control" stated that the boots were out of the 1 year warranty period. I had included a copy of the receipt dated far less than 1 year. The boots were clearly defective, and still are. I threw them away. Because of the idiotic treatment I received, I would choose ANY name brand before a Columbia product. They could have done the right thing and gained a customer, but they chose to screw me. Nice work Columbia!

This company sucks.  Apparently in 2012 i placed an order for 388.50.  I returned some items as they were Christmas gifts and due to Columbia's inconsistent sizing, I had to send things back. Apparently now I am unable to place an order and so is everyone in my household including our apartment. There are three households st this residence and a  total of 8 different credit cards and they will not accept an order from any of them.  Even tried using a gift card and it will not go through. This is ridiculous.

I am flabbergasted by some of the bad reviews posted here.  Columbia sportswear has consistently been a winner for me.  I love that they offer good quality, REAL sportswear in plus sizes for women.  Their clothing is good quality, well fitting and BEAUTIFUL!  I don't live in an area with a Columbia store, so I order online.  Even so, I have never purchased a product from this website that I needed to return.  And every single time I wear a Columbia garment, I get scads of comments and compliments from folks who want to know where I buy my clothes.  The last time i purchased a shirt from Columbia, my husband told me that I looked beautiful and said I should get one in each color they offered!  As a plus sized woman, I have often felt victimized by companies who cater to people with hard-to-fit bodies;  charging premium prices for poor quality goods, simply because our choices are scarce.  I cannot express how much I appreciate a mainline business who makes quality garments in all sizes and treats their larger sized customers exactly the same as their smaller counterparts.  When I wear Columbia, I feel comfortable, beautiful and dressed appropriately for the Rocky Mountain region where I live.  I heartily recommend Columbia!

Like several other notable, formerly proud, and once market leading companies (see Ray-Ban, Hoover Vacuum, et al.)Sorel has been purchased for it's brand cache and is systematically being transformed into a made in China (or Viet Nam) fashion focused, inferior product oriented, over priced corporate cash cow.  The heritage of quality and performance has been traded for return on investment.My expensive Sorels lasted exactly one hour in the sub-zero January temperatures that we have suffered recently in the midwest, before they completely disintegrated.  I returned them to the factory, based on the instructions provided by the customer service person at Sorel, and the warranty evaluator rejected my claim.  Technically, they were out of the warranty period, but when you drop a buck fifty on a pair of winter boots, you expect them to out perform your daughter's Hello Kitty boots.  That wasn't the case.  If you want an exceptional pair of extreme weather boots, grab a pair of US Army surplus "Mickey Mouse" boots manufactured by BATA.  They are  absolutey the warmest, most durable boots you'll ever own, and they're available all over the internet for bout $60.  Skip the junk that Columbia is cranking out in China and calling Sorel.

I used to like Columbia clothing as it was generally constructed of quality material. The last two purchases have completely changed my mind. I just spent $70 on a sweater that began to pill after just two washes. The last sweater I bought turned into a giant ball of pilly fuzz within a week. I'll not spend another nickel on anything made by this brand.

I disagree with the orange head review, Columbia is the bee's knees.I bought a Bugaboo parka in 2008 from some rando sporting goods site and we had several good years together. Sadly, the zipper died and I needed to send it in for repair just in time for a cold snap and of course I have a trip to Iceland coming up as well. Womp womp.So. Off to Oregon it went. Once I saw they received it I gave them a call to check on it and explain that I kinda needed it back and was answered by a lovely woman who listened to my plight and set about helping find a solution for me. She told me I was getting a replacement and we went through the options I had available to me, in less than half an hour a new coat was ordered and Columbia had made a huge fan out of me. A spankin new coat arrived at my office today and I love it. Columbia stands behind its products with great customer service, what more can you ask for?

They offer free shipping, but you have to pay for returns. There is not a choice to evenly exchange an item for a different size. You return the item for a refund and place a new order. The jacket I bought is now 1.5 times as much.

Bought a pair of mens Birke Trail light weight hikers on 2/17/15. Wore them maybe 20 times and the toe box failed and wore/tore through due to substandard suede. I sent them in to Columbia and they proceeded to loose them for two weeks after they received them. After numerous phone calls they finally found them and I was told in late April that they would get back to me ASAP once they were evaluated. Here is it 6/5/15 and I had heard nothing so I called and was put on hold for 10 minutes while the rep looked up the info. He them informed me that they could replace them and they were waiting for me to contact them. NOT what they told me back in late April. Either way they don't have the shoes I had purchased so they will replace them with a similar shoe and it will be another 2 weeks before I get them. Columbia used to be a great company, not any more. I will buy from anyone but them in the future. Most likely Lands End, North Face, etc.

I've tried using their unsubscribe form many times, but it does not work (probably because it thinks email addresses can't have a plus sign in them). Then, I opened 5 support tickets over the course of 2 months. Each time they told me they unsubscribed me, yet I still receive email from them.

I regret giving them my email, but I do not regret buying a jacket from them. It's one of my daily drivers.







My review is regarding Customer Service after placing an online order. 
I question the speed of delivery order and after two full weeks still no package.  I tied to trace it but it may no sense... Coming to California (on the west coast) package was in Chicago for several days.  When I question the 'Customer Care' rep I was told delivery is between 8-13 days.  I told her that was not what my email shipping notice informed me of.  I was basically told I had to wait! 
Still waiting package was now in Iowa again I'm on west coast as the company is too. 
After several rude email from 'Customer Care' rep I was still left with no answers or package.  So I went to the mall and purchase another Mother's Day gift. Finally after two PLUS weeks package arrived I know one reason it took so long the box was re-re-recycled and previous labels were not removed. Now at checkout I did NOT check box to recycle box.   Ask to speak with Supervisor still waiting all I received was another rude email for 'Customer Care' more like Customer careLESS rep.  
I really love Columbia clothing but I will look for another company.







Their products is a piece of junk, very poor quality, I bought a few thousand dollars worth of stuff for my whole families, we wore it for the first time and 3 of the coats stitches by the armpit came apart. Will never buy this piece sh*t again, waste my time returning it...Columbia need to Fired the CEO.







I have a pair of Columbia boots that are a few years old. They are a winter boot that I wear only in the snowiest of conditions. I will never by a pair of Columbia boots again, in fact I'll never by a Columbia product again. The seams tore out of these boots rendering them useless in the winter. I wrote Columbia, but got no response. These are boots supposedly made for the toughest conditions, like Columbias moto, "tested tough", yeah right, Do Not Buy Columbia Boots, and if you expect customer service don't by Columbia products at all. It's sad because I use to be a fan of Columbia products. When I go to buy winter boots in the future I'll get Sorels.







Lifetime warranty unless it's classified as a sportswear item, then it only has a one year warranty. So if the zipper stop falls off and so does the zipper make sure it happens within 364 days. Stuff happens, but then the company should step up and fix. Oh, I could mail back and they would evaluate and let me know, but probably not. 
On a small positive note, I did receive a quick and professional response to my email. But that didn't help fix my wife's jacket. Not satisfied.







Never again, I bought a light Columbia coat and the zipper jammed with my car keys inside. I had to cut the coat open to get my keys. I always give companies a second chance, I bought another jacket and the exact situation happened., keys in the pocket. I own a lot of coats, cheap and nice and these are the only brand that has failed me. I tried to return it and they told me to send it in postage on me and they will probably give you a new one. Never mind keep your bad product.







purchased a $60 backpack and after 4 weeks of use, my fourth grade son has a giant rip at the seam.   They want me to return it for a repair and to pay shipping!  They will pay the shipping if they determine it is warranted.  Obviously I can't wait the 4-6 weeks for my son to have a backpack.  I had to go and buy a Jansport.   Now I am suppose to pay $10 to ship it back to them and have them return a backpack I don't need or want.
They wouldn't even offer to pay for shipping!
Horrible customer service for defective and poor quality bag.







In general I've been a big fan of Columbia gear and especially their PFG line.  Out of 30 PFG shirts I own or have owned I had one of my TAMIAMI II PFG shirts have a neck tag go bad after a hot day fishing in the Louisiana Summer.  The tag got sticky and rubbed off on my neck.  I washed the shirt on cold/cold cycle like I always do and on removing it from the wash I noticed that the tag had transferred a rubbery residue to the collar of the shirt that wouldn't come off.  I emailed Columbia asking if they had a recommended treatment to remove this tag residue and was informed I should just mail it to the warranty dept. so I did.  The warranty dept. mailed it back with no notice and the package was left with just a sheet of paper indicating the warranty wouldn't cover my shirt?  All I want is a way to remove the tag residue and they must know a way!!!  This is so frustrating to have a perfectly good shirt ruined due to their goofy tag residue that should be easily removed by a known solvent to them that they won't share the information...







I was excited to make my first purchase on this website and I was very pleased to see my jacket was on sale. So I bought it on Saturday, eager to have it this week so I paid extra for "2 day shipping". On Tuesday the status check on the website simply said "processing". No eta of a delivery date or even shipping date.  I emailed customer service and didn't hear back. So Tuesday evening I called to inquire. They said its 2 OR 3 business days, after a 1 day processing. Ok fine. I would get it Wed or Thur. Wednesday came, Thursday came and still nothing. I did finally receive a UPS tracking number from them and when I tracked it I was given a delivery date of Thursday. But now its Friday and still nothing. I contacted UPS and they said they still haven't received the item to ship..? And I needed to contact the seller. So now I am sitting on the phone on hold. My initial wait time was estimated to be 25 minutes. Every few minutes a recording comes on to update my hold time, but my hold time is going up instead of down. Now its at 34 minutes..? I still never did receive an email response from their customer service. I'm a little stunned I thought Columbia was a decent brand, and the gear seems to be, but the online ordering and customer service is enough to make me go elsewhere, which I will be after receiving this jacket (whenever that will be).







I would put a big old Goose Egg (0) If I could!!!!  I want to be clear that I am reviewing the company customer service here, NOT the products.  The products have always been great, that's why what happened to me disheartens me even more.  :(

If you order from online, you should be aware that if your package is lost (or in my case stolen) while in transit with UPS or FED Ex, Columbia "customer service" becomes your worst nightmare.  They should call it Columbia service instead of customer service, because they don't treat you like a valued customer when this happens to you.  

I placed an order with a coat and mittens that they had on a great sale!  I tracked the package until it reached IL, and that is where it stopped, and my headache began!  I called Columbia (C) and told them that my package has not arrived by the ETA, and I was told that I need to wait at least 7 days past the ETA to see if it shows up.  Mind you, they have my $150.  They were willing and happy to take that, but I had no product!!  So, I patiently waited the 7 days, tracked the package again to the same distribution center in IL.  I called C back, and I was told that they would open up an investigation request.  They informed me that this could take 10-14 business days to complete.  So I asked, if I could have a refund or could they ship me a new package?  I was told that this is not their policy (by several other people as well in the company).  I was beside myself.  How could a company this huge treat me (a great frequent customer) as though it was my fault the package was lost.  they could have put a tracer on the package, and had (if found) it sent back to Columbia.  In the meantime, I should have gotten a new package and been thrilled w my purchase!  but NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.  It didn't end there.  I wrote email after email call after call, and I kept getting told that the investigation with UPS was not complete (I have a friend with UPS access who said the invest was already closed and she sent me the notes).  The notes said that they found the mittens (outside of the box), and the jacket was never found.  The jacket was marked stolen, and the mittens were shipped back to C.  You know what I was told at this point???!!!!  I had to wait for the mittens to arrive back to C!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I cant even tell you how livid I was!  Why do I have to wait for them to get the mittens back whne the invest. was closed and completed.  

I finally got my money back a month after I ordered.  Thanks Columbia!  You lost a great customer.  Thanks but no thanks for the offer of 20% off an order.  You are all heart!!!!







Horrible customer service. Order a jacket for son based on sizing cart (indicates runs bigger). Turned out it's smaller then sizing indicates so I called same day when receiving package. Asked for a exchange from small to medium and they still have other size on same color. Asked me to ship jacket back, So mailed next day. When returned and I checked tracking that return were back at Columbia about 2 working days later, Called customer service and and they told me the same color don't have size left besides large.







Beware--Columbia Customer Service may NOT repair or replace your item, but choose to give you a few dollars e-credit.  I asked for my item back but they recycle or donate them.
I did not know that was an option. I should have kept my item and  gotten it fixed  myself.  Now I have lost my great rain garment that looked simple to fix.  Seams splitting all over a garment that is worn a few times seems like a manufacturing error.







I returned a pair of hiking boots after 3 months of light use. The left boot sole came unglued and fell apart. I had to pay $20.00 to ship them back on top of the original purchase price. 3 weeks later, I got the boots back. Columbia re-glued them in a half assed way; you could see the gaps in the sole and toe piece- it was a joke! The letter that came back with the boots from "quality control" stated that the boots were out of the 1 year warranty period. I had included a copy of the receipt dated far less than 1 year. The boots were clearly defective, and still are. I threw them away. Because of the idiotic treatment I received, I would choose ANY name brand before a Columbia product. They could have done the right thing and gained a customer, but they chose to screw me. Nice work Columbia!







This company sucks.  Apparently in 2012 i placed an order for 388.50.  I returned some items as they were Christmas gifts and due to Columbia's inconsistent sizing, I had to send things back. Apparently now I am unable to place an order and so is everyone in my household including our apartment. There are three households st this residence and a  total of 8 different credit cards and they will not accept an order from any of them.  Even tried using a gift card and it will not go through. This is ridiculous.







I am flabbergasted by some of the bad reviews posted here.  Columbia sportswear has consistently been a winner for me.  I love that they offer good quality, REAL sportswear in plus sizes for women.  Their clothing is good quality, well fitting and BEAUTIFUL!  

I don't live in an area with a Columbia store, so I order online.  Even so, I have never purchased a product from this website that I needed to return.  And every single time I wear a Columbia garment, I get scads of comments and compliments from folks who want to know where I buy my clothes.  The last time i purchased a shirt from Columbia, my husband told me that I looked beautiful and said I should get one in each color they offered!  

As a plus sized woman, I have often felt victimized by companies who cater to people with hard-to-fit bodies;  charging premium prices for poor quality goods, simply because our choices are scarce.  I cannot express how much I appreciate a mainline business who makes quality garments in all sizes and treats their larger sized customers exactly the same as their smaller counterparts.  When I wear Columbia, I feel comfortable, beautiful and dressed appropriately for the Rocky Mountain region where I live.  

I heartily recommend Columbia!







Like several other notable, formerly proud, and once market leading companies (see Ray-Ban, Hoover Vacuum, et al.)Sorel has been purchased for it's brand cache and is systematically being transformed into a made in China (or Viet Nam) fashion focused, inferior product oriented, over priced corporate cash cow.  The heritage of quality and performance has been traded for return on investment.

My expensive Sorels lasted exactly one hour in the sub-zero January temperatures that we have suffered recently in the midwest, before they completely disintegrated.  I returned them to the factory, based on the instructions provided by the customer service person at Sorel, and the warranty evaluator rejected my claim.  Technically, they were out of the warranty period, but when you drop a buck fifty on a pair of winter boots, you expect them to out perform your daughter's Hello Kitty boots.  That wasn't the case.  
If you want an exceptional pair of extreme weather boots, grab a pair of US Army surplus "Mickey Mouse" boots manufactured by BATA.  They are  absolutey the warmest, most durable boots you'll ever own, and they're available all over the internet for bout $60.  Skip the junk that Columbia is cranking out in China and calling Sorel.







I used to like Columbia clothing as it was generally constructed of quality material. The last two purchases have completely changed my mind. I just spent $70 on a sweater that began to pill after just two washes. The last sweater I bought turned into a giant ball of pilly fuzz within a week. I'll not spend another nickel on anything made by this brand.







I disagree with the orange head review, Columbia is the bee's knees.

I bought a Bugaboo parka in 2008 from some rando sporting goods site and we had several good years together. Sadly, the zipper died and I needed to send it in for repair just in time for a cold snap and of course I have a trip to Iceland coming up as well. Womp womp.

So. Off to Oregon it went. Once I saw they received it I gave them a call to check on it and explain that I kinda needed it back and was answered by a lovely woman who listened to my plight and set about helping find a solution for me. She told me I was getting a replacement and we went through the options I had available to me, in less than half an hour a new coat was ordered and Columbia had made a huge fan out of me. 

A spankin new coat arrived at my office today and I love it. Columbia stands behind its products with great customer service, what more can you ask for?







They offer free shipping, but you have to pay for returns. There is not a choice to evenly exchange an item for a different size. You return the item for a refund and place a new order. The jacket I bought is now 1.5 times as much.







Bought a pair of mens Birke Trail light weight hikers on 2/17/15. Wore them maybe 20 times and the toe box failed and wore/tore through due to substandard suede. I sent them in to Columbia and they proceeded to loose them for two weeks after they received them. After numerous phone calls they finally found them and I was told in late April that they would get back to me ASAP once they were evaluated. Here is it 6/5/15 and I had heard nothing so I called and was put on hold for 10 minutes while the rep looked up the info. He them informed me that they could replace them and they were waiting for me to contact them. NOT what they told me back in late April. Either way they don't have the shoes I had purchased so they will replace them with a similar shoe and it will be another 2 weeks before I get them. Columbia used to be a great company, not any more. I will buy from anyone but them in the future. Most likely Lands End, North Face, etc.

I've tried using their unsubscribe form many times, but it does not work (probably because it thinks email addresses can't have a plus sign in them). Then, I opened 5 support tickets over the course of 2 months. Each time they told me they unsubscribed me, yet I still receive email from them.I regret giving them my email, but I do not regret buying a jacket from them. It's one of my daily drivers.

My review is regarding Customer Service after placing an online order. I question the speed of delivery order and after two full weeks still no package.  I tied to trace it but it may no sense... Coming to California (on the west coast) package was in Chicago for several days.  When I question the 'Customer Care' rep I was told delivery is between 8-13 days.  I told her that was not what my email shipping notice informed me of.  I was basically told I had to wait! Still waiting package was now in Iowa again I'm on west coast as the company is too. After several rude email from 'Customer Care' rep I was still left with no answers or package.  So I went to the mall and purchase another Mother's Day gift. Finally after two PLUS weeks package arrived I know one reason it took so long the box was re-re-recycled and previous labels were not removed. Now at checkout I did NOT check box to recycle box.   Ask to speak with Supervisor still waiting all I received was another rude email for 'Customer Care' more like Customer careLESS rep.  I really love Columbia clothing but I will look for another company.

I have a pair of Columbia boots that are a few years old. They are a winter boot that I wear only in the snowiest of conditions. I will never by a pair of Columbia boots again, in fact I'll never by a Columbia product again. The seams tore out of these boots rendering them useless in the winter. I wrote Columbia, but got no response. These are boots supposedly made for the toughest conditions, like Columbias moto, "tested tough", yeah right, Do Not Buy Columbia Boots, and if you expect customer service don't by Columbia products at all. It's sad because I use to be a fan of Columbia products. When I go to buy winter boots in the future I'll get Sorels.

Lifetime warranty unless it's classified as a sportswear item, then it only has a one year warranty. So if the zipper stop falls off and so does the zipper make sure it happens within 364 days. Stuff happens, but then the company should step up and fix. Oh, I could mail back and they would evaluate and let me know, but probably not. On a small positive note, I did receive a quick and professional response to my email. But that didn't help fix my wife's jacket. Not satisfied.

Never again, I bought a light Columbia coat and the zipper jammed with my car keys inside. I had to cut the coat open to get my keys. I always give companies a second chance, I bought another jacket and the exact situation happened., keys in the pocket. I own a lot of coats, cheap and nice and these are the only brand that has failed me. I tried to return it and they told me to send it in postage on me and they will probably give you a new one. Never mind keep your bad product.

purchased a $60 backpack and after 4 weeks of use, my fourth grade son has a giant rip at the seam.   They want me to return it for a repair and to pay shipping!  They will pay the shipping if they determine it is warranted.  Obviously I can't wait the 4-6 weeks for my son to have a backpack.  I had to go and buy a Jansport.   Now I am suppose to pay $10 to ship it back to them and have them return a backpack I don't need or want.They wouldn't even offer to pay for shipping!Horrible customer service for defective and poor quality bag.

In general I've been a big fan of Columbia gear and especially their PFG line.  Out of 30 PFG shirts I own or have owned I had one of my TAMIAMI II PFG shirts have a neck tag go bad after a hot day fishing in the Louisiana Summer.  The tag got sticky and rubbed off on my neck.  I washed the shirt on cold/cold cycle like I always do and on removing it from the wash I noticed that the tag had transferred a rubbery residue to the collar of the shirt that wouldn't come off.  I emailed Columbia asking if they had a recommended treatment to remove this tag residue and was informed I should just mail it to the warranty dept. so I did.  The warranty dept. mailed it back with no notice and the package was left with just a sheet of paper indicating the warranty wouldn't cover my shirt?  All I want is a way to remove the tag residue and they must know a way!!!  This is so frustrating to have a perfectly good shirt ruined due to their goofy tag residue that should be easily removed by a known solvent to them that they won't share the information...








Of MANY PFG shirts this one tag went bad/got sticky & left residue that won't come off.  Warranty Dept. denied claim?

I was excited to make my first purchase on this website and I was very pleased to see my jacket was on sale. So I bought it on Saturday, eager to have it this week so I paid extra for "2 day shipping". On Tuesday the status check on the website simply said "processing". No eta of a delivery date or even shipping date.  I emailed customer service and didn't hear back. So Tuesday evening I called to inquire. They said its 2 OR 3 business days, after a 1 day processing. Ok fine. I would get it Wed or Thur. Wednesday came, Thursday came and still nothing. I did finally receive a UPS tracking number from them and when I tracked it I was given a delivery date of Thursday. But now its Friday and still nothing. I contacted UPS and they said they still haven't received the item to ship..? And I needed to contact the seller. So now I am sitting on the phone on hold. My initial wait time was estimated to be 25 minutes. Every few minutes a recording comes on to update my hold time, but my hold time is going up instead of down. Now its at 34 minutes..? I still never did receive an email response from their customer service. I'm a little stunned I thought Columbia was a decent brand, and the gear seems to be, but the online ordering and customer service is enough to make me go elsewhere, which I will be after receiving this jacket (whenever that will be).

I would put a big old Goose Egg (0) If I could!!!!  I want to be clear that I am reviewing the company customer service here, NOT the products.  The products have always been great, that's why what happened to me disheartens me even more.  :(If you order from online, you should be aware that if your package is lost (or in my case stolen) while in transit with UPS or FED Ex, Columbia "customer service" becomes your worst nightmare.  They should call it Columbia service instead of customer service, because they don't treat you like a valued customer when this happens to you.  I placed an order with a coat and mittens that they had on a great sale!  I tracked the package until it reached IL, and that is where it stopped, and my headache began!  I called Columbia (C) and told them that my package has not arrived by the ETA, and I was told that I need to wait at least 7 days past the ETA to see if it shows up.  Mind you, they have my $150.  They were willing and happy to take that, but I had no product!!  So, I patiently waited the 7 days, tracked the package again to the same distribution center in IL.  I called C back, and I was told that they would open up an investigation request.  They informed me that this could take 10-14 business days to complete.  So I asked, if I could have a refund or could they ship me a new package?  I was told that this is not their policy (by several other people as well in the company).  I was beside myself.  How could a company this huge treat me (a great frequent customer) as though it was my fault the package was lost.  they could have put a tracer on the package, and had (if found) it sent back to Columbia.  In the meantime, I should have gotten a new package and been thrilled w my purchase!  but NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.  It didn't end there.  I wrote email after email call after call, and I kept getting told that the investigation with UPS was not complete (I have a friend with UPS access who said the invest was already closed and she sent me the notes).  The notes said that they found the mittens (outside of the box), and the jacket was never found.  The jacket was marked stolen, and the mittens were shipped back to C.  You know what I was told at this point???!!!!  I had to wait for the mittens to arrive back to C!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I cant even tell you how livid I was!  Why do I have to wait for them to get the mittens back whne the invest. was closed and completed.  I finally got my money back a month after I ordered.  Thanks Columbia!  You lost a great customer.  Thanks but no thanks for the offer of 20% off an order.  You are all heart!!!!

Horrible customer service. Order a jacket for son based on sizing cart (indicates runs bigger). Turned out it's smaller then sizing indicates so I called same day when receiving package. Asked for a exchange from small to medium and they still have other size on same color. Asked me to ship jacket back, So mailed next day. When returned and I checked tracking that return were back at Columbia about 2 working days later, Called customer service and and they told me the same color don't have size left besides large.

Beware--Columbia Customer Service may NOT repair or replace your item, but choose to give you a few dollars e-credit.  I asked for my item back but they recycle or donate them.I did not know that was an option. I should have kept my item and  gotten it fixed  myself.  Now I have lost my great rain garment that looked simple to fix.  Seams splitting all over a garment that is worn a few times seems like a manufacturing error.

I returned a pair of hiking boots after 3 months of light use. The left boot sole came unglued and fell apart. I had to pay $20.00 to ship them back on top of the original purchase price. 3 weeks later, I got the boots back. Columbia re-glued them in a half assed way; you could see the gaps in the sole and toe piece- it was a joke! The letter that came back with the boots from "quality control" stated that the boots were out of the 1 year warranty period. I had included a copy of the receipt dated far less than 1 year. The boots were clearly defective, and still are. I threw them away. Because of the idiotic treatment I received, I would choose ANY name brand before a Columbia product. They could have done the right thing and gained a customer, but they chose to screw me. Nice work Columbia!

This company sucks.  Apparently in 2012 i placed an order for 388.50.  I returned some items as they were Christmas gifts and due to Columbia's inconsistent sizing, I had to send things back. Apparently now I am unable to place an order and so is everyone in my household including our apartment. There are three households st this residence and a  total of 8 different credit cards and they will not accept an order from any of them.  Even tried using a gift card and it will not go through. This is ridiculous.

I am flabbergasted by some of the bad reviews posted here.  Columbia sportswear has consistently been a winner for me.  I love that they offer good quality, REAL sportswear in plus sizes for women.  Their clothing is good quality, well fitting and BEAUTIFUL!  I don't live in an area with a Columbia store, so I order online.  Even so, I have never purchased a product from this website that I needed to return.  And every single time I wear a Columbia garment, I get scads of comments and compliments from folks who want to know where I buy my clothes.  The last time i purchased a shirt from Columbia, my husband told me that I looked beautiful and said I should get one in each color they offered!  As a plus sized woman, I have often felt victimized by companies who cater to people with hard-to-fit bodies;  charging premium prices for poor quality goods, simply because our choices are scarce.  I cannot express how much I appreciate a mainline business who makes quality garments in all sizes and treats their larger sized customers exactly the same as their smaller counterparts.  When I wear Columbia, I feel comfortable, beautiful and dressed appropriately for the Rocky Mountain region where I live.  I heartily recommend Columbia!

Like several other notable, formerly proud, and once market leading companies (see Ray-Ban, Hoover Vacuum, et al.)Sorel has been purchased for it's brand cache and is systematically being transformed into a made in China (or Viet Nam) fashion focused, inferior product oriented, over priced corporate cash cow.  The heritage of quality and performance has been traded for return on investment.My expensive Sorels lasted exactly one hour in the sub-zero January temperatures that we have suffered recently in the midwest, before they completely disintegrated.  I returned them to the factory, based on the instructions provided by the customer service person at Sorel, and the warranty evaluator rejected my claim.  Technically, they were out of the warranty period, but when you drop a buck fifty on a pair of winter boots, you expect them to out perform your daughter's Hello Kitty boots.  That wasn't the case.  If you want an exceptional pair of extreme weather boots, grab a pair of US Army surplus "Mickey Mouse" boots manufactured by BATA.  They are  absolutey the warmest, most durable boots you'll ever own, and they're available all over the internet for bout $60.  Skip the junk that Columbia is cranking out in China and calling Sorel.

I used to like Columbia clothing as it was generally constructed of quality material. The last two purchases have completely changed my mind. I just spent $70 on a sweater that began to pill after just two washes. The last sweater I bought turned into a giant ball of pilly fuzz within a week. I'll not spend another nickel on anything made by this brand.

I disagree with the orange head review, Columbia is the bee's knees.I bought a Bugaboo parka in 2008 from some rando sporting goods site and we had several good years together. Sadly, the zipper died and I needed to send it in for repair just in time for a cold snap and of course I have a trip to Iceland coming up as well. Womp womp.So. Off to Oregon it went. Once I saw they received it I gave them a call to check on it and explain that I kinda needed it back and was answered by a lovely woman who listened to my plight and set about helping find a solution for me. She told me I was getting a replacement and we went through the options I had available to me, in less than half an hour a new coat was ordered and Columbia had made a huge fan out of me. A spankin new coat arrived at my office today and I love it. Columbia stands behind its products with great customer service, what more can you ask for?

They offer free shipping, but you have to pay for returns. There is not a choice to evenly exchange an item for a different size. You return the item for a refund and place a new order. The jacket I bought is now 1.5 times as much.

Bought a pair of mens Birke Trail light weight hikers on 2/17/15. Wore them maybe 20 times and the toe box failed and wore/tore through due to substandard suede. I sent them in to Columbia and they proceeded to loose them for two weeks after they received them. After numerous phone calls they finally found them and I was told in late April that they would get back to me ASAP once they were evaluated. Here is it 6/5/15 and I had heard nothing so I called and was put on hold for 10 minutes while the rep looked up the info. He them informed me that they could replace them and they were waiting for me to contact them. NOT what they told me back in late April. Either way they don't have the shoes I had purchased so they will replace them with a similar shoe and it will be another 2 weeks before I get them. Columbia used to be a great company, not any more. I will buy from anyone but them in the future. Most likely Lands End, North Face, etc.

I like much more Eddie Bauer but my boyfriend has also a membership card of this store, so he always get me things that I love! The excuse: hey, lets check out those 20% off deals! And surely, there is always a shirt with the metallic inside that keep your super warm anywhere...and that matches with the color of my sunglasses:) Impossible not to get a good deal back home. I think they should hire a better stylist to put the clothes in a more attractive way and not so much as 'outlet display'. At least I like to buy things that are displayed in an attractive manner. This store lacks the wow factor but still has everything I want every time I go and service has always been good.







No problem.  Needed to return an online item and it was done with a smile. I was on hold for 15 minutes trying to see if the Columbia outlet near where I live would take it, since I was returning Sorel shoes.  I hung up because 15 minutes is too long to wait for an answer. Here they were pleasant, took it and give me my money back. It's a large store with a big selection. I would definitely come here to shop if I didn't have the friends and family discount, which always makes it cheaper for me to shop online but I don't want to pay return shipping if it doesn't work out.







I have never been so upset with a company.  I live in the desert and I bought a coat to go to Buffalo in January.  I purchased the coat on January 7 and paid extra for 2 day shipping.  It is now 10 days later and the coat has not arrived.  I was told by Customer Care that there was a snow storm that delayed my coat.  I was not informed of the delay and missed my chance to buy another coat   I don't have enough balance on my card to purchase another coat and I'm cold.  AWFUL!!!!!!!







They close at 9 and we were there 8:53 to pay for a jacket we decided and they didn't let us in. Bad customer service and not follow the operation time. Lazy employee....







Employee Norman has great customer service. He honored and did a price adjustment since one of the jackets wasn't coming up 50% but there was a sign that said 50% off - didn't give me any hassle and was kind and friendly.







I had a horrible experience here when I tried to do an exchange last week .There was  one rude  guy in the counter doing all the return.He constantly kept complaining about customers trying to do return to the other guy in the counter infront of the other customers .We went for an exchange , the guy turned us away after half  hour wait ,even though we had all the receipts and tags .Keep off from this store and take your business elsewhere unless you like to be yelled at.

They close at 9 and we were there 8:53 to pay for a jacket we decided and they didn't let us in. Bad customer service and not follow the operation time. Lazy employee....

Employee Norman has great customer service. He honored and did a price adjustment since one of the jackets wasn't coming up 50% but there was a sign that said 50% off - didn't give me any hassle and was kind and friendly.

I had a horrible experience here when I tried to do an exchange last week .There was  one rude  guy in the counter doing all the return.He constantly kept complaining about customers trying to do return to the other guy in the counter infront of the other customers .We went for an exchange , the guy turned us away after half  hour wait ,even though we had all the receipts and tags .Keep off from this store and take your business elsewhere unless you like to be yelled at.

I like much more Eddie Bauer but my boyfriend has also a membership card of this store, so he always get me things that I love! The excuse: hey, lets check out those 20% off deals! And surely, there is always a shirt with the metallic inside that keep your super warm anywhere...and that matches with the color of my sunglasses:) Impossible not to get a good deal back home. I think they should hire a better stylist to put the clothes in a more attractive way and not so much as 'outlet display'. At least I like to buy things that are displayed in an attractive manner. This store lacks the wow factor but still has everything I want every time I go and service has always been good.







No problem.  Needed to return an online item and it was done with a smile. I was on hold for 15 minutes trying to see if the Columbia outlet near where I live would take it, since I was returning Sorel shoes.  I hung up because 15 minutes is too long to wait for an answer. Here they were pleasant, took it and give me my money back. It's a large store with a big selection. I would definitely come here to shop if I didn't have the friends and family discount, which always makes it cheaper for me to shop online but I don't want to pay return shipping if it doesn't work out.







I have never been so upset with a company.  I live in the desert and I bought a coat to go to Buffalo in January.  I purchased the coat on January 7 and paid extra for 2 day shipping.  It is now 10 days later and the coat has not arrived.  I was told by Customer Care that there was a snow storm that delayed my coat.  I was not informed of the delay and missed my chance to buy another coat   I don't have enough balance on my card to purchase another coat and I'm cold.  AWFUL!!!!!!!







They close at 9 and we were there 8:53 to pay for a jacket we decided and they didn't let us in. Bad customer service and not follow the operation time. Lazy employee....







Employee Norman has great customer service. He honored and did a price adjustment since one of the jackets wasn't coming up 50% but there was a sign that said 50% off - didn't give me any hassle and was kind and friendly.







I had a horrible experience here when I tried to do an exchange last week .There was  one rude  guy in the counter doing all the return.He constantly kept complaining about customers trying to do return to the other guy in the counter infront of the other customers .We went for an exchange , the guy turned us away after half  hour wait ,even though we had all the receipts and tags .Keep off from this store and take your business elsewhere unless you like to be yelled at.

And surely, there is always a shirt with the metallic inside that keep your super warm anywhere...and that matches with the color of my sunglasses:) Impossible not to get a good deal back home. I think they should hire a better stylist to put the clothes in a more attractive way and not so much as 'outlet display'. At least I like to buy things that are displayed in an attractive manner. This store lacks the wow factor but still has everything I want every time I go and service has always been good.

No problem.  Needed to return an online item and it was done with a smile. I was on hold for 15 minutes trying to see if the Columbia outlet near where I live would take it, since I was returning Sorel shoes.  I hung up because 15 minutes is too long to wait for an answer. Here they were pleasant, took it and give me my money back. It's a large store with a big selection. I would definitely come here to shop if I didn't have the friends and family discount, which always makes it cheaper for me to shop online but I don't want to pay return shipping if it doesn't work out.

I have never been so upset with a company.  I live in the desert and I bought a coat to go to Buffalo in January.  I purchased the coat on January 7 and paid extra for 2 day shipping.  It is now 10 days later and the coat has not arrived.  I was told by Customer Care that there was a snow storm that delayed my coat.  I was not informed of the delay and missed my chance to buy another coat   I don't have enough balance on my card to purchase another coat and I'm cold.  AWFUL!!!!!!!

Employee Norman has great customer service. He honored and did a price adjustment since one of the jackets wasn't coming up 50% but there was a sign that said 50% off - didn't give me any hassle and was kind and friendly.

I had a horrible experience here when I tried to do an exchange last week .There was  one rude  guy in the counter doing all the return.He constantly kept complaining about customers trying to do return to the other guy in the counter infront of the other customers .We went for an exchange , the guy turned us away after half  hour wait ,even though we had all the receipts and tags .Keep off from this store and take your business elsewhere unless you like to be yelled at.

No problem.  Needed to return an online item and it was done with a smile. I was on hold for 15 minutes trying to see if the Columbia outlet near where I live would take it, since I was returning Sorel shoes.  I hung up because 15 minutes is too long to wait for an answer. Here they were pleasant, took it and give me my money back. It's a large store with a big selection. I would definitely come here to shop if I didn't have the friends and family discount, which always makes it cheaper for me to shop online but I don't want to pay return shipping if it doesn't work out.

Employee Norman has great customer service. He honored and did a price adjustment since one of the jackets wasn't coming up 50% but there was a sign that said 50% off - didn't give me any hassle and was kind and friendly.

I like much more Eddie Bauer but my boyfriend has also a membership card of this store, so he always get me things that I love! The excuse: hey, lets check out those 20% off deals! And surely, there is always a shirt with the metallic inside that keep your super warm anywhere...and that matches with the color of my sunglasses:) Impossible not to get a good deal back home. I think they should hire a better stylist to put the clothes in a more attractive way and not so much as 'outlet display'. At least I like to buy things that are displayed in an attractive manner. This store lacks the wow factor but still has everything I want every time I go and service has always been good.

I have never been so upset with a company.  I live in the desert and I bought a coat to go to Buffalo in January.  I purchased the coat on January 7 and paid extra for 2 day shipping.  It is now 10 days later and the coat has not arrived.  I was told by Customer Care that there was a snow storm that delayed my coat.  I was not informed of the delay and missed my chance to buy another coat   I don't have enough balance on my card to purchase another coat and I'm cold.  AWFUL!!!!!!!

I had a horrible experience here when I tried to do an exchange last week .There was  one rude  guy in the counter doing all the return.He constantly kept complaining about customers trying to do return to the other guy in the counter infront of the other customers .We went for an exchange , the guy turned us away after half  hour wait ,even though we had all the receipts and tags .Keep off from this store and take your business elsewhere unless you like to be yelled at.

They close at 9 and we were there 8:53 to pay for a jacket we decided and they didn't let us in. Bad customer service and not follow the operation time. Lazy employee....

It is now 10 days later and the coat has not arrived.  I was told by Customer Care that there was a snow storm that delayed my coat.  I was not informed of the delay and missed my chance to buy another coat   I don't have enough balance on my card to purchase another coat and I'm cold.  AWFUL!!!!!!!







I had a horrible experience here when I tried to do an exchange last week .There was  one rude  guy in the counter doing all the return.He constantly kept complaining about customers trying to do return to the other guy in the counter infront of the other customers .We went for an exchange , the guy turned us away after half  hour wait ,even though we had all the receipts and tags .Keep off from this store and take your business elsewhere unless you like to be yelled at.







They close at 9 and we were there 8:53 to pay for a jacket we decided and they didn't let us in. Bad customer service and not follow the operation time. Lazy employee....







I like much more Eddie Bauer but my boyfriend has also a membership card of this store, so he always get me things that I love! The excuse: hey, lets check out those 20% off deals! And surely, there is always a shirt with the metallic inside that keep your super warm anywhere...and that matches with the color of my sunglasses:) Impossible not to get a good deal back home. I think they should hire a better stylist to put the clothes in a more attractive way and not so much as 'outlet display'. At least I like to buy things that are displayed in an attractive manner. This store lacks the wow factor but still has everything I want every time I go and service has always been good.







No problem.  Needed to return an online item and it was done with a smile. I was on hold for 15 minutes trying to see if the Columbia outlet near where I live would take it, since I was returning Sorel shoes.  I hung up because 15 minutes is too long to wait for an answer. Here they were pleasant, took it and give me my money back. It's a large store with a big selection. I would definitely come here to shop if I didn't have the friends and family discount, which always makes it cheaper for me to shop online but I don't want to pay return shipping if it doesn't work out.







Employee Norman has great customer service. He honored and did a price adjustment since one of the jackets wasn't coming up 50% but there was a sign that said 50% off - didn't give me any hassle and was kind and friendly.

No problem.  Needed to return an online item and it was done with a smile. I was on hold for 15 minutes trying to see if the Columbia outlet near where I live would take it, since I was returning Sorel shoes.  I hung up because 15 minutes is too long to wait for an answer. Here they were pleasant, took it and give me my money back. It's a large store with a big selection. I would definitely come here to shop if I didn't have the friends and family discount, which always makes it cheaper for me to shop online but I don't want to pay return shipping if it doesn't work out.







I have never been so upset with a company.  I live in the desert and I bought a coat to go to Buffalo in January.  I purchased the coat on January 7 and paid extra for 2 day shipping.  It is now 10 days later and the coat has not arrived.  I was told by Customer Care that there was a snow storm that delayed my coat.  I was not informed of the delay and missed my chance to buy another coat   I don't have enough balance on my card to purchase another coat and I'm cold.  AWFUL!!!!!!!







They close at 9 and we were there 8:53 to pay for a jacket we decided and they didn't let us in. Bad customer service and not follow the operation time. Lazy employee....







Employee Norman has great customer service. He honored and did a price adjustment since one of the jackets wasn't coming up 50% but there was a sign that said 50% off - didn't give me any hassle and was kind and friendly.







I had a horrible experience here when I tried to do an exchange last week .There was  one rude  guy in the counter doing all the return.He constantly kept complaining about customers trying to do return to the other guy in the counter infront of the other customers .We went for an exchange , the guy turned us away after half  hour wait ,even though we had all the receipts and tags .Keep off from this store and take your business elsewhere unless you like to be yelled at.

I like much more Eddie Bauer but my boyfriend has also a membership card of this store, so he always get me things that I love! The excuse: hey, lets check out those 20% off deals! And surely, there is always a shirt with the metallic inside that keep your super warm anywhere...and that matches with the color of my sunglasses:) Impossible not to get a good deal back home. I think they should hire a better stylist to put the clothes in a more attractive way and not so much as 'outlet display'. At least I like to buy things that are displayed in an attractive manner. This store lacks the wow factor but still has everything I want every time I go and service has always been good.

I like much more Eddie Bauer but my boyfriend has also a membership card of this store, so he always get me things that I love! The excuse: hey, lets check out those 20% off deals! And surely, there is always a shirt with the metallic inside that keep your super warm anywhere...and that matches with the color of my sunglasses:) Impossible not to get a good deal back home. I think they should hire a better stylist to put the clothes in a more attractive way and not so much as 'outlet display'. At least I like to buy things that are displayed in an attractive manner. This store lacks the wow factor but still has everything I want every time I go and service has always been good.







I have never been so upset with a company.  I live in the desert and I bought a coat to go to Buffalo in January.  I purchased the coat on January 7 and paid extra for 2 day shipping.  It is now 10 days later and the coat has not arrived.  I was told by Customer Care that there was a snow storm that delayed my coat.  I was not informed of the delay and missed my chance to buy another coat   I don't have enough balance on my card to purchase another coat and I'm cold.  AWFUL!!!!!!!







They close at 9 and we were there 8:53 to pay for a jacket we decided and they didn't let us in. Bad customer service and not follow the operation time. Lazy employee....







Employee Norman has great customer service. He honored and did a price adjustment since one of the jackets wasn't coming up 50% but there was a sign that said 50% off - didn't give me any hassle and was kind and friendly.







I had a horrible experience here when I tried to do an exchange last week .There was  one rude  guy in the counter doing all the return.He constantly kept complaining about customers trying to do return to the other guy in the counter infront of the other customers .We went for an exchange , the guy turned us away after half  hour wait ,even though we had all the receipts and tags .Keep off from this store and take your business elsewhere unless you like to be yelled at.

No problem.  Needed to return an online item and it was done with a smile. I was on hold for 15 minutes trying to see if the Columbia outlet near where I live would take it, since I was returning Sorel shoes.  I hung up because 15 minutes is too long to wait for an answer. Here they were pleasant, took it and give me my money back. It's a large store with a big selection. I would definitely come here to shop if I didn't have the friends and family discount, which always makes it cheaper for me to shop online but I don't want to pay return shipping if it doesn't work out.

I like much more Eddie Bauer but my boyfriend has also a membership card of this store, so he always get me things that I love! The excuse: hey, lets check out those 20% off deals! And surely, there is always a shirt with the metallic inside that keep your super warm anywhere...and that matches with the color of my sunglasses:) Impossible not to get a good deal back home. I think they should hire a better stylist to put the clothes in a more attractive way and not so much as 'outlet display'. At least I like to buy things that are displayed in an attractive manner. This store lacks the wow factor but still has everything I want every time I go and service has always been good.







No problem.  Needed to return an online item and it was done with a smile. I was on hold for 15 minutes trying to see if the Columbia outlet near where I live would take it, since I was returning Sorel shoes.  I hung up because 15 minutes is too long to wait for an answer. Here they were pleasant, took it and give me my money back. It's a large store with a big selection. I would definitely come here to shop if I didn't have the friends and family discount, which always makes it cheaper for me to shop online but I don't want to pay return shipping if it doesn't work out.







They close at 9 and we were there 8:53 to pay for a jacket we decided and they didn't let us in. Bad customer service and not follow the operation time. Lazy employee....







Employee Norman has great customer service. He honored and did a price adjustment since one of the jackets wasn't coming up 50% but there was a sign that said 50% off - didn't give me any hassle and was kind and friendly.







I had a horrible experience here when I tried to do an exchange last week .There was  one rude  guy in the counter doing all the return.He constantly kept complaining about customers trying to do return to the other guy in the counter infront of the other customers .We went for an exchange , the guy turned us away after half  hour wait ,even though we had all the receipts and tags .Keep off from this store and take your business elsewhere unless you like to be yelled at.

I have never been so upset with a company.  I live in the desert and I bought a coat to go to Buffalo in January.  I purchased the coat on January 7 and paid extra for 2 day shipping.  It is now 10 days later and the coat has not arrived.  I was told by Customer Care that there was a snow storm that delayed my coat.  I was not informed of the delay and missed my chance to buy another coat   I don't have enough balance on my card to purchase another coat and I'm cold.  AWFUL!!!!!!!

I like much more Eddie Bauer but my boyfriend has also a membership card of this store, so he always get me things that I love! The excuse: hey, lets check out those 20% off deals! And surely, there is always a shirt with the metallic inside that keep your super warm anywhere...and that matches with the color of my sunglasses:) Impossible not to get a good deal back home. I think they should hire a better stylist to put the clothes in a more attractive way and not so much as 'outlet display'. At least I like to buy things that are displayed in an attractive manner. This store lacks the wow factor but still has everything I want every time I go and service has always been good.







No problem.  Needed to return an online item and it was done with a smile. I was on hold for 15 minutes trying to see if the Columbia outlet near where I live would take it, since I was returning Sorel shoes.  I hung up because 15 minutes is too long to wait for an answer. Here they were pleasant, took it and give me my money back. It's a large store with a big selection. I would definitely come here to shop if I didn't have the friends and family discount, which always makes it cheaper for me to shop online but I don't want to pay return shipping if it doesn't work out.







I have never been so upset with a company.  I live in the desert and I bought a coat to go to Buffalo in January.  I purchased the coat on January 7 and paid extra for 2 day shipping.  It is now 10 days later and the coat has not arrived.  I was told by Customer Care that there was a snow storm that delayed my coat.  I was not informed of the delay and missed my chance to buy another coat   I don't have enough balance on my card to purchase another coat and I'm cold.  AWFUL!!!!!!!







They close at 9 and we were there 8:53 to pay for a jacket we decided and they didn't let us in. Bad customer service and not follow the operation time. Lazy employee....







Employee Norman has great customer service. He honored and did a price adjustment since one of the jackets wasn't coming up 50% but there was a sign that said 50% off - didn't give me any hassle and was kind and friendly.







I had a horrible experience here when I tried to do an exchange last week .There was  one rude  guy in the counter doing all the return.He constantly kept complaining about customers trying to do return to the other guy in the counter infront of the other customers .We went for an exchange , the guy turned us away after half  hour wait ,even though we had all the receipts and tags .Keep off from this store and take your business elsewhere unless you like to be yelled at.

I had a horrible experience here when I tried to do an exchange last week .There was  one rude  guy in the counter doing all the return.He constantly kept complaining about customers trying to do return to the other guy in the counter infront of the other customers .We went for an exchange , the guy turned us away after half  hour wait ,even though we had all the receipts and tags .Keep off from this store and take your business elsewhere unless you like to be yelled at.

I like much more Eddie Bauer but my boyfriend has also a membership card of this store, so he always get me things that I love! The excuse: hey, lets check out those 20% off deals! And surely, there is always a shirt with the metallic inside that keep your super warm anywhere...and that matches with the color of my sunglasses:) Impossible not to get a good deal back home. I think they should hire a better stylist to put the clothes in a more attractive way and not so much as 'outlet display'. At least I like to buy things that are displayed in an attractive manner. This store lacks the wow factor but still has everything I want every time I go and service has always been good.







No problem.  Needed to return an online item and it was done with a smile. I was on hold for 15 minutes trying to see if the Columbia outlet near where I live would take it, since I was returning Sorel shoes.  I hung up because 15 minutes is too long to wait for an answer. Here they were pleasant, took it and give me my money back. It's a large store with a big selection. I would definitely come here to shop if I didn't have the friends and family discount, which always makes it cheaper for me to shop online but I don't want to pay return shipping if it doesn't work out.







I have never been so upset with a company.  I live in the desert and I bought a coat to go to Buffalo in January.  I purchased the coat on January 7 and paid extra for 2 day shipping.  It is now 10 days later and the coat has not arrived.  I was told by Customer Care that there was a snow storm that delayed my coat.  I was not informed of the delay and missed my chance to buy another coat   I don't have enough balance on my card to purchase another coat and I'm cold.  AWFUL!!!!!!!







They close at 9 and we were there 8:53 to pay for a jacket we decided and they didn't let us in. Bad customer service and not follow the operation time. Lazy employee....







Employee Norman has great customer service. He honored and did a price adjustment since one of the jackets wasn't coming up 50% but there was a sign that said 50% off - didn't give me any hassle and was kind and friendly.







I had a horrible experience here when I tried to do an exchange last week .There was  one rude  guy in the counter doing all the return.He constantly kept complaining about customers trying to do return to the other guy in the counter infront of the other customers .We went for an exchange , the guy turned us away after half  hour wait ,even though we had all the receipts and tags .Keep off from this store and take your business elsewhere unless you like to be yelled at.

I have never been so upset with a company.  I live in the desert and I bought a coat to go to Buffalo in January.  I purchased the coat on January 7 and paid extra for 2 day shipping.  It is now 10 days later and the coat has not arrived.  I was told by Customer Care that there was a snow storm that delayed my coat.  I was not informed of the delay and missed my chance to buy another coat   I don't have enough balance on my card to purchase another coat and I'm cold.  AWFUL!!!!!!!

They close at 9 and we were there 8:53 to pay for a jacket we decided and they didn't let us in. Bad customer service and not follow the operation time. Lazy employee....

Employee Norman has great customer service. He honored and did a price adjustment since one of the jackets wasn't coming up 50% but there was a sign that said 50% off - didn't give me any hassle and was kind and friendly.

I had a horrible experience here when I tried to do an exchange last week .There was  one rude  guy in the counter doing all the return.He constantly kept complaining about customers trying to do return to the other guy in the counter infront of the other customers .We went for an exchange , the guy turned us away after half  hour wait ,even though we had all the receipts and tags .Keep off from this store and take your business elsewhere unless you like to be yelled at.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
