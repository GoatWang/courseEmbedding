Product Description▼▲
Ron Chernow tells the riveting story of Alexander Hamilton in the first full-length biography in decades as a man who overcame all odds to shape, inspire, and scandalize the newborn America. Chernow presents an entirely different man than the commonly perceived aristocrat, whose legendary ambitions were motivated not merely by self-interest but by passionate patriotism and a stubborn will to build the foundations of American prosperity and power. This Hamilton is far more human than we've encountered before-from his shame about his birth to his fiery aspirations, from his intimate relationships with childhood friends to his titanic feuds with Jefferson, Madison, Adams, Monroe, and Burr, and from his highly public affair with Maria Reynolds to his loving marriage to his loyal wife Eliza. Never before has there been a more vivid account of Hamilton's famous and mysterious death in a duel with Aaron Burr in July of 1804.

Publisher's Description▼▲
A New York Times Bestseller, and the inspiration for the hit Broadway musical Hamilton!Pulitzer Prize-winning author Ron Chernow presents a landmark biography of Alexander Hamilton, the Founding Father who galvanized, inspired, scandalized, and shaped the newborn nation.In the first full-length biography of Alexander Hamilton in decades, Ron Chernow tells the riveting story of a man who overcame all odds to shape, inspire, and scandalize the newborn America. According to historian Joseph Ellis, Alexander Hamilton is "a robust full-length portrait, in my view the best ever written, of the most brilliant, charismatic and dangerous founder of them all."Few figures in American history have been more hotly debated or more grossly misunderstood than Alexander Hamilton. Chernows biography gives Hamilton his due and sets the record straight, deftly illustrating that the political and economic greatness of todays America is the result of Hamiltons countless sacrifices to champion ideas that were often wildly disputed during his time. "To repudiate his legacy," Chernow writes, "is, in many ways, to repudiate the modern world." Chernow here recounts Hamiltons turbulent life: an illegitimate, largely self-taught orphan from the Caribbean, he came out of nowhere to take America by storm, rising to become George Washingtons aide-de-camp in the Continental Army, coauthoring The Federalist Papers, founding the Bank of New York, leading the Federalist Party, and becoming the first Treasury Secretary of the United States.Historians have long told the story of Americas birth as the triumph of Jeffersons democratic ideals over the aristocratic intentions of Hamilton. Chernow presents an entirely different man, whose legendary ambitions were motivated not merely by self-interest but by passionate patriotism and a stubborn will to build the foundations of American prosperity and power. His is a Hamilton far more human than weve encountered beforefrom his shame about his birth to his fiery aspirations, from his intimate relationships with childhood friends to his titanic feuds with Jefferson, Madison, Adams, Monroe, and Burr, and from his highly public affair with Maria Reynolds to his loving marriage to his loyal wife Eliza. And never before has there been a more vivid account of Hamiltons famous and mysterious death in a duel with Aaron Burr in July of 1804.Chernows biography is not just a portrait of Hamilton, but the story of Americas birth seen through its most central figure. At a critical time to look back to our roots, Alexander Hamilton will remind readers of the purpose of our institutions and our heritage as Americans."Nobody has captured Hamilton better than Chernow" The New York Times Book Review Ron Chernow's new biography, Grant, will be published by Penguin Press in October 2017. 


Author Bio▼▲
Ron Chernow is the prize-winning author of six books and the recipient of the 2015 National Humanities Medal. His first book, The House of Morgan, won the National Book Award, Washington: A Life won the 2011 Pulitzer Prize for Biography, and Alexander Hamilton was the inspiration for the Broadway musical. His new biography, Grant, will be published in October 2017. Chernow lives in Brooklyn, New York.


Editorial Reviews▼▲
"...[N]obody has captured Hamilton better than Chernow..." The New York Times Book Review"...[A] biography commensurate with Hamilton's character, as well as the full, complex context of his unflaggingly active life.... This is a fine work that captures Hamilton's life with judiciousness and verve." Publishers Weekly"A splendid life of an enlightened reactionary and forgotten Founding Father. Literate and full of engaging historical asides. By far the best of the many lives of Hamilton now in print, and a model of the biographers art."Kirkus Reviews (Starred Review)"A robust full-length portrait, in my view the best ever written, of the most brilliant, charismatic and dangerous founder of them all." Joseph J. Ellis, author of Founding Brothers: The Revolutionary Generation"A brilliant historian has done it again! The thoroughness and integrity of Ron Chernows research shines forth on every page of his Alexander Hamilton. He has created a vivid and compelling portrait of a remarkable manand at the same time he has made a monumental contribution to our understanding of the beginnings of the American Republic." Robert A. Caro, author of The Power Broker and The Years of Lyndon Johnson"Alexander Hamilton was one of the most brilliant men of his brilliant time, and one of the most fascinating figures in all of American history. His rocketing life-story is utterly amazing. His importance to the founding of the new nation, and thus to the whole course of American history, can hardly be overstated. And so Ron Chernow's new Hamilton could not be more welcome. This is grand-scale biography at its bestthorough, insightful, consistently fair, and superbly written. It clears away more than a few shop-worn misconceptions about Hamilton, gives credit where credit is due, and is both clear-eyed and understanding about its very human subject. Its numerous portraits of the complex, often conflicting cast of characters are deft and telling. The whole life and times are here in a genuinely great book." David McCullough, author of John Adams

 commentsUndercover zillionaires23. David S. Chernow, $7.9 million23 of 25Title: President and Chief Development and Strategy OfficerCompany: Select Medical Holdings  (SEM)CEO: Robert A. Ortenzio Pay difference: $7.0 millionA longtime director, Chernow joined Select Medical as president in 2010, and to sweeten the deal, the firm awarded him stock worth nearly $7.5 million. If that wasn't enough, because Chernow had to move from Colorado to a new home near Select's Pennsylvania headquarters, the firm gave him a relocation bonus of $150,000. It's safe to say that will cover the U-Haul rental. Select added Chief Development Officer to Chernow's title last January and his stock award won't vest completely until 2016, so it looks like his bosses are hoping he won't pick up and move again any time soon.  --J.O.Source: Equilar, Inc.NEXT: Jeffrey A. Wilke, $7.2 millionMethodology: Total compensation is calculated as the sum of base salary, discretionary and performance-based cash bonuses, the grant-date fair value for stock and option awards during the fiscal year, and other compensation like earnings on deferred compensation, benefits and perks. Equilar, an executive compensation research firm, looked at CEOs at 1,000 of the largest public U.S. companies as measured by revenue. Pay data based on companies' fiscal year end of Dec. 2010 unless otherwise noted. Cash compensation and stock and options increases may not add up exactly to total compensation increases due to rounding. By Stacy Cowley and James O'Toole @CNNMoney

David ChernowCMO I’ve grown-up at Brightwing.  My father started the company in 1973 and, so for as long as I can remember, Brightwing’s people have been part of my family.  We moved to Florida with some Brightwing people to start a branch in Ft. Lauderdale and then moved to Dallas, Texas to start one there.   Throughout all of those moves, Brightwing become home for many people.  We spent weekends, holidays, and vacations together.  We were very much a Brightwing family.  Fast forward 40 years and though my father has long since retired, my brother and I have stayed true to the core values and beliefs we grew up with:  family-centricity, relationship building, and helping people make a difference in their personal and business lives. Today, through the collaborative efforts of Carol, April, Ashley, and Joe our marketing department develops some pretty innovative and creative content.  I say collaborative because we have found that our work product is that much better when we are all part of the creative process.  I call it “Conjoined Intelligence”, which simply means that the intelligence of the group as a whole is greater than any single individual member.   And, so we use the group’s conjoined intelligence for almost all of our projects.  It was the catalyst for our website.  For instance, we felt as a group that story telling with conversational language was more revealing than using corporate speak to describe boring business concepts.  Also, showing who we really are through candid shots of our own people resonated truer than using staged stock photos.  We use marketing to help tell our story with words and pictures, so our viewers can get the “feeling” of what it like to partner with us. I graduated from Cranbrook, the University of Michigan (BA), and the University of Detroit Mercy School of Law (JD).  I married my soul-mate, Julie, and we have 2 children, Jake and Blair.  Jake plays hockey and baseball and Blair dances.  I coach my son’s sports and am a regular participant in the Daddy/Daughter dance at Studio A. This quote says it all: “Realize that your physical experience and environment is the materialization of your beliefs. If you find great exuberance, health, effective work, abundance, smiles on the faces of those who you meet, then take it for granted that your beliefs are beneficial. But if you find poor health, a lack of meaningful work, a lack of abundance, a world of sorrow and evil, then assume your beliefs are faulty and begin examining them.” - Seth, The Nature of Personal Reality  TestimonialsDon't take our word for it! Here is what our clients and employees have to say about us.....September 14, 2016"My experience with Brightwing thus far has been highly favored over past employment experiences. I was a little bit apprehensive not knowing how it would be doing contracted work, but it was been great. I hope to be with Brightwing for many years. " Read MoreAndrea S.   Admin Assitant Texas InstrumentsJuly, 15, 2016"As soon as I reached Texas, I looked for Jeff and established a new working relationship between Baumann and Brightwing. Together we had success in filling critical positions in different functional areas for our divisions, springs and medical. Jeff and his team where instrumental in finding talent with background in industries that are not well represented in Texas, thus making the search very difficult. " Read MoreDavide D.
