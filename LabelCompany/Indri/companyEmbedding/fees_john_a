1. The performance reflects the asset charges for Series I shares from inception to January 27, 2002, and the asset charges for Series II shares for the time periods subsequent to January 27, 2002. The performance for Series II shares will be lower than Series I shares due to the higher Series II 12b-1 fee.


2. During the time period shown in the chart, the Lifestyles, Science & Technology, Blue Chip Growth, Equity-Income, Health Sciences and Small Company Value portfolios expenses were reimbursed. If such expenses had not been reimbursed, returns would be lower. Expense reimbursement for the International Core portfolio was terminated 11/25/02. Expense reimbursement for the Capital Appreciation portfolio was terminated effective 5/15/01.


3. The portfolios in the John Hanocck Variable Insurance Trust described above are not retail mutual funds and are only available under variable annuity contracts, variable life policies, or through participation in tax qualified retirement plans. Although the portfolios' investment adviser or subadvisers may manage retail mutual funds with similar names and investment objectives, no representation is made, and no assurance is given, that any portfolio's investment results will be comparable to the investment results of any other fund, including other funds with the same investment adviser or subadviser. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Papa John's Franchise Cost & Fees

Date of Incorporation: 1984
Franchising Since: 1985
Headquarters: Louisville, Kentucky
Business Description: The franchisor, Papa John's International, Inc., operates and sells franchises for the operation of pizza businesses known as Papa John's restaurants. It also sells certain items to the franchisees.
Franchise Offer: The Papa John's franchise offered is a retail restaurant devoted primarily to the sale of pizza and related food products. The majority of Papa John's franchises are operated on a delivery and carry-out basis. However, there are a few restaurants that offer dine-in service and there may be additional restaurants with dine-in service developed in the future.  The franchisor also permits development of restaurants in non-traditional venues, such as sports stadiums and food courts. The traditional Papa John's franchise is typically operated in leased space located on or near main thoroughfares. Restaurants operated under the Non-Traditional Program are typically located in sports stadiums or arenas and generally do not offer delivery service.
Financial Assistance: Neither the franchisor nor any agents or affiliates offers, direct financing arrangements. The franchisor’s affiliate, Capital Delivery Ltd., sometimes provides financing for transactions involving the purchase and sale of existing restaurants, but does not offer financing for a franchisee’s initial investment in the franchise.
Training and Assistance: Before the opening of the franchisee’s first restaurant, the franchisor will provide initial training on the operation of the restaurant to the principal operator and the restaurant managers. The principal operator at least one manager must attend training in a certified training restaurant identified by the franchisor, and at Papa John's University in Louisville, Kentucky. The Principal Operator and all restaurant managers may be required to attend additional training that the franchisor determines to be necessary or appropriate. An opening support team made up of franchisor designated employees will be used for training prior to the franchisee’s first two Restaurant openings.  The franchisor also reserves the right to require any of the franchisee’s employees or prospective employees to take part in training and instruction as it deems necessary.
Territory: Franchisees must operate their restaurant at a specific location identified in the Franchise Agreement. Franchisees may not conduct business at any site other than the restaurant, or relocate the restaurant without written consent, which the franchisor will not unreasonably withhold. The franchisor will not, during the term of the Franchise Agreement, locate nor license another to locate a standard Papa John's restaurant within a specified radius of the restaurant, generally 1.5 miles. In densely populated urban areas, the Territory may be reduced to a one-half mile radius. If the franchisee opens a Non-Traditional Restaurant, the Territory for that Restaurant will extend only to the bounds of the site in which the Non-Traditional Restaurant is located.
Term of Agreement and Renewal: The length of the initial franchise term is 10 years. Franchisees may renew for an additional 10-year term, if they meet certain requirements.
Obligations and Restrictions: Franchisees (or their managing shareholder or partner) are not obligated to participate personally in the direct operation of the restaurant, except as described in the FDD. Franchisees must designate an individual to serve as the “Principal Operator” under both the Development Agreement and Franchise Agreement. If franchisees are an individual, they are the “Principal Operator.” If franchisees are a corporation, limited liability company or partnership, the Principal Operator must meet certain qualifications. Franchisees must offer for sale and sell only those products and services the franchisor approves and must make all menu items specified by the franchisor available for sale by carry-out and delivery service from the restaurant, except that no delivery service may be provided from a Non-Traditional restaurant without written consent. Franchisees may not offer for sale any products or provide any services that the franchisor has not approved.

Frequently Asked Questions


1. What is the Guaranteed Income for Life Rollover Variable Annuity IRA?


					It is a variable annuity that is exclusively available for terminating or retiring 401(k) plan participants with John Hancock who have money in the Guaranteed Income for Life option within the plan. The GIFL Rollover Variable Annuity IRA allows you to maintain the benefits of the Guaranteed Income for Life option. By using the GIFL Rollover Variable Annuity to set up a rollover IRA, you will not need to pay any income taxes on your rollover amount until you start taking income or make a withdrawal. 
				
2. What is a variable annuity?

					A variable annuity is a long-term contract between you and an insurance company, designed to help you grow your retirement assets and provide regular withdrawals when you are in retirement. When considering an annuity for use in an IRA or other tax-qualified retirement plan (i.e., 401(k), 403(b), 457), it is important to note that there is no additional tax deferral benefit, since these plans are already afforded tax-deferred status. Thus, an annuity should only be purchased in an IRA or qualified plan if some of the other features of the annuity are of value, such as access to specific portfolio choices, the ability to have guaranteed payments for life and other guaranteed benefits, and you are willing to incur any additional costs associated with the annuity to receive such benefits. See the prospectus for details.
				
3. How does the GIFL Rollover Annuity work?

					The GIFL Rollover Variable Annuity IRA was designed to mirror substantially the Guaranteed Income for Life option in your 401(k) plan. You receive the same benefits of: downside protection, upside potential, and lifetime income. When you roll over to the GIFL Rollover Variable Annuity IRA, your 401(k) account value and Benefit Base are transferred, dollar-for-dollar. You also have access to similar portfolios as those available in the Guaranteed Income for Life option in your 401(k) plan. Each contract anniversary, your Benefit Base will "step up" if your account value is greater than the Benefit Base. The annual fee is 0.35% of the Benefit Base. The fee may increase to a maximum of 0.65% upon step up. Should the annual step up fee increase, there is always the option to decline to step up and retain the previous Benefit Base and fee. The guarantee is backed by the claims-paying ability of the issuer, and does not apply to the investment performance or safety of the underlying portfolios.
				
4. When can I start receiving lifetime income from the GIFL Rollover Variable Annuity IRA?	

					You can begin taking your lifetime income on any contract anniversary after age 59 1/2 so long as you have satisfied the five-year holding period. The five year holding period starts on the date of the first contribution into the Guaranteed Income for Life option in your 401(k) plan. Any remaining holding period will be carried over to the GIFL Rollover Variable Annuity IRA at the time of rollover. Also, the holding period is reset for any additional purchase payments if the additional purchase payments exceed 20% of the Benefit Base at the time of the payment; or, if the additional purchase payments, when combined with all other purchase payments made during the contract year, exceed 20% of the Benefit Base. 
				
5. Can I put more money into the GIFL Rollover Variable Annuity IRA?

					Yes. Contributions can be made to your IRA for each year that you receive compensation and have not reached age 70 1/2. For 2012, the contribution limit is $5,000 ($6,000 if you are age 50 or over). Also, you may make a one-time contribution of existing qualified plan assets (e.g., rollover IRA). The total amount of additional contributions made after the first Contract Anniversary is limited to
$25,000 measured over the life of the contract. Note that you can make contributions after you begin
receiving income. However, this may or may not increase your lifetime income amount. See the
prospectus for more detailed information.
				
6. What is my lifetime income based upon?

					Your lifetime income amount is 5% of your Benefit Base at the time of your first withdrawal (4.5% for you and your spouse, if you so choose). This applies to both the Guaranteed Income for Life option in your plan and the GIFL Rollover Variable Annuity IRA. You must be age 59 1/2 to begin taking lifetime income.
				
7. Can my lifetime income amount be paid out over the joint lives of both me and my spouse?

					Yes, so long as you have not already started to receive your lifetime income amount based only on your own life. Also, your lifetime income amount will be 4.5% of your Benefit Base.
				
8. Can my income ever increase after I begin receiving money?

					Yes. If your underlying investments perform well during retirement and your Benefit Base subsequently steps up, your lifetime income amount will be increased accordingly.
				
9. Can I withdraw money from the GIFL Rollover Variable Annuity IRA? How will that affect my lifetime income amount?

					Yes, you can withdraw your money any time you like without incurring any charges. If you do so prior to taking your lifetime income amount, your Benefit Base will be reduced by the amount of your withdrawal on a pro rata basis. If you withdraw money in excess of your lifetime income amount for any year after your lifetime income amount begins, your income and Benefit Base will also be adjusted on a pro rata basis. Charges may apply to amounts taken in excess of the withdrawal amount available without a withdrawal charge during the surrender charge period. All withdrawals reduce the death benefit and optional benefits. In addition, withdrawals of taxable amounts will be subject to ordinary income tax and, if made prior to age 59�, a 10% IRS penalty tax may apply.
				

10. What is the fee for the Guaranteed Income for Life feature in this rollover product?

					The fee for the Guaranteed Income for Life feature in the GIFL Rollover Variable Annuity IRA is currently 0.35%.  See the prospectus for more detailed information. 
				
11. Are there any other fees associated with the product?

					Yes.  The GIFL Rollover Variable Annuity IRA also includes asset-based charges for daily administration, 0.15%, and mortality and expenses, 0.20%  When these fees are combined with the fee for Guaranteed Income for Life and the underlying portfolio expenses, the result is a similar, but not identical, cost structure as the Guaranteed Income for Life option in your plan.
				
12. Where can I get more information about the GIFL Rollover Variable Annuity IRA?

					To view, download, or order a prospectus, including fees, expenses, and investment 
                    options, call 1-888-695-4472 or contact your plans financial representative.

A GOOD PRODUCT IS A STAR Celebrities: Their fees, pluses and minuses of using them




By: Roger Pe - @inquirerdotnet
 Philippine Daily Inquirer / 01:51 AM September 07, 2012







Sporting greats. Movie stars. Intellectual achievers. Beauty queens. Entertainers, and other famous personalities—when they’re hot, they’re hot and who else could be chasing them?
Brands that want to have a measure of the celebrities’ glow to help them get into people’s homes and consciousness, and hopefully their wallets.
Celebrities are like honeycombs, “pinuputakte” (swarmed by bees), in Pinoy street language, when they step into a mall.
ADVERTISEMENT






Fans and curious onlookers gravitate toward them, creating a commotion, and in some cases, pandemonium.
Smart advertisers strike while the iron is hot, knocking on their doors, cashing in on their popularity.
As these demi-gods turn into big crowd magnets and everyone is going gaga over them, companies are scrambling to catch a proverbial star.
Based on AC Nielsen’s latest study covering from January to June 11 last year, the Top 5 celebrity endorsers in the Philippines are:
1. Kris Aquino (10 endorsements)
2. John Lloyd Cruz (8 endorsements)
3. Carmina Villaroel, Zoren Legaspi, Ryan Agoncillo, Sarah Geronimo and Vic Sotto (7 endorsements)
4. Anne Curtis, Marie Lozano, Michael V and Sharon Cuneta (6 endorsements)
ADVERTISEMENT



5. Judy Ann Santos and Kim Chiu (5 endorsements)
Last April, Rappler (an online news portal) published BIR’s top celebrity taxpayers for the year 2010 as follows:
1. Kris Aquino: P32.3 million income tax based on P101.08 million income
2. Sarah Geronimo: P14.8 million tax based on P46.5 million income
3. Piolo Pascual: P13.05 million income tax based on P40.9 million income
4. Marian Rivera: P11.89 million income tax based on P37.27 million income
5. John Lloyd Cruz: P10.93 million income tax based on P34.25 million income
Filipino and global boxing icon Manny Pacquiao is in a league of his own.
For the first time last year, Pacman barged into Forbes’ yearly list of the 20 highest-paid celebrities, ranking 16th with $67 million in earnings in spite of his controversial loss to Timothy Bradley.
Manny Pacquiao’s global endorsements include Nike, Technomarine, Hewlett-Packard and Hennessy, making him ahead of Dr. Phil McGraw ($64 million), business mogul Donald Trump ($63 million), Ryan Seacrest ($59 million), and Britney Spears and Tiger Woods (both with $58 million).
So you’ve signed a big celebrity as endorser because your brand isn’t moving up in the sales charts, and your bottom line is nearing rock bottom.
Is a celebrity the last resort?
Before spending your precious money down the drain, ask yourself if you did your homework.
Do you have a good strategy? Are you delivering the right message? How’s your advertising? Does it stand out from the media clutter? Or worst, are you selling a turkey?
There’s more to using glamour, prestige, and fame lent by celebrities to your advertising than meets the eye.
Your product, the celebrity
“The product, the product, the product.” Many advertising greats have repeatedly said this line.
Everything boils down to a good product, one that delivers what it says, one that makes the competition cringe with envy and, in the long run, has no option but to improve his.
A great product is a celebrity. It will sell on its own merits. Its performance is its own testimonial. Extremely satisfied consumers are its free endorsers.
Advertising a bad product, even if endorsed by Superman or the sexiest girl or man in the world, will not do the trick. It will only hasten its demise. People will eventually know that, by word of mouth, it is not good.
A good product with a celebrity endorser won’t do just as much either.
Remember what your marketing mentors taught you before? Learn from consumers, the very people who buy and use your product. Know what goes on their minds.
Probe, ask, talk, be one of them. What precious insights have you picked from being one of them?
Many marketers oftentimes fall into this trap: Using celebrity endorsers mouthing manufactured words blindly.
Letting endorsers memorize lines like robots without the heart and soul of a consumer is a waste of time and money. Today’s consumers are intelligent, they’ll know.
Ad campaigns that portray celebrities as consumers of the brand they are advertising tend to be more credible.
A commercial that uses a celebrity as part of the story to dramatize a brand’s unique selling proposition leaves a good impression. It elicits audience empathy.
An ad that makes a celebrity just pose and smile in front of camera is cold and invites sarcasm. People tend to say, “So?”
Advertising that makes celebrities as mere decorations or props make people turn to the next page of a newspaper or change TV channels.
The worst thing that could happen is, people remember the celebrities, not the brand.
Commercials using celebrities with a sense of purpose are best remembered and talked about.
When celebrities are depicted like normal human beings, people can always relate.
So the next time you are going to do an ad using a celebrity, review your idea.
Consumerizing a celebrity attracts throngs of consumers. Scrutinize if he/she is going to be relevant to the story. Want to connect meaningfully to your audience? Attach celebrities to the concept—not coldly detached from consumers’ hearts and minds.
Choosing a celebrity
Now that you have a product that will be swarmed by “bees” and in a situation that you have to use a celebrity, some tips to consider:
Do research on the celebrity’s likability.
Just because someone is popular, pretty or good-looking doesn’t mean she or he will fit the role.
You may find that there are skeletons rattling in the celebrity’s closet, things that could hurt your brand image later on.
Marketing guru Willy Arcilla, who has worked around the region and the greater China market handling a number of multinational brands, says:
“Choose someone who best personifies your brand’s imagery, character and values, someone who can dramatize your brand’s rational and emotional benefits, and most of all, someone who genuinely loves your brand, uses your product or patronizes your service because credibility is key.”
“It is like choosing a suit for your wedding day, says Raymund Sison, BBDO-Guerrero copywriter.
“It should fit perfectly or a disaster totally. The celebrity’s image should be right for the brand personality in the same manner as the role of the brand should be appropriate to the endorser’s lifestyle,” he says.
Sison also tells us that the brand ambassador should likewise appeal to the market and the market should be able to identify with the celebrity.
Veteran TV commercial director Sockie Fernandez, who has done many celebrity endorser ads, says that aside from popularity, one should “choose a celebrity that reflects the character and values of the brand you are selling.”
“Credibility is the most important thing. After all, your brand’s credibility is at stake. Does the product match the celebrity’s lifestyle? There should be truth in advertising,” says TV commercial producer Desiree Pe-Beasley.
Rolly Halagao, one of advertising’s most in-demand casting directors, says: “Choose your celebrity endorser not only on popularity but also on credibility, adaptability and willingness to endorse your brand.”
Halagao explains: “A celebrity must be a hot item to ignite buzz among your target. The willingness to do the project is a big factor because you may have an endorser who’ll just do it for the money.”
Upside of using celebrities
A brand looks real when a celebrity endorses it. It shows that it exists.
People are generally impressionable and would readily identify with the brands celebrities endorse.
“Many people believe that if they buy what celebrities are endorsing, they, too, can be just like them and have a piece of that ‘better’ life,” says Arcilla.
If your celebrity prospect can fill the Smart Araneta Coliseum or The Arena near the Mall of Asia without spending too much on promotional gimmicks, he or she could be a brand winner.
Sixteen-year-old Gabby Douglas was everyone’s darling after she became the first Afro-American to win an Olympic gymnastics gold. Procter & Gamble took advantage and offered her with multimillion-dollar endorsement deals. So did Kellogg’s.
Olympic champions Usain Bolt, Jessica Ennis, Mo Farrah are now enjoying fat celebrity endorsement fees because of their vastly immense pulling power.
The bigger risk
What happens when endorsers figure in scandals and not so palatable situations?
When the endorser is ‘tainted’ the chain reaction follows.
After winning eight gold medals at the Beijing Olympics, Michael Phelps earned numerous endorsement contracts. When photos of him surfaced on the net holding a marijuana pipe, AT&T cancelled his endorsement deals.
Tiger Woods had juicy contracts with Nike until he got into a smoldering domestic scandal. Relentless bad press rocked his otherwise wholesome persona affecting his image and Nike’s as well.
Woods lost major endorsement deals with Gillette, Gatorade and Tag Heuer after he was found to have been unfaithful to his wife.
Accenture also severed all ties with him, confirming he was “no longer the right representative.”
A British actress told the world she rarely wears make-up while at the same time endorsing a cosmetics brand.
In 1988, actor Alan Alda was IBM spokesman but was caught buying a Toshiba.
Anheuser-Busch, Oakley and Nike announced, however, that it was sticking with Lance Armstrong despite the doping allegations hurled on the cyclist.
In a statement, Oakley said: “It supports athletes who respect and honor the ethics of sports until proven otherwise.”
But even with these brands standing by Armstrong, Ad Age reported: “His popularity is going on a spiral downhill.”
So thinking of using an endorser? The payoffs are great, the risks even greater, but the greatest thing to do is invest on your product first and the rest, including celebrities, will follow.
