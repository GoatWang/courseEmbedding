Buse   Vice President, Finance and Controller   (Principal Accounting Officer and an Authorized Officer)Exhibit Index   1.01 Conflict Minerals Report as required by Items 1.01 and 1.02 of this Form 
Exhibit 1.01Rockwell Collins, Inc.Conflict Minerals ReportFor The Year Ended December 31, 20141.    OverviewThis report (the "Report"), for the calendar year ended December 31, 2014, has been prepared by Rockwell Collins (herein after referred to as "Rockwell Collins," the "Company," "we," "us," or "our") pursuant to Rule 13p-1 (the Rule) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Rule was adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to implement reporting and disclosure requirements related to conflict minerals as directed by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act). The Rule imposes certain reporting obligations on SEC registrants whose manufactured products may potentially contain conflict minerals which are necessary to the functionality or production of their products that are sourced from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the surrounding countries, (hereinafter referred to as the "Covered Countries"). Conflict Minerals are defined as cassiterite, columbite-tantalite, gold, wolframite and their derivatives, which are limited to tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold (3TG).In accordance with the Rule, the information in this Report includes the activities of all majority-owned subsidiaries and entities that are required to be consolidated under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Per the Rule, acquisitions are required to be included in the Company’s first filing that occurs no more than eight months after the acquisition date. Furthermore, any businesses that were divested during the reporting period were included in our procedures through the transaction disposition date.1.1    Our ProductsRockwell Collins is a leader in the design, production and support of communication and aviation electronics for commercial and military customers worldwide. The integrated system solutions and products we provide to our served markets are oriented around a set of core competencies: communications, navigation, automated flight control, displays/surveillance, simulation and training, integrated electronics and information management systems. For further information on our Company or products, please visit www.rockwellcollins.com.1.2    The Company’s Conflict Minerals PolicyThe Company is committed to ensuring that we uphold fundamental human rights and believe that all human beings around the world should be treated with dignity, fairness and respect. It is our Company's intention to obtain products and services only from suppliers who demonstrate a serious commitment to the health and safety of their workers, and operate in compliance with human rights laws. For additional information about our commitment to responsible sourcing and other human rights, see our Standards of Business Conduct (SBC) at https://www.rockwellcollins.com/Our_Company/Ethics/Our_Standards.aspx.Our  Conflict Minerals Position Statement is publicly available on our website at http://www.rockwellcollins.com/Our_Company/Corporate_Responsibility/Material_Declarations.aspx.1.3    Reasonable Country of Origin Inquiry (RCOI)Our supply chain is complex and there are multiple tiers between the Company and the mine. Rockwell Collins is considered a downstream supplier or a “component product manufacturer” and does not procure metals directly from the mines or smelters.  Thus, the Company relied on our direct suppliers to provide information on the origin of the conflict minerals contained in components and materials supplied to us, including sources of 3TG within their products. For the current reporting period, the Company surveyed direct suppliers who comprised the majority of our component spend during calendar 2014.2.     Design of Company’s Due Diligence FrameworkThe due diligence measures captured in the Company’s Conflict Minerals Procedure, have been designed in conformance with the internationally recognized framework: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in the publication OECD (2013) Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas: Second Edition, OECD Publishing and the related Supplements for 3TG that can be found at http://www.oecd.org/investment/mne/mining.htm. The five steps from the OECD Due Diligence Guidance document are listed below:•Step 1: Establish Strong Company Management Systems•Step 2: Identify and Assess Risk in the Supply Chain•Step 3: Design and Implement a Strategy to Respond to Identified Risks•Step 4: Carry Out Independent Third-Party Audit of Smelter/Refiner’s Due Diligence Practices•Step 5: Report Annually on Supply Chain Due Diligence2.1     Step 1: Establish Strong Company Management Systems Rockwell has established a management system to determine the source and chain of custody of 3TG in our supply chain. Additionally our company has an established Conflict Minerals Team, which oversees the due diligence process and includes representatives from Finance, Legal, Manufacturing, and Supply Chain. We have also set expectations and procedures around our sourcing of 3TG as described below.•Conflict Minerals ProcedureWe have developed an internal Conflict Mineral Procedure that defines the process requirements to comply with the Rule. •Supplier EngagementThroughout the last calendar year, we have taken measures to communicate the requirements of the rule and our expectations for compliance with our supply base. In addition, we maintain an electronic portal which suppliers can use to access resources related to 3TG, including FAQs from the Aerospace Industries Association’s (AIA) Conflict Minerals Working Group (CMWG) and the SEC. •Grievance MechanismRockwell Collins has an established Ombsudsman hotline, as part of our Standards of Business Conduct Policy, which may be used by employees or outside parties to report violations of our policies and procedures.  2.2     Step 2: Identify and Assess Risk in the Supply ChainBecause of our size, the complexity of our products, and the depth, breadth, and constant evolution of our supply chain, it is difficult to identify actors upstream from our direct suppliers. We rely on these suppliers, whose components contain 3TG, to provide us with information about the source of conflict minerals contained in the supplied components. Our direct suppliers are similarly reliant upon information provided by their suppliers. Many of the purchase contracts with our suppliers are multi-year contracts and therefore we may have difficulty in imposing new contract terms and flow-down requirements. As we enter into new contracts, or renew our existing contracts, we are adding a clause to require suppliers to provide information about their source of 3TG and smelters. In the meantime, as described below, we are working with selected suppliers to ensure they provide the 3TG sourcing information.We requested that all identified suppliers provide information to us regarding 3TG and smelters using the template developed by Conflict Free Sourcing Initiative (CFSI) known as the Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (the Template). The Template was developed to facilitate disclosure and communication of information regarding smelters and refiners that provide material to a manufacturer’s supply chain. It includes questions regarding a direct supplier’s conflict free policy, its due diligence process and information about its supply chain such as the names and locations of smelters and refiners as well as the origin of 3TG used by those facilities. We have determined that requesting our identified suppliers to complete the Template represents our reasonable best efforts to determine the mines or locations of origin of 3TG in our supply chain. We have reached this conclusion in part as a result of our participation in the CFSI.2.3     Step 3: Design and Implement a Strategy to Respond to Identified Risks Although we do not have a direct relationship with 3TG smelters and refiners, we do participate in industry-wide 3TG initiatives within the Aerospace & Defense and Electronics sectors. The purpose of our participation within these industry groups is to enable us to obtain information from upstream entities within the supply chain as well as develop a standardized procedure for  identifying socially responsible smelters and refiners. The following is a list of the specific industry initiatives in which we participate:•Aerospace Industries Association (AIA) Conflict Minerals Working Group•CFSI (Conflict Free Sourcing Initiative) which includes the CFSP (Conflict Free Smelter Program)•IPC Conflict Minerals Due Diligence Committee•IPC Conflict Minerals Data Exchange Task GroupAs part of our normal operating procedures, should we learn of smelters in our supply chain who are sourcing from the Covered Countries, and are not on the CFSP lists or active in the CFSP, we engage the direct supplier and perform further due diligence.2.4     Step 4: Carry out Independent Third-Party Audit of Smelter/Refiner’s Due Diligence PracticesWe do not have a direct relationship with 3TG smelters or refiners and therefore do not perform direct audits of these entities. However, we do support audits conducted by third parties through our participation in a number of industry-wide initiatives as described in Section 2.3 above.2.5     Step 5: Report Annually on Supply Chain Due DiligenceThis Conflict Minerals Report constitutes our annual report on our 3TG due diligence which is filed with the SEC and is available on our Company website http://www.rockwellcollins.com under the SEC filings link on our Investor Relations page.3.     Due Diligence PerformedThis section addresses the actions that the Company took to exercise due diligence on source and chain of custody of 3TG within the supply chain.3.1    Survey ResponsesAt the conclusion of the supplier survey effort, the Company reviewed the supplier survey responses against criteria developed to determine which suppliers required further engagement. These criteria included incomplete responses as well as inconsistencies within the data reported in the Template. From this analysis, the Company identified four categories that required additional follow-up:•Suppliers That Reported They Source 3TG From The Covered Countries•Suppliers That Reported Their Products Did Not Contain Any 3TG•Suppliers That Either Provided Incomplete Responses Or Did Not Respond At All •Suppliers That Did Not Capture / Document Any Smelter Information3.1.1    Suppliers That Reported They Source 3TG From The Covered CountriesThrough the analysis of survey responses, we identified suppliers that reported they have sourced 3TG from the Covered Countries.  Upon further investigation, through phone and email contact with the suppliers, we understood that the components supplied to us may contain 3TG from conflict free smelters. Rockwell Collins performed due diligence and determined that those suppliers fell into one of the following categories: i) supplier used a CFSI compliant smelter or ii) chain of custody could not be performed due to insufficient information regarding the supply chain of the products provided by the supplier. 3.1.2    Suppliers That Reported Their Products Did Not Contain Any 3TGThrough the analysis of survey responses, we identified suppliers that responded stating their products did not contain any 3TG substances, but that Rockwell Collins had reason to believe such responses may be inconsistent with our knowledge of their products. We followed up with these suppliers, providing information and education on where the 3TG could be located in their products, such as metal alloying elements, plating / surface finishes, contained within the solder, and also within electrical components themselves.  3.1.3    Suppliers Providing Either Incomplete Or No ResponsesThrough the analysis of survey responses, we identified suppliers that either provided an incomplete response to our survey request or they did not respond at all. In addition to the communications that were sent to suppliers during the request of information from our supply base, these suppliers received an additional communication to educate and increase the knowledge of the suppliers regarding the Rule.3.1.4    Suppliers That Did Not Capture / Document Any Smelter InformationThrough the analysis of survey responses, we identified suppliers that either: i) did not provide smelter information; or ii) did not request smelter information from upstream suppliers. We followed up with these suppliers, providing information and education on the importance of requesting smelter information reminding them that smelters are in the best position to ensure the supplier of minerals via conflict free locations. We encouraged suppliers to begin tracking information on smelters so that the collective supply chain can have comprehensive viable information relating to the chain of custody on Conflict Minerals.4.0    Efforts To Determine Mine or Location of OriginAs stated in the Rule, which describes the content of the Conflict Minerals Report, “it is very difficult, if not impossible, to trace Conflict Minerals to their mine or other location of origin” after the smelting (tin, tantalum, tungsten) or refining (gold) processes.  The smelters and refiners are consolidating points for raw ore and are in the best position in the total supply chain to know the origin of the ores. As the Company does not purchase raw ore or unrefined 3TG, our focus was to gain smelter information from industry initiatives and our supply base.To gain insight into the country of origin, chain of custody and conflict status of our 3TGs, we relied primarily on the findings of the CFSP. Established by members of the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (“EICC”) and the Global e-Sustainability Initiative (“GeSI”), CFSP is a voluntary program in which an independent third party evaluates smelters’ and refiners’ procurement and inventory practices and determines, as of the date of evaluation, whether the smelter or refiner has demonstrated that all the materials it processed originated from conflict free sources. Even after CFSP validation, it was difficult for the Company to identify valid smelters and refiners directly used in our supply chain as a majority of the information that was provided from our supply chain was at a company level rather than at a product level, which is required by the Rule. Listed below are the smelters and refiners we believe to be potentially in our supply chain for 2014. The presence of a smelter or refiner on the list does not indicate that Rockwell Collins products necessarily contained 3TGs processed by that smelter or refiner. As our engagement with the supply chain evolves, our list of smelters may change to reflect improvements in the quality of information provided to us. The location information and compliance status is as reported by the CFSP as of May 18, 2015. Metal Smelter Reference List Smelter Country CFSP Compliance StatusGold Aida Chemical Industries Co.

        Beautiful bootie
This is one of the most comfortable pairs of shoes I own, and I own many.

I bought them in Chianti and love them.  The haircalf is certainly different from anything I have had before.  These are stylish and clearly stand out from the rest of the world.  I get complements whenever I wear them.

If you want to make a statement, buy these shoes!  They go with nearly everything.

        Exceptional!
I bought these booties in the chianti color to have something completely different from anything in my closet.  They go with almost anything that you would wear with black.  They are absolutely gorgeous and comfortable for all day.  Wear them with jeans, slacks, or dresses for an outstanding statement!

        Stylish
This is a very stylish bootie with the side buckle and rivets. And the Chianti color is rich and different. Pairs well with skinny jeans and slacks. The calf circumference was a little big for me because I have slim ankles.

        Definitely runs small
I bought the Chianti color in a size 7.5. I love the shoe, but with the pointy toe, it is a bit snug. If you think you might want to wear socks with this, you might need to go up a half size. I have narrow feet and ankles, and I am consistently a size 7.5 in DJP shoes, so I was surprised by this fit.

        Beautiful boot but very tight!
Tia boot is very tight over the arches, I wish I would have ordered a half to full size up just to get them on and not be so tight! I'm going to keep them because they are so beautiful and as usual for pliner, amazing quality!

        Very cool but too wide for me
I have a narrow foot but found these especially wide. Otherwise they are very well designed and I love them. I do wish Pliner made more narrows. I'd need to add on a closet !

Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"

From the Press
Gizmodo.com
"It found my photos on Flickr, my Amazon wishlist, my public Foursquare records, Vimeo, Picassa, and Stumbleupon accounts. It grabbed approximately twelve bajillion photos of me (with many, many false positives) and even more web links."


From the Press
U.S. News & World Report
"BeenVerified easily and inexpensively provides access to public records information through its website and several mobile phone applications. No longer are large corporations the only ones who can afford background checks."
