NASHVILLE, Tenn., July  27, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. ("CapStar") (NASDAQ:CSTR) reported a net loss of $3.34 million, or $0.26 per share on a fully diluted basis, for the three months ended June 30, 2017, compared to net income of $2.48 million, or $0.23 per share on a fully diluted basis, for the three months ended June 30, 2016.  The net loss for the quarter was primarily attributable to the charge off and costs associated with one borrowing relationship, which impacted pretax earnings by $9.7 million.
"CapStar's organic growth remains strong," said Claire W. Tucker, CapStar's president and chief executive officer.  "Comparing performance in the second quarter of 2017 to the same period in 2016, pre-tax pre-provision income increased 31% to $5.0 million from $3.8 million.  Our otherwise strong quarterly performance was overshadowed by deterioration in one non-performing relationship that we discussed previously in connection with our first quarter results, which led to a charge off of the relationship's existing loan balance.  We believe that our existing risk management processes and credit infrastructure provide a solid framework for sound asset quality.  We are consistently focused on delivering strong operating and financial results, and we remain committed to achieving our stated goal of a 1% ROAA by the end of 2018."
Soundness

The allowance for loan losses represented 1.25% of total loans at June 30, 2017 compared to 1.18% at June 30, 2016. 
Non-performing assets as a percentage of total loans and other real estate owned was 0.32% at June 30, 2017 compared to 0.66% at June 30, 2016. 
Annualized net charge-offs totaled 4.38% for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to 0.01% for the same period in 2016.   
The total risk based capital ratio increased to 11.51% at June 30, 2017 compared to 10.67% at June 30, 2016.    

Profitability

Return on average assets ("ROAA") for the three months ended June 30, 2017 was -0.96% compared to 0.80% for the same period in 2016.   
Return on average equity ("ROAE") for the three months ended June 30, 2017 was -9.39% compared to 8.85% for the same period in 2016.   
The net interest margin ("NIM") for the three months ended June 30, 2017 was 3.15% compared to 3.09% for the same period in 2016.   
The efficiency ratio for the three months ended June 30, 2017 was 62.1% compared to 67.6% for the same period in 2016. 

"While we are disappointed with the credit impact on our bottom-line performance, there are several positives from our quarterly performance," said Rob Anderson, chief financial officer and chief administrative officer of CapStar.  "Our net interest margin expanded 6 basis points, loan growth was up 18%, DDA & NOW deposits increased 14%, and noninterest income benefited from loan sales in our Tri-Net line of business.  Absent the credit charges, the operating performance of the company met our internal expectations for the quarter."
Growth

Average total assets for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 increased 11.7%, to $1.39 billion, compared to $1.25 billion for the same period in 2016. 
Average gross loans for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 increased 17.7%, to $1.03 billion, compared to $874.0 million for the same period in 2016. 
Average total deposits for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 increased 1.7%, to $1.11 billion, compared to $1.09 billion for the same period in 2016.

Forward-Looking Statements
Certain statements in this earnings release are forward-looking statements that reflect CapStar's current views with respect to, among other things, future events and CapStar's financial and operational performance. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as "may," "should," "could," "predict," "potential," "believe," "will likely result," "expect," "continue," "will," "anticipate," "seek," "aspire," "achieve," "estimate," "intend," "plan," "project," "projection," "forecast," "roadmap," "goal," "target," "would," and "outlook," or the negative version of those words or other comparable words of a future or forward-looking nature. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about CapStar's industry, management's beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond CapStar's control. The inclusion of these forward-looking statements should not be regarded as a representation by CapStar or any other person that such expectations, estimates and projections will be achieved. Accordingly, CapStar cautions you that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Although CapStar believes that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date made, actual results may prove to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. There are or will be important factors that could cause CapStar's actual results to differ materially from those indicated in these forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, any factors identified in this earnings release as well as those factors that are detailed from time to time in CapStar's periodic and current reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including those factors included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 under the headings "Item 1A. Risk Factors" and "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements" and in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K.  If one or more events related to these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if CapStar's underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this earnings release, and CapStar does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as required by law. New risks and uncertainties may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for CapStar to predict their occurrence or how they will affect CapStar.
Non-GAAP Disclaimer 
This earnings release includes the following financial measure that was prepared other than in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("non-GAAP financial measure"): pre-tax, pre-provision income. This non-GAAP financial measure (i) provides useful information to management and investors that is supplementary to CapStar's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows computed in accordance with GAAP, (ii) enables a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting CapStar's business, and (iii) allows investors to evaluate CapStar's performance in a manner similar to management, the financial services industry, bank stock analysts and bank regulators; however, CapStar acknowledges that this non-GAAP financial measure has a number of limitations.  As such, you should not view this non-GAAP financial measure as a substitute for results determined in accordance with GAAP, and it is not necessarily comparable to non-GAAP financial measures that other companies use.  See below for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

Legendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful. One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100.

We estimate that the net proceeds to us from the sale of our common stock in
this offering will be $16.6 million, (or $22.0 million if the underwriters
exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares of common stock from
us), after deducting the estimated underwriting discount and offering expenses.

We intend to use the net proceeds to us from this offering, along with available
cash, for general corporate purposes, which may include the support of our
balance sheet growth, the acquisition of other banks or financial institutions
or other complementary businesses to the extent such opportunities arise, and
the maintenance of our capital and liquidity ratios, and the ratios of our bank,
at acceptable levels. We have not specifically allocated the amount of net
proceeds to us that will be used for these purposes, and our management will
have broad discretion over how these proceeds are used.

We plan to invest these proceeds in short term investments until needed for the
uses described above.

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of our common stock by the
selling shareholders.


The financial services industry is highly competitive. We compete for loans,
deposits, and financial services in our market area. We compete directly with
other bank and nonbank institutions located within our market area,
Internet-based banks, out-of-market banks, and bank holding companies that
advertise in or otherwise serve our market area, along with money market and
mutual funds, brokerage houses, mortgage companies, and insurance companies or
other commercial entities that offer financial services products. Competition
involves efforts to retain current clients, obtain new loans and deposits,
increase the scope and type of services offered, and offer competitive interest
rates paid on deposits and charged on loans. Many of our competitors enjoy
competitive advantages, including greater financial resources, a wider
geographic presence, more accessible branch office locations, the ability to
offer additional services, more favorable pricing alternatives, and lower
origination and operating costs. Some of our competitors have been in business
for a long time and have an established client base and name recognition. We
believe that our experienced leadership, efficient and scalable operating model,
personalized service and emphasis on attracting core deposits from our other
product offerings enable us to effectively compete in the communities in which
we operate.


Company Description
We are CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc., a bank holding company headquartered in
Nashville, Tennessee, and we operate primarily through our wholly owned
subsidiary, CapStar Bank, a Tennessee-chartered state bank. We are a commercial
bank that seeks to establish and maintain comprehensive


 relationships with our
clients by delivering customized and creative banking solutions and superior
client service. Our products and services include (i) commercial and industrial
loans to small and medium sized businesses, with a particular focus on
businesses operating in the healthcare industry, (ii) commercial real estate
loans, (iii) private banking and wealth management services for the owners and
operators of our business clients and other high net worth individuals and (iv)
correspondent banking services to meet the needs of Tennessee’s smaller
community banks. Our operations are presently concentrated in demographically
attractive and fast-growing counties in the Nashville MSA. As of June 30, 2016,
on a consolidated basis, we had total assets of $1.3 billion, total deposits of
$1.1 billion, total net loans of $877.0 million, and shareholders’ equity of
$114.3 million.
---

CapStar Bank was incorporated in the State of Tennessee in 2007.

The bank successfully completed its initial and only capital issuance in 2008,
raising approximately $88.0 million in shareholders’ equity, which represented
and continues to be the largest initial capitalization in Tennessee history for
a de novo state-chartered bank. During the economic recession and bank liquidity
crisis that soon followed, the bank did not accept government funds from the
Troubled Asset Relief Program or the Small Business Lending Fund, nor did it
need to supplement its capital base to maintain well-capitalized status by
issuing any form of additional capital.

The bank acquired a state charter in 2008 which was accomplished through a de
novo application with the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions, or the
TDFI, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. Upon approval of its charter,
CapStar Bank opened for business to the public on July 14, 2008. Since then, the
bank has opened two additional branches in the Nashville MSA. In July 2012, the
bank completed the acquisition of American Security which, at the date of
acquisition, operated two branch locations and approximately $160 million in
assets. In February 2014, the bank completed the acquisition of Farmington.

We were incorporated on December 1, 2015, and, on February 5, 2016, we completed
the share exchange with CapStar Bank’s shareholders that resulted in CapStar
Bank becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. As a result of the share
exchange, all of our operations are currently conducted through CapStar Bank.

We currently have seven locations, five of which are retail bank branches and
two of which are mortgage origination offices.

Our principal executive offices are located at 201 4th Avenue North, Suite 950,
Nashville, Tennessee 37219, and our telephone number is (615) 732-6400. We also
maintain an Internet site at www.capstarbank.com.

IPO Preview: CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. - CapStar Financial Holdings (NASDAQ:CSTR) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»IPO Preview: CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc.Sep.20.16 | About: CapStar Financial (CSTR) Don Dion Long/short equity, special situations, momentum, event-drivenMarketplaceIPO InsightsSummaryCapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. filed its S-1/A with the Securities and Exchange Commission announcing its IPO that is scheduled for Thursday, Sept. 22, 2016.The company estimates net proceeds of $17.1 million, (or $22.7 million if underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares of common stock), from this offering.The bank has enjoyed a CAGR of 38.2 percent in its net income between Dec. 31, 2011 and Dec. 31, 2015.Recent financial IPOs have done well, and we expect this trend to continue with CSTR. We recommend that investors consider an allocation during its IPO. CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSTR) filed its S-1/A with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Sept. 14, 2016, announcing its upcoming initial public offering. The company estimated net proceeds of $22.7 million, assuming underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares, through its IPO on Sept. 22, 2016. It is offering 2,585,500 shares, 1,290,213 of which will come from selling shareholders. This represents approximately 49.9 percent of shares from company insiders. CapStar Financial also has an additional 387,750 shares that are over-allotted and that the underwriters can purchase if they choose to do so. The company's shares have a price range of $14.50 to $16.50. Upon completion on this offering, Capstar Financial will have 10,795,870 shares of common stock outstanding. This number assumes underwriters do not exercise their over-allotment option and excludes the shares that would be outstanding through the conversion of stock options. Assuming CapStar prices at the midpoint of its range, the company would have a market capitalization of $167.34 million. Business summary Founded in 2007, CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. is a bank holding company that is headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee. The company's primary operation is its subsidiary CapStar Bank. It is a commercial bank that is concentrated in locations in the greater metropolitan service area of Nashville. The bank has seven locations, five of which are retail bank branches, and two of which are mortgage origination offices. The company reports that it had total assets of $1.3 billion as of June 30, 2016. It also reported that it had $1.1 billion in deposits, net loans totaling $887 million, and shareholders' equity of $114.3 million, as of that date. Executive management overview Claire W. Tucker is the chief executive officer, president and director of CapStar Financial Holdings. Before beginning her position in those roles, Ms. Tucker previously served as the CEO and president of CapStar Bank. Ms. Tucker has 32 years of experience in business banking. She holds a Bachelor of Science from Tennessee Wesleyan University and a Master of Business Administration from the University of Tennessee. The chief administrative officer and chief financial officer of CapStar Financial Holdings, Robert Anderson also serves as the CFO and chief administrative officer of CapStar Bank. He has more than 20 years of executive-level experience in the finance industry. Mr. Anderson holds both a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Science from The Ohio State University and has a Master of Business Administration from Pepperdine University. Financial highlights and risks Between December 31, 2011, and June 30, 2016, CapStar Financial Holdings reported that it enjoyed compound annual growth rates (CAGR) of 14.5 percent for its assets and total deposits and 19.1 percent for its total loans. Between December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2015, the company reports that it generated a CAGR of 38.2 percent for its net income. In 2015, net interest income was $34.8 million, a 7.3 percent increase from the previous year and net income was $7.6 million, an increase of 51.4 percent from the previous year. During the same time, return on average assets and return on average equity was 0.66% and 7.08% respectively. The bank anticipates growth through capturing market share and growing its customer base in the Nashville MSA. It also looks to expand through strategic acquisitions and to diversify its revenue sources by expanding its mortgage and wealth management lines. The company anticipates an increase of its core deposits and additional revenue through cross-sales of products to existing customers. 

 (CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. S-1/A Form) The company identifies several risk factors, including the volatility of the financial markets, potential damage due to weakened economic conditions and concerns about the federal fiscal policy-making process. The bank also reports that 86 percent of its loans are held by people and businesses in the Nashville MSA, so its operations are highly concentrated in that market. Finally, it reports that the financial and banking industry is very competitive, and the competition from larger banks and online banking platforms could negatively impact its profitability. Industry peers The financial services industry is highly competitive and CapStar's competitors include other regional banks, online banking platforms, large banks with long histories and name recognition and other lenders. Its IPO closely follows that of FB Financial (Pending:FBK), another Tennessee Bank, which went public just last week (9.15). FBK generated a 9.2 percent return on its first day of trading. Assuming CapStar prices at the midpoint of its range, and using earnings as of year-end 2015, CSTR's P/E ratio of 21.23 is in line with similar Tennessee banks, such as Pinnacle Financial Partners (20.45), Commerce Union Bancshares Inc. (20.09), and Capital Bank Financial Corp. (24.45). Conclusion Although CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. is a relatively young bank, in its short history, it has grown to be the sixth-largest in Nashville. The bank has shown excellent CAGRs and has a sound plan for further growth. In addition, the strength of the Tennessee economy is another positive indicator for this bank. Nashville has one of the lowest unemployment rates among metropolitan areas, and since July 2015, more than 100 companies have announced plans to relocate to, or expand within, Nashville and the surrounding area. Of the 34 IPOs in the second quarter of 2016, first day returns average 9.4% and 71% of deals ended June above their offer price. Recent financial IPOs have done particularly well. CapStar is well positioned to continue this trend and we recommend that investors consider purchasing shares of CapStar during its IPO.

CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. Announces Second Quarter 2017 Results






GlobeNewswire



Jul 27, 2017 5:38 PM EDT













 




























































 NASHVILLE, Tenn., July 27, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. ("CapStar") (NASDAQ:CSTR) reported a net loss of $3.34 million, or $0.26 per share on a fully diluted basis, for the three months ended June 30, 2017, compared to net income of $2.48 million, or $0.23 per share on a fully diluted basis, for the three months ended June 30, 2016.  The net loss for the quarter was primarily attributable to the charge off and costs associated with one borrowing relationship, which impacted pretax earnings by $9.7 million. "CapStar's organic growth remains strong," said Claire W. Tucker, CapStar's president and chief executive officer.  "Comparing performance in the second quarter of 2017 to the same period in 2016, pre-tax pre-provision income increased 31% to $5.0 million from $3.8 million.  Our otherwise strong quarterly performance was overshadowed by deterioration in one non-performing relationship that we discussed previously in connection with our first quarter results, which led to a charge off of the relationship's existing loan balance.  We believe that our existing risk management processes and credit infrastructure provide a solid framework for sound asset quality.  We are consistently focused on delivering strong operating and financial results, and we remain committed to achieving our stated goal of a 1% ROAA by the end of 2018."  Soundness   The allowance for loan losses represented 1.25% of total loans at June 30, 2017 compared to 1.18% at June 30, 2016.  Non-performing assets as a percentage of total loans and other real estate owned was 0.32% at June 30, 2017 compared to 0.66% at June 30, 2016.  Annualized net charge-offs totaled 4.38% for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to 0.01% for the same period in 2016.    The total risk based capital ratio increased to 11.51% at June 30, 2017 compared to 10.67% at June 30, 2016.       Profitability  Return on average assets ("ROAA") for the three months ended June 30, 2017 was -0.96% compared to 0.80% for the same period in 2016.    Return on average equity ("ROAE") for the three months ended June 30, 2017 was -9.39% compared to 8.85% for the same period in 2016.    The net interest margin ("NIM") for the three months ended June 30, 2017 was 3.15% compared to 3.09% for the same period in 2016.    The efficiency ratio for the three months ended June 30, 2017 was 62.1% compared to 67.6% for the same period in 2016.   "While we are disappointed with the credit impact on our bottom-line performance, there are several positives from our quarterly performance," said Rob Anderson, chief financial officer and chief administrative officer of CapStar.  "Our net interest margin expanded 6 basis points, loan growth was up 18%, DDA & NOW deposits increased 14%, and noninterest income benefited from loan sales in our Tri-Net line of business.  Absent the credit charges, the operating performance of the company met our internal expectations for the quarter."

CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. Announces Second Quarter 2017 Results

      NASHVILLE, Tenn., July 27, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --
      CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. (“CapStar”)
      (NASDAQ:CSTR) reported a net loss of $3.34 million, or $0.26
      per share on a fully diluted basis, for the three months
      ended June 30, 2017, compared to net income of $2.48 million,
      or $0.23 per share on a fully diluted basis, for the three
      months ended June 30, 2016.  The net loss for the
      quarter was primarily attributable to the charge off and
      costs associated with one borrowing relationship, which
      impacted pretax earnings by $9.7 million.


      “CapStar’s organic growth remains strong,” said Claire W.
      Tucker, CapStar’s president and chief executive
      officer.  “Comparing performance in the second quarter
      of 2017 to the same period in 2016, pre-tax pre-provision
      income increased 31% to $5.0 million from $3.8 million. 
      Our otherwise strong quarterly performance was overshadowed
      by deterioration in one non-performing relationship that we
      discussed previously in connection with our first quarter
      results, which led to a charge off of the relationship’s
      existing loan balance.  We believe that our existing
      risk management processes and credit infrastructure provide a
      solid framework for sound asset quality.  We are
      consistently focused on delivering strong operating and
      financial results, and we remain committed to achieving our
      stated goal of a 1% ROAA by the end of 2018.”
    

Soundness


The allowance for loan losses represented 1.25% of total
      loans at June 30, 2017 compared to 1.18% at June 30,
      2016.
         
      
Non-performing assets as a percentage of total loans and
      other real estate owned was 0.32% at June 30, 2017 compared
      to 0.66% at June 30, 2016.
         
      
Annualized net charge-offs totaled 4.38% for the three
      months ended June 30, 2017 compared to 0.01% for the same
      period in 2016. 
         
      
The total risk based capital ratio increased to 11.51% at
      June 30, 2017 compared to 10.67% at June 30, 2016.  
       
      


Profitability


Return on average assets ("ROAA") for the three months
      ended June 30, 2017 was -0.96% compared to 0.80% for the same
      period in 2016. 
         
      
Return on average equity ("ROAE") for the three months
      ended June 30, 2017 was -9.39% compared to 8.85% for the same
      period in 2016. 
         
      
The net interest margin (“NIM”) for the three months
      ended June 30, 2017 was 3.15% compared to 3.09% for the same
      period in 2016. 
         
      
The efficiency ratio for the three months ended June 30,
      2017 was 62.1% compared to 67.6% for the same period in
      2016. 
      


      “While we are disappointed with the credit impact on our
      bottom-line performance, there are several positives from our
      quarterly performance,” said Rob Anderson, chief financial
      officer and chief administrative officer of CapStar. 
      “Our net interest margin expanded 6 basis points, loan growth
      was up 18%, DDA & NOW deposits increased 14%, and
      noninterest income benefited from loan sales in our Tri-Net
      line of business.  Absent the credit charges, the
      operating performance of the company met our internal
      expectations for the quarter.”
    

Growth


Average total assets for the quarter ended June 30, 2017
      increased 11.7%, to $1.39 billion, compared to $1.25 billion
      for the same period in 2016.
         
      
Average gross loans for the quarter ended June 30, 2017
      increased 17.7%, to $1.03 billion, compared to $874.0 million
      for the same period in 2016.
         
      
Average total deposits for the quarter ended June 30,
      2017 increased 1.7%, to $1.11 billion, compared to $1.09
      billion for the same period in 2016.
         
      
Average Demand and NOW deposits for the quarter ended
      June 30, 2017 increased 13.9%, to $531.6 million, compared to
      $466.7 million for the same period in
      2016.

Forward-Looking Statements


      Certain statements in this earnings release are
      forward-looking statements that reflect CapStar’s current
      views with respect to, among other things, future events and
      CapStar’s financial and operational performance. These
      statements are often, but not always, made through the use of
      words or phrases such as “may,” “should,” “could,” “predict,”
      “potential,” “believe,” “will likely result,” “expect,”
      “continue,” “will,” “anticipate,” “seek,” “aspire,”
      “achieve,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “project,”
      “projection,” “forecast,” “roadmap,” “goal,” “target,”
      “would,” and “outlook,” or the negative version of those
      words or other comparable words of a future or
      forward-looking nature. These forward-looking statements are
      not historical facts, and are based on current expectations,
      estimates and projections about CapStar’s industry,
      management’s beliefs and certain assumptions made by
      management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently
      uncertain and beyond CapStar’s control. The inclusion of
      these forward-looking statements should not be regarded as a
      representation by CapStar or any other person that such
      expectations, estimates and projections will be achieved.
      Accordingly, CapStar cautions you that any such
      forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future
      performance and are subject to risks, assumptions and
      uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Although CapStar
      believes that the expectations reflected in these
      forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date
      made, actual results may prove to be materially different
      from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking
      statements. There are or will be important factors that could
      cause CapStar’s actual results to differ materially from
      those indicated in these forward-looking statements,
      including, but not limited to, any factors identified in this
      earnings release as well as those factors that are detailed
      from time to time in CapStar’s periodic and current reports
      filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including
      those factors included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form
      10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 under the headings
      “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Note Regarding
      Forward Looking Statements” and in the Company’s Quarterly
      Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. 
      If one or more events related to these or other risks or
      uncertainties materialize, or if CapStar’s underlying
      assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may differ
      materially from our forward-looking statements. Accordingly,
      you should not place undue reliance on any such
      forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement
      speaks only as of the date of this earnings release, and
      CapStar does not undertake any obligation to publicly update
      or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result
      of new information, future developments or otherwise, except
      as required by law. New risks and uncertainties may emerge
      from time to time, and it is not possible for CapStar to
      predict their occurrence or how they will affect CapStar.
    

Non-GAAP Disclaimer


      This earnings release includes the following financial
      measure that was prepared other than in accordance with
      generally accepted accounting principles in the United States
      (“non-GAAP financial measure”): pre-tax, pre-provision
      income. This non-GAAP financial measure (i) provides useful
      information to management and investors that is supplementary
      to CapStar’s financial condition, results of operations and
      cash flows computed in accordance with GAAP, (ii) enables a
      more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting
      CapStar’s business, and (iii) allows investors to evaluate
      CapStar’s performance in a manner similar to management, the
      financial services industry, bank stock analysts and bank
      regulators; however, CapStar acknowledges that this non-GAAP
      financial measure has a number of limitations.  As such,
      you should not view this non-GAAP financial measure as a
      substitute for results determined in accordance with GAAP,
      and it is not necessarily comparable to non-GAAP financial
      measures that other companies use.  See below for a
      reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the most
      directly comparable GAAP financial measure.
