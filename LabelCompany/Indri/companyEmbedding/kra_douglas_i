GOVERNANCE
One of the objectives of Pega is to build a fast-growing, profitable enterprise that rewards our employees, shareholders, and partners. To achieve this, we must continuously earn the trust of our many stakeholders: employees, customers, partners, suppliers, shareholders, government officials, and the general public.
The tone for our actions is set by our board of directors and senior leadership team. We expect our employees, contractors, and partners to be team-oriented, take ownership, act with integrity, and value diversity. We strive to do the right thing, not because we are required to do it, because we want to do it.
We strive to comply with both the letter and spirit of applicable laws and regulations. To those ends, we have made our basic corporate-governance documents public so our stakeholders can know how we strive to act in all of our business actions.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/23/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.
