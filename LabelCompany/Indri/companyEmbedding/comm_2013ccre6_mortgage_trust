How cash-out refinancing works



The cash out refinance is designed to accomplish two goals — to improve on the terms of an existing home loan and deliver additional funds at a low interest rate. Other types of mortgage refinance include the rate and term refinance, in which the new loan amount is equal to the remaining balance on the old mortgage, and the limited cash out refinance, in which the closing costs are added wrapped into the new loan, increasing its balance.It only makes sense to undertake a cash-out refinance if the new loan comes with a better refinance rate or more favorable terms (replacing an adjustable rate home loan with a fixed rate mortgage, for example).

Refinance with cash out: conforming loans
It is important to note that cash out refinancing generally costs more than rate and term or limited cash out refinancing. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, for example, require lenders to collect surcharges for these loans (called “conforming” mortgages) because they are considered riskier.
The added costs of cash out refinancing can be substantial and should be considered carefully. If, for example, a homeowner wishes to refinance a $200,000 mortgage and take an additional $10,000 cash out, there may be no extra costs (the new loan amount is less than 60 percent of the home’s value and the borrower has a 700 FICO score, for example). On the other hand, if the homeowner has a 650 FICO and the new loan amount is 83 percent of the property value, it would cost an extra $6,300 to borrow $10,000!
In general, cash out refinancing is likely to be the lowest cost option when the amount of additional cash is relatively high. In the above example, the added costs come to 63 percent of the amount borrowed. If the homeowner were to take $100,000 cash out, however, the added costs come to nine percent of the amount borrowed — a considerably lower figure. The chart below shows the added costs, which depend on the borrower’s credit score and the loan-to-value ratio. Notice cash out is limited to 85 percent of the property value.




What is cash-out refinancing?
A refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage. The difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose.

Glossary Terms
​ Cash-Out Refinancing

A refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage. The difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose.

​ Equity

The difference between the fair market value of an asset (like a home) and the amount of debt against that asset (like a mortgage balance).

​  Rate and Term Refinancing

A mortgage refinance that replaces the existing mortgage with a new one but does not disburse cash to the borrower. Rate and term refinancing is undertaken simply to improve on the terms of the old loan – reducing the interest rate is a popular goal.

​  Refinance 

Refinancing means replacing one loan with a new, better loan. Improving the terms of a loan can mean obtaining a lower interest rate, a lower monthly payment, replacing an adjustable or variable rate loan with a fixed-rate loan or increasing the size of the loan and taking the difference in cash.

Cash-Out Refinance Pros
Cash out refinancing offers a few advantages over other sources of funds:

Because it’s secured by real estate, the interest rate is lower than rates for unsecured financing.
Because it’s a first mortgage, the interest rate is lower than rates for home equity loans, which are usually second mortgages.
The interest may be tax-deductible. Check with a tax pro.



Cash-Out Refinance Cons

Underwriting guidelines are stricter than for rate and term refinancing.
Costs are higher because surcharges are assessed against the entire refinance, not just the amount of cash out.
Cash out refinancing takes longer than setting up a home equity loan or personal (unsecured) loan.
Increasing the loan-to-value to over 80 percent requires mortgage insurance.







 



Alternatives to cash-out refinancing
Homeowners considering a cash out refinance should compare the costs of all available options:

Rate and term refinance plus a home equity loan (if terms of existing loan can be bettered)
Adding just a home equity loan (if existing loan cannot be improved)
Taking a personal loan (if credit rating is good and costs are low)
Consolidating debt with a debt management plan or balance transfer card

Cash out refinancing is a valid strategy for financing anything from college tuition to debt consolidation to home improvements. However, homeowners should run the numbers and consider the total cost of borrowing — lender fees, interest rates and third party costs — before committing.

Will you save money by refinancing your current loan?
A mortgage refinance can mean big savings, but it may come at a price in the short term. The decision to refinance generally comes down to whether you'll be in your home long enough for your monthly savings to outweigh the upfront refinancing costs. Our Refinance Calculator can help you determine the amount of time you'll need to stay in your home after refinancing your mortgage to breakeven and cover your costs.

Breakeven Analysis







                                    Monthly Payment
                                    ?
There are several ways to calculate your refinance breakeven. The "quick and dirty" method involves dividing the difference in your monthly payment by the refinancing costs. That isn't necessarily the most accurate method, and the longer you've been paying your current loan, the less accurate that breakeven calculation is. In addition, this method won't help you if your refinancing from a 30-year mortgage to a 15-year loan.










                                    Interest Expense
                                    ?
The next method is based on the difference in  interest expense between your current loan and a refinance mortgage. Your breakeven is that point in which the total interest savings equals the cost of refinancing. This method allows you to compare loans with different terms.










                                    Mortgage Tax Deduction
                                    ?
If you itemize your deductions when you file your taxes, it affects your breakeven point. Higher interest rates mean higher mortgage deductions. Refinancing to a lower rate decreases your mortgage interest deduction.










                                    Pay Down Existing Mortgage
                                    ?
You can choose to refinance or leave your mortgage alone, but you have another option -- use your cash to pay down your mortgage balance instead of spending it on refinancing. You can reamortize your loan to reduce your payment or accelerate your repayment. This breakeven method measures how long it would take for your refinance payment less the reamortized payment on your current mortgage to cover the costs of refinancing.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating.

Press Releases
Date of Release: January 13, 2017
DBRS Upgrades Three Classes of COMM 2013-CCRE6


January 13, 2017







DBRS Limited (DBRS) has today upgraded the ratings on the following classes of Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2013-CCRE6 (the Certificates) issued by COMM 2013-CCRE6 Mortgage Trust:

-- Class B to AA (high) (sf) from AA (sf)
-- Class PEZ to A (high) (sf) from A (sf) 
-- Class C to A (high) (sf) from A (sf)

In addition, DBRS has confirmed the remaining classes as follows:

-- Class A-1 at AAA (sf)
-- Class A-2 at AAA (sf)
-- Class A-3FL at AAA (sf)
-- Class A-3FX at AAA (sf)
-- Class A-4 at AAA (sf)
-- Class A-SB at AAA (sf)
-- Class A-M at AAA (sf)
-- Class X-A at AAA (sf)
-- Class X-B at AAA (sf)
-- Class D at BBB (low) (sf)
-- Class E at BB (sf)
-- Class F at B (sf)

DBRS has assigned a Positive trend to Class D; all other trends are Stable. The Class PEZ certificates are exchangeable for the Classes A-M, B and C certificates (and vice versa).

These rating actions reflect the overall stable performance of the transaction with loans in the Top 15, representing approximately 80.0% of the pool balance, generally showing healthy cash flow growth over the DBRS underwritten (UW) figures and stable occupancy trends. At issuance, the pool consisted of 48 loans secured by 80 commercial and multifamily properties. The pool has since experienced a collateral reduction of 3.3% as a result of scheduled amortization with all of the original 48 loans outstanding. The pool also benefits from defeasance collateral as one loan in the Top 15, representing 6.9% of the current pool balance, is fully defeased. Based on YE2015 financials, the pool reported a weighted-average (WA) debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) of 2.33 times (x) and a WA debt yield of 12.8%. Comparatively, the YE2014 WA DSCR and WA debt yield were 2.24x and 11.2%, respectively. At issuance, the WA DBRS UW DSCR and debt yield figures were 1.99x and 10.4%, respectively.

As of the December 2016 remittance, there are five loans, representing 3.8% of the current pool balance, on the servicer�s watchlist. All of these loans showed a coverage ratio above 1.0x as of the most recent full-year reporting (YE2015) available. For additional information on these loans, please see the servicer�s reported data and, for the larger and/or pivotal loans on the watchlist, DBRS commentary on the DBRS IReports platform at www.ireports.dbrs.com. 

At issuance, DBRS shadow-rated one loan investment grade: Prospectus ID #1 Federal Center Plaza, representing 9.0% of the current pool balance. DBRS�s review confirms that the performance of these loans remains consistent with investment-grade loan characteristics. 

DBRS has provided updated loan-level commentary and analysis for larger and/or pivotal watchlisted loans and for the specially serviced loan as well as for the largest 15 loans in the pool in the DBRS CMBS IReports platform. To view these and future loan-level updates provided as part of DBRS�s ongoing surveillance of this transaction, please log into DBRS CMBS IReports at www.ireports.dbrs.com. 

The ratings assigned to Classes D, E and F materially deviate from the higher ratings implied by the quantitative model. DBRS considers a material deviation to be a rating differential of three or more notches between the assigned rating and the rating implied by the quantitative model that is a substantial component of a rating methodology; in this case, the assigned ratings reflect the sustainability of loan performance trends not demonstrated.

Notes:
All figures are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted.

This rating is endorsed by DBRS Ratings Limited for use in the European Union.

The applicable methodologies are North American CMBS Rating Methodology (March 2016) and CMBS North American Surveillance (December 2016), which can be found on our website under Methodologies.

EXHIBIT 99.2

 


MORTGAGE LOAN PURCHASE
AGREEMENT

 

This Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement (this
“ Agreement ”), is dated and effective
March 7, 2013 between Cantor Commercial Real Estate Lending,
L.P., as seller (the “ Seller ”), and Deutsche
Mortgage & Asset Receiving Corporation, as purchaser (the
“ Purchaser ”).

 

The Seller desires to sell, assign, transfer and
otherwise convey to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser desires to
purchase, subject to the terms and conditions set forth below, the
commercial, multifamily and manufactured housing mortgage loans
(collectively, the “ Mortgage Loans ”)
identified on the schedule annexed hereto as Exhibit A
(the “ Mortgage Loan Schedule ”).

 

It is expected that the Mortgage Loans will be
transferred, together with other commercial, multifamily and
manufactured housing mortgage loans (such Mortgage Loans, the
“ Other Mortgage Loans ”) to COMM 2013-CCRE6
Mortgage Trust, a trust fund (the “ Trust Fund
”) to be formed by the Purchaser, the beneficial ownership of
which will be evidenced by a series of commercial mortgage
pass-through certificates (the “ Certificates
”).  The offer and sale of certain classes of the
Certificates (the “ Registered Certificates ”)
will be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the “ Securities Act ”).  The Trust
Fund will be created and the Certificates will be issued pursuant
to a pooling and servicing agreement to be dated as of March 1,
2013 (the “ Pooling and Servicing Agreement ”),
among the Purchaser, as depositor, Wells Fargo Bank, National
Association, as master servicer (the “ Master Servicer
”), Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as special
servicer (the “ Special Servicer ”), Deutsche
Bank Trust Company Americas, as certificate administrator,
custodian and paying agent (in its capacity as certificate
administrator, the “ Certificate Administrator
”), Park Bridge Lender Services LLC, as operating advisor
(the “ Operating Advisor ”), and U.S. Bank
National Association, as trustee (the “ Trustee
”).

 

The Purchaser intends to sell the Registered
Certificates to Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (“ DBS
”), Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. (“ CF&Co.
”), CastleOak Securities, L.P. (“ CastleOak
”), J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (“ JPMorgan
”) and KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. (“ KeyBanc
” and, together with DBS, CF&Co., CastleOak and JPMorgan,
in such capacity, the “ Underwriters ”) pursuant
to an underwriting agreement dated February 26, 2013 (the “
Underwriting Agreement ”).  The Purchaser
intends to sell other Certificates (the “ Non-Registered
Certificates ”) to DBS and CF&Co. (together, in such
capacity, the “ Initial Purchasers ”) pursuant
to a certificate purchase agreement dated February 26, 2013 (the
“ Certificate Purchase Agreement
”).  Capitalized terms that are used but not
defined herein have the respective meanings assigned to them in the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement (in effect as of the Closing Date)
or in the Indemnification Agreement, dated February 26, 2013 (the
“ Indemnification Agreement ”), among the
Seller, the Purchaser, the Underwriters and the Initial
Purchasers.

 



 



 





 



 

Now, therefore, in consideration of the premises
and the mutual agreements set forth herein, the parties agree as
follows:

 


SECTION 1.   Agreement to
Purchase .


 

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement, the Seller agrees to sell, assign, transfer and
otherwise convey to the Purchaser upon receipt of the Mortgage Loan
Purchase Price referred to in this Section 1, and the Purchaser
agrees to purchase, the Mortgage Loans.  The purchase and
sale of the Mortgage Loans shall take place on or about
March 7, 2013 or such other date as shall be mutually
acceptable to the parties hereto (the “ Closing Date
”).  As of the Cut-off Date, the Mortgage Loans
will have an aggregate principal balance (the “ Aggregate
Cut-off Date Balance ”), after application of all
payments of principal due thereon on or before the Cut-off Date,
whether or not received, of $670,470,709, subject to a variance of
plus or minus 5.0%.  The purchase price of the Mortgage
Loans (inclusive of accrued interest and exclusive of the
Seller’s share of the costs set forth in Section 9
hereof) (the “ Mortgage Loan Purchase Price ”)
shall be equal to the amount set forth on the cross receipt between
the Seller and the Purchaser dated the date hereof.

 


SECTION 2.   Conveyance of
Mortgage Loans .


 


(a)   On the Closing
Date, subject only to receipt by the Seller of the Mortgage Loan
Purchase Price, the satisfaction of the other closing conditions
required to be satisfied on the part of Purchaser pursuant to
Section 7 and the issuance of the Certificates, the Seller agrees
to sell, transfer, assign, set over and otherwise convey to
the Purchaser, without recourse, all the right, title and interest
of the Seller from and after the Closing Date in and to the
following property whether now owned or existing or hereafter
acquired or arising (the “ Covered Assets ”):
the Mortgage Loans identified on the Mortgage Loan Schedule,
including all rights to payment in respect thereof, which,
notwithstanding the foregoing, includes all interest and principal
received or receivable by the Seller on or with respect to the
Mortgage Loans after the Cut-off Date (subject to the proviso in
the next sentence), together with all of the Seller’s right,
title and interest in and to the proceeds of any related title,
hazard, or other insurance policies and any escrow, reserve or
other comparable accounts related to the Mortgage Loans, subject to
(i) that certain Agreement to Appointment of Master Servicer dated
as of March 7, 2013, between the Master Servicer, the
Depositor and the Seller and (ii) the rights of any related
Companion Loan Noteholder pursuant to the related Intercreditor
Agreement, if any.  The Purchaser shall be entitled to
(and, to the extent received by or on behalf of the Seller, the
Seller shall deliver or cause to be delivered to or at the
direction of the Purchaser) all scheduled payments of principal and
interest due on the Mortgage Loans after the Cut-off Date, and all
other recoveries of principal and interest collected thereon after
the Cut-off Date; provided , however , that all
scheduled payments of principal and interest due on or before the
Cut-off Date and collected after the Cut-off Date shall belong to
the Seller, and the Purchaser or its successors or assigns shall
promptly remit any such payments to the Seller.


 

With respect to any Mortgage Loan that is
subject to an Intercreditor Agreement, the parties hereto intend
that the provisions of this Section 2(a) serve as an assignment and
assumption agreement between the Seller, as the assignor, and the
Purchaser, on behalf of the Trust, as the
assignee.  Accordingly, the Seller hereby (and in
accordance with and subject to all
 


 



-2-





 


 
other
applicable provisions of this Agreement) assigns, grants, sells,
transfers, delivers, sets over, and conveys to the Purchaser all
right, title and interest of the Seller in, to and arising out of
the related Intercreditor Agreement and the Purchaser, on behalf of
the Trust, hereby accepts (subject to applicable provisions of this
Agreement) the foregoing assignment and assumes all of the rights
and obligations of Seller with respect to related Intercreditor
Agreement from and after the Closing Date.  In addition,
the Purchaser acknowledges that any such Mortgage Loan that is a
Serviced Mortgage Loan shall be serviced pursuant to the terms of
the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.

 

Within 45 days after the Closing Date, the
Seller shall, or shall at the expense of the Seller cause a third
party vendor (which may be the Trustee, Certificate Administrator
or Custodian pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or
otherwise) to, (1) complete (to the extent necessary) and record
(in favor of the Trustee in the following form: “U.S. Bank
National Association, as Trustee, in trust for the Holders of COMM
2013-CCRE6 Mortgage Trust Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through
Certificates”) in the appropriate public recording office (a)
each Assignment of Mortgage referred to in clause (iii) of
Exhibit B which has not yet been submitted for
recording and (b) each Reassignment of Assignment of Leases,
Rents and Profits referred to in clause (viii)(B) of
Exhibit B (if not otherwise included in the related
Assignment of Mortgage) which has not yet been submitted for
recordation; and (2) complete (to the extent necessary) and
file in the appropriate public filing office each UCC assignment of
financing statement referred to in clause (v)(B) and (xiii) of
Exhibit B which has not yet been submitted for filing or
recording.  In the event that any such document or
instrument is lost or returned unrecorded or unfiled, as the case
may be, because of a defect therein, the Seller shall promptly
prepare or cause the preparation of a substitute therefor or cure
or cause the curing of such defect, as the case may be, and shall
thereafter deliver the substitute or corrected document to or at
the direction of the Purchaser (or
any subsequent owner of
the affected Mortgage Loan, including, without
limitation, the Trustee) for recording or filing, as appropriate,
at the Seller’s expense.  In the event that the
Seller receives the original recorded or filed copy, the Seller
shall, or shall cause a third party vendor or any other party under
its control to, promptly upon receipt of the original recorded or
filed copy (and in no event later than 5 Business Days following
such receipt) deliver such original to the Custodian, with evidence
of filing or recording thereon.  Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Section 2, in those instances
where the public recording office retains the original Mortgage,
Assignment of Mortgage, Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits or
Reassignment of Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits, if
applicable, after any has been recorded, the obligations hereunder
of the Seller shall be deemed to have been satisfied upon delivery
to the Custodian of a copy of the recorded original of such
Mortgage, Assignment of Mortgage, Assignment of Leases, Rents and
Profits or Reassignment of Assignment of Leases, Rents and
Profits.

 

On the Closing Date, upon (i) notification from
the Seller that the Mortgage Loan Purchase Price referred to in
Section 1 has been received by the Seller and (ii) the
issuance of the Certificates, the Purchaser shall be authorized to
release to the Certificate Administrator or its designee all of the
Mortgage Files in the Purchaser’s possession relating to the
Mortgage Loans.

 


(b)   In connection with
the Seller’s assignment pursuant to subsection (a)
above, and subject to subsections (c) and (d) below, the Seller
shall deliver to and deposit with, or cause to be delivered to and
deposited with, the Custodian, on or before the Closing Date,
the

 


 



-3-





 


 
documents
and/or instruments referred to in clauses (i), (ii), (vii), (xi)
and (xix) of Exhibit B for each Mortgage Loan so assigned
(with originals with respect to clause (i) and copies with respect
to clauses (ii), (vii), (xi) and (xix)) and, except as otherwise
provided in Section 2(d) below, within 30 days following the
Closing Date, the remaining applicable documents in Exhibit
B for each such Mortgage Loan, with copies to the Master
Servicer.

 


(c)   If the Seller
cannot deliver, or cause to be delivered, as to any Mortgage Loan,
the original Note, the Seller shall deliver a copy or duplicate
original of such Note, together with an affidavit certifying that
the original thereof has been lost or destroyed and an
indemnification in connection therewith in favor of the Certificate
Administrator, the Trustee and the Custodian.


 


(d)   If the Seller
cannot deliver, or cause to be delivered, as to any Mortgage Loan,
the original or a copy of any of the documents and/or instruments
referred to in clauses (ii), (v)(A), (viii)(A), (xiv) and
(xvi) of Exhibit B and the UCC financing statements and
UCC assignments of financing statements referred to in
clause (xiii) of Exhibit B , with evidence of
recording or filing thereon, solely because of a delay caused by
the public recording or filing office where such document or
instrument has been delivered for recordation or filing, or because
such original recorded or filed document has been lost or returned
from the recording or filing office and subsequently lost, as the
case may be, the delivery requirements of Section 2(b) shall
be deemed to have been satisfied as to such missing item, and such
missing item shall be deemed to have been included in the related
Mortgage File, provided that a copy of such document or
instrument (without evidence of recording or filing thereon, but
certified (which certificate may relate to multiple documents
and/or instruments) by the applicable public recording or filing
office, the applicable title insurance company or by the Seller to
be a true and complete copy of the original thereof submitted for
recording or filing, as the case may be) has been delivered to the
Custodian within 45 days after the Closing Date, and either the
original of such missing document or instrument, or a copy thereof,
with evidence of recording or filing, as the case may be, thereon,
is delivered to or at the direction of the Purchaser (or any
subsequent owner of the affected Mortgage Loan, including without
limitation the Trustee) within 180 days after the Closing Date (or
within such longer period after the Closing Date as the Custodian
may consent to, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed so long as the Seller has provided the
Custodian with evidence of such recording or filing, as the case
may be, or has certified to the Custodian as to the occurrence of
such recording or filing, as the case may be, and is, as certified
to the Custodian no less often than quarterly, in good faith
attempting to obtain from the appropriate public recording or
filing office such original or copy, provided such
extensions do not exceed 24 months in the aggregate).


 

If the Seller cannot deliver, or cause to be
delivered, as to any Mortgage Loan, the original or a copy of the
related lender’s title insurance policy referred to in
clause (vii) of Exhibit B solely because such
policy has not yet been issued, the delivery requirements of
Section 2(b) shall be deemed to be satisfied as to such
missing item, and such missing item shall be deemed to have been
included in the related Mortgage File, provided that the
Seller has delivered to the Custodian a binder marked as binding
and countersigned by the title insurer or its authorized agent
(which may be a pro forma or specimen title insurance policy which
has been accepted or approved in writing as binding by the related
title insurance company) or an acknowledged closing instruction or
escrow letter, and the Seller shall deliver to the Custodian
or
 


 



-4-





 


 
at the
direction of the Purchaser (or any subsequent owner of the affected
Mortgage Loan, including without limitation the Trustee), promptly
following the receipt thereof, the original related lender’s
title insurance policy (or a copy thereof).

 

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
with respect to the documents referred to in clause (xix) and
clause (xx) on Exhibit B , the Seller acknowledges that the
Master Servicer will hold the original of each such document in
trust on behalf of the Trustee in order to draw on such letter of
credit on behalf of the Trust and the Seller shall be deemed to
have satisfied the delivery requirements of this Agreement by
delivering the original of each such document to the Master
Servicer.  The Seller shall pay any costs of assignment
or amendment of such letter of credit required (which assignment or
amendment shall change the beneficiary of the letter of credit to
the Trust in care of the Master Servicer) in order for the Master
Servicer to draw on such letter of credit on behalf of the
Trust.  In the event that the documents specified in
clause (xx) on Exhibit B are missing because the
related assignment or amendment documents have not been completed,
the Seller shall take all reasonably necessary steps to enable the
Master Servicer to draw on the related letter of credit on behalf
of the Trust including, if necessary, drawing on the letter of
credit in its own name pursuant to written instructions from the
Master Servicer and immediately remitting such funds (or causing
such funds to be remitted) to the Master Servicer.

 

Contemporaneously with the execution of this
Agreement by the Purchaser and the Seller, the Seller shall deliver
a power of attorney substantially in the form of
Exhibit C hereto to each of the Master Servicer and the
Special Servicer, that permits such parties to take such other
action as is necessary to effect the delivery, assignment and/or
recordation of any documents and/or instruments relating to any
Mortgage Loan which have not been delivered, assigned or recorded
at the time required for enforcement by the Trust
Fund.  The Seller will be required to effect at its
expense the assignment and, if applicable, recordation of its Loan
Documents until the assignment and recordation of all such Loan
Documents has been completed.

 


(e)   Except as provided
below, all documents and records in the Seller’s possession
(or under its control) relating to the Mortgage Loans that are not
required to be a part of a Mortgage File in accordance with
Exhibit B but that are reasonably required to service
the Mortgage Loans and copies of the documents in the Mortgage File
(all such other documents and records, including Environmental
Reports, as to any Mortgage Loan, the “ Servicing File
”), together with all escrow payments, reserve funds and
other comparable funds in the possession of the Seller (or under
its control) with respect to the Mortgage Loans, shall (unless they
are held by a sub-servicer that shall, as of the Closing Date,
begin acting on behalf of the Master Servicer pursuant to a written
agreement between such parties) be delivered by the Seller (or its
agent) to the Master Servicer (as the Purchaser’s designee)
no later than the Closing Date; provided , however ,
the Seller shall not be required to deliver, and the Servicing File
shall not be deemed to include drafts of Loan Documents,
attorney-client or internal communications of the Seller or its
affiliates or Seller’s credit underwriting or due diligence
analyses or related data (as distinguished from Environmental
Reports, financial statements, credit reports, title reports,
structural and engineering reports, appraisals and other reports,
analyses or data provided by the Borrowers or third parties other
than the Seller’s attorneys).  If a sub-servicer
shall, as of the Closing Date, begin acting on behalf of the Master
Servicer with respect to any Mortgage Loan

 


 



-5-





 


 
pursuant to a
written agreement between such parties, the Seller or its agent
shall deliver a copy of the related Servicing File to the Master
Servicer.

 


(f)   Each of the Seller
and the Purchaser will treat, and their respective records will
reflect, the transfer of the Mortgage Loans to the Purchaser as a
sale, including for tax and accounting
purposes.  Following the transfer of the Mortgage Loans
to the Purchaser, the Seller will not take any action inconsistent
with the ownership of the Mortgage Loans by the Purchaser or its
assignees.


 


(g)   Furthermore, it is
the express intent of the parties hereto that the conveyance of the
Mortgage Loans by Seller to Purchaser as provided in this Agreement
be, and be construed as, a sale of the Mortgage Loans by Seller to
Purchaser and not a pledge of the Mortgage Loans by Seller to
Purchaser to secure a debt or other obligation of
Seller.  However, in the event that, notwithstanding the
intent of the parties, the Mortgage Loans are held to be property
of Seller or if for any reason this Agreement is held or deemed to
create a security interest in the Mortgage Loans:


 


(i)   this Agreement
shall hereby create a security agreement within the meaning of
Articles 8 and 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code in effect in the
applicable state;


 


(ii)   the conveyance
provided for in this Agreement shall hereby grant from Seller to
Purchaser, and Seller hereby grants to Purchaser, a security
interest in and to all of Seller’s right, title, and
interest, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, in and to the
Covered Assets and all proceeds thereof;


 


(iii)   the possession by
Purchaser or its assignee of the Notes and such other goods,
letters of credit, advices of credit, instruments, money,
documents, chattel paper or certificated securities shall be deemed
to be possession by the secured party or possession by a purchaser
or a Person designated by him or her, for purposes of perfecting
the security interest pursuant to the Uniform Commercial Code
(including, without limitation, Sections 9-306, 9-313 and 9-314
thereof) as in force in the relevant jurisdiction; and


 


(iv)   notifications to
Persons holding such property, and acknowledgments, receipts,
confirmations from Persons holding such property, shall be deemed
to be notifications to, or acknowledgments, receipts or
confirmations from, securities intermediaries, bailees or agents
of, or Persons holding for (as applicable), Purchaser or its
assignee for the purpose of perfecting such security interest under
applicable law.


 

The Seller at the direction of the Purchaser or
its assignee, shall, to the extent consistent with this Agreement,
take such actions as may be reasonably necessary to ensure that
such security interest is a perfected security interest of first
priority under applicable law and will be maintained as
such.  In connection herewith, Purchaser and its assignee
shall have all of the rights and remedies of a secured party and
creditor under the Uniform Commercial Code as in force in the
relevant jurisdiction and may execute and file such UCC Financing
Statements as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to
accomplish the foregoing.

(h)   It is further
acknowledged and agreed by the Seller that the Purchaser intends to
convey all right, title and interest of the Purchaser from and
after the Closing Date in and to the Mortgage Loans and all rights
and remedies under this Agreement (excluding the Purchaser’s
rights and remedies under Sections 6(e)-(g), 9 and 11 of this
Agreement) to the Trustee on behalf of the Certificateholders,
including, without limitation, all rights and remedies as may be
available under Section 6 to the Purchaser in the event of a
Material Breach or a Material Defect, and the Trustee on behalf of
the Certificateholders, as assignee of the Purchaser, or such other
party as may be specified in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement,
shall be entitled to enforce any obligations of the Seller
hereunder in connection with a Material Breach or a Material Defect
as if the Trustee on behalf of the Certificateholders had been an
original party to this Agreement.


 


SECTION 3.   Examination of
Mortgage Files and Due Diligence Review .


 

The Seller shall reasonably cooperate with any
examination of the Mortgage Files and Servicing Files that may be
undertaken by or on behalf of the Purchaser.  The fact
that the Purchaser has conducted or has failed to conduct any
partial or complete examination of the Mortgage Files and/or
Servicing Files shall not affect the Purchaser’s right to
pursue any remedy available in equity or at law under Section 6 for
a breach of the Seller’s representations, warranties and
covenants set forth in or contemplated by Section 4.

 


SECTION 4.  
Representations, Warranties and Covenants of the Seller

law.


 


(v)   The Purchaser is
not in violation of, and its execution and delivery of this
Agreement and its performance of, and compliance with, the terms of
this Agreement

 


 



-9-





 


 

will not
constitute a violation of, any law, any judgment, order or decree
of any court or arbiter, or any order, regulation or demand of any
federal, state or local governmental or regulatory authority, which
violation, in the Purchaser’s good faith and reasonable
judgment, is likely to affect materially and adversely either the
ability of the Purchaser to perform its obligations under this
Agreement or the financial condition of the Purchaser.


 


(vi)   No litigation is
pending or, to the best of the Purchaser’s knowledge,
threatened against the Purchaser which would prohibit the Purchaser
from entering into this Agreement or, in the Purchaser’s good
faith and reasonable judgment, is likely to materially and
adversely affect either the ability of the Purchaser to perform its
obligations under this Agreement or the financial condition of the
Purchaser.


 


(vii)   The Purchaser has
not dealt with any broker, investment banker, agent or other
Person, other than the Seller, the Underwriters, the Initial
Purchasers and their respective affiliates, that may be entitled to
any commission or compensation in connection with the purchase of
the Mortgage Loans or the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated hereby.


 


(viii)    No consent, approval, authorization or order of,
registration or filing with, or notice to, any governmental
authority or court is required, under federal or state law, for the
Purchaser’s execution, delivery and performance of or
compliance by the Purchaser with this Agreement, or the
consummation by the Purchaser of any transaction contemplated
hereby, other than (1) such consents, approvals,
authorizations, qualifications, registrations, filings or notices
as have been obtained, made or given and (2) where the lack of
such consent, approval, authorization, qualification, registration,
filing or notice would not have a material adverse effect on the
performance by the Purchaser under this Agreement.


 


(b)   Upon discovery by
any of the parties hereto of a breach of any of the representations
and warranties set forth above which materially and adversely
affects the interests of the Seller, the party discovering such
breach shall give prompt written notice of such breach to the other

SECTION 6.   Repurchases;
Substitutions .


 


(a)   If the Purchaser
discovers that any document constituting a part of a Mortgage File
has not been delivered within the time periods provided for herein,
has not been properly executed, is missing, does not appear to be
regular on its face or contains information that does not conform
in any material respect with the corresponding information set
forth in the Mortgage Loan Schedule (each, a “ Defect
”), or discovers or receives notice of a breach of any
representation or warranty of the Seller made pursuant to
Section 4(a) of this Agreement with respect to any Mortgage
Loan (a “ Breach ”), and if such Defect is a
Material Defect or such Breach is a Material Breach, then the
Purchaser (or, following the assignment of the Mortgage Loans to
the Trust Fund, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the
Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor or
the Custodian, on behalf of the Trust Fund) shall give prompt
written notice thereof to the Seller.  If any such Defect
or Breach materially and adversely affects the value of any
Mortgage Loan, the value of the related Mortgaged Property
or

 


 



-10-





 


 
the interests
in such Mortgage Loan or Mortgaged Property of the Purchaser, or
causes the related Mortgage Loan to be other than a
“qualified mortgage” (within the meaning of Section
860G(a)(3) of the Code, without regard to the rule of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.860G-2(f)(2) which causes a defective mortgage
loan to be treated as a “qualified mortgage”), then
such Defect shall constitute a “ Material Defect
” or such Breach shall constitute a “ Material
Breach ,” as the case may be; provided ,
however , that if any of the documents specified in clauses
(i), (ii), (vii), (xi) and (xix) of the definition of
“Mortgage File” is (subject to Sections 2(c) and
2(d) hereof) not delivered, and is certified as missing pursuant to
Section 2.02 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, it shall
be deemed a Material Defect.  Promptly upon receiving
written notice of any Material Defect or Material Breach with
respect to a Mortgage Loan, accompanied by a written demand to take
the actions contemplated by this sentence, the Seller shall not
later than 90 days from the Seller’s receipt from the
Purchaser (or, following the assignment of the Mortgage Loans to
the Trust Fund, the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special
Servicer, the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating
Advisor or the Custodian, on behalf of the Trust Fund) of notice
of, and demand to take action with respect to, such Material Defect
or Material Breach, as the case may be (or, in the case of a
Material Defect or Material Breach relating to a Mortgage Loan not
being a “qualified mortgage” as described in the
preceding sentence, not later than 90 days after the Seller or any
party to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement discovers such
Material Defect or Material Breach) (any such 90-day period, the
“ Initial Resolution Period ”), (i) cure
the same in all material respects, (ii) repurchase the
affected Mortgage Loan at the applicable Repurchase Price or
(iii) substitute a Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loan for
such affected Mortgage Loan ( provided that in no event
shall such substitution occur later than the second anniversary of
the Closing Date) and pay to the Master Servicer for deposit into
the Collection Account any Substitution Shortfall Amount in
connection therewith; provided that if (i) such
Material Defect or Material Breach (other than one relating to a
deemed Material Defect under the proviso to the immediately
preceding sentence) is capable of being cured but not within the
Initial Resolution Period, (ii) such Material Defect or
Material Breach is not related to any Mortgage Loan’s not
being a “qualified mortgage” within the meaning of the
REMIC Provisions and (iii) the Seller has commenced and is
diligently proceeding with the cure of such Material Defect or
Material Breach within the Initial Resolution Period, then the
Seller shall have an additional period equal to the applicable
Resolution Extension Period to complete such cure or, failing such
cure, to repurchase the Mortgage Loan or substitute a Qualifying
Substitute Mortgage Loan.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if a Mortgage Loan is not secured by a hotel, restaurant (operated
by a Borrower), healthcare facility, nursing home, assisted living
facility, self-storage facility, theatre or fitness center
(operated by a Borrower) property, then the failure to deliver to
the Custodian copies of the UCC financing statements with respect
to such Mortgage Loan shall not be a Material Defect.

 

If the Seller is notified of a Defect in any
Mortgage File that also affects information set forth in the
Mortgage Loan Schedule, the Seller shall promptly correct such
Defect and provide a new, corrected Mortgage Loan Schedule to the
Purchaser, which corrected Mortgage Loan Schedule shall be deemed
to amend and replace the existing Mortgage Loan Schedule for all
purposes.  The failure of the Master Servicer, the
Special Servicer, the Operating Advisor, the Certificate
Administrator or the Trustee to notify the Seller of a Material
Defect or Material Breach shall not constitute a waiver of any cure
or repurchase obligation, provided that the Seller must
receive written notice thereof as described in this Section 6(a)
before commencement of the Initial Resolution Period.

 



 



-11-





 



 

If (x) there exists a Breach of any
representation or warranty on the part of the Seller as set forth
in, or made pursuant to, representation 30 or 32 of Exhibit
D to this Agreement relating to fees and expenses payable by
the Borrower associated with the exercise of a defeasance option, a
waiver of a “due-on-sale” provision or a
“due-on-encumbrance” provision or the release of any
Mortgaged Property, and (y) the related Loan Documents specifically
prohibit the Master Servicer or Special Servicer from requiring the
related Borrower to pay such fees and expenses, then, upon notice
by the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, the Seller may cure
such breach by transferring to the Collection Account, within 90
days of the Seller’s receipt of such notice, the amount of
any such fees and expenses borne by the Trust Fund that are the
basis of such Breach. Upon its making such deposit, the Seller
shall be deemed to have cured such Breach in all
respects.  Provided such payment is made, this paragraph
describes the sole remedy available to the Purchaser and its
assignees regarding any such Breach, regardless of whether it
constitutes a Material Breach, and the Seller shall not be
obligated to repurchase or otherwise cure such Breach.

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
Section 6(a), in lieu of the Seller performing its obligations
with respect to any Material Breach or Material Defect provided in
the three preceding paragraphs, to the extent that the Seller and
the Purchaser (or, following the assignment of the Mortgage Loans
to the Trust Fund, the Special Servicer on behalf of the Trust
Fund, and, if no Control Termination Event has occurred and is
continuing, with the consent of the Controlling Class
Representative) are able to agree upon a cash payment payable by
the Seller to the Purchaser (or its assignee) that would be deemed
sufficient to compensate the Purchaser (or its assignee) for a
Material Breach or Material Defect (a “ Loss of Value
Payment ”), the Seller may elect, in its sole discretion,
to pay such Loss of Value Payment to the Purchaser (or its
assignee); provided that a Material Defect or a Material
Breach as a result of a Mortgage Loan not constituting a
“qualified mortgage”, within the meaning of Code
Section 860G(a)(3), may not be cured by a Loss of Value
Payment.  Upon its making such payment, the Seller shall
be deemed to have cured such Material Breach or Material Defect in
all respects.  Provided such payment is made, this
paragraph describes the sole remedy available to the Purchaser and
its assignees regarding any such Material Breach or Material
Defect, and the Seller shall not be obligated to repurchase or
replace the related Mortgage Loan or otherwise cure such Material
Breach or Material Defect.

 


(b)   In connection with
any repurchase of, or substitution for, a Mortgage Loan
contemplated by this Section 6:


 


(i)   the Custodian, the
Master Servicer (with respect to any such Mortgage Loan other than
a Specially Serviced Loan) and the Special Servicer (with respect
to any such Mortgage Loan that is a Specially Serviced Loan),
pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, shall each be
required to tender to the Seller, and the Seller shall be entitled
to receive therefrom, all portions of the Mortgage File (in the
case of the Custodian) and the Servicing File (in the case of the
Master Servicer and the Special Servicer, as applicable) and other
documents pertaining to such Mortgage Loan possessed by it, upon
delivery:


 


(A)    to the
Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, of a trust
receipt, and


 



 



-12-





 



 


(B)    to the
Custodian by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as
applicable, of a Request for Release and an acknowledgement by the
Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, of its receipt
of the Repurchase Price or the Substitution Shortfall Amount from
the Seller;


 


(ii)   each document that
constitutes a part of the Mortgage File that was endorsed or
assigned to the Trustee shall be endorsed or assigned without
recourse in the form of endorsement or assignment provided to the
Custodian by the Seller, as the case may be, to the Seller as shall
be necessary to vest in the Seller the legal and beneficial
ownership of each Removed Mortgage Loan to the extent such
ownership was transferred to the Trustee; and


 


(iii)   the Trustee, the
Certificate Administrator, the Master Servicer and the Special
Servicer shall release, or cause the release of, any escrow
payments and reserve funds held by or on behalf of the Trustee, the
Certificate Administrator, the Master Servicer or the Special
Servicer, as the case may be, in respect of such Removed Mortgage
Loan(s) to the Seller.


 


(c)   This
Section 6 provides the sole remedies with respect to the
Mortgage Loans available to the Purchaser, and its successors and
permitted assigns ( i.e. , the Trustee and the holders of
the Certificates) in respect of any Defect in a Mortgage File or
any Breach.  If the Seller defaults on its obligations to
cure, to repurchase, or to substitute for, any Mortgage Loan in
accordance with this Section 6, or disputes its obligation to
cure, to repurchase, or to substitute for, any Mortgage Loan in
accordance with Section 6, the Purchaser may take such action as is
appropriate to enforce such payment or performance, including,
without limitation, the institution and prosecution of appropriate
proceedings.  To the extent the Purchaser prevails in
such proceeding, the Seller shall reimburse the Purchaser for all
necessary and reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection
with the enforcement of such obligation of the Seller to cure, to
repurchase, or to substitute for, any Mortgage Loan in accordance
with this Section 6.  To the extent the Seller
prevails in such proceeding, the Purchaser shall reimburse the
Seller for all necessary and reasonable costs and expenses incurred
in connection with such proceeding.


 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there is a
Material Breach or Material Defect with respect to one or more
Mortgaged Properties securing a Mortgage Loan, the Seller shall not
be obligated to repurchase the Mortgage Loan if (i) the
affected Mortgaged Property may be released pursuant to the terms
of any partial release provisions in the related Loan Documents
(and such Mortgaged Property is, in fact, released), (ii) the
remaining Mortgaged Property(ies) satisfy the requirements, if any,
set forth in the Loan Documents and the Seller provides an Opinion
of Counsel to the effect that such release would not cause an
Adverse REMIC Event to occur and (iii) each Rating Agency then
rating the Certificates shall have provided a No Downgrade
Confirmation with respect to such release.

 


(d)   As to any
Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loan, at the direction of the Master
Servicer (with respect to Performing Loans) or the Special Servicer
(with respect to Specially Serviced Loans and REO Properties), the
Seller shall deliver to the Custodian for such Qualifying
Substitute Mortgage Loan (with a copy to the Master Servicer), the
related Mortgage File with the related Note endorsed as required by
Exhibit B hereto.  Pursuant to the Pooling
and

 


 



-13-





 


 
Servicing
Agreement, Monthly Payments due with respect to Qualifying
Substitute Mortgage Loans in or prior to the month of substitution
shall not be part of the Trust Fund and, if received by the Master
Servicer, shall be remitted by the Master Servicer to the related
Seller on the next succeeding Distribution Date.  For the
month of repurchase or substitution, distributions to
Certificateholders pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement
will include the Monthly Payment(s) due on the related Removed
Mortgage Loan and received by the Master Servicer or the Special
Servicer on behalf of the Trust on or prior to the related date of
repurchase or substitution, as applicable, and the Seller shall be
entitled to retain all amounts received thereafter in respect of
such Removed Mortgage Loan.

 

In any month in which the Seller substitutes one
or more Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loans for one or more
Removed Mortgage Loans, pursuant to this Agreement, the Master
Servicer will determine the applicable Substitution Shortfall
Amount.  At the direction of the Certificate
Administrator, the Seller shall deposit, or deliver to the Master
Servicer for deposit, into the Collection Account cash equal to
such amount concurrently with the delivery of the Mortgage Files
for such Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loans, without any
reimbursement thereof.  Any Mortgage Loan that is
repurchased or replaced by the Seller pursuant to this
Section 6 shall constitute a “ Removed
Mortgage Loan ”.

 


(e)   If the Seller
(i) receives from any Person (other than the Depositor) any
Repurchase Communication of a Repurchase Request; (ii) rejects any
Repurchase Request or is in dispute with the Person making any
Repurchase Request as to the merits of such Repurchase Request (a
“ Dispute ”); or (iii) receives a Repurchase
Communication of a Repurchase Request Withdrawal, then the Seller
shall deliver notice thereof (each, a “ Rule 15Ga-1
Notice ”) to the Depositor within ten (10) Business Days
of the Seller’s receipt thereof (or in the case of a
rejection or Dispute, the occurrence thereof).  Each Rule
15Ga-1 Notice shall include (i) the identity of the related
Mortgage Loan, (ii) the date the Repurchase Communication of the
Repurchase Request or the Repurchase Request Withdrawal was
received, as applicable, and (iii) in the case of a Repurchase
Request, the identity of the Person making such Repurchase Request
and, if known, the basis for the Repurchase Request (as asserted in
the Repurchase Request).


 

“ Repurchase Communication ”
means, for purposes of this Section 6(e) only, any communication,
whether oral or written, which need not be in any specific
form.

 


(f)   The Seller shall
provide to the Depositor relevant portions of any Form ABS-15G that
the Seller is required to file with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (only to the extent that such portions relate to any
Mortgage Loan) on or before the date that is five (5) Business Days
before the date such Form ABS-15G is required to be filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.  In connection with
such filing, upon the request of the Seller, the Depositor shall
provide to the Seller the Trust Fund’s Central Index Key
(CIK) number and such other information regarding the principal
balances of the Mortgage Loans as is reasonably necessary for the
Seller to complete and file such Form ABS-15G.


 


(g)   The Seller agrees
that a Rule 15Ga-1 Notice Provider will not, in connection with
providing the Seller with any Rule 15Ga-1 Notice (for purposes of
this Section 6(g) only, as defined in the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement), be required to provide any information protected by the
attorney-client privilege or attorney work product
doctrines.  In

 


 



-14-





 


 
addition, the
Seller hereby acknowledges that (i) any Rule 15Ga-1 Notice
provided pursuant to Section 2.03(d) of the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement is so provided only to assist the Seller, the
Depositor and its Affiliates to comply with Rule 15Ga-1 under the
Exchange Act, Items 1104 and 1121 of Regulation AB and any other
requirement of law or regulation and (ii) (A) no action
taken by, or inaction of, a Rule 15Ga-1 Notice Provider and
(B) no information provided pursuant to Section 2.03(d)
of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement by a Rule 15Ga-1 Notice
Provider, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver or defense to the
exercise of any legal right the Rule 15Ga-1 Notice Provider may
have with respect to this Agreement, including with respect to any
Repurchase Request that is the subject of a Rule 15Ga-1
Notice.

 


(h)   Each party hereto
agrees that the receipt of a Rule 15Ga-1 Notice or the delivery of
any notice required to be delivered pursuant to this Section 6
shall not, in and of itself, constitute delivery of notice of,
receipt of notice of, or knowledge of the Seller of, any Material
Defect or Material Breach.

The closing of the purchase and sale of the
Mortgage Loans (the “ Closing ”) shall be held

hereof.

How cash-out refinancing works



The cash out refinance is designed to accomplish two goals — to improve on the terms of an existing home loan and deliver additional funds at a low interest rate. Other types of mortgage refinance include the rate and term refinance, in which the new loan amount is equal to the remaining balance on the old mortgage, and the limited cash out refinance, in which the closing costs are added wrapped into the new loan, increasing its balance.It only makes sense to undertake a cash-out refinance if the new loan comes with a better refinance rate or more favorable terms (replacing an adjustable rate home loan with a fixed rate mortgage, for example).

Refinance with cash out: conforming loans
It is important to note that cash out refinancing generally costs more than rate and term or limited cash out refinancing. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, for example, require lenders to collect surcharges for these loans (called “conforming” mortgages) because they are considered riskier.
The added costs of cash out refinancing can be substantial and should be considered carefully. If, for example, a homeowner wishes to refinance a $200,000 mortgage and take an additional $10,000 cash out, there may be no extra costs (the new loan amount is less than 60 percent of the home’s value and the borrower has a 700 FICO score, for example). On the other hand, if the homeowner has a 650 FICO and the new loan amount is 83 percent of the property value, it would cost an extra $6,300 to borrow $10,000!
In general, cash out refinancing is likely to be the lowest cost option when the amount of additional cash is relatively high. In the above example, the added costs come to 63 percent of the amount borrowed. If the homeowner were to take $100,000 cash out, however, the added costs come to nine percent of the amount borrowed — a considerably lower figure. The chart below shows the added costs, which depend on the borrower’s credit score and the loan-to-value ratio. Notice cash out is limited to 85 percent of the property value.




What is cash-out refinancing?
A refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage. The difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose.

Glossary Terms
​ Cash-Out Refinancing

A refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage. The difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose.

​ Equity

The difference between the fair market value of an asset (like a home) and the amount of debt against that asset (like a mortgage balance).

​  Rate and Term Refinancing

A mortgage refinance that replaces the existing mortgage with a new one but does not disburse cash to the borrower. Rate and term refinancing is undertaken simply to improve on the terms of the old loan – reducing the interest rate is a popular goal.

​  Refinance 

Refinancing means replacing one loan with a new, better loan. Improving the terms of a loan can mean obtaining a lower interest rate, a lower monthly payment, replacing an adjustable or variable rate loan with a fixed-rate loan or increasing the size of the loan and taking the difference in cash.

Cash-Out Refinance Pros
Cash out refinancing offers a few advantages over other sources of funds:

Because it’s secured by real estate, the interest rate is lower than rates for unsecured financing.
Because it’s a first mortgage, the interest rate is lower than rates for home equity loans, which are usually second mortgages.
The interest may be tax-deductible. Check with a tax pro.



Cash-Out Refinance Cons

Underwriting guidelines are stricter than for rate and term refinancing.
Costs are higher because surcharges are assessed against the entire refinance, not just the amount of cash out.
Cash out refinancing takes longer than setting up a home equity loan or personal (unsecured) loan.
Increasing the loan-to-value to over 80 percent requires mortgage insurance.







 



Alternatives to cash-out refinancing
Homeowners considering a cash out refinance should compare the costs of all available options:

Rate and term refinance plus a home equity loan (if terms of existing loan can be bettered)
Adding just a home equity loan (if existing loan cannot be improved)
Taking a personal loan (if credit rating is good and costs are low)
Consolidating debt with a debt management plan or balance transfer card

Cash out refinancing is a valid strategy for financing anything from college tuition to debt consolidation to home improvements. However, homeowners should run the numbers and consider the total cost of borrowing — lender fees, interest rates and third party costs — before committing.

Will you save money by refinancing your current loan?
A mortgage refinance can mean big savings, but it may come at a price in the short term. The decision to refinance generally comes down to whether you'll be in your home long enough for your monthly savings to outweigh the upfront refinancing costs. Our Refinance Calculator can help you determine the amount of time you'll need to stay in your home after refinancing your mortgage to breakeven and cover your costs.

Breakeven Analysis







                                    Monthly Payment
                                    ?
There are several ways to calculate your refinance breakeven. The "quick and dirty" method involves dividing the difference in your monthly payment by the refinancing costs. That isn't necessarily the most accurate method, and the longer you've been paying your current loan, the less accurate that breakeven calculation is. In addition, this method won't help you if your refinancing from a 30-year mortgage to a 15-year loan.










                                    Interest Expense
                                    ?
The next method is based on the difference in  interest expense between your current loan and a refinance mortgage. Your breakeven is that point in which the total interest savings equals the cost of refinancing. This method allows you to compare loans with different terms.










                                    Mortgage Tax Deduction
                                    ?
If you itemize your deductions when you file your taxes, it affects your breakeven point. Higher interest rates mean higher mortgage deductions. Refinancing to a lower rate decreases your mortgage interest deduction.










                                    Pay Down Existing Mortgage
                                    ?
You can choose to refinance or leave your mortgage alone, but you have another option -- use your cash to pay down your mortgage balance instead of spending it on refinancing. You can reamortize your loan to reduce your payment or accelerate your repayment. This breakeven method measures how long it would take for your refinance payment less the reamortized payment on your current mortgage to cover the costs of refinancing.

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.

                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
