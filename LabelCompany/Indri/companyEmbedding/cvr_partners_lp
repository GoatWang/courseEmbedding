Soreide Law Group Files FINRA Arbitration Against FIRST DALLAS SECURITIES INC and Broker, GARY M. BRADSHAW 


The Soreide Law Group recently filed a FINRA arbitration on behalf of their client (Claimant) against FIRST DALLAS SECURITIES INCORPORATED and their registered representative, GARY M. BRADSHAW (CRD# 1389924).
The Claimant, is a retired widow from Texas, whose husband passed away in 2008. The Claimant met FIRST DALLAS broker, BRADSHAW, through her now deceased mother and both lived off the income from their investments. They both had built conservative portfolios of income producing investments to sustain them through retirement. They were completely reliant upon FIRST DALLAS broker, BRADSHAW, for all investment advice and allowed him to act on their behalf, believing he was always acting in their best interest.
In 2013, BRADSHAW allegedly began transitioning the Claimant’s accounts from conservative bonds to large concentrated positions of oil and gas related investments. By 2014 BRADSHAW had concentrated over 100% of the Claimant’s account into 3 oil and gas investments, CVR Partners, LP, Kinder Morgan, and Legacy Reserves, LP. Due to the devastating losses in oil and gas stocks, the Claimant suffered over $160,000 in losses to her irreplaceable retirement savings.
Upon the passing of her mother, the Claimant learned as executor of her mother’s estate that BRADSHAW concentrated over 20% of her mother’s account into CVR Partners and Legacy Reserves in an account that previously was 100% invested with investment grade bonds.
Allegedly there was no hedging or stop loss strategy implemented in the accounts and the Respondent’s unsuitable recommendations have now cost the Claimants over $250,000 of losses.
The lawsuit alleges that while with FIRST DALLAS SECURITIES INCORPORATED, the Claimant fell victim to breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, negligence, and negligent supervision over their registered representative, GARY MACK BRADSHAW, who over concentrated the Claimant’s account into speculative energy stocks without disclosing the true nature and risk of maintaining these investments in such large concentrations. This strategy was completely unsuitable for the Claimant and the Respondents made no attempt to protect her life savings.
GARY M. BRADSHAW (CRD# 1389924) has been registered in the securities industry for 31 years and is registered with the following firm since 02/1990:
FIRST DALLAS SECURITIES INCORPORATED
2905 MAPLE AVE.
DALLAS, TX 75201
If you or a loved one had large concentrated positions in oil and gas related investments with First Dallas Securities Incorporated broker, Gary M. Bradshaw, or any other broker/dealer, call (888) 760-6552 for a free consultation with an attorney. Soreide Law Group handles cases nationwide before FINRA and operates on a contingency fee.

Testimonials



Our experience with Lars Soreide was very satisfying. He is a very sincere and dedicated lawyer. He did an excellent job in representing us in front of the arbitrator.We recovered 100% of the funds that we invested with the stockbroker. We highly recommend him.WILL GILLMAN • CLIENTMr. Soreide represented me and Everything went great. I highly recommend hiring Mr. Soreide. Preparation is key and he was super prepared for the hearing. Thank You.TODD FREDERICK • CLIENTWe are so happy we chose Lars K. Soreide of Soreide Law Group to handle a claim against our stock broker. Our long trusted broker was actually not to be trusted. We had lost over 6 figures because of illegal activity the FBI charged him with. We were devastated since my husband and I were in retirement. I researched for many hours before deciding on Lars Soreide to handle the case against our broker to try and recover some of our losses. He was professional and did an outstanding job. He knew how to reach a settlement when another legal firm representing a large group could not reach a settlement due to the size of that groups claim. We are so happy we did not go with the large group and chose someone that would concentrate on our loss and our settlement. We are very satisfied with the way he handled and settled our case. ANN HODY • CLIENTThe Soreide Law Group was of great help to us. They are true professionals in the field of the SEC law and in our case they won a satisfactory settlement. KRISTINA HALL • CLIENTExtremely Knowledgeable, professional, and prompt. No communication issues whatsoever and, of course, the desired best possible outcome was achieved.BRIAN FERY • CLIENTSoreide Law Group helped my wife and I recover a portion of what we lost with an Atlanta brokerage firm. Soreide stayed in touch every step of the way and concluded our claim in the amount of time they originally stated. Very good experience. KEN MILLS • CLIENTLars Soreide is a fantastic litigator and helped me recover 90% of my losses through my broker. After a sick wife, i took my eyes off my brokerage account – turns out the guy was running trades that were substantially more aggressive than the conservative basis i had established my portfolio under. He helped me arbitrate my case and litigated the matter. What do you know, they wound up firing the broker and paid me almost 100% of my losses. This guy is fantastic and will fight harder than any other lawyer I’m convinced to regain your money. He doesn’t get paid unless you do!!JEFFREY K • CLIENTExcellent Attorney, Trustworthy, Knowledgeable and Responsive.
I have many years experience in the legal field and I found Lars to be among the best attorneys that I have had the pleasure of dealing with. I have never had the need to file an action on behalf of myself or my family before. My mother’s life savings was lost to an investment which involved some unscrupulous dealings. I decided that I needed to do something to help my mother recover some of her savings as this investment devastated her financially. After investigating and speaking with several attorneys I was most impressed with Lars. I have dealt with many attorneys over the years due to my work and I found Lars to be extremely intelligent, compassionate and very knowledgeable in this field of litigation. Lars was on top of every detail of the process. Due to his prowess my mother was able to recover a good portion of her lost investment. I cannot say enough about his straight forward dealings with us as well as his compassion towards my mother and her situation. He truly believed in what he was doing for us and he brought this attitude in to the case. If I ever had to file suit again I would not hesitate to contact Lars again in a second. I cannot recommend him enough. He does not relegate you to his staff but he speaks with you directly every time. I was most impressed with his attitude, responsiveness, knowledge and compassion. I cannot thank him enough for helping our family in our time of need.JOHN C • CLIENTThank God for this Guy! Lars Soreide is amazing. He recovered over a half a million dollars of my funds from my churn and burn broker who actually counter sued me after filing the lawsuit. I didn’t even know it was possible to bring this type of lawsuit through FINRA to recover. Glad I went through with it. Would recommend Lars to anyone.Michael M • CLIENTMr. Soreide is very honest, he never promised an outcome but took the case when everyone said there was no case. I was very pleased with the outcome and how we recovered our losses and he saw it through until the end. Marissa Nugent • CLIENTI hired Lars Soreide to represent me against my stock broker who was running a ponzi scheme. Soreide Law sued the firm for not catching the fraud he was running. The case went to a full trial before 3 arbitrators and they awarded us back every dollar I lost in the Ponzi scheme. My wife and I felt this was totally hopeless because the stock broker was in jail and had no money but we collected every penny back from the firm. We owe a huge THANK YOU to Soreide Law Group. Dominic M. • CLIENT5.0 Out of 5.0 Overall Superb Client Review RatingLawyers.com

                                                    Coffeyville, Kansas, is the only fertilizer facility in
                                                    North America that utilizes a petroleum coke, or pet coke,
                                                    gasification process to produce nitrogen fertilizer. The
                                                    plant, which sits on 35 acres, includes a 1,300 ton-per-day
                                                    ammonia unit, a 3,000 ton-per-day urea ammonium nitrate

                                                    million standard cubic feet per day of hydrogen. Our
                                                    gasifier is a dual-train facility, with each gasifier able
                                                    to function independently of the other, thereby providing
                                                    redundancy and improving reliability.

                                                    secure raw material supply. The primary raw material
                                                    feedstock used in the plant's nitrogen fertilizer production
                                                    process is pet coke, which is produced during the crude oil
                                                    refining process. We currently purchase most of our pet coke
                                                    from CVR Refining, which owns the Coffeyville refinery

It is currently the policy of the Board of Directors of the general partner of CVR Partners to distribute all of the available cash we generate each quarter, as determined by the Board of Directors.

We generally intend to pay our distributions within 60 days after the end of each quarter to unitholders of record on the applicable record date. However, as described in our public filings, the Board of Directors of the general partner of CVR Partners reserves the right to change the distribution policy at any time, and the partnership agreement which governs CVR Partners does not require the partnership to make distributions at all.

CVR Partners LP: CVR Partners Reports 2017 Second Quarter Results


Tickers:
                    UAN 




      
        SUGAR LAND, Texas, July 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- CVR Partners, LP (NYSE: UAN), a manufacturer of ammonia and urea ammonium nitrate (UAN) solution fertilizer products, today announced a second quarter 2017 net loss of $3.5 million, or 3 cents per common unit, on net sales of $97.9 million, compared to a net loss of $17.0 million, or 15 cents per common unit, on net sales of $119.8 million for the second quarter a year earlier. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $32.3 million for the second quarter of 2017, compared to adjusted EBITDA of $29.1 million for the second quarter of 2016.
      
      
      
        For the first six months of 2017, CVR Partners had a net loss of $13.8 million, or 12 cents per common unit, on net sales of $183.2 million, compared to net income of $1.0 million, or 1 cent per common unit, on net sales of $192.9 million for the comparable period a year earlier. Adjusted EBITDA for the first six months of 2017 was $53.1 million, compared to adjusted EBITDA of $57.0 million for the first six months of 2016.
      
      
Top Company Interviews


        CVR Partners' results include the results of the East Dubuque fertilizer facility beginning April 1, 2016.
      
      
        'The East Dubuque fertilizer facility continued to achieve high on-stream rates during the 2017 second quarter, with the ammonia plant posting a record on-stream rate of 100 percent,' said Mark Pytosh, chief executive officer. 'The gasification and ammonia plants at our Coffeyville facility operated at on-stream rates above 98 percent, however, we experienced approximately 11 days of downtime in the UAN plant related to outages at Linde's air separation facility.
      
      
        'Nitrogen fertilizer pricing continues to be impacted by additional production, particularly in the United States. In the U.S., we saw a marked decrease in imported nitrogen product as the spring progressed,' Pytosh said. 'The last of the large U.S. capacity expansions is expected to come online and enter production during the third quarter and trade flows have been adjusting to the new capacity. While the market completes this transition, we will continue to focus on operating our plants at high on-stream rates, maximizing our marketing and logistics efforts and prudently managing costs and capital spending.'
      
      
        Consolidated Operations
      
      
        For the second quarter of 2017, consolidated average realized gate prices for UAN and ammonia were $174 per ton and $333 per ton, respectively. Consolidated average realized gate prices for UAN and ammonia were $199 per ton and $417 per ton, respectively, for the same period in 2016.
      
      
        CVR Partners' fertilizer facilities produced a combined 215,300 tons of ammonia during the second quarter of 2017, of which 77,500 net tons were available for sale while the rest was upgraded to other fertilizer products, including 313,800 tons of UAN. In the 2016 second quarter, the fertilizer facilities produced 171,500 tons of ammonia, of which 45,600 net tons were available for sale while the remainder was upgraded to other fertilizer products, including 296,500 tons of UAN.
      
      
        Distributions
      
      
        CVR Partners will not pay a cash distribution for the 2017 second quarter. CVR Partners is a variable distribution master limited partnership. As a result, its quarterly distributions, if any, will vary from quarter to quarter due to several factors, including, but not limited to, its operating performance, fluctuations in the prices received for its finished products, maintenance capital expenditures, and cash reserves deemed necessary or appropriate by the board of directors of its general partner.
      
      
        2017 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call
      
      
        CVR Partners previously announced that it will host its 2017 second quarter Earnings Conference Call for analysts and investors on Thursday, July 27, at 11 a.m. Eastern.

______________________________
















(1)


Product pricing at gate represents net sales less freight revenue divided by product sales volume in tons and is shown in order to provide a pricing measure that is comparable across the fertilizer industry.










(2)


Gross tons produced for ammonia represent total ammonia produced, including ammonia produced that was upgraded into other fertilizer products. Net tons available for sale represent ammonia available for sale that was not upgraded into other fertilizer products.










(3)


The cost per MMBtu excludes derivative activity, when applicable. The impact of natural gas derivative activity during the periods presented was not material.










(4)


On-stream factor is the total number of hours operated divided by the total number of hours in the reporting period and is included as a measure of operating efficiency.





Coffeyville Facility
The Linde air separation unit experienced a shut down during the second quarter of 2017. Following the Linde outage, the Coffeyville Facility UAN unit experienced a number of operational challenges, resulting in approximately 11 days of UAN downtime during the three months ended June 30, 2017. Excluding the impact of the Linde air separation unit outage at the Coffeyville Facility, the UAN unit on-stream factors at the Coffeyville Facility would have been 99.5% and 98.1%, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017.
      
      
        East Dubuque Facility
Excluding the impact of the full facility turnaround at the East Dubuque Facility, the on-stream factors at the East Dubuque Facility would have been 100% for ammonia and 99.6% for UAN for the three months ended June 30, 2016.
      
      
        Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
      
      
        To supplement our actual results calculated in accordance with GAAP for the applicable periods, the Partnership also uses the non-GAAP financial measures noted above, which are reconciled to our GAAP based results below. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP results.
      
      
        EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before (i) interest (income) expense, (ii) income tax expense and (iii) depreciation and amortization expense.
      
      
        Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA further adjusted for the impact of major scheduled turnaround expenses, gain or loss on extinguishment of debt, loss on disposition of assets, expenses associated with the East Dubuque Merger, and business interruption insurance recovery, when applicable.
      
      
        We present EBITDA because we believe it allows users of our financial statements, such as investors and analysts, to assess our financial performance without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis. We present Adjusted EBITDA because we have found it helpful to consider an operating measure that excludes amounts, such as major scheduled turnaround expenses, gain or loss on extinguishment of debt, loss on disposition of assets, expenses associated with the East Dubuque Merger, and business interruption insurance recovery, relating to transactions not reflective of our core operations. When applicable, each of these amounts is discussed in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our SEC reports, so that investors have complete information about these amounts. We also present Adjusted EBITDA because it is the starting point used by the board of directors of our general partner when calculating our available cash for distribution.
      
      
        EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under GAAP and should not be substituted for net income (loss) or cash flows from operations. Management believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA enable investors and analysts to better understand our ability to make distributions to common unitholders, help investors and analysts evaluate our ongoing operating results and allow for greater transparency in reviewing our overall financial, operational and economic performance by allowing investors to evaluate the same information used by management. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA presented by other companies may not be comparable to our presentation, since each company may define these terms differently.
      
      
        A reconciliation of consolidated Net income (loss) to consolidated EBITDA and consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is as follows:

        Available cash for distribution is not a recognized term under GAAP. Available cash for distribution should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income (loss) or operating income, or any other measure of financial performance or operating performance. In addition, available cash for distribution is not presented as, and should not be considered, an alternative to cash flows from operations or as a measure of liquidity. Available cash for distribution as reported by the Partnership may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other entities, thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.
      
      
        Available cash begins with Adjusted EBITDA reduced for cash needed for (i) net cash interest expense (excluding capitalized interest) and debt service and other contractual obligations; (ii) maintenance capital expenditures; and (iii) to the extent applicable, major scheduled turnaround expenses, reserves for future operating or capital needs that the board of directors of the general partner deems necessary or appropriate, and expenses associated with the East Dubuque Merger, if any. Available cash for distribution may be increased by the release of previously established cash reserves, if any, at the discretion of the board of directors of our general partner, and available cash is increased by the business interruption insurance proceeds and the impact of purchase accounting. Actual distributions are set by the board of directors of our general partner. The board of directors of our general partner may modify our cash distribution policy at any time, and our partnership agreement does not require us to make distributions at all.
      
      
        A reconciliation of consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to Available cash for distribution is as follows:

SUGAR LAND, Texas, July 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- CVR Partners, LP (NYSE:   UAN), a manufacturer of ammonia and urea ammonium nitrate (UAN) solution fertilizer products, today announced a second quarter 2017 net loss of $3.5 million, or 3 cents per common unit, on net sales of $97.9 million, compared to a net loss of $17.0 million, or 15 cents per common unit, on net sales of $119.8 million for the second quarter a year earlier. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $32.3 million for the second quarter of 2017, compared to adjusted EBITDA of $29.1 million for the second quarter of 2016.








For the first six months of 2017, CVR Partners had a net loss of $13.8 million, or 12 cents per common unit, on net sales of $183.2 million, compared to net income of $1.0 million, or 1 cent per common unit, on net sales of $192.9 million for the comparable period a year earlier. Adjusted EBITDA for the first six months of 2017 was $53.1 million, compared to adjusted EBITDA of $57.0 million for the first six months of 2016.
CVR Partners' results include the results of the East Dubuque fertilizer facility beginning April 1, 2016.
"The East Dubuque fertilizer facility continued to achieve high on-stream rates during the 2017 second quarter, with the ammonia plant posting a record on-stream rate of 100 percent," said Mark Pytosh, chief executive officer. "The gasification and ammonia plants at our Coffeyville facility operated at on-stream rates above 98 percent, however, we experienced approximately 11 days of downtime in the UAN plant related to outages at Linde's air separation facility. 
"Nitrogen fertilizer pricing continues to be impacted by additional production, particularly in the United States. In the U.S., we saw a marked decrease in imported nitrogen product as the spring progressed," Pytosh said. "The last of the large U.S. capacity expansions is expected to come online and enter production during the third quarter and trade flows have been adjusting to the new capacity. While the market completes this transition, we will continue to focus on operating our plants at high on-stream rates, maximizing our marketing and logistics efforts and prudently managing costs and capital spending." 
Consolidated Operations
For the second quarter of 2017, consolidated average realized gate prices for UAN and ammonia were $174 per ton and $333 per ton, respectively. Consolidated average realized gate prices for UAN and ammonia were $199 per ton and $417 per ton, respectively, for the same period in 2016. 
CVR Partners' fertilizer facilities produced a combined 215,300 tons of ammonia during the second quarter of 2017, of which 77,500 net tons were available for sale while the rest was upgraded to other fertilizer products, including 313,800 tons of UAN. In the 2016 second quarter, the fertilizer facilities produced 171,500 tons of ammonia, of which 45,600 net tons were available for sale while the remainder was upgraded to other fertilizer products, including 296,500 tons of UAN.
Distributions
CVR Partners will not pay a cash distribution for the 2017 second quarter. CVR Partners is a variable distribution master limited partnership. As a result, its quarterly distributions, if any, will vary from quarter to quarter due to several factors, including, but not limited to, its operating performance, fluctuations in the prices received for its finished products, maintenance capital expenditures, and cash reserves deemed necessary or appropriate by the board of directors of its general partner.
2017 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call
CVR Partners previously announced that it will host its 2017 second quarter Earnings Conference Call for analysts and investors on Thursday, July 27, at 11 a.m. Eastern. The Earnings Conference Call may also include discussion of the Partnership's developments, forward-looking information and other material information about business and financial matters.
The Earnings Conference Call will be broadcast live over the Internet at https://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/1004/21796. For investors or analysts who want to participate during the call, the dial-in number is (877) 407-8029.
For those unable to listen live, the webcast will be archived and available for 14 days at https://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/1004/21796. A repeat of the conference call can be accessed by dialing (877) 660-6853, conference ID 13666027.
This release serves as a qualified notice to nominees and brokers as provided for under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1446-4(b).

 ______________________________ 












 (1) 
 Product pricing at gate represents net sales less freight revenue divided by product sales volume in tons and is shown in order to provide a pricing measure that is comparable across the fertilizer industry.  






 (2) 
 Gross tons produced for ammonia represent total ammonia produced, including ammonia produced that was upgraded into other fertilizer products. Net tons available for sale represent ammonia available for sale that was not upgraded into other fertilizer products. 






 (3) 
 The cost per MMBtu excludes derivative activity, when applicable. The impact of natural gas derivative activity during the periods presented was not material. 






 (4) 
 On-stream factor is the total number of hours operated divided by the total number of hours in the reporting period and is included as a measure of operating efficiency.  




Coffeyville FacilityThe Linde air separation unit experienced a shut down during the second quarter of 2017. Following the Linde outage, the Coffeyville Facility UAN unit experienced a number of operational challenges, resulting in approximately 11 days of UAN downtime during the three months ended June 30, 2017. Excluding the impact of the Linde air separation unit outage at the Coffeyville Facility, the UAN unit on-stream factors at the Coffeyville Facility would have been 99.5% and 98.1%, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017.
East Dubuque FacilityExcluding the impact of the full facility turnaround at the East Dubuque Facility, the on-stream factors at the East Dubuque Facility would have been 100% for ammonia and 99.6% for UAN for the three months ended June 30, 2016.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement our actual results calculated in accordance with GAAP for the applicable periods, the Partnership also uses the non-GAAP financial measures noted above, which are reconciled to our GAAP based results below. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP results. 
EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before (i) interest (income) expense, (ii) income tax expense and (iii) depreciation and amortization expense.
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA further adjusted for the impact of major scheduled turnaround expenses, gain or loss on extinguishment of debt, loss on disposition of assets, expenses associated with the East Dubuque Merger, and business interruption insurance recovery, when applicable. 
We present EBITDA because we believe it allows users of our financial statements, such as investors and analysts, to assess our financial performance without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis. We present Adjusted EBITDA because we have found it helpful to consider an operating measure that excludes amounts, such as major scheduled turnaround expenses, gain or loss on extinguishment of debt, loss on disposition of assets, expenses associated with the East Dubuque Merger, and business interruption insurance recovery, relating to transactions not reflective of our core operations. When applicable, each of these amounts is discussed in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our SEC reports, so that investors have complete information about these amounts. We also present Adjusted EBITDA because it is the starting point used by the board of directors of our general partner when calculating our available cash for distribution. 
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under GAAP and should not be substituted for net income (loss) or cash flows from operations. Management believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA enable investors and analysts to better understand our ability to make distributions to common unitholders, help investors and analysts evaluate our ongoing operating results and allow for greater transparency in reviewing our overall financial, operational and economic performance by allowing investors to evaluate the same information used by management. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA presented by other companies may not be comparable to our presentation, since each company may define these terms differently.
A reconciliation of consolidated Net income (loss) to consolidated EBITDA and consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is as follows:

Available cash for distribution is not a recognized term under GAAP. Available cash for distribution should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income (loss) or operating income, or any other measure of financial performance or operating performance. In addition, available cash for distribution is not presented as, and should not be considered, an alternative to cash flows from operations or as a measure of liquidity. Available cash for distribution as reported by the Partnership may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other entities, thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.
Available cash begins with Adjusted EBITDA reduced for cash needed for (i) net cash interest expense (excluding capitalized interest) and debt service and other contractual obligations; (ii) maintenance capital expenditures; and (iii) to the extent applicable, major scheduled turnaround expenses, reserves for future operating or capital needs that the board of directors of the general partner deems necessary or appropriate, and expenses associated with the East Dubuque Merger, if any. Available cash for distribution may be increased by the release of previously established cash reserves, if any, at the discretion of the board of directors of our general partner, and available cash is increased by the business interruption insurance proceeds and the impact of purchase accounting. Actual distributions are set by the board of directors of our general partner. The board of directors of our general partner may modify our cash distribution policy at any time, and our partnership agreement does not require us to make distributions at all.
A reconciliation of consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to Available cash for distribution is as follows:

Buy CVR Partners LP Before Fertilizer Prices Reverse - CVR Partners, LP (NYSE:UAN) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Buy CVR Partners LP Before Fertilizer Prices ReverseJun. 6.17 | About: CVR Partners, (UAN) Stock Reporter Long/short equity, value, macro, research analystSummaryMany have been short fertilizer equities over the last five years. During this period prices were unfeasibly high and the market was oversupplied.Throughout the fertilizer bear market CVR Partners LP has remained cash flow positive and the balance sheet is stable.While it is difficult to locate the true bottom, when nitrogen fertilizer prices rebound I believe CVR Partners LP is one of the fertilizer stocks that will generate significant upside.Many have been short fertilizer equities over the last five years. During this period prices were unfeasibly high and the market was oversupplied. Correspondingly, CVR Partner LP's (NYSE:UAN) shares fell from ~$28-29 to below $4. This was accompanied by its per-share distribution falling from $2.21 in 2012 to zero in 2016. At the time of this writing, shares were trading at all time lows and I believe now is a good time to take advantage of the recent weakness. While it is difficult to locate the true bottom, when nitrogen fertilizer prices rebound I believe CVR is one of the fertilizer stocks that will generate significant upside returns as well as resume distribution payments. Company Background I figured I would begin this article with a bit of context around CVR Partners LP's business given the company seems to have been neglected by other Seeking Alpha contributors. CVR Partners LP is a limited partnership formed by CVR Energy. CVR Partners LP has two manufacturing facilities, one located in Coffeyville, Kansas and the other in East Dubuque, Illinois, where it produces and distributes nitrogen fertilizer products, which mainly includes ammonia and urea ammonium nitrate, or UAN for short, fertilizers. Coffeyville Facility The Coffeyville facility began production in 2000 and is the only plant in North America that uses a petroleum coke ("pet coke") gasification process to produce nitrogen fertilizer. The facility is also strategically located next to CVR Refining's refinery which over the past five years has supplied over 70% of the pet coke consumed by the facility. The company typically buys pet coke from CVR Refining, they purchase 100% of the pet coke produced, for lower prices than they would otherwise pay to third parties. They have been able to source the remainder of pet coke requirements from third parties at market prices. They have a pet coke supply agreement that ends December 2017 and it will be important to monitor their ability to purchase pet coke on comparable terms going forward. Their process allows them to convert the ammonia they produce into UAN, urea ammonium nitrate used as a fertilizer, which demands a premium price. During 2016, about 93% ammonia produced was converted into UAN.
 East Dubuque Facility As a recent development, CVR Partners acquired Rentech Nitrogen Partners on April 1st, 2016 and the primary plant is the East Dubuque fertilizer plant. This plant uses natural gas to produce nitrogen fertilizer and is conveniently located on the Mississippi River and has access to a barge dock for loading purposes. It is worth noting that fluctuations in natural gas prices can impact profitability but more recently CVR has benefitted from the fall in gas prices. Additionally, the facility has the flexibility to vary its product mix depending on seasonality factors, market demand, and pricing. However, sales primarily consist of ammonia and UAN. Demand, Markets, Seasonality, and Storage Global fertilizer demand is influenced by a number of factors including grain demand, population growth, dietary changes, and increased consumption of bio-fuels. According to the International Fertilizer Industry Association, from 1974 to 2014 global fertilizer demand grew 2.1% on an annualized basis. Going forward over the 2010 to 2030 period, according to the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations global fertilizer is expected to increase by 34%. Furthermore, developed market populations are transitioning to more protein-oriented diets thereby increasing demand for grain for animal feed. China's wheat and coarse grains production increased an estimated 48% from 2006 to 2016 and is still struggling to satisfy demand. As a result, China increased wheat and coarse grain imports by over 500% over this period, according to the United States Department of Agriculture. The United States is also the largest coarse grains exporter, accounting for 32% of global exports as of September 2016. The fertilizer business is seasonal with the heavy demand periods occurring in spring and fall in the corn belt which includes Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, and Wisconsin states as well as in the summer in the the wheat belt which includes Kansas, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Texas states. The first half of the calendar year tends to have higher net sales, which CVR refers to as the planting season, and the second half of the year tends to have lower net sales, which CVR refers to as the fill season. To meet demand during these periods, they will allow inventories to accumulate and they have capacity to store ~160,000 tons of UAN and ~80,000 tons of ammonia in storage tanks located at their two production facilities. Demand is further impacted by planting and fertilizer application rate decisions on farmers that make decisions based on crop prices, soil conditions, weather patterns, etc.
 Competition Competition in the fertilizer industry is fierce. Price is the determining factor. However, during high demand periods of increased farming activities delivery capacity becomes a material differentiating factor. To best accommodate demand, CVR seasonally adjusts its inventory and owns a leased railcar fleet. Notable competitors include Potash, Agrium, CF Industries Holdings, and Koch Nitrogen Company. Additionally, there is foreign competition from international producers that export to the United States. However, fertilizer is very costly to export with long delivery times which poses a challenge for internationals to compete with a conveniently located producer such as CVR (located in close proximity to the corn and wheat belts). CVR's location within the U.S. farm belt is in many instances closer to the end user than other domestic competitors that incur greater costs in transporting fertilizer over long distances. Key Operating Statistics I've included a snapshot of CVR's operating statistics for the past five years. At the very bottom in the market indicators section, you can see how ammonium and UAN prices have declined. 

 Source: CVR Partners LP Balance Sheet In conjunction with the East Dubuque Merger, on April 1, 2016, CVR incurred additional indebtedness. The acquisition was driven by the decision to diversify production processes whereby CVR acquired Rentech Nitrogen Partners, which operated a facility (East Dubuque) that uses natural gas as the main input to produce nitrogen fertilizer. In June 2016, CVR issued $645 million of 2023 notes which was necessary to complete the transaction although was costly in the short term. The merger allows CVR to capitalize on low natural gas prices, as their competitors have been able to enjoy, and to further benefit from a recovery in nitrogen fertilizer prices. However following the merger, as of the first quarter of 2017 interest expenses stood at $15.7 million which is equivalent to just under $0.14 per share. Assuming $0.14 per quarter, this adds up to $0.56 per share for the year 2017 which is not immaterial. For reference, interest payments as of the first quarter of 2016 were just $1.7 million. That being said, throughout the fertilizer bear market CVR has remained cash flow positive and the balance sheet is stable.
 

 Source: CVR Partners LP Risks  There is risk nitrogen fertilizer prices will continue to fall. CVR incurs significant fixed costs to operate their two plants and if fertilizer prices fall below a certain level profitability and ability to make distributions going forward would be negatively impacted. CVR primarily produces UAN, urea ammonium nitrate, which has historically demanded a premium over other fertilizers. However, in recent quarters this premium has decreased. Additionally, CVR's pet coke production process employed by the Coffeyville facility served as a competitive edge for cheaper production while competitors used more expensive natural gas. Today's low natural gas prices have taken away some of CVR's advantage from their cost effective pet coke process. However, the East Dubuque plant, acquired in April 2016, uses natural gas to produce nitrogen fertilizer whereby low natural gas prices are beneficial. For the year 2016, the top five customers accounted for 32% of net sales with the top two customers accounting for 10%. While this is high customer concentration, a single customer loss would not have material operational effects. Unlike other industries, CVR does not have long-term minimum purchase contracts with their customers. This is industry practice. The company is exposed to extensive regulatory risk.  While it is difficult to identify a true bottom and prices may be volatile over the next 1-3 months, I believe now is the time to buy CVR Partners ahead of a rebound in nitrogen fertilizer prices. CVR's balance sheet is stable for the near-term if prices remain low, but I believe the stock will generate significant upside returns in the event of a recovery in prices.

Testimonials



Our experience with Lars Soreide was very satisfying. He is a very sincere and dedicated lawyer. He did an excellent job in representing us in front of the arbitrator.We recovered 100% of the funds that we invested with the stockbroker. We highly recommend him.WILL GILLMAN • CLIENTMr. Soreide represented me and Everything went great. I highly recommend hiring Mr. Soreide. Preparation is key and he was super prepared for the hearing. Thank You.TODD FREDERICK • CLIENTWe are so happy we chose Lars K. Soreide of Soreide Law Group to handle a claim against our stock broker. Our long trusted broker was actually not to be trusted. We had lost over 6 figures because of illegal activity the FBI charged him with. We were devastated since my husband and I were in retirement. I researched for many hours before deciding on Lars Soreide to handle the case against our broker to try and recover some of our losses. He was professional and did an outstanding job. He knew how to reach a settlement when another legal firm representing a large group could not reach a settlement due to the size of that groups claim. We are so happy we did not go with the large group and chose someone that would concentrate on our loss and our settlement. We are very satisfied with the way he handled and settled our case. ANN HODY • CLIENTThe Soreide Law Group was of great help to us. They are true professionals in the field of the SEC law and in our case they won a satisfactory settlement. KRISTINA HALL • CLIENTExtremely Knowledgeable, professional, and prompt. No communication issues whatsoever and, of course, the desired best possible outcome was achieved.BRIAN FERY • CLIENTSoreide Law Group helped my wife and I recover a portion of what we lost with an Atlanta brokerage firm. Soreide stayed in touch every step of the way and concluded our claim in the amount of time they originally stated. Very good experience. KEN MILLS • CLIENTLars Soreide is a fantastic litigator and helped me recover 90% of my losses through my broker. After a sick wife, i took my eyes off my brokerage account – turns out the guy was running trades that were substantially more aggressive than the conservative basis i had established my portfolio under. He helped me arbitrate my case and litigated the matter. What do you know, they wound up firing the broker and paid me almost 100% of my losses. This guy is fantastic and will fight harder than any other lawyer I’m convinced to regain your money. He doesn’t get paid unless you do!!JEFFREY K • CLIENTExcellent Attorney, Trustworthy, Knowledgeable and Responsive.
I have many years experience in the legal field and I found Lars to be among the best attorneys that I have had the pleasure of dealing with. I have never had the need to file an action on behalf of myself or my family before. My mother’s life savings was lost to an investment which involved some unscrupulous dealings. I decided that I needed to do something to help my mother recover some of her savings as this investment devastated her financially. After investigating and speaking with several attorneys I was most impressed with Lars. I have dealt with many attorneys over the years due to my work and I found Lars to be extremely intelligent, compassionate and very knowledgeable in this field of litigation. Lars was on top of every detail of the process. Due to his prowess my mother was able to recover a good portion of her lost investment. I cannot say enough about his straight forward dealings with us as well as his compassion towards my mother and her situation. He truly believed in what he was doing for us and he brought this attitude in to the case. If I ever had to file suit again I would not hesitate to contact Lars again in a second. I cannot recommend him enough. He does not relegate you to his staff but he speaks with you directly every time. I was most impressed with his attitude, responsiveness, knowledge and compassion. I cannot thank him enough for helping our family in our time of need.JOHN C • CLIENTThank God for this Guy! Lars Soreide is amazing. He recovered over a half a million dollars of my funds from my churn and burn broker who actually counter sued me after filing the lawsuit. I didn’t even know it was possible to bring this type of lawsuit through FINRA to recover. Glad I went through with it. Would recommend Lars to anyone.Michael M • CLIENTMr. Soreide is very honest, he never promised an outcome but took the case when everyone said there was no case. I was very pleased with the outcome and how we recovered our losses and he saw it through until the end. Marissa Nugent • CLIENTI hired Lars Soreide to represent me against my stock broker who was running a ponzi scheme. Soreide Law sued the firm for not catching the fraud he was running. The case went to a full trial before 3 arbitrators and they awarded us back every dollar I lost in the Ponzi scheme. My wife and I felt this was totally hopeless because the stock broker was in jail and had no money but we collected every penny back from the firm. We owe a huge THANK YOU to Soreide Law Group. Dominic M. • CLIENT5.0 Out of 5.0 Overall Superb Client Review RatingLawyers.com
