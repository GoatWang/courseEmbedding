		Becker's Healthcare: Why Henry Ford would be an advocate for value-based care
    

Understanding the assembly line of an episode
If disintermediation is the future of healthcare delivery, what can we learn from industries that have undergone similar transformations? One of the greatest innovators and 'disintermediators' of our time was Henry Ford, who is well-known for his use of the assembly line technique of production to systematically lower costs – and make cars accessible and affordable to the masses. How would Henry Ford evaluate the current state of our fee-for-service model?

Why we exist — Clarify Health Solutions
































































 CLARIFY HEALTH
Healthcare is not always what it should be
Find out more





 


      The healthcare industry today faces many challenges. Gaps in communication between patients and their care teams create confusion, delays, and anxiety. Doctors, nurses, and broader care teams are faced with busy schedules and limited resources. Hospital leaders are under pressure to increase efficiency, but they don’t have the critical analysis and technology to support their efforts. The cause is broken processes and inefficient workflows, which results in significant waste and a poor patient experience. Solutions on the market today only focus on a small piece of the problem that needs to be solved — and they’re not actionable in real-time. But changes in how services are billed are forcing hospitals to evolve, and advances in technology have created an opportunity to reimagine the way care is delivered. 
    

 






      Optimizing workflows, fixing journeys
    

        The tangible value we deliver is in optimizing workflows and patient care journeys. This requires changing the current models of care. We developed the Clarify Health solution by listening to what stakeholders in healthcare expect and need from each other.
      





      What patients want
    Patients want precise, personalized, high-quality care at an affordable price. More specifically, they expect:

Easy access to quality care providers
Respect for their time
The fastest recovery possible


To get back to fully enjoying life
Care they can afford





     What clinicians want
     Doctors, nurses, and other caregivers face demanding schedules that leave little time for meaningful engagement with patients. They are open to change, but sometimes skeptical of ineffective management strategies. They want to focus on what really matters:
    

Increased time with patients
Real-time feedback on patient progress


Less administrative burden
Employing their most valuable skills






     What health systems want
    
     The healthcare industry is inefficient. Hospitals face pressure from all sides to deliver a service promise of higher value care. Health systems want to:    

Optimize workflows to eliminate excess cost and wasted time
Evolve and adapt successfully to the new value-based approach
Monitor program progress and efficiencies


Use technology to better engage and communicate with patients
Build patient trust and loyalty
Increase clinician satisfaction with the care they provide



 


      Shifting trends and industry pressure
    

   The healthcare industry is transitioning to a fee-for-value system, where a single facility will assume accountability for the overall outcomes and cost of a patient's journey of care. We believe that focusing on delivering great care to patients will ensure success regardless of the specifics of the payment model. The Clarify solution is designed with this philosophy in mind.

That said, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) are leading the transition with the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (CJR) and Bundled Payment for Care Improvement (BPCI) programs. These programs present not only a challenge for health systems, but also an opportunity to transform how they deliver care across the continuum. 

    





    CJR
    

    Medicare’s Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (CJR) program holds a hospital accountable for the cost of the entire episode of care, from hospital admission until 90 days after discharge. Medicare sets a target price, and hospitals earn a bonus or penalty depending on performance relative to that target. Hospitals can increase their potential bonus by performing well on quality and patient satisfaction metrics.  
The Clarify solution can help you maximize the value of this program. Contact us to find out more.
    

      Key CJR Facts:
    

Started on April 1, 2016
Makes hospitals accountable for entire episodes of care
Could impact hospital revenue +/- 50% for the relevant procedures 


Allows gainsharing with patients and other providers who directly serve the patient
Applies to ~800 hospitals (download the list below)
Will roll out gradually over the next five years





Contact our CJR experts



      BPCI
    
CMS launched the Bundled Payment for Care Improvement (BPCI) program in 2013 to help lower costs and improve patient care. This voluntary pilot program is currently testing four different models.
Key BPCI facts:

BPCI has already launched and is not accepting new participants 
Participants can choose from 48 different episodes of care
Of the four BPCI models, Model 1 and 4 are less common and only include the inpatient stay


Model 2 and 3 include in the episode any post-acute care and other related services for a defined period of time after discharge
Model 2 and 3 participants earn a bonus (or penalty) based on cost performance
Model 2 and 3 participants are initially paid fee-for-service, with a year-end reconciliation






       The Clarify solution can help you manage your BPCI bundles. Contact us to find out more.

Testimonials




Dovetail has everything successfully indexed and “search” features is a big hit with the users.Gary Storey, Dovetail Systems Administrator | Macy’sThe rollout of Dovetail mobile is a huge win for the Field Agents. Dovetail Seeker has also been a huge win. It’s great to be able to redirect customers to the site knowing they can search and find answers to their questions. The volume to the call center has dropped substantially.Eddie Surabian, Manager of Help Desk | Pulte HomesWe couldn’t be happier with our decision. My advice for any Clarify thick client users looking to replace or upgrade their systems is to work with Dovetail Software.David Nunnally, Business Control Systems Team Lead | Command AlkonWe could not be more pleased to have this strategic partnership and the quality support that Dovetail’s staff provides.Shawn Zudal, VP of M.I.S. | MicrosOur newfound ability to expose customer data to other parts of the enterprise using Dovetail is awesome – there is no way we could have done this with Amdocs.Darcy Roessler, Project Manager | Best BuyDovetail provided the quickest way to achieve our objectives, in part because it removed the need to re-engineer Clarify, which would have added a lot of time and cost to the project.Neal Cao, Applications Development Manager | AkibiaI want to thank Gary of Dovetail for expeditiously examining the problem and providing a quick resolution.Andrew Szendey, Programs Manager | Global Customer CareIt has been an absolute pleasure to work with Dovetail. Our relationship has been wonderful since Day #1 and continues to strengthen.  Thank you for being a true partner with H&R Block.  I consider our relationship to be among the best I have with any IT vendor I work with (and I work with over 500!).John Meiers, Sourcing Leader | H&R BlockMigrating from our outdated platform to Dovetail Support Suite has been a tremendous upgrade for us, providing benefits across multiple areas of our business. We realized an immediate 50% reduction in IT maintenance expenses around our CRM platform after deploying Dovetail’s browser-based client architecture.Stephen Stark, President | USICA big part of the reason Therma-Wave chose Dovetail was value.  We were paying too much money for the quality of the service and support we received with our previous vendor.   It took a lot of persistence to find anyone who had the expertise to help with our problems.Kristina Pereyra, Enterprise Wide Programmer Analyst | Therma-WaveDovetail Software offered us a cost-effective and efficient solution that seamlessly integrates with our IFO initiative and Fast-Track Services.Barbara Switzer, Senior Manager of Applications Programming | Global CrossingDovetail enabled us to easily and inexpensively connect our SAP applications and free up resources to deliver ongoing value rather than focus on middleware.Steve Lucchesi, Senior IT Director | Intuitive Surgical
