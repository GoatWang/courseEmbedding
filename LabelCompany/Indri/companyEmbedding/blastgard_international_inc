Technology
 



Industry ApplicationsIn aircraft dry bays, cargo holds, and containers.BlastWrap® technology offers the only practical means of protecting commercial aircraft against internal detonation of solid explosive charges without requiring specially hardened luggage containers. BlastWrap®, for example, can be used as cargo compartment linings and partitions.BlastWrap®'s weight and dimensions are well within the allowable margins for these aircraft. Use of BlastWrap® linings in air cargo containers enhances protection capabilities, and BlastWrap® is unique in being suitable for retrofit in existing containers.As walls to protect buildings against vehicle bombsAboard naval vessels and merchant ships to minimize damage from breaching blasts emanating from mines, cruise missiles, and torpedoesTo surround fuel tanks for suppressing fireballs' and explosionsAs dividers to suppress fireballs and fuel mist explosions from accidents aboard both aircraft and ships, in process facilities, and on offshore platforms to suppress fireballs and explosionsAs separators and partitions in explosives manufacturing and handling facilities, such as a load/assembly/pack (LAP) depots, fireworks plants, and propellant manufacturing sitesAs pallets and buffers between stacks of palletized munitions and ordnanceTo line portable and fixed magazinesTo make missile launch boxes for military vehicles and naval vesselsTo make cabinets and containers for handling fuses, small rockets, and explosive devicesTo build and maintain reputation as industry leader and reputable supplierTo expand market size and share, exploiting past sales, contacts, and technology innovations to maximum advantage.BlastWrap® products protect against outdoor/unconfined explosions. Because of the Montreal protocol's ban of Halon extinguishing agents, BlastWrap® is the only blast and fire suppression means available for most applications, including adaptation for underwater use. It is an inherently effective sound absorber and thermal insulator.BlastWrap® works indoors or out, vented or unvented, wet or dry, clean or dirty, damaged or intact, and against strong or weak blasts from solid explosives or flammable fluids. It is a lightweight, space-efficient custom-engineered product for insulation, fragment/ballistic protection, environmental protection or impact and cushioning barriers. Significantly, no new or high-cost fabrication technologies or materials are required to produce BlastWrap® products. New Market SectorsBlast effect-mitigation for hydrocarbon and process industriesQuick-erect blast protection barriers and revetmentsFireball and explosion-suppressing fuel tank jackets (for natural and compressed natural gas, propane, and other "green fuel" vehicle systems)Demilitarization protection productsBlast effect mitigation materials for existing structures' & facilities (magazines, explosive's storage units, warships, propellant plants, etc.)Blast protection shields, armors, and structures with "stealth" ("low-observable") camouflage propertiesBlast/fire protection linings for commercial and military aircraft and air cargo containersBlast and ballistic-protected modular buildings (barracks, control and accommodations for offshore facilities, field stations, tactical shelters and command facilities, monitoring stations for law enforcement)Underwater blast isolation units for offshore facility abandonments, coastal construction, and naval vessels.Replacement of Existing TechnologiesComposite structures (non blast), such as topsides for offshore facilities, FPSOs, neutral buoyancy jackets for deepwater drilling risers, and sub-sea manifold protectionComposite blast/fire protection structures and materials (blast walls, blast mitigation billboards, relief vents, reinforcement of masonry buildings) for hydrocarbon, process, mining, missile launch, and manufacturing facilities, and for building demolitionsExplosive's storage and shipping containers, portable magazines, and explosive disposal kitsMine blast protection kits for vehiclesSafety shields and specialty protection for entertainment industry location sets (Hollywood sound stages, vehicles, on-location structures)Personnel and vehicle protective armorMine (coal, mineral extraction and processing) safety










Government Awards
 







Government Awards
 



BlastWrap® has been designated as Qualified Anti-Terrorism Technologies and placed on the “Approved Products List for Homeland Security.” We were issued the “Designation” and “Certification” for our technology by the Department of Homeland Security under the Support Anti-Terrorism by Fostering Effective Technologies Act of 2002 (the SAFETY ACT) in July of 2006.  In January 2017, the designation and certification was extended for BlastWrap until November 2021.THE SAFETY ACT 







“Designation” and “Certification” are intended to support effective technologies aimed at preventing, detecting, identifying, or deterring acts of terrorism, or limiting the harm that such acts might otherwise cause. The criteria technologies must meet to be awarded “Designation” and “Certification” status include: the availability of the technology for immediate deployment in public and private settings; the magnitude of risk exposure to the public if the technology is not deployed; the evaluation of scientific studies being feasibly conducted to assess the technology’s capability to substantially reduce risks of harm; and the technology’s effectiveness in facilitating the defense against acts of terrorism. BlastWrap is designed to mitigate the blast effects of an explosion by rapidly extinguishing the fireball, eliminating burns and post-blast fires, and reducing the subsequent over-pressures by more than 50%, thus reducing damage to people and property. The SAFETY ACT legislation was designed to encourage the development and rapid deployment of life-saving antiterrorism technologies by providing manufacturers or sellers with limited risk to legal liability. It was also designed to harness the nation’s scientific and technological resources to provide federal, state, and local officials with the technology and capabilities to protect the United States from terrorist acts. One area of focus for the Department of Homeland Security is catastrophic terrorist threats to the nation’s security that could result in large-scale loss of life and major economic impact. The SAFETY ACT fosters research of technologies to counter threats both by evolutionary improvements to current capabilities and development of revolutionary, new capabilities.GSA APPROVED PRODUCT General Services Administration enters into contracts with commercial firms to provide supplies and services at stated prices. This streamlined procurement vehicle is available to federal agencies and other organizations to obtain engineering and environmental services from pre-qualified vendors. GSA has completed federally mandated contracting requirements—competition, pricing, small business and other contracting evaluations—normally required prior to obtaining services. BlastGard’s finished products are in the GSA System.There are no other products available in the marketplace with such dramatic pressure and impulse reduction and such low a momentum exchange. BlastWrap® also differs from other technologies in that it doesn’t offer another armored barrier at a protected position but provides a proven method of reducing blast energy at source or before it can interact with structure.  BlastWrap® adds little extra weight and cost but builds in a large amount of threat protection to existing platforms. BlastWrap was tested in 2006 by Naval Surface Warfare Center, Indian Head Picatinny Detachment and by the U. S. Army Aviation and Missile Research Development and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) in Huntsville, AL.

BlastGard International, Inc. (BLGA) Offers Proprietary Blast Mitigation Products for Military and Commercial Sectors
June 26, 2017



BlastGard International, Inc. (OTC: BLGA) manufactures proprietary blast mitigation products for the military, commercial sector, government agencies, and law enforcement. It also provides products in the Blastgard MTR Series for personal protective gear and offers products such as mitigated trash receptacles.
The company is doing business as BlastGard Defense Group and HighCom Security. It manufactures BlastWrap® technology proprietary blast materials to mitigate blast effects and post-blast fires. Its primary market focuses on clients operating in the military, commercial sector, government agencies, and law enforcement. It also offers personal protective gear through HighCom Security. 
Industry applications for its technology products include suppressing fireballs and explosions. Its products are designed for naval vessels and merchant ships and to minimize damages from breaching blasts, and to protect buildings from vehicle bombs. BlastWrap has been named a Qualified Anti-Terrorism Technology and placed on the “Approved Products List For Homeland Security.” In January of 2017, the designation and certification for BlastWrap was extended until November 2021. The company’s products are also in the General Services Administration system.      
The Blastgard MTR Series is a collection of triple-wall mitigated trash receptacles designed to reduce lethal threats from the detonation of an improvised explosive device, including primary and secondary fragments and any resultant post-blast fires. The products have triple-wall technology to achieve that ability to withstand explosions. This is a Colorado corporation operating out of offices in Clearwater, Florida, with a manufacturing facility in Columbus, Ohio. It generates 99% of sales from HighCom Securities, Inc. 
Simultaneously, the company serves several different markets. As it serves the military and government agencies, it is also replacing existing technologies with products for commercial needs, including entertainment industry location sets (such as Hollywood sound stages), mining extracting and processing, building demolitions, and reinforcement of masonry buildings. Other markets include underwater blast isolation units, coastal construction, monitoring stations for law enforcement, and blast protection shields for low observable camouflage properties.

BlastWrap® — BlastGard International Inc.
































































What is BlastWrap?
 


SCROLL DOWN





What is BlastWrap?
 



Our patented BlastWrap® material has been designed to mitigate blasts and suppress flash fires resulting from explosions, regardless of the material or compound causing the explosion. We believe that this technology can be used to create new finished products or designed to retrofit existing products.Mitigation or attenuation of blast effects is the dissipation of blast energy so that acoustic and shock waves, peak overpressure, reflected peak overpressure, impulse and afterburn (the rapid burning of combustible materials in the “hot zone”, including soot, occurring so fast that it adds to blast effect from the original explosive) are reduced. This reduction is accomplished through both physical and chemical processes that are triggered when a blast occurs. The remaining energy is transmitted at a slower, more sustainable level. The amount of reflected energy is significantly reduced with mitigation. Unlike hardening systems, the performance of our products is not related directly to material thickness and therefore we believe our products have a greater range of uses producing the same or better effectiveness against blast effects.Our BlastGard® technology is designed to mitigate blast and rapid combustion phenomena through numerous mechanisms. The relative contribution of each mechanism depends upon the intensity and nature of the impinging hazard. Shock wave attenuation, for example, is dominant in mitigating mechanical explosions. Our products attempt to emulate unconfined conditions and accelerate attenuating processes that occur in free air. Thus BlastWrap® does not try to resist blasts (which physically intensify blast phenomena); it mitigates them. BlastWrap® can be used as part of confining assemblies (containers and blast walls). In effect, BlastWrap® is a ‘virtual vent’.Our BlastWrap® products are made from two flexible films arranged one over the other and joined by a plurality of seams filled with attenuating filler material (volcanic glass bead or other suitable two-phase materials), configurable (designed for each application) with an extinguishing coating. Together, this combination of materials is designed to mitigate a blast while at the same time eliminate fireballs or flame fronts produced by the blast.Blastwrap® works 24-hours a day, quenches fireballs and post blast fires, reduces blast impulse and pressure, does not dispense chemical extinguishants, uses neither alarms, sensors, nor an activation system, and is nontoxic and ecologically friendly. 










How It Works
 







How It Works
 



Our BlastGard® Technology extracts heat, decelerates both blast wind and shock waves, and quenches the hot gases in all blasts and fireballs. BlastWrap® does not interact with the explosive elements, and is therefore not altered by them. However, after a single intense detonation, BlastWrap® must be replaced.For blasts that produce fireballs or intense hot gases at higher pressures, BlastGard® Technology has the ability, through testing, to cool the blast zone rapidly, thereby reducing structural damage.In detonation of high explosives, where at least half of the energy released is in the shock wave, attenuation occurs even more rapidly, and in doing so substantially reduces explosion phenomena.The performance of BlastWrap® proprietary technology is independent of scenario and environment, which means that it does not matter where the physical location is, how the basic product form is used or the environment in which the event takes place. The basic product form can be used as a stand-alone material (as linings, curtain barriers, or as structural material), or can be laminated or otherwise affixed to a wide range of product forms such as insulation (thermal and acoustic), ballistic armor, or packaging materials. BlastWrap® products can thus provide blast and fire protection in flooring, wall, and roof constructions, in packaging, in storage cabinets and other containment structures, and aboard all types of vehicles, ships, and aircraft.An explosion results from the rapid conversion of chemical energy into rapidly expanding high-pressure gases. The rapidly expanding gases compress the surrounding air much like a piston and create a shock wave that travels ahead of the explosive gases.  The “overpressure” (pressure above ambient) in a shock wave acts to “pre-condition” the air as it passes through to make the following accelerated gas “piston” more damaging. This high intensity, short duration overpressure wave transfers impulse (momentum) which stresses, damages or destroys structures in its path. Impulse follows the shock wave but lingers and decays with time. The negative phase is a partial vacuum that “whips” lighter structures to magnify damage. A shock wave can be likened to an initial hard punch, while the impulse is more like a powerful bulldozer.  Any reduction in the effective power of the shock wave will increase the target’s capability to withstand the destructive impulse.BlastWrap is scientifically engineered and designed to remove much or most of the energy from an explosion. It actually interferes with the blast energy process. There are two primary components of any explosion – mechanical effects (which are shock impulse and acoustic waves) and chemical/thermal effects (fireball). In fact, shock impulse is the real killer in a high explosive blast. BlastWrap dissipates blast shock wave energy through irreversible processes, such as drag, turbulence, friction, viscosity, reflection, etc.; and at the same time, BlastWrap dramatically quenches the flame fronts or fireballs created as a result of the explosion in milliseconds. This is important because a fireball (which represents the rapid gas expansion by the burning of materials) creates enormous pressures, commonly called “the blast wind.” As a result of that, BlastWrap also kills the phenomena of afterburn which can initiate post-blast fires.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Who We Are BlastGard International Inc., doing business as BlastGard Defense Group, manufactures and markets proprietary blast mitigation materials through BlastGard International and designs, manufactures and distributes a unique range of leading security products and personal protective gear through HighCom Security. The Company's patented BlastWrap® technology effectively mitigates blast effects and suppresses post-blast fires. This unique technology can be used to create new, finished products or be used to retrofit to existing products. BlastGard's core market focus is on blast effects mitigation for the commercial sector, military, law enforcement and government agencies.










Our Vision
 







Our Vision
 



Our corporate vision is to be recognized as the leading worldwide provider of environmentally responsible solutions to protect lives and structures and to mitigate the risk/hazards posed from fire/explosions, accidental or planned, through products, research, information, and services by integrating scientific, engineering technologies in a customer driven organization that delivers an equitable return to our shareholders and a rewarding work place for our employees. 










Technology
 







Technology
 



Industry ApplicationsIn aircraft dry bays, cargo holds, and containers.BlastWrap® technology offers the only practical means of protecting commercial aircraft against internal detonation of solid explosive charges without requiring specially hardened luggage containers. BlastWrap®, for example, can be used as cargo compartment linings and partitions.BlastWrap®'s weight and dimensions are well within the allowable margins for these aircraft. Use of BlastWrap® linings in air cargo containers enhances protection capabilities, and BlastWrap® is unique in being suitable for retrofit in existing containers.As walls to protect buildings against vehicle bombsAboard naval vessels and merchant ships to minimize damage from breaching blasts emanating from mines, cruise missiles, and torpedoesTo surround fuel tanks for suppressing fireballs' and explosionsAs dividers to suppress fireballs and fuel mist explosions from accidents aboard both aircraft and ships, in process facilities, and on offshore platforms to suppress fireballs and explosionsAs separators and partitions in explosives manufacturing and handling facilities, such as a load/assembly/pack (LAP) depots, fireworks plants, and propellant manufacturing sitesAs pallets and buffers between stacks of palletized munitions and ordnanceTo line portable and fixed magazinesTo make missile launch boxes for military vehicles and naval vesselsTo make cabinets and containers for handling fuses, small rockets, and explosive devicesTo build and maintain reputation as industry leader and reputable supplierTo expand market size and share, exploiting past sales, contacts, and technology innovations to maximum advantage.BlastWrap® products protect against outdoor/unconfined explosions. Because of the Montreal protocol's ban of Halon extinguishing agents, BlastWrap® is the only blast and fire suppression means available for most applications, including adaptation for underwater use. It is an inherently effective sound absorber and thermal insulator.BlastWrap® works indoors or out, vented or unvented, wet or dry, clean or dirty, damaged or intact, and against strong or weak blasts from solid explosives or flammable fluids. It is a lightweight, space-efficient custom-engineered product for insulation, fragment/ballistic protection, environmental protection or impact and cushioning barriers. Significantly, no new or high-cost fabrication technologies or materials are required to produce BlastWrap® products. New Market SectorsBlast effect-mitigation for hydrocarbon and process industriesQuick-erect blast protection barriers and revetmentsFireball and explosion-suppressing fuel tank jackets (for natural and compressed natural gas, propane, and other "green fuel" vehicle systems)Demilitarization protection productsBlast effect mitigation materials for existing structures' & facilities (magazines, explosive's storage units, warships, propellant plants, etc.)Blast protection shields, armors, and structures with "stealth" ("low-observable") camouflage propertiesBlast/fire protection linings for commercial and military aircraft and air cargo containersBlast and ballistic-protected modular buildings (barracks, control and accommodations for offshore facilities, field stations, tactical shelters and command facilities, monitoring stations for law enforcement)Underwater blast isolation units for offshore facility abandonments, coastal construction, and naval vessels.Replacement of Existing TechnologiesComposite structures (non blast), such as topsides for offshore facilities, FPSOs, neutral buoyancy jackets for deepwater drilling risers, and sub-sea manifold protectionComposite blast/fire protection structures and materials (blast walls, blast mitigation billboards, relief vents, reinforcement of masonry buildings) for hydrocarbon, process, mining, missile launch, and manufacturing facilities, and for building demolitionsExplosive's storage and shipping containers, portable magazines, and explosive disposal kitsMine blast protection kits for vehiclesSafety shields and specialty protection for entertainment industry location sets (Hollywood sound stages, vehicles, on-location structures)Personnel and vehicle protective armorMine (coal, mineral extraction and processing) safety

BlastWrap® has been designated as Qualified Anti-Terrorism Technologies and placed on the “Approved Products List for Homeland Security.” We were issued the “Designation” and “Certification” for our technology by the Department of Homeland Security under the Support Anti-Terrorism by Fostering Effective Technologies Act of 2002 (the SAFETY ACT) in July of 2006.  In January 2017, the designation and certification was extended for BlastWrap until November 2021.THE SAFETY ACT 







“Designation” and “Certification” are intended to support effective technologies aimed at preventing, detecting, identifying, or deterring acts of terrorism, or limiting the harm that such acts might otherwise cause. The criteria technologies must meet to be awarded “Designation” and “Certification” status include: the availability of the technology for immediate deployment in public and private settings; the magnitude of risk exposure to the public if the technology is not deployed; the evaluation of scientific studies being feasibly conducted to assess the technology’s capability to substantially reduce risks of harm; and the technology’s effectiveness in facilitating the defense against acts of terrorism. BlastWrap is designed to mitigate the blast effects of an explosion by rapidly extinguishing the fireball, eliminating burns and post-blast fires, and reducing the subsequent over-pressures by more than 50%, thus reducing damage to people and property. The SAFETY ACT legislation was designed to encourage the development and rapid deployment of life-saving antiterrorism technologies by providing manufacturers or sellers with limited risk to legal liability. It was also designed to harness the nation’s scientific and technological resources to provide federal, state, and local officials with the technology and capabilities to protect the United States from terrorist acts. One area of focus for the Department of Homeland Security is catastrophic terrorist threats to the nation’s security that could result in large-scale loss of life and major economic impact. The SAFETY ACT fosters research of technologies to counter threats both by evolutionary improvements to current capabilities and development of revolutionary, new capabilities.GSA APPROVED PRODUCT General Services Administration enters into contracts with commercial firms to provide supplies and services at stated prices. This streamlined procurement vehicle is available to federal agencies and other organizations to obtain engineering and environmental services from pre-qualified vendors. GSA has completed federally mandated contracting requirements—competition, pricing, small business and other contracting evaluations—normally required prior to obtaining services. BlastGard’s finished products are in the GSA System.There are no other products available in the marketplace with such dramatic pressure and impulse reduction and such low a momentum exchange. BlastWrap® also differs from other technologies in that it doesn’t offer another armored barrier at a protected position but provides a proven method of reducing blast energy at source or before it can interact with structure.  BlastWrap® adds little extra weight and cost but builds in a large amount of threat protection to existing platforms. BlastWrap was tested in 2006 by Naval Surface Warfare Center, Indian Head Picatinny Detachment and by the U. S. Army Aviation and Missile Research Development and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) in Huntsville, AL.
