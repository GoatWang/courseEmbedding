Early life[edit]
Kessler was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1954 to Edith and Milton Kessler. He grew up in a community in Brooklyn near Coney Island called Sea Gate with his parents and his older sister Linda. He went on to Columbia University graduating summa cum laude in 1975 and then Columbia Law School. He graduated there as a Kent Scholar and editor of the Law Review in 1977.[2]
Professional career[edit]
Kessler began working at Weil, Gotshal & Manges as an Associate in the Anti-Trust Department[3] full-time in 1977, after working there as a Summer Associate in 1976. He went on to become a Partner in 1984. From 1976-2003 he was the lead counsel in various complex antitrust, sports law and IP law cases, including major jury trials. He represented a number of US and international companies in criminal and civil investigations in the antitrust and trade areas and was part of the team that successfully defended Matsushita Electric and JVC against claims of a worldwide conspiracy in the landmark U.S. Supreme Court case, Zenith v. Matsushita.[4] He became regarded as a leading commentator on international antitrust law.[5] He also was the lead counsel in several intellectual property cases involving frontier issues of IP law.[6]
Additionally, Kessler became known as one of the most prominent sports lawyer in the USA as he became regularly engaged in high-profile sports litigation.[7] He litigated some all known sports-antitrust cases while at Weil, including McNeil v. the NFL, the antitrust jury trial which led to the establishment of free agency in the National Football League (NFL).[8] He also handled numerous sports law cases for clients including the National Football League Players Association, the National Basketball Players Association, the Arena Football League Players Association, the National Hockey League Players Association, the Major League Baseball Players Association, the NFL Coaches Association, Players, Inc., the Women's Tennis Benefit Association and Adidas. Kessler represented various classes of NBA, NFL, AFL and MLS players, and several professional leagues, the now defunct North American Soccer League and United States Football League, as well as the Cities of San Diego and Oakland, and Alameda County, in various sports law disputes.[9] He also successfully represented Latrell Sprewell in his controversial suspension arbitration.[citation needed]
Move to Dewey[edit]
In 2003 Kessler left Weil to join the law firm Dewey Ballantine. Dewey Ballantine later merged with the Law Firm LeBoeuf & Lam and Kessler was at the newly created “super firm” Dewey & LeBoeuf where he was the chairman of the firm's Global Litigation Department, co-chairman of the Sports Litigation Practice Group, and a member of its Executive and Leadership Committees.[10] He has also recently[when?] done work on behalf of the National Invitation Tournament, CAA Sports, Wasserman Media Group, SCP Worldwide, and Pro Bono work for South African Amputee Sprinter Oscar Pistorious and Castor Semanaya.[11] Both runners were successfully represented by Kessler and allowed to continue their careers despite challenges from the IAAF. Kessler negotiated the current free agency/salary cap systems in the NFL, NBA, and successfully represented Michael Vick[12] in his roster bonus arbitration, Plaxico Burress in his Signing Bonus arbitration, and numerous other players in successful arbitrations and “special master cases”.[13]
Kessler is a Lecturer-in-Law at Columbia Law School where he teaches a course on complex litigation. He has written and lectured on a wide variety of antitrust, sports law and related topics.[14] He published a new edition of International Trade and U.S. Antitrust Law, a leading treatise on antitrust and trade law issues in a global economy, was Co-Editor-in-Chief of State Antitrust Practice and Statutes, and was a member of the Council and was formerly Co-chairman of the Publications Committee and Chairman of the International Antitrust Law Committee, of the Antitrust Section of the American Bar Association (ABA).[15] He was also a member of the ABA's NAFTA Tri-National Committee and an Adjunct Professor of Law at Fordham Law School. He was a founding member of the Board of Advisors of the Georgetown University Study of Private Antitrust Litigation.[16]
Kessler has been recognized by numerous publications, including Chambers USA - America's Leading Lawyers for Business and Best Lawyers in America.[17] He is recognized by Guide to the World's Leading Antitrust Lawyers and Who's Who of Competition Lawyers and has been included in Super Lawyers, Corporate Counsel Edition 2009, The Lawdragon 500 Leading Lawyers in America 2005, 2006 and 2008 through 2011 and Lawdragon 500 Leading Litigators in America 2006.[18] Kessler is named in the 2011 edition of The Best Lawyers in America and as a New York Super Lawyer in 2006 through 2012, and he has been named as one of The 50 Most Influential People in Sports Business by Street & Smith's SportsBusiness Journal and that publication has named him one of the 20 Most Influential People in the NFL numerous times including most recently in 2011.[19] Kessler has also been named a National General Commercial Litigation Star by Benchmark Litigation.[citation needed]
Move to Winston[edit]
In May 2012, Kessler left Dewey & LeBoeuf and joined the firm of Winston & Strawn.[20] Dewey had experienced mass partner defections starting in March 2012 for a variety of reasons, and despite his best efforts in conjunction with several other of the firms most prominent and successful partners to save the firm it proved to be unmanageable. Thus, Kessler led a group of over 20 other Partners, over 40 Associates, and a large group of support staff with him to Winston where he currently is a Partner and Co-Chairman of the firm’s Executive Committee.[21] In total, over 75 people went with him from Dewey to Winston as he brought over his entire practice, and the total group that made the transition is widely considered one of the most successful and prominent litigation groups in the country.[by whom?] In recent years, he has led successful appeals regarding discipline handed out by the NFL to Adrian Peterson, Tom Brady, and the players implicated in "Bounty Gate".[22]
Personal life[edit]
Kessler has been married to his wife Regina since 1977, and has two children. He has lived in New York City for his entire life.[citation needed]

Early life[edit]
Kessler was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1954 to Edith and Milton Kessler. He grew up in a community in Brooklyn near Coney Island called Sea Gate with his parents and his older sister Linda. He went on to Columbia University graduating summa cum laude in 1975 and then Columbia Law School. He graduated there as a Kent Scholar and editor of the Law Review in 1977.[2]
Professional career[edit]
Kessler began working at Weil, Gotshal & Manges as an Associate in the Anti-Trust Department[3] full-time in 1977, after working there as a Summer Associate in 1976. He went on to become a Partner in 1984. From 1976-2003 he was the lead counsel in various complex antitrust, sports law and IP law cases, including major jury trials. He represented a number of US and international companies in criminal and civil investigations in the antitrust and trade areas and was part of the team that successfully defended Matsushita Electric and JVC against claims of a worldwide conspiracy in the landmark U.S. Supreme Court case, Zenith v. Matsushita.[4] He became regarded as a leading commentator on international antitrust law.[5] He also was the lead counsel in several intellectual property cases involving frontier issues of IP law.[6]
Additionally, Kessler became known as one of the most prominent sports lawyer in the USA as he became regularly engaged in high-profile sports litigation.[7] He litigated some all known sports-antitrust cases while at Weil, including McNeil v. the NFL, the antitrust jury trial which led to the establishment of free agency in the National Football League (NFL).[8] He also handled numerous sports law cases for clients including the National Football League Players Association, the National Basketball Players Association, the Arena Football League Players Association, the National Hockey League Players Association, the Major League Baseball Players Association, the NFL Coaches Association, Players, Inc., the Women's Tennis Benefit Association and Adidas. Kessler represented various classes of NBA, NFL, AFL and MLS players, and several professional leagues, the now defunct North American Soccer League and United States Football League, as well as the Cities of San Diego and Oakland, and Alameda County, in various sports law disputes.[9] He also successfully represented Latrell Sprewell in his controversial suspension arbitration.[citation needed]
Move to Dewey[edit]
In 2003 Kessler left Weil to join the law firm Dewey Ballantine. Dewey Ballantine later merged with the Law Firm LeBoeuf & Lam and Kessler was at the newly created “super firm” Dewey & LeBoeuf where he was the chairman of the firm's Global Litigation Department, co-chairman of the Sports Litigation Practice Group, and a member of its Executive and Leadership Committees.[10] He has also recently[when?] done work on behalf of the National Invitation Tournament, CAA Sports, Wasserman Media Group, SCP Worldwide, and Pro Bono work for South African Amputee Sprinter Oscar Pistorious and Castor Semanaya.[11] Both runners were successfully represented by Kessler and allowed to continue their careers despite challenges from the IAAF. Kessler negotiated the current free agency/salary cap systems in the NFL, NBA, and successfully represented Michael Vick[12] in his roster bonus arbitration, Plaxico Burress in his Signing Bonus arbitration, and numerous other players in successful arbitrations and “special master cases”.[13]
Kessler is a Lecturer-in-Law at Columbia Law School where he teaches a course on complex litigation. He has written and lectured on a wide variety of antitrust, sports law and related topics.[14] He published a new edition of International Trade and U.S. Antitrust Law, a leading treatise on antitrust and trade law issues in a global economy, was Co-Editor-in-Chief of State Antitrust Practice and Statutes, and was a member of the Council and was formerly Co-chairman of the Publications Committee and Chairman of the International Antitrust Law Committee, of the Antitrust Section of the American Bar Association (ABA).[15] He was also a member of the ABA's NAFTA Tri-National Committee and an Adjunct Professor of Law at Fordham Law School. He was a founding member of the Board of Advisors of the Georgetown University Study of Private Antitrust Litigation.[16]
Kessler has been recognized by numerous publications, including Chambers USA - America's Leading Lawyers for Business and Best Lawyers in America.[17] He is recognized by Guide to the World's Leading Antitrust Lawyers and Who's Who of Competition Lawyers and has been included in Super Lawyers, Corporate Counsel Edition 2009, The Lawdragon 500 Leading Lawyers in America 2005, 2006 and 2008 through 2011 and Lawdragon 500 Leading Litigators in America 2006.[18] Kessler is named in the 2011 edition of The Best Lawyers in America and as a New York Super Lawyer in 2006 through 2012, and he has been named as one of The 50 Most Influential People in Sports Business by Street & Smith's SportsBusiness Journal and that publication has named him one of the 20 Most Influential People in the NFL numerous times including most recently in 2011.[19] Kessler has also been named a National General Commercial Litigation Star by Benchmark Litigation.[citation needed]
Move to Winston[edit]
In May 2012, Kessler left Dewey & LeBoeuf and joined the firm of Winston & Strawn.[20] Dewey had experienced mass partner defections starting in March 2012 for a variety of reasons, and despite his best efforts in conjunction with several other of the firms most prominent and successful partners to save the firm it proved to be unmanageable. Thus, Kessler led a group of over 20 other Partners, over 40 Associates, and a large group of support staff with him to Winston where he currently is a Partner and Co-Chairman of the firm’s Executive Committee.[21] In total, over 75 people went with him from Dewey to Winston as he brought over his entire practice, and the total group that made the transition is widely considered one of the most successful and prominent litigation groups in the country.[by whom?] In recent years, he has led successful appeals regarding discipline handed out by the NFL to Adrian Peterson, Tom Brady, and the players implicated in "Bounty Gate".[22]
Personal life[edit]
Kessler has been married to his wife Regina since 1977, and has two children. He has lived in New York City for his entire life.[citation needed]

Kessler has been married to his wife Regina since 1977, and has two children. He has lived in New York City for his entire life.[citation needed]

Early life[edit]
Kessler was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1954 to Edith and Milton Kessler. He grew up in a community in Brooklyn near Coney Island called Sea Gate with his parents and his older sister Linda. He went on to Columbia University graduating summa cum laude in 1975 and then Columbia Law School. He graduated there as a Kent Scholar and editor of the Law Review in 1977.[2]
Professional career[edit]
Kessler began working at Weil, Gotshal & Manges as an Associate in the Anti-Trust Department[3] full-time in 1977, after working there as a Summer Associate in 1976. He went on to become a Partner in 1984. From 1976-2003 he was the lead counsel in various complex antitrust, sports law and IP law cases, including major jury trials. He represented a number of US and international companies in criminal and civil investigations in the antitrust and trade areas and was part of the team that successfully defended Matsushita Electric and JVC against claims of a worldwide conspiracy in the landmark U.S. Supreme Court case, Zenith v. Matsushita.[4] He became regarded as a leading commentator on international antitrust law.[5] He also was the lead counsel in several intellectual property cases involving frontier issues of IP law.[6]
Additionally, Kessler became known as one of the most prominent sports lawyer in the USA as he became regularly engaged in high-profile sports litigation.[7] He litigated some all known sports-antitrust cases while at Weil, including McNeil v. the NFL, the antitrust jury trial which led to the establishment of free agency in the National Football League (NFL).[8] He also handled numerous sports law cases for clients including the National Football League Players Association, the National Basketball Players Association, the Arena Football League Players Association, the National Hockey League Players Association, the Major League Baseball Players Association, the NFL Coaches Association, Players, Inc., the Women's Tennis Benefit Association and Adidas. Kessler represented various classes of NBA, NFL, AFL and MLS players, and several professional leagues, the now defunct North American Soccer League and United States Football League, as well as the Cities of San Diego and Oakland, and Alameda County, in various sports law disputes.[9] He also successfully represented Latrell Sprewell in his controversial suspension arbitration.[citation needed]
Move to Dewey[edit]
In 2003 Kessler left Weil to join the law firm Dewey Ballantine. Dewey Ballantine later merged with the Law Firm LeBoeuf & Lam and Kessler was at the newly created “super firm” Dewey & LeBoeuf where he was the chairman of the firm's Global Litigation Department, co-chairman of the Sports Litigation Practice Group, and a member of its Executive and Leadership Committees.[10] He has also recently[when?] done work on behalf of the National Invitation Tournament, CAA Sports, Wasserman Media Group, SCP Worldwide, and Pro Bono work for South African Amputee Sprinter Oscar Pistorious and Castor Semanaya.[11] Both runners were successfully represented by Kessler and allowed to continue their careers despite challenges from the IAAF. Kessler negotiated the current free agency/salary cap systems in the NFL, NBA, and successfully represented Michael Vick[12] in his roster bonus arbitration, Plaxico Burress in his Signing Bonus arbitration, and numerous other players in successful arbitrations and “special master cases”.[13]
Kessler is a Lecturer-in-Law at Columbia Law School where he teaches a course on complex litigation. He has written and lectured on a wide variety of antitrust, sports law and related topics.[14] He published a new edition of International Trade and U.S. Antitrust Law, a leading treatise on antitrust and trade law issues in a global economy, was Co-Editor-in-Chief of State Antitrust Practice and Statutes, and was a member of the Council and was formerly Co-chairman of the Publications Committee and Chairman of the International Antitrust Law Committee, of the Antitrust Section of the American Bar Association (ABA).[15] He was also a member of the ABA's NAFTA Tri-National Committee and an Adjunct Professor of Law at Fordham Law School. He was a founding member of the Board of Advisors of the Georgetown University Study of Private Antitrust Litigation.[16]
Kessler has been recognized by numerous publications, including Chambers USA - America's Leading Lawyers for Business and Best Lawyers in America.[17] He is recognized by Guide to the World's Leading Antitrust Lawyers and Who's Who of Competition Lawyers and has been included in Super Lawyers, Corporate Counsel Edition 2009, The Lawdragon 500 Leading Lawyers in America 2005, 2006 and 2008 through 2011 and Lawdragon 500 Leading Litigators in America 2006.[18] Kessler is named in the 2011 edition of The Best Lawyers in America and as a New York Super Lawyer in 2006 through 2012, and he has been named as one of The 50 Most Influential People in Sports Business by Street & Smith's SportsBusiness Journal and that publication has named him one of the 20 Most Influential People in the NFL numerous times including most recently in 2011.[19] Kessler has also been named a National General Commercial Litigation Star by Benchmark Litigation.[citation needed]
Move to Winston[edit]
In May 2012, Kessler left Dewey & LeBoeuf and joined the firm of Winston & Strawn.[20] Dewey had experienced mass partner defections starting in March 2012 for a variety of reasons, and despite his best efforts in conjunction with several other of the firms most prominent and successful partners to save the firm it proved to be unmanageable. Thus, Kessler led a group of over 20 other Partners, over 40 Associates, and a large group of support staff with him to Winston where he currently is a Partner and Co-Chairman of the firm’s Executive Committee.[21] In total, over 75 people went with him from Dewey to Winston as he brought over his entire practice, and the total group that made the transition is widely considered one of the most successful and prominent litigation groups in the country.[by whom?] In recent years, he has led successful appeals regarding discipline handed out by the NFL to Adrian Peterson, Tom Brady, and the players implicated in "Bounty Gate".[22]
Personal life[edit]
Kessler has been married to his wife Regina since 1977, and has two children. He has lived in New York City for his entire life.[citation needed]

But there are some standard coverages included in most homeowners policies, such as protection for your dwelling and personal property for certain natural disasters and personal liabilities. It's important to know exactly what is and isn't covered by your policy and to understand your coverage limits. If you'd like to talk through your current policy or get coverage tailored to life in TX, I'd be happy to help.Learn More After A Car AccidentMost people don't want to think about getting into an accident, but it's a reality many of us will have to deal with at some point. I know that a car accident can be frightening, but you can help reduce some of the stress by knowing what to do ahead of time. Remember to always keep current proof of insurance in the car, and follow these tips about your personal safety, documenting the accident and beginning the claims process.Learn More Vacation Home CoverageWhether you're looking for that perfect spot on the beach, want a kitchen to use or need somewhere with room for extended family, sometimes a vacation rental is the best fit for your getaway. And while you probably thought about the cost, you may not have thought about the insurance implications of staying in a rental. Are you covered if your suitcases are stolen during your stay? What happens if the home is damaged while you're there? Before you start packing, make sure you'll be covered while you're away.Learn More Life Insurance CalculatorBuying life insurance is a very important decision, but I know it's one that can also be overwhelming — especially when it comes to figuring out how much you might want. You may want to consider things like your family's future expenses, income and life events, as well as the length and type of policy you are purchasing. It's a lot to think about, but this calculator is a great place to start. And once you get your results, I'm here to talk more in-depth as you choose the policy that may work best for you.Learn More Tips for Managing Small Business Insurance CostsBeing a small business owner can mean working long after you've "closed" for the day. The to-do list is never done, and you're frequently juggling priorities. But you may want to move reviewing your business insurance to the top of that list. There's a lot to consider when covering the business you put your heart into. From making sure you having the right amount of protection to managing risks and bundling coverages, I'm here to help you choose the coverage that is right for your business.Learn More Insurance That Protects Your BikeYour motorcycle is more than just a way to get around. You've invested your time in it, you've made sure it's in perfect working order and you took classes and bought the right gear so you could enjoy it safely. It only make sense that you put the same effort into safeguarding your bike, and you, with insurance. Whether it's collision coverage or a custom paint job, it's important to make sure you have the protection that fits your bike. Here's a breakdown of coverages to help you decide what is right for you.Learn More Motorhome Insurance BasicsIf you own a motorhome or are thinking about purchasing one, here are some things you may want to consider when it comes to protecting your home on wheels.Learn More Water Damage In Your CondoOne of the great perks to living in a condo is that it's fairly low-maintenance. You likely don't have to worry about lawn care or replacing the roof. But what about water damage? Whether your washer overflows or a bathroom pipe bursts, water damage can wreak havoc. If you have condo insurance, though, you'll generally have coverage for accidental damage caused by your plumbing or appliances. While I hope your home stays dry and cozy, it's a good idea to know what your condo policy may cover just in case.Learn More Show moreShow lessInsurance Products & ServicesInsurance is unlike any other product out there - you pay for it and hope you never have to use it. And that makes paying more than you need to that much more uncomfortable.With a policy from Allstate, you can help keep your insurance costs low with the wide variety of discounts we offer. Keep in mind, not all discounts are available in every state. The best way to get all that you qualify for is to get an insurance quote specific to Texarkana.You can get a rough "ballpark" insurance quote from many companies online, but talking with an agent allows you to ask questions and get a quote for coverage that matters most to you. As an Allstate agent, I can prepare a quote that details the coverage, deductibles (your portion of a loss) and cost (premium) of your insurance policy.Insurance products and services offered at my Allstate agency include:Auto InsuranceCar InsuranceFlood InsuranceInsuranceLife InsuranceMotorcycle InsuranceHome InsuranceInsurance QuoteInsurance AgencyBusiness InsuranceAnnuitiesRetirementCollege Savings PlanContactPhone(903) 831-3866(903) 831-3866Toll Free(844) 537-5377(844) 537-5377Fax(903) 832-4701(903) 832-4701Email:kesler@allstate.comkesler@allstate.comAddress:515 Main StTexarkana, TX 75501Get DirectionsLandmarks:Our agency is located in downtown Texarkana.
