About Us




























 












Overview
The big ultimate worth of a company is its ability to create value. This has been our credo over the company's history - it shapes our long-term vision and guides our day-to-day strategies.

Alta Mesa is a privately held company engaged in onshore oil and natural gas acquisition, exploitation, exploration and production whose focus is to maximize the profitability of our assets in a safe and environmentally sound manner. We seek to maintain a portfolio of lower risk properties in plays where we identify a large inventory of drilling, development, and enhanced recovery and exploitation opportunities in known resources. We believe our balanced portfolio of assets in the Oklahoma STACK play and South Louisiana has decades of future development potential. We maximize the profitability of our assets by focusing on advanced engineering analytics, enhanced geological techniques including 3-D seismic analysis, and proven drilling, stimulation, completion, and production methods.  
Our areas of focus are typically characterized by multiple hydrocarbon pay zones, and because we are re-developing fields and areas left behind by major oil and natural gas companies and other previous operators, our assets are typically served by existing infrastructure.  As a result, our approach lowers geological, mechanical, and market-related risks. We focus on properties within our core operating areas that we believe have significant development and exploration opportunities and where we can apply our technical experience and economies of scale to increase production and proved reserves while lowering lease operating and capital costs. Additionally, we have consistently created value through workovers and re-completions of existing wells, infill drilling, operations improvements, secondary recovery and 3-D seismic-driven drilling.  We expect to continue production growth in our core areas through continued well workovers, enhanced drilling and recovery programs and disciplined exploration. We periodically enter into and actively manage hedging transactions for a portion of our oil and natural gas production.  This allows us to reduce exposure to price fluctuations and achieve more predictable cash flows, while retaining commodity upside through future production and reserve growth.

Operations




























 






Operations












STACK Play in the Sooner Trend, OklahomaOur assets in Oklahoma have been owned by Alta Mesa for over 25 years and are located in the eastern portion of the Anadarko Basin referred to as the STACK. The STACK is an acronym describing both its location—Sooner Trend Anadarko Basin Canadian and Kingfisher County—and the multiple, stacked productive formations present in the area. The STACK is a prolific hydrocarbon system with high oil and liquids-rich natural gas content, multiple horizontal target horizons, extensive production history and historically high drilling success rates.The fields were originally developed by Texaco, Exxon and Conoco and have historically been shallow-decline, long-lived oil wells originally drilled on 80-acre spacing and waterflooded to varying degrees. Beginning in the early 1990s, our STACK operations were focused on vertical wells and waterfloods. Since late 2012, however, we have concentrated on the horizontal development of the Mississippian-age Osage and Meramec formations, as well as the Pennsylvanian-age Oswego formation. Generally speaking, these formations are made up of siliceous carbonate and have highly naturally fractured reservoir and geologic systems. We intend to further develop other formations with demonstrated vertical production, using horizontal drilling, including the Pennsylvanian-age Big Lime, Prue, Skinner, Red Fork and Cherokee Shale; Mississippian-age Manning Lime; Devonian-age Woodford Shale; and Silurian-age Hunton Lime. Given the predictable geology of the STACK formations, this allows for a repeatable drilling inventory. We have about 4,000 potential drilling locations across four benches, with multiple upside locations possible through optimized spacing and targeting of additional producing horizons.  The STACK is among the lowest cost basins in the U.S. with asset quality comparable to the Permian. Alta Mesa is an efficient operator with a proven track record and focus on continuous improvement. We have worked diligently to reduce the drilling and completion costs per well thru operating and drilling efficiencies. We have doubled our STACK acreage position to over 100K net highly contiguous acres since January 2015, most of which are held by production. Our contiguous acreage positions allows for efficient field development through optimal spacing and pad drilling.  The legacy infrastructure systems in this area that will support the development of our STACK assets is mature. extensive and readily expandable. New Systems with high capacity for development have been built to accommodate higher individual well rates from horizontal wells and the anticipated significant growth expected from our use of multi-well pads. The Kingfisher Midstream cryogenic plant is a larger capacity system and modern plant that has a capacity of 60 MMCF per day and ties newer acreage to central legacy leasehold.   South LouisianaAlta Mesa has three major areas of operation in South Louisiana, in fields originally developed by major oil companies, where we have working interests in over 60 producing wells and approximately 55,000 gross developed and undeveloped acres (~31,900 acres, net). These areas have multiple low-risk exploration and development targets, potential for exploiting substantial bypassed and overlooked oil pay zones, and opportunities to increase profitability through facilities de-bottlenecking, production enhancements and drilling. Weeks Island Field . Weeks Island, located in Iberia Parish, contains some of our largest developed oil reserves. It is a historically-prolific oil field with 55 potential pay zones that are structurally trapped against a piercement salt dome, which we believe offer significant future opportunities for added production and reserves. The main field pay zones are characterized by high, stable production rates due to the predominant water-drive production mechanism and high-porosity sands. The field was discovered in 1945 by Shell and subsequently developed by Shell and Exxon. We acquired these properties in 2010 with our acquisition of Meridian, which had purchased them in 1998. We operate all of the wells in this field in which we have an interest. Since mid-2011 we have continuously employed one drilling rig and one completion rig in Weeks Island to exploit its potential for development through sidetracking, new drilling and recompletions. Additionally, Weeks Island oil sales prices are based on the Louisiana Light Sweet crude market price index, which has trended appreciably higher than the West Texas Intermediate index.
