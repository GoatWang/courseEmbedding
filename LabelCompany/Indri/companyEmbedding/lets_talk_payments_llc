What’s in Store for RegTech in 2017?

December 26, 2016  &nbsp &nbspBy : Anshu Dubey



RegTech has been a famous buzzword in 2016 and the industry – banking and FinTech alike – is looking eagerly at 2017. RegTech is comparatively a new term used in FinTech to describe a set of companies and solutions that address regulatory challenges across industries, including financial services, through innovative technology.
There are more than 6,000 small, medium and large enterprises globally offering governance, risk management and compliance solutions. MetricStream, Nasdaq, Rsam and EMC are among the top players in the GRC technology market when it comes to product offerings. The popular areas for RegTechs in 2016 have been compliance analysis, knowledge and training, KYC, compliance implementation & monitoring and analytics-based reporting – regulatory, transaction and MI.

In spite of the big number of FinTechs – new and old, small and big – regional and global financial institutions are actively working themselves to address their pain points and have a long way to go before they start bringing their compliance cost down. Even the conservative estimate for regulatory compliance spending by large and small banks is upward of $70 billion. And this figure doesn’t include the fines and penalties being paid by FIs for non-compliance.
Risk management and universal utilities to aggregate available data and content for effective compliance management are still the top priorities and will continue to be big revenue opportunities for RegTechs in 2017. The same view emerged from a recent panel discussion for RegTech in Mumbai – a first of its kind – with panelists from global banks, RegTech startups and APAC regulation professionals.
The length and breadth of data available with financial institutions are huge. This data is still not been used to its full capacity for effective and proactive risk management. Analytics-based RegTech solutions will be the key focus area for banks and FinTechs alike in 2017.
IBM’s acquisition of Promontory Financial Group is a trend setter in many ways for 2017. Firstly, the traditional reputation of Promontory experts on being leaders in risk management and regulatory compliance consulting, combined with IBM’s industry expertise will push RegTechs across the globe to improve their depth and breadth of compliance knowledge and work. Secondly, IBM’s cognitive capabilities already being demonstrated by Watson, will be multiplied when Promontory compliance analysis will complement it. This again will give a very healthy push to analytics based FinTechs to move beyond KYC/AML and health check reporting to sophisticated analytics and proactive risk management.

The value chain will mature in 2017. RegTech has been helping to automate the more mundane compliance tasks and reduce operational risks associated with meeting compliance and reporting obligations. In 2017, analytics and AI would lead the way to empower compliance functions to make informed risk choices based on data provided insight and also advise on mitigating and manages those risks.
Henri Arslanian, noted RegTech professional and expert, also strongly believes that 2017 will be the year of RegTech. The year 2016 has been a great one for RegTech and 2017 is stated to be a prosperous one as well.

Applications of Machine Learning in FinTech – Let's Talk Payments – MediumHomepageSign in / Sign upLet's Talk PaymentsBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingApr 5, 2016Applications of Machine Learning in FinTechMachine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that provides computers with the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. The science behind machine learning is interesting and application-oriented. Many startups have disrupted the FinTech ecosystem with machine learning as their key technology.There are various applications of machine learning used by the FinTech companies falling under different subcategories. Let us look at some of the applications of machine learning and companies using such applications.1. Predictive Analysis for Credit Scores and Bad LoansCompanies in the lending Industry are using machine learning for predicting bad loans and for building credit risk models.Here are a few companies using this application:Lending Club: Lending Club is the world’s largest online marketplace which connects borrowers and investors. They use machine learning for predicting bad loans.Kabbage: Kabbage, Inc. is an online FinTech and data company based in Atlanta. The company provides funding directly to small businesses and consumers through an automated lending platform. The Kabbage team specializes in building the next-generation machine learning and analytics stack for building credit risk models and analyzing the existing portfolio.LendUp: LendUp is in the business of improving payday lending. And it’s now opening its vault to let other organizations offer similar services via its API. It uses machine learning and algorithms to pinpoint the top 15% that are most likely to repay their loans. It charges them interest rates starting at 29% without hidden charges or rollover fees.2. Accurate Decision-MakingFinancial processing and decision-making could be enhanced by machine learning technologies that allow computers to process data and make decisions (such as credit-related) quicker and efficient. Some of the companies using such applications are:Affirm: Affirm is a technology and data-driven finance company. They mine vast amounts of data to successfully rewrite the rules on how credit is evaluated. To protect against fraud and build credit data, the company uses machine learning models.ZestFinance: ZestFinance uses machine learning techniques and large-scale data analysis to consume vast amounts of data and make more accurate credit decisions. ZestFinance takes an entirely different approach to underwriting by using machine learning and large-scale big data analysis.BillGuard: BillGuard is a personal finance security company that alerts users to bad chargers. The company has expertise in big data mining, machine learning algorithms, security and consumer Web UX.3. Content/Information ExtractionInformation Extraction has been a major application of machine learning. It involves extraction from Web content like articles, publications, documents etc. The various companies using these applications are mentioned below:Dataminr: Dataminr is a leading real-time information discovery company. Dataminr transforms real-time data from Twitter and other public sources into actionable signals, identifying the most relevant information in real time for clients in the financial sector. It trawls social media and other information sources using complex machine learning algorithms to identify significant or newsworthy posts and then flags them for its clients in real time.AlphaSense: AlphaSense is a financial search engine that solves fundamental problems of information abundance and fragmentation for knowledge professionals. It leverages proprietary natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to provide a powerful and highly differentiated product with an intuitive user interface.4. Fraud Detection and Identity ManagementAccording to IBM research, fraud costs the financial industry approximately $80 billion annually; US credit and debit card issuers alone lost $2.4 billion.“We are able to apply complicated logic that is outside the realm of human analysis to huge quantities of streaming data.” — Manager, Machine Learning Technologies Group, IBM ResearchWith the help of machine learning, fraud detection techniques can be made efficient and effective. The solutions created can analyze historical transaction data to build a model that can detect fraudulent patterns. Companies are also using machine learning for biometric authentication. Here are the companies working in this field:Feedzai: Feedzai uses machine learning and big data science to make commerce safe. Feedzai machine learning models detect fraud up to 30% earlier than traditional methods.Bionym: Bionym has developed a biometric authentication device using ECG backed with machine learning algorithms.EyeVerify: EyeVerify software identifies “eye prints,” the pattern of veins in the whites of eyes, using machine learning technology.BioCatch: BioCatch, is a leading provider of behavioral biometric, authentication and malware detection solutions for mobile and web applications. Banks and e-commerce sites use BioCatch to significantly reduce friction associated with risky transactions and protect users against cyberthreats such as account takeovers, Man-in-the-Browser (MitB) malware and remote access (RAT) attacks.5. Building Trading AlgorithmMachine learning is used in creating algorithms for trading decisions. Algorithmic trading, also called high-frequency trading, is the use of automated systems to identify true signals among the massive amounts of data that capture the underlying stock market dynamics. Machine learning provides powerful tools to extract patterns from the seemingly market trends.Here are companies using machine learning for building trading algorithm:KFL Capital: The predictions made by the company are the output of algorithms, predictive models and coding. The company employs machine learning algorithms to identify non-random price patterns in financial data.Binatix: Binatix is a learning trading firm which is possibly the first to use state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to spot patterns that offer an edge in investing.Originally published: Applications of Machine Learning in FinTechShare40Never miss a story from Let's Talk Payments, when you sign up for Medium.

Great Job
8/10/2016


Kay G says: I recently brought two rowdy dogs to get groomed, bathed, and nails and she was nothing but smiles the whole time. This shows me that she truly knows how to take care of dogs. I always take my dogs to her even if it means driving 30 minutes out of my way. Her prices were fair, as well, I always make sure to tip her accordingly. 


Love Miss Angie
7/15/2016


Sandra M says: Write your reviewAngel and I both love Angie. I wouldn't take my baby anywhere else.


Love Angela 
5/28/2016


Donna W says: I've used Angela for a few years now and my babies love her, as do I. She has patience and a love for my babies which means they will get the best care ever. With other groomers my Gracie would start quivering as soon as I got there. Not with Angela, Gracie and Radar both love Angela and her fantastic play area. It is safe and set up in a way that the dogs cannot escape through an open door. All of that means a lot to me. My Gracie has special needs and Angela handles her great. High paw five to Angela!


Angela is the BEST!

Peace of Mind
7/12/2015


Jeri C says: After several failed attempts with other groomers, I took a chance with Let's Talk Dogs after seeing signs posted along the road. I have 2 dogs, the 9 yr old has some special needs & is prone to fits of anti-social behavior. the 2 yr old, is well, a 2 yr old. Angela has been a perfect fit for us. Grooming can be as stressful for owners as it is for our dogs. I love the way Angela schedules & the atmosphere that generates. I almost don't want other people to know! I want to keep her for myself! 


Another "pawfect haircut"

Great

Kim E says: Angela does an awesome job. She is so nice and really cares alot about your hairy baby. You can tell she loves dogs! Love her picture on the wall of her hairy babies. Depending on what your pet needs done. They are not there all day. When she schedules your pet. There is no waiting. She takes care of them right then. 



Miley Jo Approved!

Janet M says: We moved to Southern Indiana about 2 years ago and are grateful to have found Angela to groom our very spoiled dog.  Angela does a wonderful job of grooming and making Callie look so cute that people stop to admire and pet her.  I don't want to take Callie anywhere else.   


Very Friendly
3/19/2015


Angie C says: Angela is so friendly and my Maggie loves her!  I have been going to her for 3 years and I have never had any problems at all.
What I love most is that you take your dog, leave he/she with Angela for 1 hour and then you get your dog back.  Not drop of in the morning and leave there in a cage all day.

Outstanding!

Kaity L says: My Sassy has never liked getting her fur washed, much less cut, so it really shocked me when she took right to Angela. I've been all through out Corydon and was at my wits end when every groomer would have issues and Sassy would try to nip at them, I found Let's Talk Dogs and I wont be going any place else. Angela answered every question I had and treated Sassy and I with respect and I can't tell you how much that means to someone who loves her Furbaby as much as I do. I'm looking forward to many years of business with Let's Talk Dogs and encourage others to let her share her love for every Fur baby that walks through the door! Thank you so much.

LLC Basics




Limited liability companies combine the best parts of partnerships and corporations.


By Beth Laurence, J.D.




Share on Google Plus





Share on Facebook













 





A limited liability company (LLC) offers protection from personal liability for business debts, just like a corporation. However, unlike a corporation, which must pay its own taxes, an LLC is a pass-through tax entity: The profits and losses of the business pass through to its owners, who report them on their personal tax returns just as they would if they owned a partnership or sole proprietorship. Moreover, while setting up an LLC is more difficult than creating a partnership or sole proprietorship, running one is significantly easier than running a corporation.
Here are the main features of an LLC:
Limited Personal Liability
Like shareholders of a corporation, all LLC owners are protected from personal liability for business debts and claims. This means that if the business itself can't pay a creditor -- such as a supplier, a lender, or a landlord -- the creditor cannot legally come after an LLC member's house, car, or other personal possessions. Because only LLC assets are used to pay off business debts, LLC owners stand to lose only the money that they've invested in the LLC. This feature is often called "limited liability."
Exceptions to Limited Liability
While LLC owners enjoy limited personal liability for many of their business transactions, this protection is not absolute. This drawback is not unique to LLCs, however -- the same exceptions apply to corporations. An LLC owner can be held personally liable if he or she:

personally and directly injures someone
personally guarantees a bank loan or a business debt on which the LLC defaults
fails to deposit taxes withheld from employees' wages
intentionally does something fraudulent, illegal, or reckless that causes harm to the company or to someone else, or
treats the LLC as an extension of his or her personal affairs, rather than as a separate legal entity.

This last exception is the most important. If owners don't treat the LLC as a separate business, a court might decide that the LLC doesn't really exist and find that its owners are really doing business as individuals who are personally liable for their acts. To keep this from happening, make sure you and your co-owners:

Act fairly and legally. Do not conceal or misrepresent material facts or the state of your finances to vendors, creditors, or other outsiders.
Fund your LLC adequately. Invest enough cash in the business so that your LLC can meet foreseeable expenses and liabilities.
Keep LLC and personal business separate. Get a federal employer identification number, open up a business-only checking account, and keep your personal finances out of your LLC accounting books.
Create an operating agreement. Having a formal written operating agreement lends credibility to your LLC's separate existence. For more on this, see Nolo's article The LLC Operating Agreement.

For more information on LLC limited liability protection and the differences in state laws, see  LLCs and Limited  Liability - What Protection Do You Get?.  


Additional Protection: Business Insurance
A good liability insurance policy can shield your personal assets when limited liability protection does not. For instance, if you are a massage therapist and you accidentally injure a client's back, your liability insurance policy should cover you. Insurance can also protect your personal assets in the event that your limited liability status is ignored by a court.
In addition to protecting your personal assets in such situations, insurance can protect the LLC's assets from lawsuits and claims. But your LLC won't be protected if it doesn't pay its bills: Commercial insurance usually does not protect personal or corporate assets from unpaid business debts, whether or not they're personally guaranteed.
For more information on insurance, see Nolo's article Obtaining Small Business Insurance.
LLC Taxes
Unlike a corporation, an LLC is not considered separate from its owners for tax purposes. Instead, it is what the IRS calls a "pass-through entity," like a partnership or sole proprietorship. This means that business income passes through the business to the LLC members, who report their share of profits -- or losses -- on their individual income tax returns. Each LLC member must make quarterly estimated tax payments to the IRS.
While an LLC itself doesn't pay taxes, co-owned LLCs must file Form 1065, an informational return, with the IRS each year. This form, which partnerships also have to file, sets out each LLC member's share of the LLC's profits (or losses), which the IRS reviews to make sure LLC members are correctly reporting their income.
For more information on LLC taxes, see Nolo's article How LLCs Are Taxed.
LLC Management
The owners of most small LLCs participate equally in the management of their business. This arrangement is called "member management."
There is an alternative management structure -- somewhat awkwardly called "manager management" -- in which you designate one or more owners (or even an outsider) to take responsibility for managing the LLC. The nonmanaging owners (sometimes family members who have invested in the company) simply sit back and share in LLC profits.
In a manager-managed LLC, only the named managers get to vote on management decisions and act as agents of the LLC. Choosing manager management sometimes makes sense, but it might require you to deal with state and federal laws regulating the sale of securities. (For more information, see Nolo's Limited Liability Company (LLC) FAQ.)
Forming an LLC
To create an LLC, you file "articles of organization" (in some states called a "certificate of organization" or "certificate of formation") with the LLC division of your state government. This office is often in the same department as the corporations division, which is usually part of the secretary of state's office. Filing fees range from about $100 to $800. Now, in every state, you can  form an LLC with just one person.
Many states supply a blank one-page form for the articles of organization, on which you need only specify a few basic details about your LLC, such as its name and address, and contact information for a person involved with the LLC (usually called a "registered agent") who will receive legal papers on its behalf. Some states also require you to list the names and addresses of the LLC members.
In addition to filing articles of organization, you must create a written LLC operating agreement. You don't have to file your operating agreement with the state, but that doesn't mean you can get by without one. The operating agreement is a crucial document because it sets out the LLC members' rights and responsibilities, their percentage interests in the business, and their share of the profits.
To learn more about these and other details involved in setting up an LLC, read Nolo's article How to Form an LLC. To form your LLC right now, use Nolo's Online LLC, which will collect the required information and file your articles of organization with your state.
Ending an LLC
Under the laws of many states, unless your operating agreement says otherwise, when one member wants to leave the LLC, the company dissolves. In that case, the LLC members must fulfill any remaining business obligations, pay off all debts, divide any assets and profits among themselves, and then decide whether they want to start a new LLC to continue the business with the remaining members.
Your LLC operating agreement can prevent this kind of abrupt ending to your business by including "buy-sell," or buyout, provisions that set up guidelines for what will happen when one member retires, dies, becomes disabled, or leaves the LLC to pursue other interests. (For more information, see Nolo's article Plan Ahead for LLC Ownership Changes.)

I have used let's talk twice now and have not had any problems. However, this second time I am supposed to get rebates but they are directly from T-Mobile. I have yet to submit everything but am now worried.

I haven't experienced the mail in rebate issue, although I have purchased from them a couple of times. Recently I purchased two phones, and received a $200 instant discount taken off each phone at the time of purchase. I received two free phones, two free bluetooth headsets, and free shipping.

I tried to purchase a phone on the phone from these folks and when we got to the part where they wanted my acct. no. from my old phone, I told them I have a TracFone and there is no acct. no. I said I have a serial no., but he said that would not do. We were at the end of the order and I had told him every pertinent number, SS, driver's license, etc., but he said the order would be on hold until I could submit an acct. no. I got tired of listening to him and hung up. Within 10 min. a charge was made by them on my debit card. They said it would take from 7 to 30 days to credit my card.No, I won't be buying anything from them. I just bought the same phone from another online seller.

I am currently going through the same thing with them. I purchased my phone in May with the promise of a 50.00 rebate and when I check the status they tell me 2 to 3 weeks. It's been 7 months and today they tell me 12 to 16 weeks longer! They are trying to avoid payment in hopes you'll forget about it or lose your information copies.It's a scam tricking you into thinking your getting a good deal on phones through them but without that rebate you are'nt. I really regret doing business with them.

I ordered 2 phones mid May 2006. Waited 4 months billing like the rebate stated, sent it in for my $100 and $150 rebates and............NADA. A year later, and everytime I call which has been 4 or 5 times, al I get is a run around, technical phone problems,leaving you on hold forever,please call back in an hour, or flat out(disconnected) hung up on. I WOULD NEVER USE THESE CROOKS AGAIN!!!! They prove that rebates are generally a bunch of CRAP. They hope you forget and never send them in, or just string you along long enough that you just get weary and stop harrassing them for what you are legally entitled to. My only consolation is KARMA. You get what you give. THEY DISGUST ME!!!

I had a similar experience with let's talk.com. I placed an order to add a line to my existing account and convert to a family talk plan for Cingular on 5/3/07. They were offering the Sony Ericsson phone w810i for $229.99 minus an instant rebate of $180.00 and Cingular rebate of $100, totalling -$50.01, i.e. I was offered $50 after all rebates. After placing the order they sent me multiple emails requesting one information and after the other over a few days time. Even after supplying all the information, they still did not process the order, saying that Cingular was requiring a $150 deposit on my order. I have been a customer in good standing with Cingular for several years with no outstanding balance or any late payments. So, I called Cingular and and asked why they are asking for a deposit. I was told that they did not require any deposit from me to add another line. I called Let's talk and told them about my conversation with Cingular. So, then they agreed to proceed with the order after I gave the phone number and name of the Cingular representative I talked to. After a day or two again they emailed me with the same message saying that I need to pay a deposit of $150 that Cingular is asking to process the order. They even quoted some credit reporting agency which did my credit check. I ordered a credit report from the agency and found that Let's talk never ordered any report. My report came out clean as well. I have had a friend who had problem with their order through let's talk too. I called let's talk and cancelled my order. So, deal with this company at your own risk !

i also ordered from letstalk.com, and i bought 2 phones on a family plan for Cingular, 1 pink razr and 1 black razr, i got both of them pretty quick, considering it was a holiday weekend, but when i opened it, the pink razr was good but when i opened my black razr it wasnt even Cingular branded (the pink one was) it was an unlocked phone, it couldnt text either, but when i went to call out, tht was the worst, there was no sound and the mic didnt work, i was pissed, then we called Lets talk, and we (my sister and i) could not figure out how to return it, we called everybody, they were all in india and they did not understand what we were talking about.. after over a month of calling them & the better business Bureau we finally got it sent out, then another two weeks went buy and we finally got it back, they had the worst service center ever!!!! DO NOT BUT FROM THEM!! PAY $30 FOR A RAZR IF U WANT ONE, ITS WORTH THE EXTRA MONEY TO GET IT OFF OF CINGULAR/AT&T'S WEBSITE!!!

As I said in my earlier post, I thought when I received my phones, all was well.  For some reason Let's Talk said I couldn't keep my two old ATT phone numbers, even though I only wanted to migrate my service over to Cingular.  Although I was on a family plan, they assigned me two new numbers with different area codes.  I contacted them and they changed one of the numbers. When I checked the Cingular website I discovered I now had five phone lines on my account; my original two, the two new ones, and the one with the different area code.  I ended up going to the Cingular store, where they had to wipe out the entire transaction and start the order over. It was a hassle but I ended up being able to keep my original phone numbers after all.

I signed up for a free razor V3c and a 2 year T-Mobile Plan with 1000 anytime min.Phone would be FREE (including shipping) and I would receive a $50 rebate.Order on Thurs. May 31st and I got an email on Friday June 1st saying my credit was denied by T-Mobile and I should click the link in the email and choose one of those phones and plans.Well the phone and plan for me to chose was the same one I ordered, so I called Let's Talk and without telling the sales person whom answered the phone that I click the link to see what was avail. he informed me that all I needed to do is place a new order using that link if you where denied credit.Well folks, my fico is 755/725/700 and I could just by the phone out right but I find that these people are a joke.I applied for my cell phone using my company EIN number and it's info to order this phone and I know that our DAB is 80+ more than enough to order over 50 phones if we need them.Just for the record I am going to call them back on monday to ask them when did they look at my credit report (no inquires in 20+ days) and to explain why I can reorder the same package that they just said I did not qualify for....... this should be interesting ...... I let everyone know what happen but I think I will go straight to the wireless store and get my phone and service.

In my last response, I qualified for rebates but had not submitted them yet.  Well, I did submit for the rebates and received them...let's talk sent e-mail when the forms were received and being processed.  I have since ordered accessories from them and received promptly with no problems.

i ordered 4 Motorola razors from letstalk.com about 18 months ago.  each phone cost me more than $150 but i was supposed to get $130 per phone back in rebates from letstalk.com (should be called letsripthemoff.com).  i submitted the rebates more than a year ago and letsripthemoff.com has managed to stall paying the rebates.  in fact they have denied 3 of the 4 rebates.  its taken me more than 1 year and i still do not have my money.  i will press my case directly with the president if they have one.  but regardless, do stay away from them.  they are crooks!

I bought 2 Treos from Letstalk.com, but like everyone else I got the zillion emails asking for this or that, but they could not give reasons why they needed the information.  After seeing this posting, I told them I knew their company was a scam, so they sent the phone with no more emails.  Then, of course, they opened a new line for me instead of upgrading my existing line. I know the difference between an upgrade and new line, but nowhere on the website did it say that I would get a new line, AND the website asked what phone number I wanted the plan to go to (totally deceptive). After an hour on the phone with Sprint, I had to send the phone back and get refunded by Sprint.  Sprint told me that third parties get a $20 commission every time they open a new line, so they'll use any sort of deception to get people to sign up.  Sprint was totally cool about the whole thing, but it was a hassle and obviously not worth it, since now I have no new phone.  I'm going to write a letter to Sprint to tell them about the scam, but I'm sure there are a number of companies that do this, and the new accounts they gain are worth the people they piss off.

in march of this year, i purchased 3 lines from lets talk thru tmobile.  well because i had insufficient coverage in my area tmobile let me out of my contract and called lets talk for me.  so on this conference call with a tmobile rep and a lets talk rep i was told that because the lines were activated they recieved their commission as well as i deactivated them before the 30 day guarantee... well everything was told that no issues were discovered and that everything was taken f.  four months later my moms card was charged 750.00 for deactivation fees.  first of all this card was used for verification only and no where in their terms and conditions does it state that it gives them permission to charge the card.  so now the phones are gone so i cant return them (which on that lovely conference call i was told i didnt need to return them) and they will not own up to making a mistake.  I have called in numerous times and i keep getting the run around...  you would think that in four months if a product wasnt received that was supposed to be that one would recieve a letter, email or something stating that the phones were not yet received... but not this company... if anyone knows how i can go about disputing this please let me know!!! THANKS

We've had several contracts from letstalk.com, always for T-Mobile though, and NEVER had a problem. I got my rebates and everything. When I read these posts here, it seems to be predominantly for Cingular contracts. Might that be the issue?

I purchased a Samsung Blast with a 2-yr T-Mobile contract through Let's Talk last year.  I can't comment about the rebate (I forgot to send it in), but I can say I've had a great deal of trouble with my phone freezing up.  Had I bought the phone directly from T-Mobile I could send it back for a new phone.  Since I purchased it elsewhere, however, I'm stuck!!!  Just something else to consider before purchasing from Let's Talk.

On December 11th, i decided i was done using prepay, the rates were about to go up, my phone was about unusable, text messaging charges were killing me.  So i started researching phone companies.  I was going to have to pay a hefty deposit at cingular and verizon, so i chose t-mobile as they have the flex pay plan which allows you to get a new phone without paying a deposit.  Sweet deal, i started checking out their phones and fell in love with the Motozine ZN5, great now its time to check for the best price(t-mobile site, best buy, newegg, walmart, etc) Walmart was hands down the cheapest (should have been my first sign).  So I started my order for the phone, free after instant discount, free 4gb microsd card, free 3 day shipping.  Order went in no problem. Then i start getting these e-mails (more info needed), (deposit required)....what flexpay doesn't require a deposit.  Then these jerkwads start putting authorization holds on the bank account i ordered with.  Every time i call them i get put on hold for 30 min to an hour.  Finally i get through to an account manager and get my account status to "ready to ship"....sweet, but every day the estimated ship date gets moved to the next day.  Today (1/12/09) I get a bill in the mail saying its time to pay for the next months service.  I call "letstalk.com" again spend about an hour on the phone saying they've had problems processing my payment, I 3-way in my bank which assures them their debit for my first month service and 149.99 has posted.  Letstalk quickly puts my order back to Ready to ship status.  A few hours later i check my order again to make sure it's still "ready to ship" and the status has been moved all the way back to "carrier approval".  With T-mobile bill in hand i finally call t-mobile customer service.  1 ring and i'm talking to someone, they all were very concerned that i had not received my phone.  They have credited my t-mobile account for the amount that i had paid for first month and said they will start my billing when my phone ships.  Tomorrow i call letstalk.com back, if they still haven't shipped my phone i will cancel my order, cancel my check card that i used to open the account, and order direct from t-mobile.AAARRRRGGGGGHHHHH!!!!!

They also misrepresented that you could keep your old phone number and your old phone operational until the new phone arrives.  Let's Talk automatically disconnected my Verizon service 4 days before my new phone arrived--nothing I could do.  Helpless for 4 days.Be warned---their "how to" is misleading and you will be without service for days if you port over your old number.

You may have to wait six months to a year to get on the shelves after a buyer agrees to sell your productSo let's talk money.In the first article in this series about product licensing for industrial designers, I presented a vision of what is possible—positive, encouraging, optimistic but slightly cautionary. Here, I am interested in throwing out some numbers so that you can decide if licensing might make sense for you (or under what conditions it would).It is important to understand that there is no "standard" contract across industries or even within a company. Everything is generally negotiable and there are many ways that compensation can pan out. The most common mode is for a company to compensate through royalties only, which helps mitigate their risk that the product may not sell well. It is also possible for the designer to receive up-front cash in addition to royalties, but often this is just an advance payment deducted from future royalties. But this is still good if you can get it, because there is no guarantee that there will be future royalties. Hence, companies usually only agree to advances if the amount is relatively small and/or if they are confident that the product will sell. Insisting on significant money up front is often a quick way to sour a deal.OXO offers licensors both cash buyouts and royalty dealsSome companies prefer to buy the intellectual property outright in one lump sum—as with Ikea, for example. This is more of a gamble for the licensee, but saves the administrative hassle of calculating and cutting royalty checks, as well as the risk and cost of potential contract re-negotiation or disputes with the licensor (you). But with this risk comes the reward of saving all the royalties they would have paid out if the product proved particularly successful. Some companies like OXO consider both the royalty and cash-buyout options.Companies can also offer an equity stake in the business that surrounds the product. This is much less common, however, and occurs usually when the designer brings more to the table than just a single new product idea (e.g. name cache, design services for a whole product line, expertise and connections, or even money). More established designers/consultancies do this, like Yves Behar's fuseproject that has had at least 18 equity partners including, more recently, with Core77 Design Awards 2012 Notable for Consumer Products, Sabi. Fuseproject's recent joint venture, Sabi pill productsI am going to focus however on the most common approach—royalties-only. In doing so, I want to emphasize the need to understand the licensee's position. Being in the mass-manufacturing business is tough! There are high start-up costs with tooling and initial inventory, increasing pressures from mass retailers (like having to take back product if it does not sell!), overhead costs of product development and sales teams, stiff global competition, changing regulations, expensive and lengthy certifications, insurance, etc. Young designers often gasp when hearing that a good royalty rate might be 5% of wholesale cost (around 2% of retail price)—"but it is MY idea!" Seasoned designers understand that a designed product (not to mention one that is not engineered, sourced, and fully developed and tested) is but a small part of the business equation. While important, good product design needs so much more to be a lasting commercial success. At the heart of the numbers is the issue of risk. Designers, in most cases, have very little to lose beyond their time and relatively small development costs. In the business world, the bigger risk-takers earn the bigger the rewards.I mentioned in the last column that many of the design-y companies (like the big European furniture and furnishings enterprises) often fail to yield substantive paychecks. They can be good for the portfolio, but not the pocketbook. This is in large part due to a lack of substantive intellectual property being offered for license. Much of what sells is not particularly novel. Look at the similarities in product lines at Crate and Barrel, West Elm, Room and Board, Restoration Hardware—these companies are going after the same basic market, and when one has a hit product, the others follow suit with their own derivations. This is certainly not unique to furniture and occurs to some degree in probably every industry. My (tragically) favorite demonstration of this sameness is the telephone aisle at Best Buy. Overwhelmingly there are just slight aesthetic differences, that possibly could be protected by a design patent, but that would ultimately not afford much protection. I am an advocate of design patents when approached and drafted strategically, but in a mature product category where there is a great deal of prior art, they aren't so effective (or would take hundreds of thousands of dollars to enforce with litigation). Manufacturers must navigate these treacherous waters and understandably are wary of paying significant sums for product ideas that cannot be protected. Design patent enforcement can be more challenging in a mature product categoryI advocate designers getting into the game of novel functionality, rather than just form (or secondarily producing form that can be well protected through design patents). If designers can produce robust intellectual property, they have access to a greater pay out, otherwise licensing is a bit of a crapshoot. [Ed Note: For more on Design Patents check out our full series here!]While some complain about the intellectual property protection as impeding innovation, it is intended to spur advancement by offering a reward (a short-term monopoly) for the risk of investing in something new. Like it or not, these are the rules of the game, and for product design, they are generally fair with generally equal access. Enforcement of patents, however, is problematic, as litigation is, as my attorney puts it, "the sport of kings." Luckily for more traditional product design, as opposed to information technology and electronica, disruption by patent trolls is less problematic. Crocs recently won a major design patent infringementWhile admittedly the patent system is far from ideal, product designers can more easily get aboard on the front end—securing IP for licensure—while the licensee is usually at the more troublesome back end of enforcement. (But going after infringers may still not be cost effective, and both licensor and licensee lose with reduced sales.)So let's say you have a protectable new product idea—how much money is in it? The answer depends on a few major factors: royalty percentage, the amount the royalty percentage is based on, cost of the product, number of units sold, and time period. The wise licensor considers all of these at the outset, when vetting a new product idea and before investing too much time and energy. Royalty rates vary per industry, but a good rule of thumb is between 2-3% on the low end, and 7-10% on the high end. I have licensed consumer products for as low as 3% and as high as 7%, with 5% being the most common and a generally fair number. But 5% of what? Usually this percentage is on wholesale cost, often "net sales" for the manufacturer. This is not the price tag in the store, but is often less than half of this—40% is pretty typical with larger retailers. (So, $10 retail price tag is sold at a wholesale price of $4; the retailer has a "60% margin"). And be careful, especially with the big-name European furniture and furnishings companies. Their notion of "net sales" is often actually at or near the cost of manufacturing, sometimes called "first cost," which is generally half of wholesale cost—ouch! "Net sales" may be closer to manufacturing cost than wholesale price. Photo by Mike Roelofs.Price-point of the product must next be considered. If the retail price of product is especially low (less than a dollar) or is especially high (hundreds or thousands of dollars) then royalty rates often reflect this. Both parties generally have their eye on the final cost of the license, and purchase price has some relation to sales volume. Understandably fewer $3000 products are sold than $3 products. In my experience it is tougher to make a decent paycheck on a $9 item than a $19 item. While more people can afford a $9 item, a $19 item is still accessible and the units sold can be equivalent, but usually the royalty rate is the same. So, within a range, you are often better off shooting for a product that sells for more.As mentioned, number of units sold is a critical component. This is why distribution is so important and why mass retailers are often the key to a nice royalty check. If a retailer has 1000 stores (like Bed Bath & Beyond) and they sell 1 product per store per week, then this is 52,000 products per year. (Usually if your product is not selling at least at this rate, they will drop your product.) With a fairly successful product, you may sell 3 units per store per week, or 156,000 units each year. If the product sells for $25, wholesales for $10, and you have a 5% royalty deal, then you are looking at $.50 per unit sold, for a total of $78,000 per year. Nice payout. If it sells at the minimum of 1/store/week, this is $26k per year. This is not to say that getting a product into a mass retailer is easy—it definitely is not. And many of them test in a small number of stores, slowly getting, if ever, to a full national rollout.But the idea is to begin with the market in mind (and likely a mass market), which is often not the designer's propensity. When in licensing mode, the successful designer abandons the many cool product ideas that she has which do not have a chance at mass appeal and large distribution. Please check out my royalty calculator to help estimate the potential licensing payoff—do this before working too much on the idea, as it just may not be financially worthwhile for you. Remember you not only have to develop the idea, but will have to sell it, which takes time (and is the topic of a future article).Use a royalty calculator to vet new ideas for licensing potentialThe last issue to consider in the calculus is time. How long will the product sell? Product lifespans vary by industry, but usually there are growth-, maturity-, and drop-off-stages. You should probably not expect more than 3-4 years of strong royalty checks for a given product before sales begin to slide. If a product is successful, you are assured of sales dilution from knock-offs or derivations that quickly follow. And financial derailment can easily happen at any turn, given the vagaries of corporate politics and strategy as well as innumerable external threats. For an excellent inventor's account of the rise and maturation of an innovative electrical power strip, read Christopher Hawker's "The Song of the PowerSquid".PowerSquid, licensed by Trident DesignThe other time element to consider is the wait for your first royalty check after signing a licensing agreement. Plan on 1-1/2 to 2 years, if at all. Firstly, licensing deals fall through all the time, even just weeks after the agreement is inked. This is because the company wants to sign an agreement before they invest time and money in actual product development—when things usually fall apart. Licensees also want a contract signed before they present the idea to potential retail buyers. If there is not enough initial interest, the project gets dropped, and the contract is nullified. (You may be able to negotiate a "kill clause" in the contract that offers a small fee if the licensee chooses not to move forward.)If there is preliminary interest from buyers (often based on renderings or prototypes), you still have to wait for product development, packaging, certifications, manufacturing and shipping. You may also have to wait up to a year to get into a mass retailer depending on when they update their store-shelf planograms. And then you wait at least three months as royalties are commonly paid quarterly. So licensing is not a quick and easy road to riches, just as with all other legal enterprises. But it can pay off and work for you if you have the right expectations. In my experience and in speaking with other licensors, making $20-30k/year licensing a $15 mass-market item is doing pretty well. Of the 8,000 new kitchen products introduced each year, as many as 95% of new products "fail",  according to the Food Network's Invention Hunters. There is a lot of competition, and flailing products may generate just $1000 royalty dollars per year. A dental company with a large catalog that I licensed a product to, even maintains that a product with $6k of net yearly sales is average and worth keeping in the catalog—dhello there, $100 quarterly royalty checks! This is why you usually need to maintain a number of licensed products, inevitably in various stages of growth, maturity and decline, to make a proper living out of it.But you can certainly hit it big too. And this is what keeps the dream alive and can make product licensing exciting. Like all other forms of work, you are better off being energized by what you do, most especially if there is no guaranteed payoff. And, it is important to have the right expectations about the chances of getting a license, getting a product to market, getting sufficient distribution, and ultimately getting a decent royalty check. You should always run the numbers on what your payday might be with a new idea, given the price-point, distribution, and likely royalty rate, before investing your time and certainly your money on prototypes and intellectual property protection. It can be a fun and lucrative ride, but it's not get-rich-quick for the overwhelming majority of new product licensors.

Albert,  It is possible that doing your own market research would be helpful to a potential licensee. Presumably they would need to be convinced that it is not significantly biased in any way, e.g. it's your friends and family are the respondents and the questions are not leading. Fundamentally it needs to be good information that moves toward standards of validity, reliability, and generalizability.  Other marketing data can be helpful as well, like a market analysis of the competitors, though often if a licensee is in the industry they have a better sense of this than you might. Honestly, I am not so sure that a bunch of positive comments from unknown people--just names--would have a great deal of influence. It is certainly better than if they were bad comments, but do these people actually represent those who might purchase? Have you determined a target market that would be meaningful/relevant to the licensee?  Just because someone likes the idea does not mean that they are moved to purchase. Perhaps there are other ways to get user feedback, or more specific or more useful feedback. I have seen very convincing videos of people using products where it is obvious that they are amazed, or convinced, or otherwise pleased. Perhaps you want to convey that it is easy to use and you show candid videos--no need for high production. Of course you want to do the research that helps answer the most important questions that a licensee would have and that would help mitigate risk.Your research is valuable to them when it might save them money in having to do it themselves, just like with product development efforts or marketing efforts of the designer/inventor.  If i was a potential licensee I might be more concerned with how your solution compares to other competitive products--like air in a can, for example. Do people prefer yours? At what price? What are their biggest concerns or barriers to purchase?Generally research provided by the inventor at the pitch stage would likely only nudge a licensee unless it was powerful research that was believable. Third parties are helpful, but of course add cost.But perhaps just as much as convincing a licensee, research helps you the inventor know more and be more confident or better understand the shortcomings (which all products do) and how to address them.Best of luck!Bruce

Thanks Bruce for checking my product out, and for your honest opinion. A couple of years ago I had done another survey on another product I invented. I got over 124 people to give me a rating from 1 to 10 and most all of my ratings I got all nines and tens. After I did the survey I decided to market it myself so I took it to Walmart.  They wanted me to demonstrate my product to them. After I demonstrated my product the manager told me that he loved my idea. And he told one of the other managers that were in the room with us to take me where the beach equipment was. He showed me that he had a place on the shelf where they would display my product. I was surprised that Walmart was ready to do business with me. They were ready for me to start manufacturing my product by the thousands. But I had to tell them that I will have to get back with them, because I didn't have any experience in marketing. that's why I am trying to put my products into a manufacturer's hands, like Stephen Key says we should do and let the manufacturing company handle everything for me. I have many great ideas but I don't know how to read or write because I had dyslexia and I also got lead poisoning when I was a kid in the Bahamas, so it makes it very hard for me to do what I am trying to do but I know one day I will be able to get my products into a manufacturer company hands. 2

Hi Bruce, I would like to have your honest opinion on what you think about my emergency air supply line. This is my new invention that is patent pending.  I am doing a survey so when I get in touch with a manufacturing company they can see that people liked my new idea. Could you tell me if it makes it easier for a manufacturing company to accept and license my product since I am doing a survey, Thanks so much you can go here to see my new product  http://www.1952albert.com/emergencyairsupplyline.htm

Ximena,Congrats on your deal. The issue of indemnity is very important. This is protection if something goes wrong.It is not uncommon for a licensee to try and put the liability for a  problem onto the designer, but it is not fair in general in my opinion. It is understandable that they would try, but I have never singed a contract with this. In my experience once I raised my concerns the company changed the contract in every case, because they realize that it is unfair.If they are actually manufacturing the product, why would you be responsible if it fails? Likely they will be doing the engineering and fabrication, which you have no control over.  I suggest that you express your concerns--remember everything is negotiable. Also remember that they are making the lion's share of the profit.The only liability that I have taken on is over the originality of the idea, to the extent that I know. It makes sense that they have no idea if you actually stole your idea from someone and would be concerned about that. While I accept liability if it turns out that I knowingly and willingly violated someone else's intellectual property, I do not accept liability for the overall originality of the idea. Independent designers are generally not in a position to enter into intellectual property litigation--this could be a frivolous claim or a legitimate one or an international one. They should be willing to take that risk on, just as they do with their own products.My sense is that they will understand your concerns--make them known respectfully in the spirit of negotiation. But in the end you should not take on liability for anything that is out of your control because litigation can be a bankrupt-er (which is why they want to try to and get you to take it on rather than themselves if you let them).

Hi Bruce,I am about to sign a licensing agreement and the Licensee states that as:  "The DESIGNER I am the sole owner of the Design. As such, the DESIGNER shall be solely liable for any infringement of the DESIGN on the rights of third parties. DESIGNER, expressly stipulates and agrees to indemnify and hold forever harmless LICENSEE, against any and all claims, demands or actions which may hereafter at any time be made or instituted against LICENSEE for the purpose of enforcing rights held or allegedly held in the Design. Furthermore, DESIGNER agrees to reimburse LICENSEE for reasonable attorney's fees incurred by LICENSEE to defend against any such claim, demand, or action."I feel this clause makes me very vulnerable. I would appreciate your feedback.

Such a helpful article, thank you.  I am hoping you or someone can direct me, I have two ideas: One is for an additional demographic I know of for product a company currently successfully sells. ($20.00 ea)  The additional demographic consists of a group of women numbering in the hundreds of thousands. No change to the product would be necessary, only the packaging and marketing. The other is similar. I have an idea for a product currently successfully sold (also approx 20.00 ea). If the company altered the color of the product and packaging it would open up a huge market.   I would like to know how I should contact the companies and what I should say.

Alberta, This is a tough one, at least your second question--what you should say. The first part is easy, you already know the companies so just call them and try and speak to someone on the phone. It may take a while to find the right person, but if they are game for this kind of thing, you will find them. It is certainly possible that they are not open to this as companies run a risk with 'open innovation.' But the problem you have is that there is no intellectual property to protect. Companies are loath to pay for something that cannot be protected. Your best bet is to try and have a conversation with them--ideally protected by an NDA, but that may be challenging--to see if they are game. If they are you would need to find a way to directly measure the financial impact of your idea. The least risk for them is a royalty for that market. In my opinion, this only has a small chance of working out for you, but is still worth pursuing because you have very little invested in it. You should always be thinking about return on investment, and if this were to hit, any money you would get from them would prove to be a high percentage. Without an NDA though they could very easily take your idea with no recourse. But, what have you got to lose if you do not try? What would you do with your idea anyway?  Good Luck.

                    hello I read you're article and I  have a question for you.

I am going to  start working with a licensing company that has connection with a lot of big name retail  like Walmart , target, Walgreen and more,

 they are going to help me create my product they offer me a 20 to 80 % royalty from their company meaning 20 for them and 80 for me. then they also told me that they work with retail product licensing which has a typical royalty range of 3%-7%.

 now with all honesty they told me that my product has a  95% chance to be a success because of the category my product will be in which is product for dogs.

what I would like to know is how much revenue will my product make with a 3%-7% royalty.

                    I would stay away from Quirky or in general publicizing product opportunities you identify - what is the point? Helping other firms get it to market before you? This has always been a cat-and-mouse  game you normally win by being faster and having higher conceptual fluency than the next guy (or gal). I have a half dozen license deals but always tried to go for ideas/products with the shortest development cycle, can't believe people will invest years in a concept then find out the market has long moved on. 

Great series, though, numbers are right on. Most people cannot retire on royalties as product lifetimes keep shortening so you have to run constantly, not like finding oil in your back yard.

                    Addendum:  The coveted object of greatest worth to me in the license game is not a new design as much as a new problem.  

Design is the easy part (phones at Best Buy), identifying a new problem, that is the hard part.  

Which brings me to your comment on Quirky, I am very cautious  of what I submit to quirky.  I rarely submit a design that identifies a new problem, because that IP is very precious.  And first to market with the solution to new problem is a huge advantage, even when the problem is only perceived.

                    Bruce your article is right on the money; my personal experience of over 200 concepts presented - 15 licensed - 3 on the market - 3 in progress (tooling) - 3 dead due to factory pricing - 1 dead due to technical difficulties - the rest in limbo.  All licensed between 2 and 5% of net sales except 1 outright sale.  Two of the 3 on the market are in Walmart, told they are selling well, can't wait for the first royalty cheque on those.

My largest hurtle is getting my concepts in front of companies,  I have several that have gotten great feedback but don't fit the reviewer's market space.

                    Ray, thanks, it is difficult to give a good representation of the financial upside because there is so much variability. Designers/inventors who do a lot of licensing have a pretty wide range--some products that may only generate $1k/year, some in the $5k/year range, and others that are a hit and generate $30-40k (if not $100k+). Often great products do not sell well for any number of reasons beyond the design (what we can control). It is interesting to look at Quirky.com and the sales numbers of their products, since they share them. It is a long road to just get to market on Quirky, but the big hurdle is marketplace acceptance, which can be disappointing as the numbers tell.

DAN, congratulations! After you get that first one under your belt; it can be addictive.  If you are game, I would love to talk about your licensing experience. You can email me through core77.

                    The timing could not be more perfect.  I just signed my first royalty agreement.  The product has been in dev for 18 months and I won't see a royalty check for another 7 so your 2 year payout estimate was spot-on.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

It's amazing what three letters can do.
Adding "Inc." or "LLC" to your business' name is more than a good look. It protects your personal assets, creates tax advantages, and much more.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
