Back-Up Care Programs: Emergency Child Care, Adult & Elder Care
Providing emergency back-up care when regular care arrangements fall through.
Bright Horizons® back-up care provides families with a safety net for those days when regular daycare, child care, or elder care arrangements fall through. Back-up care programs are provided most often through employers who sponsor care for their employees with dependent-care needs. We also provide drop-in or emergency child care to the community at select Bright Horizons locations.
Back-up care supplements, rather than replaces, normal care arrangements and is a comforting emergency alternative when you need it most. Our programs offer back-up care for family members of all ages, from infants through elders, including adults and children with special needs.










 Drop-In Emergency  Child  Care 
Providing back-up child care for families in our communities.
				Many Bright Horizons child care centers offer drop-in or emergency child care for families who live nearby and are looking for safe, high-quality care as well as engaging and fun activities for their children when their regular caregiver is unavailable.

Our centers are specially designed to help children feel safe and secure, and to ease the transition into their new environment. We welcome your child to our world-class facility with engaging opportunities for play and discovery, and devoted child care experts. Please contact a center near you to learn more.

Bright Horizons Family Solutions

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Bright Horizons Family Solutions (NYSE: BFAM) is a United States–based child-care provider and is the largest provider of employer-sponsored child care.[1] It is headquartered in Watertown, Massachusetts.
Bright Horizons was founded in 1986 by Massachusetts-based Bright Horizons Linda A. Mason and Roger H. Brown.[2]
Bright Horizons operates more than 700 child care centers worldwide, more than 600 across the U.S. and more than 200 in the UK and Ireland. The company also operates centers in Canada and Puerto Rico. Bright Horizons acquired kidsunlimited in April 2013, which has 64 nurseries and a successful childcare vouchers business.[3] This development means that Bright Horizons now serves around 15,500 children and families.
The Advisory Board includes scholars and practitioners such as Ed Schein and Stew Friedman. The company was publicly traded on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol: BFAM until it was acquired by Bain Capital in May 2008, and became publicly traded again 2013.
In 2014, Bright Horizons Family Solutions was named for the fifteenth time to Fortune Magazine's annual "100 Best Places to Work in America".[4]
In 1999, the senior leadership team at Bright Horizons formed the Bright Horizons Foundation for Children. Through the Foundation, Bright Horizons supports nonprofit organizations with a focus on programs for children and families. The Foundation is headquartered in Brentwood, Tennessee.[5] Bright Spaces, the Foundation’s program, creates play rooms for children in crisis in partnerships with Bright Horizons’ clients, other nonprofits, city governments, and other organizations.

Bright Horizons Family Solutions

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Bright Horizons Family Solutions (NYSE: BFAM) is a United States–based child-care provider and is the largest provider of employer-sponsored child care.[1] It is headquartered in Watertown, Massachusetts.
Bright Horizons was founded in 1986 by Massachusetts-based Bright Horizons Linda A. Mason and Roger H. Brown.[2]
Bright Horizons operates more than 700 child care centers worldwide, more than 600 across the U.S. and more than 200 in the UK and Ireland. The company also operates centers in Canada and Puerto Rico. Bright Horizons acquired kidsunlimited in April 2013, which has 64 nurseries and a successful childcare vouchers business.[3] This development means that Bright Horizons now serves around 15,500 children and families.
The Advisory Board includes scholars and practitioners such as Ed Schein and Stew Friedman. The company was publicly traded on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol: BFAM until it was acquired by Bain Capital in May 2008, and became publicly traded again 2013.
In 2014, Bright Horizons Family Solutions was named for the fifteenth time to Fortune Magazine's annual "100 Best Places to Work in America".[4]
In 1999, the senior leadership team at Bright Horizons formed the Bright Horizons Foundation for Children. Through the Foundation, Bright Horizons supports nonprofit organizations with a focus on programs for children and families. The Foundation is headquartered in Brentwood, Tennessee.[5] Bright Spaces, the Foundation’s program, creates play rooms for children in crisis in partnerships with Bright Horizons’ clients, other nonprofits, city governments, and other organizations.

Bright Horizons Family Solutions

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Bright Horizons Family Solutions (NYSE: BFAM) is a United States–based child-care provider and is the largest provider of employer-sponsored child care.[1] It is headquartered in Watertown, Massachusetts.
Bright Horizons was founded in 1986 by Massachusetts-based Bright Horizons Linda A. Mason and Roger H. Brown.[2]
Bright Horizons operates more than 700 child care centers worldwide, more than 600 across the U.S. and more than 200 in the UK and Ireland. The company also operates centers in Canada and Puerto Rico. Bright Horizons acquired kidsunlimited in April 2013, which has 64 nurseries and a successful childcare vouchers business.[3] This development means that Bright Horizons now serves around 15,500 children and families.
The Advisory Board includes scholars and practitioners such as Ed Schein and Stew Friedman. The company was publicly traded on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol: BFAM until it was acquired by Bain Capital in May 2008, and became publicly traded again 2013.
In 2014, Bright Horizons Family Solutions was named for the fifteenth time to Fortune Magazine's annual "100 Best Places to Work in America".[4]
In 1999, the senior leadership team at Bright Horizons formed the Bright Horizons Foundation for Children. Through the Foundation, Bright Horizons supports nonprofit organizations with a focus on programs for children and families. The Foundation is headquartered in Brentwood, Tennessee.[5] Bright Spaces, the Foundation’s program, creates play rooms for children in crisis in partnerships with Bright Horizons’ clients, other nonprofits, city governments, and other organizations.
