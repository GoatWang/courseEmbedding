BlueVine is the fastest, most convenient way for small businesses to get funding
Owning a small business can be incredibly rewarding. That’s why you started yours. But it can also be challenging when cash management is taking time away from running your business and when accessing capital for your business is a slow and difficult process.
That’s where we come in. We started BlueVine with two things in mind. First, to provide small businesses like yours access to capital when you need it, so you don’t have to worry about making payroll or investing in growth. Second, to serve small business owners with speed, simplicity, and transparency – no long waits, paperwork, or hidden fees that happen with other financial institutions. Running a business is challenging; BlueVine makes working capital easy.
BlueVine is based in Redwood City, California and backed by leading venture capital firms and private investors. We are proud to enable small businesses to grow and thrive with our service.

			Frequently Asked Questions		







About BlueVineInvoice FactoringLine of Credit				



About BlueVineInvoice FactoringLine of Credit



What is BlueVine?BlueVine is a leading online provider of working capital financing to small businesses. We offer financing through our business line of credit or invoice factoring products. We believe in making business financing fast, simple, and transparent so business owners like you can spend your time growing your business, not managing your cash flow.
What are the benefits of using BlueVine?
Speed: we generally approve applications within 24 hours, and after that we can get you funds as fast as a few hours after your request
Simplicity: a 5 minute application and an intuitive online dashboard
Transparency: when approved, we give you one rate for line of credit draws or factored invoices. As long as your account is in good standing, this includes everything except the optional wire transfer fee ($15)
Flexibility: fund only when you need, and pay only for what you use
Personal Service: a US based customer success team ready to answer any question or help with any issue

Do I need invoicing or accounting software to use BlueVine?No. Connecting your invoicing or accounting software to your BlueVine dashboard provides some additional benefits, but you can use BlueVine even if you don’t use invoicing or accounting software.
What are the benefits of connecting my invoicing or accounting software?
You may qualify for a higher credit line.
If you use QuickBooks, applying using your Intuit credentials at sign-up shortens your application process by pre-filling application fields.
If you use BlueVine’s invoice factoring, invoices sync from your software for one-click funding.

What information do you need from me to apply?The BlueVine application is three simple steps that can be completed in minutes.
We ask for:

General information about your business, such as address and Tax ID
Information about the business owner applying, including social security number
Either a read-only connection to your business’ bank account or your 3 most recent months of bank statements

 
The information you provide is stored in accordance with our strict Privacy Policy and encrypted to make sure that it is always safe and secure.
How is qualification for a BlueVine account determined?Qualification for BlueVine is determined based on a number of factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, your business cash flow, the strength of your customers, and to a lesser extent your personal and business credit history. You do not have to have perfect credit to work with us. We work with a broad range of clients, including those with below average credit.
What kind of credit score must I have to apply for a BlueVine Account?While we evaluate many parameters when making a funding decision, we look for personal credit scores above 530 for our invoice factoring service and above 600 for our business line of credit service.
How quickly does BlueVine make funding decisions?We typically respond to your application within 24 hours.
How much funding will I have access to?BlueVine offers credit lines between $5,000 and $2,000,000. Your credit line is the total amount of funding that you can have outstanding at any given time, and will replenish as you repay draws (for a line of credit) or as your customers pay outstanding invoices (for invoice factoring).
Are there termination fees if I want to leave?No. As long as you have no balances outstanding, you can stop using BlueVine at any time with no penalties or fees.
Does BlueVine provide unsecured financing?BlueVine financing is not unsecured. However, we do not require any specific amount, type or value of collateral and no appraisal or specific assets are required. Financing is secured by a general lien on the assets of the business and backed by a personal guarantee. We do not take personal assets as collateral.

What is “invoice factoring”?Today, business customers request longer and more flexible payment terms. As a result, you are constantly waiting to be paid by your customers while operational expenses, such as rent and payroll, need to be paid today. This gap in cash flow can limit your ability to hire more employees, buy more inventory and take on more customers. BlueVine’s invoice factoring solves your cash flow challenges by giving you money for your outstanding invoices today.
What is different about BlueVine’s invoice factoring?We fund invoices, but that’s where the similarities with traditional invoice factoring end. Our solution is fast, simple, and 100% online. In addition, BlueVine lets you maintain full control of your financing and your customer relationships as long as you are in good standing. We do not require any minimum volume or have termination fees, and you can fund as many or as few invoices as you like.
What businesses are eligible for invoice factoring?Any business that serves businesses (B2B) or governments (B2G) is eligible. Our minimum requirements are that you have been in business at least 3 months, that the business owner have a personal credit score of 530+, and that the business have revenues of at least $10,000 per month.
I’ve been denied by the bank for a loan. Can I still get funding from BlueVine?Yes. Our decision process is different than a bank’s. While we take credit history into consideration we focus on the quality of your customers, not only personal credit history. A great advantage of BlueVine’s invoice factoring is that you can leverage the credit-worthiness of your customers.
What kind of invoices can I submit?BlueVine currently accepts invoices where:

The service or product was completed, delivered and accepted by your customer
The customer is based in the US or Canada (English speaking provinces)
The customer is a business (not a consumer)
The invoice face value is higher than $500
The payment term is shorter than 13 weeks
The due date is at least 1 week away

Do I need invoicing software to work with BlueVine?No. If you don’t have invoicing software, you can easily upload the details of your issued invoices right in your BlueVine dashboard.
What industries does BlueVine work with?BlueVine serves businesses in a wide variety of industries. These include (but not limited to): IT Services & Technology, Business & Professional Services, Wholesale Trade & Distribution, Manufacturing, and Staffing Services. At the moment, we cannot work with companies in the medical and healthcare industries.
How often can I get funding on BlueVine?You can request advances for as many invoices as you like and as often as you like, within your available credit line. For example, if your credit line is $50,000, you can get funded on invoices worth a combined total of $50,000 at any given time.
How quickly do I receive the funds?As quickly as in a few hours once approved. With BlueVine you can choose between ACH electronic transfers or bank wire transfers. ACH transfers are free and the funds usually appear the next business day (but may take up to three). A bank wire costs $15 per wire and funds are typically available in your bank account the same day.
Does BlueVine notify my customers that I am receiving advances on their invoices?Generally, no. This way you maintain full control of your customer communications. However, BlueVine may offer you a larger credit line contingent upon a notification of assignment being sent to some of your customers.
What happens if my customer doesn’t pay?In the event your customer doesn’t pay the invoice, you are still responsible for settling your balance with BlueVine. You can self-pay the invoice directly on our website, or we will enroll you in our installment plan.
Is invoice factoring the same as getting a loan?No. BlueVine gives you an advance on the invoice amount, then on the invoice due date, your customer will simply pay the amount due to your BlueVine Account instead of sending it to your business address or account. As long as the invoice is paid by your customer as expected, there’s no repayment on your part, and you take on no debt or liability.
What is a business line of credit?A business line of credit gives you the ability to access funding when you want, up to your credit limit.  And unlike a traditional merchant cash advance or cash flow loan that is one-time, BlueVine’s Flex Credit is “revolving credit.”  This means that as you repay back your outstanding funds your available credit replenishes, and you can draw additional funds again as you like.
How is a line of credit different from a merchant cash advance?A typical merchant cash advance is an advance on your credit card transactions, and you must re-apply every time you want new funds.  A BlueVine business line of credit doesn’t require credit card transactions, and you can draw funds as often as you like (up to your credit limit).
What businesses are eligible for a line of credit?Any type of business is eligible. Our minimum application requirements are that you have been in business 6 months, that the business owner have a personal credit score of 600 or more, and that the business have revenues of at least $10,000 per month.
Due to regulations, however, we cannot provide lines of credit in the following states:

Kentucky
Nevada
New Hampshire
North Dakota
South Dakota
Tennessee
Vermont

Are you in one of these states? See if invoice factoring is right for you.
How do I draw funds?After approval, simply go into your dashboard, select an amount less than or equal to your available credit, and click the “Get funds now” button. That’s it!
How much funding will I have access to?BlueVine’s Flex Credit lines currently range from $5,000-$100,000.
How fast can I receive my funds?As quickly as a few hours once approved. With BlueVine you can choose between ACH electronic transfers or bank wire transfers. ACH transfers are free and the funds usually appear the next business day (but may take up to three). A bank wire costs $15 per wire and funds are typically available in your bank account the same day.
How does repayment work?Weekly repayments are automatically debited from your bank account.  As long as you have sufficient money in your bank account, you never have to worry about missing a payment.
How does repayment replenish my available credit?As you repay a draw, the principal portion (i.e. not fees) of your payment is added back to your available credit.  For example, if your weekly payment is $150 and your fees that week are $10, then after your repayment your available credit will go back up by $140.
What if I need more than $100,000?Our invoice factoring credit lines go up to $2,000,000.  We are also always looking for ways to grow with our clients; if your needs are different, contact us for a custom quote.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 07/23/2014
            

                BBB has determined that BlueVine Capital, Inc. meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                            4. complete the required application and pay all monetary obligations to BBB in a timely manner
                        









Advertise Honestly









            Adhere to established standards of advertising and selling.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Make known all material facts in both written and verbal representations, remembering that misrepresentation may result not only from direct statements but by omitting or obscuring relevant facts.
                

                    2. Ensure that any written materials are readily available, clear, accurate and complete.
                







Be Transparent









            Openly identify the nature, location, and ownership of the business, and clearly disclose all policies, guarantees and procedures that bear on a customer's decision to buy.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Upon request, provide BBB with all information required to evaluate compliance with BBB standards. This may include, but is not limited to business name, address and contact information; names and background of principles; business and banking references; licensing and/or professional accreditation; and a complete description of the nature of the business.
                

                    2. Clearly disclose to customers:

                    
1. direct and effective means to contact the business
2. terms of any written contract
3. any guarantees or warranties accompanying a product

                            4. any restrictions or limitations imposed (e.g. limited supply,maximum number available per customer)
                        
5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        BlueVine Capital, Inc. has received 3.68 out of 5 stars based on 2 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        BlueVine Capital, Inc. has received 3.68 out of 5 stars based on 2 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

What are the benefits of using BlueVine's business line of credit?



                    

                        

A business line of credit gives you the ability to access funding when you want, up to your credit limit. And unlike a traditional merchant cash advance or cash flow loan that is one-time, BlueVine’s Flex Credit is “revolving credit.” This means that as you repay back your outstanding funds your available credit replenishes, and you can draw additional funds again as you like.



                    

                        

What are the minimum requirements for the Line of Credit product?



                    

                        

600+ FICO, 6+ months in business, $1,000+ average monthly bank balance, $5,000+ monthly revenue



                    

                        

Do you serve all 50 states?



                    

                        

Due to regulations, we cannot provide lines of credit in the following states: Kentucky, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont



                    

                        

What kinds of companies use BlueVine?



                    

                        

Our solution is trusted by thousands of businesses owners and hundreds of industries across the country. We are rated 5 stars on the Intuit App Center, A+ rated by the BBB and rated 5 stars on TrustPilot. It costs nothing to apply and there are no monthly subscription fees or minimums. You only pay for the funds you use.

Merchant Cash Advance vs. Small Business Loan
 

 





 
Merchant Cash Advance
You can access funding from $5,000 to $300,000. Here’s how it works:


We purchase a set dollar amount of your business’s future credit/debit sales at a discounted price, we pay you this price in a lump sum cash funding.


We collect an agreed upon percentage of each future credit/debit transaction that you process. We do this directly through your processor, or we ACH the amount from your bank.


Your future payments vary based upon your future sales volume— so payments are cash flow friendly!
More questions on a merchant cash advance? Watch this video here to find out more.  
 




 
Small Business Loans
With this solution, you can access funding $5,000 to $500,000. The steps to get funding are easy:


We review your application and your banking and credit card processing history (if applicable) and consult with you on the loan amount, payment, and funding structure


We collect a set daily payment amount from your bank account via ACH debit


Your future payments are fixed so you can plan your future cash flow.
 

 



 
The Merchant Cash Advance Solution
If you have a history of credit card acceptance, then a Merchant Cash Advance may be just what you need. Your history of credit card volume is used to determine the amount of funds that can be advanced. A Merchant Cash Advance requires a minimal operating history and the lowest possible credit requirements. Your payments fluctuate, and are dependent upon the amount of your future credit card sales. The amount that you pay is either collected directly through the daily deposits of your merchant processing account or collected by daily ACH debit to your bank account.
 




 
The Small Business Loan Solution
This solution is ideal for the stronger credit profile, and business with strong consistent cash flow that desires a fixed payment structure. Additionally, the funding amount is not limited by your credit card processing volume. If you have at least 9 months operating history in your business, and prefer a fixed payment structure, then let us quote you a Small Business Loan. Funding time is still about 3 days after submission of your complete application package!

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
