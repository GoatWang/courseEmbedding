Description

                    Watanabe, un uomo dal passato oscuro, pur restando nell'ombra, tenta con il lavoro di riconquistare giorno per giorno la dignità perduta negli ultimi dodici anni. Dopo aver stabilizzato la sua situazione, in un momento di relativa tranquillità emotiva, ritorna a visitare la sua casa abbandonata anni prima. Scopre così che ora vi abitano persone a lui sconosciute. Sconosciute, sì, ma non estranee. Questo romanzo si svolge in Giappone, ed è una storia generata dalla reazione a tragici eventi di protagonisti estremamente sensibili, che narra soprattutto di come nulla possa fermare una giovane madre determinata a dare alla sua meravigliosa piccola creatura, di nome Chiharu, la famiglia che lei non ha potuto avere. Ogni personaggio ha qualcosa del proprio passato nascosto in tasca, racchiuso in un duro guscio di noce, affinché gli altri non possano romperlo e rivelare così il mistero in esso racchiuso. Ma sentimenti come la stima, il rispetto, l'amore e il richiamo del sangue possono più di qualsiasi schiaccianoci.show more

Talent Management at American Income Life 


Career Tips, LeadershipFeb 10thLEAVE A COMMENT


Domenico Bertini VP of Field Operations for American Income Life
Imagine you arrive at work one morning to the evidence of a burglary.
A brand new server, printer, or fax machine has disappeared. You call the building security officer and the police. Then you launch your own investigation. You are determined to find out how this happened and who is responsible. You will not rest until the case is solved. And you immediately increase security measures—no more property will be lost.
Now think about the last time one of your most talented agents was stolen by the competition or just walked out your door. What kind of investigation did you launch? What measures were implemented to prevent it from happening again?
Maybe the loss of a $40,000 – $200,000 asset set off no alarm bells because no one ever really assessed the cost of losing talent.
While there’s really no silver bullet for keeping everyone we hire, there are a few steps you can take to increase your talent retention.

Keep your best people in front of the line, you’ll have significant payoff. The best American Income Life agents solve customer problems and capitalize on opportunities to up-sell products or services. These high performing agents build your service reputation and help you combat negative feedback.

 Losing high performers could cost your agency tens of thousands in immediate growth not to mention the time you’ll have to spend in recruitment, training and learning curve costs to replace them. Yet most agencies don’t differentiate among agents who voluntarily choose to leave, and our turnover statistics only summarize the total of terminations in that month, quarter or year. A much deeper dive is needed. Start with exit interviews and find out why they are leaving. You will learn that most of the time they are not leaving the company, but they are leaving a bad manager.
We need to develop a talent mindset and part of this includes tracking terminations by performance. It should be a cardinal sin to lose a top performer. A senior manager (if not an executive) should call top performing agents who voluntarily terminate. This will help our managers to focus on retaining the “rock stars” of American Income Life.
There’s no magic bullet for keeping your best people. Talent Retention involves doing a number of things well. Although turnover is most often attributed to income, 70% to 80% of the reasons people leave are related to supervision: they leave their managers. So clearly, training our managers not only to recruit but also to motivate and inspire talent is a retention factor you cannot overlook.
A missing link in many agencies, especially as they grow larger, is the human touch. Your top talent wants to be treated important in the organization. Little things make a big difference. American Income Life’s great founder, Bernard Rapoport, always made an effort to know and remember the top talents’ names in the company and recognize them when in front of them. That little recognition was often more important than a bonus check for many of us.  How can you feel anything but disengaged when you feel like a number? Agencies that find ways to value their talent and focus on retention as well as recruiting will be miles ahead in the upcoming growth journey we have started many years ago.

Turnover is reduced when people…they are PEOPLE…feel wanted, cared about, and a part of things.  There are some rules but the fitst one is simple, and the oldest:
1. Do to others what you would have others do to you.
2. Compliment nice appearance
2. Know something about everyone.
3. Is a relative sick?ask about them
4. Do they have a question? Answer it without talking down or reminding them ‘you were taught this’
5. LOOK at them. Men are your equals, as are women.
6. Talk to their EYES. If you’re looking somewhere else, guys, the ladies darn well know it. It’s rude.
7. NEVER raise your voice. Get softer if you’re unhappy. They listen harder.
8. Replace insulting displays of displeassure with ‘I’m disappointed that this happened”.
9. The ‘employee’ in front of you is a creation of the same God. You may have authority, but that makes your accountability higher when it comes to how you treat them.
10. Treat EVERYONE with respect and love.
As our wise leader says, being personal and caring helps retain. The single biggest cost we have is training and recruiting. We spend a lot of time replacing folks that we could have kept if we hadn’t been too busy to care.
Bravo, Sir. This article is dead on.

Great article Dom – the best in this series of Leadership comments!
It’s such common sense, but those who look for it when ‘being managed’ tend to overlook it ‘when managing’
And, that’s probably why “B” had this skill – he had no one to manage him!
