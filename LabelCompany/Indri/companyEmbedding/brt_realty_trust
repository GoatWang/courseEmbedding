Company Profile
BRT Apartments Corp. (formerly known as BRT Realty Trust) is a REIT trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: BRT) that is focused on investing directly and through joint ventures acquiring existing multifamily properties, and to a limited extent ground up development of multifamily apartments.
Our multi-family property activities commenced in 2012 and involve our ownership and operation, primarily through joint ventures in which we typically have an 80% equity interest of such properties. Many of our properties are located in the southeast, but we will consider acquisition opportunities throughout the United States.
BRT and affiliates have been successfully serving our clients’ needs for over 35 years.
Prior to 2012 BRT and affiliated entities were in the business of originating and holding for investment short term commercial real estate mortgage loans. We have discontinued this service and are concentrating primarily on multi-family property activities.

Zacks Rank:



 




Style Scores:



NA Value | NA Growth | NA Momentum | NA VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The financial analysis of BRT requires an investor to check the cash flows for BRT Realty Trust.  While its important to look at the BRT Realty Trust debt position, the cash flow statement becomes equally important because public companies use accrual accounting.  For example, if a company sells a product which gets counted as BRT Realty Trust revenue  but does not convert to cash because it does not receive payment in the same quarter, it affects the cash position for that period.  BRT Realty Trust cash flow analysis is possible because this statement breaks down how balance sheet accounts and income statement items affect cash and cash equivalents.  BRT Realty Trust had cash and cash equivalents of $15.55M at the beginning of the quarter and $43.14M at quarter end for 2017-Q2.   The cash from operating activities for BRT Realty Trust is $11.56M for 2017-Q2, which saw an increase of 48.21% from previous quarter.

BRT Realty Trust had a Net Change in Cash and Cash Equivalents of $15.74M for the latest quarter 2017-Q2.  If a firm is able to grow its cash, it is considered to be a positive signal and could lead to a jump in the BRT Realty Trust stock price , albeit too much cash on hand can imply the company has no or limited avenues for growth in which to invest this cash.  BRT Realty Trust increased its cash from operating activities to $3.76M in 2017-Q2.  Operating activities include production of goods or creating a product or providing a service, and collecting payment for the same from customers.  The cash generated from these activities is refered to as cash flow from operating activities.  Growth companies (typically most tech companies) spend heavily  on investing activities and this figure was positive at $62.77M for BRT stock.

BRT Realty Trust earned $29.9M from financing activities,in the form of repayment of loans or interest paid, dividend pay-out to shareholders etc.  .
