Esplanade Capital LLC


                  Esplanade Capital seeks superior long-term capital appreciation. They seek to achieve this by outperforming the S&P 500 Index in up markets, minimizing the permanent loss of capital in down markets and through lower volatility than the S&P 500 Index. Esplanade believes there are a limited number of attractive investment opportunities at any one time. They are risk averse and only invest in businesses they understand. Esplanade invests in stocks that have the potential to double in value over a two to three year timeframe. The firm shorts stocks that they believe are trading in excess of twice their fair value (ideally, where their fair value is zero).Esplanade employs a stock index designed to measure the performance of public companies that cater to the mass affluent. This refers to upper middle-class consumers that are buying goods and services that were traditionally only purchased by the very wealthy. The Esplanade Capital Mass Affluence Stock Index represents 13 mid- to large-cap companies in industries including specialty retail, restaurants, education, homebuilding, food, lodging and recreation.
