STEVEN J. COLLINS - About






























 























Since he was seven years old, Grammy nominated producer/songwriter Steven J. Collins has been a musician and song writer. Beginning with the drums then to the piano, saxophone and even violin. He honed a bevy of his musical skills in church and during his time attending the world renowned Musicians Institute in Hollywood California, where he solidified his skills as a recording engineer and studio tech. 
 
Unknowingly, this early musical foundation was the training ground to later making waves in music, writing and producing for artists and producers such as T-Pain, Gospel legend John P. Kee, Tamar Braxton, Tank, Tamela Mann, Tech n9ne, Kierra Sheard, Krizz Kaliko and more. All in six short years and he’s showing no signs of slowing down.
 
In 2010, Steven was one of three winners of the BlazeTrak & super producer Rodney Jerkins Producers and Songwriters Contest. Steven was one of 3 producers chosen out of 450, worldwide.
 
In 2013, Steven  Co-Produced on a Grammy nominated album for R&B artist Tamar Braxton which led to more opportunities for major music placements. 
 
In 2015 Steven J. Collins gained notoriety in the social media world through his creative and innovative talkbox covers of hits from the past and present! His online following dramatically increased once he caught the attention of super producer Timbaland who has broadcasted Steven as part of his elite band of producers and creatives called Team Timbo. 
 
In January of 2016 Steven was featured as a talkbox artist on the live TV recording of Celebration Of Gospel on BET, with Gospel Pioneer John P. Kee.
 
Steven is excited and  focused on playing a major part in the new standard in content creation and the music and film industry and is looking forward to continuing to bring inspiration to listeners and viewers worldwide.
