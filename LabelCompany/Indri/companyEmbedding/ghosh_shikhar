He was selected by Business Week as one of the best Entrepreneurs in the US, by Forbes as one of the ‘Masters of the Internet Universe’ and by Fortune as the CEO of one of the 10 most innovative companies in the US. Companies he founded were selected as both the ‘hottest’ and ‘coolest’ emerging companies by business publications.
Shikhar joined the Boston Consulting Group after getting his MBA from HBS in 1980. At BCG he focused on organization and innovation in large organizations. He was elected a worldwide partner of the firm in 1987. Shikhar left BCG in 1988 to become CEO of Appex, an early-stage venture backed company that built the inter-carrier infrastructure for the US mobile phone industry. Appex provided centralized services that enabled independent mobile carriers to operate as a single seamless network. Appex’s services included call forwarding across carriers, fraud prevention services, billing and customer service. Appex was bought by EDS in 1990. By the time Shikhar left in 1993, Appex’s revenues exceeded $100 million with an order backlog of over $1 billion. It was selected by Business week as the fastest growing private company in the US.
Shikhar founded Open Market in 1993. Open Market was one of the pioneering companies in the commercialization of the Internet.

Open Market was one of the first Internet companies to go public. It was selected by numerous business publications as one of the companies that helped to make the Internet what it is today.
After leaving Open Market Shikhar has been the founder, CEO or Chairman of several companies in the wireless, payment, Internet marketing, and on-line retailing industries.

Anthology: Pivoting the Business Model
Shikhar Ghosh and Christopher Payton
In July 2014, after 18 months and eight unsuccessful product launches, the CEO of Yabbly has agreed to sell his company to a larger, well-funded startup, providing a return of capital for his investors and a home for his team. Two weeks prior to the scheduled closing, the team launches a final experiment based on the results of a customer interview. After creating a quick landing page and announcing the product launch through social media channels, the company finds significant customer interest. With only two weeks of promising data, the CEO must decide whether or not to abandon the planned sale to pursue the new product, and if so, what terms he should offer new and existing investors to finance the next phase of product development.

Collage.com: Scaling a Distributed Organization
Christopher Stanton and Shikhar Ghosh
Kevin Borders and Joe Golden, co-founders and co-CEOs of Collage.com, must decide how to grow their custom photo-products startup in the face of fierce competition. From 2011 through 2016, the business evolved from a hobby to a startup with $22 million in revenue and 45 employees, all of whom worked remotely from home. Customer acquisition was becoming more difficult and repeat purchase rates lagged behind Shutterfly, the industry leader. New hires would help to integrate new products and grow marketing efforts, but several experienced team members wondered whether virtual collaboration could continue to work with an influx of new people.

Dinr: My First Start-up (A)
Shikhar Ghosh and Kristina Maslauskaite
In May 2012, a young employee at Google's London office, Markus Berger, was thinking whether he should quit his job and go after his dream of becoming an entrepreneur. Berger's idea was to create Dinr, a company that would offer an upscale food ingredient delivery service in London. A customer would choose a recipe on Dinr's website and would receive all premeasured ingredients the same evening at their doorstep. Contrary to many existing similar companies, Dinr would not require a weekly subscription, but would operate one-off orders like other traditional food delivery services. Berger had already carried out an alpha test of the service and completed an in-depth survey of potential customers to explore the market. Most of the feedback was positive, which confirmed Berger's intuition about this market opportunity. Berger had found a more experienced co-founder with technical expertise who was willing to join Dinr part time and gathered £40,000 of initial capital. Yet, making the decision to leave his corporate job and become an entrepreneur was not easy: Was Dinr a good business opportunity? Would it be attractive to outside investors? What were the risks involved?

Intuit: Turbo Tax PersonalPro - A Tale of Two Entrepreneurs
Shikhar Ghosh, Joseph Fuller and Michael Roberts
The case tells the story of a product manager within Intuit who develops an idea for a new product that spans two of the company's existing business units—professional tax software, sold to accountants, and the consumer focused TurboTax product. The new product —TurboTax Personal Pro—connects consumers with professional accountants online, allowing them to have their taxes prepared by a professional. The cycle of product development transpires within the larger, corporate context of Intuit, where founder Scott Cook has been attempting to transform the enterprise into a leaner, more innovative company. The case describes in detail the lean startup methods used by the new product team, and how their attempts bump up against the existing, entrenched systems and processes of the larger enterprise.

Yabbly (A)
Shikhar Ghosh and Christopher Payton
In November 2013, with less than 10 months of cash on hand, Tom Leung, the founder and CEO of Yabbly, must decide where to focus his resources. His startup, a question-and-answer application for shopping decisions, had benefited from a strong showing at the SXSW Accelerator competition and had a dedicated and engaged user base. However, Leung knew that the current growth trajectory would not lead them to the milestones needed to receive an additional round of financing. Leung must decide whether to continue pursuing user acquisition experiments, explore other product ideas, or begin searching for a potential acquirer to achieve a "soft landing" for his team and his investors.

Yesware (A)
Shikhar Ghosh, Christopher Payton and Ali Huberlie
Matthew Bellows founded Yesware, a Boston-based tech startup, to solve a problem that he'd encountered as a sales manager: sales people hate entering data, rarely do it accurately, and almost always input data that can't be synthesized in a way that is useful for the manager. Together with a friend, he developed software to solve this problem—while also working towards the goal of founding a company that would be "the best place to work." But as the company grows past $5 million in annual revenue, Bellows faces challenges balancing the dual goals of continuing to scale the company and adhering to the values established for the company.

Venture Capital Investment in the Clean Energy Sector
Ramana Nanda and Shikhar Ghosh
In this note, we examine the extent to which venture capital is adequately positioned for the rapid commercialization of clean energy technologies in the United States. The need for a revolution in clean energy is driven not just by environmental consequences of energy use, but also by the need for energy security, to address growing concerns about a crisis in the balance of payments, and as a potentially important source of domestic jobs. Our premise in this note is that a key aspect of such widespread change is that these issues cannot be "solved" by a single technology. Rather, technological changes will have to be pervasive and will require a whole range of different products and processes to come to market. Some of the technological progress will come from incremental innovations that do not depend on venture capital.

Maricopa, Inc.: Finding the Right Treatment for Growth
William A. Sahlman, Thomas R. Eisenmann, Joseph B. Fuller and Shikhar Ghosh
The founders of Maricopa, Inc., a startup that sold proprietary hair-care products directly to salons, were preparing a board presentation to address the young company's inability to meet financial projections. While the products had caught on with customers, the financial shortcomings raised some questions about the company's business plan. The company had gone through much of its cash and needed additional funding to continue operating.At the same time, two VC investors were deciding how to proceed with their investments in Maricopa. The larger VC firm questioned Maricopa's management's decisions and was hesitant to further fund the company. However the Maricopa investment was much more important to the smaller VC firm, and its representative on Maricopa's board worked hard to convince her counterpart from the larger firm that while the firm had struggled, it was a young startup with strong potential. Without the larger firm investing again in Maricopa, the business was at risk of going under.

Steven Carpenter at Cake Financial (Abridged)
Thomas R. Eisenmann, Joseph B. Fuller and Shikhar Ghosh
Steven Carpenter reflects on the successes and failures of his recent venture, Cake Financial. Carpenter had just sold the four-year-old startup and was at work on a new business plan. But first, he wanted to understand why Cake Financial, a service that allowed users to access their brokerage accounts on one platform and also see how other users were investing, had not been widely adopted by customers despite positive receptions from technology and financial observers. The startup had also received financial support from prominent angel investors. Carpenter asked himself what he should have done differently with the technology supporting the platform, and how Cake should have better targeted customers and responded to their unique needs. He also wondered whether he had made the right decisions about when, and from whom, to seek funding at various stages of the company's growth.

Myomo: Getting Sales in Motion
Frank V. Cespedes, Shikhar Ghosh and Matthew Preble
In late 2012, the management team of Myomo, a startup which had designed a unique myoelectric arm brace for patients with dysfunctional arms, was deciding which of the three sales models the company had tested to pursue as its sales strategy going forward. Each model had its own unique merits and risks. The team planned to fully examine each strategy to determine how to best get the brace into the hands of those who needed it most, the patients, and identify which one enabled Myomo to grow.

It also provides social networking across sports fans. The company is growing, and its founders face the questions of where to locate their headquarters and how to structure their company, and the legal issues surrounding these decisions, including intellectual property regulations, tax laws, and ownership structure. This case provides an example of a company that, due to the nature of its product, has had to operate globally from its earliest days and establish itself in many locations simultaneously.

Skyhook Wireless
Shikhar Ghosh and Thomas R. Eisenmann
Ted Morgan, the founder of Skyhook Wireless just received a call from Steve Jobs of Apple asking for a meeting. Ted must decide how to prepare for a meeting that could finally give Skyhook an anchor customer. Ted and his team have worked for three years to build a new approach to location based services that uses WiFi rather than the well-established satellite based GPS technology. Skyhook's approach is more accurate than GPS in urban areas and, unlike GPS, it works indoors. Yet, large device manufacturers are reluctant to be the first ones to use it. Skyhook has no customers. The board and investors are getting restless. Should Ted offer Steve Jobs a free license, or pay him for Apple's user base—or should he insist on a substantial license fee? The case examines the challenges faced by entrepreneurs in creating a technology-based company and in getting market traction against an established standard.
Keywords: Wireless Technology; 
				  Information Technology; 
				  Business Ventures; 
				  Business Startups; 
				  Technology Industry;

Early life[edit]
Shikhar received his undergraduate degree from the University of Bombay. Subsequently, he received his MBA from the Harvard Business School in 1980.[3]
Career[edit]
Shikhar joined the Boston Consulting Group in 1980 after completing his MBA. At BCG he focused on organization and innovation in large organization. He was elected a worldwide partner of the firm in 1987. Shikhar left BCG in 1988 to become CEO of Appex, an early-stage venture backed company that built the inter-carrier infrastructure for the US mobile phone industry. Appex provided centralized services that enabled independent mobile carriers to operate as a single seamless network. Appex’s services included call forwarding across carriers, fraud prevention services, billing and customer service. Appex was bought by EDS in 1990. By the time Shikhar left in 1993, Appex’s revenues exceeded $100m with an order backlog of over $1 billion. It was selected by BusinessWeek as the fastest-growing private company in the US.
Shikhar founded Open Market in 1993. Open Market was one of the pioneering companies in the commercialization of the Internet. It built the first commercial infrastructure for enabling secure commerce on the Internet and provided the software and services that enabled companies like Time Warner and AT&T to offer their services on the Internet. Open Market was one of the first internet companies to go public. It was selected by numerous business publications as one of the companies that helped to make the Internet what it is today.
After leaving Open Market Shikhar has been the founder, CEO or Chairman of several companies in the wireless, payment, Internet marketing and online retailing industries. He has worked in all facets of the entrepreneurial process – starting companies with technical teams, providing and raising capital with venture capitalists, buying and selling companies, or taking them public and closing down unsuccessful companies. His ideas and interviews have multiple media. He has been a keynote speaker in numerous conferences on innovation, entrepreneurship, digital media and on the future of the Internet.

Shikhar joined the Boston Consulting Group in 1980 after completing his MBA. At BCG he focused on organization and innovation in large organization. He was elected a worldwide partner of the firm in 1987. Shikhar left BCG in 1988 to become CEO of Appex, an early-stage venture backed company that built the inter-carrier infrastructure for the US mobile phone industry. Appex provided centralized services that enabled independent mobile carriers to operate as a single seamless network. Appex’s services included call forwarding across carriers, fraud prevention services, billing and customer service. Appex was bought by EDS in 1990. By the time Shikhar left in 1993, Appex’s revenues exceeded $100m with an order backlog of over $1 billion. It was selected by BusinessWeek as the fastest-growing private company in the US.
Shikhar founded Open Market in 1993. Open Market was one of the pioneering companies in the commercialization of the Internet. It built the first commercial infrastructure for enabling secure commerce on the Internet and provided the software and services that enabled companies like Time Warner and AT&T to offer their services on the Internet. Open Market was one of the first internet companies to go public. It was selected by numerous business publications as one of the companies that helped to make the Internet what it is today.
After leaving Open Market Shikhar has been the founder, CEO or Chairman of several companies in the wireless, payment, Internet marketing and online retailing industries. He has worked in all facets of the entrepreneurial process – starting companies with technical teams, providing and raising capital with venture capitalists, buying and selling companies, or taking them public and closing down unsuccessful companies. His ideas and interviews have multiple media. He has been a keynote speaker in numerous conferences on innovation, entrepreneurship, digital media and on the future of the Internet.

Why Companies Fail—and How Their Founders Can Bounce Back
 

 Leading a doomed company can often help a career by providing experience, insight, and contacts that lead to new opportunities, says professor Shikhar Ghosh. 
 
by Carmen Nobel
Most companies fail.  It's an unsettling fact for bright-eyed entrepreneurs, but old news to start-up veterans.
But here's the good news: Experienced entrepreneurs know that running a company that eventually fails can actually help a career, but only if the executives are willing to view failure as a potential for improvement.
The statistics are disheartening no matter how an entrepreneur defines failure.  If failure means liquidating all assets, with investors losing most or all the money they put into the company, then the failure rate for start-ups is 30 to 40 percent, according to Shikhar Ghosh, a senior lecturer at Harvard Business School who has held top executive positions at some eight technology-based start-ups.   If failure refers to failing to see the projected return on investment, then the failure rate is 70 to 80 percent.  And if failure is defined as declaring a projection and then falling short of meeting it, then the failure rate is a whopping 90 to 95 percent.  
"Very few companies achieve their initial projections," says Ghosh.  "Failure is the norm."
Why Start-ups Fail
Start-ups often fail because founders and investors neglect to look before they leap, surging forward with plans without taking the time to realize that the base assumption of the business plan is wrong.  They believe they can predict the future, rather than try to create a future with their customers. Entrepreneurs tend to be single-minded with their strategies—wanting the venture to be all about the technology or all about the sales, without taking time to form a balanced plan. 
“In Silicon Valley, the fact that your enterprise has failed is actually a badge of honor.”
And all too often, they do not give themselves wiggle room to pivot midstream if the initial idea doesn't jibe with customer demand.
"Instead of going into the venture with a broad hypothesis, they commit in ways that don't allow them to change," Ghosh says. He cites as an example the failed dot-com-era grocer Webvan, which bought warehouses all over the United States before realizing that there was not enough customer demand for its grocery delivery service.
Next, there's the matter of timing, a huge issue that can determine whether a company gets funding and whether it achieves the start-up's elusive measure of success: an exit that involves going public or getting bought. 
During the Internet boom, companies armed with nothing more than a PowerPoint presentation of a lousy idea could secure tens of millions of dollars—which sometimes gave them enough time to figure out a viable business plan through trial and error. Eventually successful companies such as Netscape and Open Market went through several business models before finding one that worked.  But the opposite was true after the boom; a company could have a great idea and a great team, but still fail to achieve traction due to lack of funding and, consequently, lack of time to let a good model mature.  (These days, Ghosh says, if start-ups often manage to secure a good team and good financing, they face dozens of lower-cost competitors and fragmented customer demand.)
Funding has the potential to turn a little failure into an enormous one. 
"The predominant cause of big failures versus small failures is too much funding," Ghosh says. "What funding does is cover up all the problems that a company has. It covers up all the mistakes, it enables the company and management to focus on things that aren't important to the company's success and ignore the things that are important.  This lets management rationalize away the proverbial problem of the dogs not eating the dog food. When you don't have money you reformulate the dog food so that the dogs will eat it.  When you have a lot of money you can afford to argue that the dogs should like the dog food because it is nutritious." 
Enterprise Failure Can Be An Asset, But Personal Failure Is Ruinous
Still, stubborn entrepreneurs continue to found companies, in spite of the failure rates, which raises the question of why.  It's not as if any of them harbored childhood dreams of launching a search engine optimization software firm.  
Sometimes this is due to naïveté and hubris—the notion that their idea simply cannot fail.  But savvy entrepreneurs know that running a company that eventually fails can actually help a career.  Even failed businesses yield future networking opportunities with venture capitalists and relationships with other entrepreneurs whose companies are succeeding. Ghosh says boards of successful companies often seek out the founders and CEOs of failed companies because they value experience over a clean slate.  After all, Henry Ford, Steve Jobs, and Desh Deshpande experienced multiple failures before achieving success. 
“In a start-up, if a company is doing well, and a founder gets greedy and takes more than his fair share, people sort of forgive him. But when a company is going down, when you protect your own interest it's always at the cost of someone else.  People don't forgive that.”
"How many search engines are out there that really matter now?" Ghosh says.  "Just a handful!  And yet the people who created all the other ones in the 1990s are not living under a bridge somewhere. Many of them now run the big ones. In Silicon Valley, the fact that your enterprise has failed can  actually be a badge of honor."
Individual failures within a company can be an asset, too, in that they can prevent the whole system from failing—but only if the executives are willing to view failure as a potential for improvement.  For instance, if the company's best salesperson is unable to sign a key customer, then the management is likely to chastise the salesperson for failing.  But they could also realize that if the top talent has trouble with the sell, then maybe there is something wrong with the product.  Small failures can provide the raw material for improvement. 
"The more that you can embrace all the little failures you have, and treat them as ways of improving the system, the less likely that the entire system will collapse," Ghosh counsels.
That said, Ghosh warns entrepreneurs that failure of an enterprise, product, or initiative and the personal failure of an individual executive are two very different things. While the former is a learning experience that can lead to future opportunities, the latter can damn a career. 
A personal failure, as Ghosh defines it, is one in which an individual does something that violates a fiduciary duty, commits a crime, or acts in a way that goes against the normal tenets of morality and fair play. Ghosh cites as example a CEO who fires a bunch of employees in order to pay for his own severance package.  In such cases, a manager's reputation will be tarnished to the point of rendering him or her un-hirable even if the venture was a financial success.
 "In a start-up, if a company is doing well and a founder gets greedy and takes more than his fair share, people sort of forgive him," Ghosh says. "But when a company is going down and  you protect your own interests it's always at the cost of someone else.  People don't forgive that."
Ironically, a personal failure often occurs because an entrepreneur is trying too hard to avoid an enterprise failure.  Trying to keep the venture capitalists happy and bankruptcy at bay, the founder or CEO will resort to illegal acts such as fraud, or to morally problematic acts such as blatant misrepresentation of the company's capabilities or prospects when talking to customers or financiers.  "And when you do that, you're then on the slippery slope of taking an enterprise failure and making it a personal failure," Ghosh says.  "Executives do that all the time because they do not distinguish between the two."
Revising Expectations
Ghosh notes that venture capitalists could help mitigate personal failures by allowing for the expectation of company growing pains.  He points out that a baseball player with a .350 average is considered to be a success, even though he has a .650 failure rate.   But in entrepreneurial management, there's a tendency to see things in black and white, rather than looking at the whole picture.  And while VCs are likely to recruit an executive with experience at a failed company, they are less patient with individual failures.  VCs rarely consider their role in establishing unrealistic expectations or an environment where the ends are more important than the means, he says.
"In any natural system, failure is the engine that causes growth, that causes new birth, that causes anything to happen," he says. "One of the truly big differences between growing economies and economies that stagnate is the acceptance of failure. If you don't let forests burn, if you don't let the old trees die out and the new trees grow, you don't get a healthy forest.  The ability to manage failure so that enterprises fail but people can still succeed becomes one of the tricks of how you build a society that can reinvent itself as the world changes.

I have experienced business/project failures not from a lack of technology but because of it.  Far too often, the technology far exceeds the ability of a "human organization" to implement/accept/adopt it and/or a fundamental lack of understanding on the behalf of the technologist about the "true business problem".  These failures are "solutions in search of a problem".   

Your article explicitly involves "start ups", but if they survive this phase, then their "business development staff" hits the seminar circuit, golf courses and bars across the country in search of "problems".  

Because the new technology is sold with excessive hype (Mastering the Hype Cycle by Harvard Business Press 2008) and since the unsuspecting business process owner does not appreciate the technology paradigm shift and his new management responsibilities, the project become another "near miss" that ends up as "shelf ware". 

I don't think my "good intentions" and subsequent failure reinforce anyone's idea of a good Karma.   We need to do our homework before we attempt to "help" the business.  Today, we have enough technology to solve most business problems.  Let's figure what the problem is before we start coding.

I appreciate the discussion of the necessity of failure.  As mentioned above, failure allows companies (and people) to adjust to reality or changing circumstances.

The issue not addressed, though lurking around the corner, is when government interferes and organizations aren't allowed to fail.  This creates a moral hazard, as the penalty/remedy, failure, isn't allowed to happen.

Without failure, life's most important lessons are never learned.

Nobody likes to fail because of pride, but the lessons are priceless!

Just a few thoughts on why failures occur however we should also recognise that some 60-70 % succeed based on Ghosh's commentary(interesting that we give primacy to the failures.....)

Anchoring biases and other forms of cognitive bias-when looked at from a starting position make interesting reading-what did the investors and the proponents believe in the face of alternative views and facts?

The getting caught mid-stream and failure to adapt and overcome-is this a function of blind faith,absence of a suitable mentoring model or independent review and challenge of the real state of play or  an absence of metrics and indicators that reflect the truth rather than something convenient-or something else?

Maybe the false positives,successful failures are an important source of IP for us all-and we should value the downside events more  on the basis of learning and appreciating just how fragile business can be,when the concept seems so sound to start with?

Great analysis . People or organization that accepts failure have growth mindset . The study done by Carol S. Dweck on fixed mindset and growth mindset shows that to achieve really great success , individuals need to have growth mindset . 

Similarly an organization , whose decision makers have this growth mindset in majority tend to be a growth organization . Therefore the element of team 's mindset can be very important determinant of success .






AL HOLMES

Very interesting. For organizations at the peak of performance, Adizes tells us that 'success often breeds failure' due to complacency, inward focus, resting on laurels, arrogance, etc.
This article tells us that at the beginning of the lifecycle, failure often breeds success if founders can learn from the experience, overcome the founder's trap the next time around and perhaps learn to park their egos at the door, take advice from others and share the leadership.

Thank you. I will definitely read further.

An interesting addition to this article would be the way different cultures view failures on the business front.

In the USA, a failed venture means you tried. 

In China, a failed venture means you lost face, and possibly blemished your family's name.

In India, a failed venture means something in between.

To me the article seems too one-sided, putting all the blame of the failures on the founders. VCs who fund these 90% failed ventures, surely, cannot escape the blame (at least in some measure) for the failures.

The figures are staggering in their impact - "90% of the ventures fail" - but the author has not apportioned any blame to the  hard-nosed VCs . Clearly,the flip side of the 90% failure is that 90% of ventures funded by the VCs are not screened appropriately, risks are not assessed and managed well enough, contracts are not structured properly for the timely  intervention and rescue of the floundering ventures and the legendary VC Value-add is just not good enough to help the founders in times of crisis.To me this article seems more like an indictment of the GPs than that of the founders. 

My experience is that the entrepreneurs who get funded , thus having prolonged interaction with the more savvy VCs, 
experience great learning about various aspects of managing their businesses and the innate challenges of moving the ventures through various stages of growth. Even if their venture bombs, at a personal level the founders seem to gain a lot in terms of entrepreneurial wisdom and self-awareness, which have the potential to become the  cornerstones of their future success.

As a founder of a well-funded dot.com (failed - went bust in the 2000 crash) and then a bootstrapped software company (success - exited to a major PE firm) I wholeheartedly agree with many of the points in this article, especially those about funding often hiding underlying problems, entrepreneurs failing to adapt their plan to real conditions, and timing. 

Between my failed and successful start-ups, I had the good fortune to read Amar Bhide's 'Bootstrap Finance: The Art of Start-Ups' in HBR. It also highlights the many hidden risks of venture capital and postulates that because bootstrapped firms avoid VC-related risks, they have a higher success rate than VC-funded firms. 

At the well-funded dot.com, we effectively hid behind the cash and were not close enough to our market. We were also unwilling to change our plan in light of the declarations we'd made to funders to get their cash in the first place. At the bootstrapped software company, we got out into the market early (because we had to) and often changed course to cope with changing conditions. 

There's a mythology going on in the business press fueled by the glitz and glamour of a few VC-backed outliers. The reality, in my humble opinion, is that bootstrapping remains a much more viable start-up route for the majority.

From my personal experience I can share at least couple of reasons why companies fail. The first one is when companies in a new business environment (e.g. a new country or in a new competitive scenario) fails to identify / recognize the business risk and can't put any risk mitigation technique in place, which decimates the company.

Second reason is more relevant in a joint venture scenario, where there is a huge gap in vision between the 2 partners. Such gap turns out to be impossible to bridge and leads to automatic failure of the JV.

No company is set up without aiming at success. The promoters shell out money with a total belief that the projected results shall be achieved.
The data provided by Shikhar reflects a worrisome state in US which seems to be in focus. The failures could be the result of weak planning without considering  all pros and cons. If so, we have ourselves planned for failure and other factors cannot be blamed.
At times, despite a good start, companies go into difficulties because of factors beyond control. Government policies to restrict/ban the product(s) come as  sudden shocks for new companies have never thought of such eventualities. Further, they lack capability of diversifying to acceptable activities in the short run.This leads to a chaos and companies suffer badly.
Corruption due to greed attempted to be met by adoption of wrong practices also leads to failures but generally this does not occur in the early life of a company.
Yes, the management and the technology also contribute if proper and optimum advantage is not derived therefrom.

I would argue that Government or other institutional interventions are not to prevent or stop the "benefits" of failures but to enable potentially failing organizations to renew themselves. If failure is not due to personal leadership poverty (unethical practices, immorality, greed, selfishness etc) then government or institutional support can actually aid learning or benefitting from potential failures. 

The Bible teaches us that "a righteous man may fall seven times and rise again, but the wicked shall fall by calamity" Proverbs 24: 16. 

Overall, I would argue that societies should not support unrighteous leaders. They should be allowed to fail and die. However, supporting righteous "entrepreneurial experiments" can enable societies to thrive. I would also argue that societies need improved education for entrepreneurs so as to minimize organziational failures.

And then you have the hidden failure: the company where the CEO has no industrial vision apart from seeing the company being sold so the investors can recoup their investment. The CEO then finds a position on a company's board or with a VC and has a good life. For the rest of the employees who had been waiting for the shareholders to fire the CEO long ago it is a major failure: many will lose their job as a result of the company being sold. The company as an industrial project will have been a failure because the shareholders had no drive to make it a success by replacing the mostly incompetent CEO.

Very interesting article.  Having been part of a failed start-up (bad timing and a far too-rapid expansion) and a successful one (customer-centric marketing, selling, product development, and support).

The key difference?  A disciplined management team that was able to (1) work together and (2) operate within tight financial parameters.  As is mentioned, "funding has the potential to turn a little failure into an enormous one."

In the latter venture, because our growth was enabled by success (as defined by the market, not an investor) we did not fall prey to the maxim:  "The predominant cause of big failures versus small failures is too much funding".

Good article. Interestingly, there are few start-ups which failed prematured because the founders lived in false dreams after founding the firm - having passive supervision, relying too much on employees, due to not getting the devils in the details of business and due not able to emerge as a leader when the situation called for the leadership role.

I found it interesting that your article did not consider the impact of management control by the members of the boards of directors of the companies/examples discussed. 

I chose continued involvement with the venture community because I initially felt that the VCs had seen more companies fail than I ever would and could/would thus help me avoid the pitfalls leading to failure. I have since come to believe that more companies fail and excess funding is required because of VC board management. This is the industry that is supposed to be the expert in selecting the best potential new companies. They choose one in a hundred to invest in and seven out of ten of those fail - usually after large infusions of cash. The VCs would like to tell you that this occurs because of the high risk involved in their business. I would suggest that the primary thing these failures have in common is a board of directors composed entirely of VC investors - many of whom have little or no operating experience and all of whom have their own agenda regarding liquidation rather that growth.

What is broken is the leadership model. Business success comes from individual management innovation not BOD dictation of management strategy and action during their once a month visit to the company.

I am a bit put off by the "discovery" that businesses fail, particularly in Silicon Valley. This is bit like being surpirsed that politicians do not always tell the truth.

A well know venture capitalist once told me that he expected to hit a home on one or two investments out of ten. Break even on three and lose money on the rest. In other words, failure is built into the very business model of venture capital firms.

However, Mr. Ghosh hits on another point that every business school should hammer home to their students. Taking risks includes accepting the risk of failure. Here, it is not whether one fails because most of us do at some point or another. Instead it is how one fails. Skipping out on colleagues when things look grim is the most common failing among super-charged exectutives. Lying about the true condition of a business is another. Acknowledging that things could go sour quickly and staying to make sure colleagues and investors get the most out of the experience is the toughest thing to do in a fialing business. I have witnessed it on a few occessions and witnessed less stellar behavior on many more. Failure is no excuse to chuck ethics out the window.

An excellent and a very important topic indeed.  

The failure of any venture starts with the (a) very projections (assumed and not viable) in the business plan, (b) The cash flow comfort through funding doesn't goad them to work diligently on the plan (c) In-discretionary deployment of team (d)  Functional style of management and many other factors as others have commented above.

it is better to have tried and failed, rather than not to have tried at all. people may have fear of failure after one unsuccessful venture, which keeps them from becoming overreliant on anything except themselves.this begining of taking responsibility, is a turning point for success in later undertakings.

My wife has tried many business ventures failing: some of the reasons being lack of appropriate vision and strategy, overdependence on my salary to subsidise the activities, failing to persevere when conditions change for the worse, operational mistakes especially in stocking, using wrong assistants, and at times long absense of the owner may lead to loss of customers in service sector.






Susan Rushworth
Lecturer, Swinburne University of Technology, Australia

I don't think there are many surprises in the content of this article, but business failure and the impact it has on founders and other stakeholders is not discussed enough and the comments on this article alone make it worth following.

I'd like to pick up on the thread of 'personal failure'. The author suggests that personal failure only occurs if the founder has acted unethically. While I don't disagree with this, I think it is a subtle point that is often lost of the rest of the stakeholders, society in general and - very often - the founder him/herself. For example, see Dean Shepherd's work which highlights that learning from failure is not automatic and is certainly not immediate. He argues that it is mediated by the level of emotion (grief) induced by the failure.

It is all very well to say that an honest failure is not really a failure, but if the founder and the society in which he or she operates doesn't see it that way, then the impact may be just as bad as a dishonest failure.

A leader who is assured of their own personal integrity is likely to navigate these trials better than someone who depends on the approval of others - but let's be honest, how common is that level of self-knowledge and certainty of personal integrity?

Good discussion - thanks for airing this important topic.

It's strange the number of failed businesses we are seeing in China & India. Although, many come to HBS to study, "with the best", we are seeing few practical applications taken back home, that are proving to be successful in those countries. Strange this is seldom mentioned, stranger yet, these countries are not leading the world, what with so many HBS grads. I mean, let's look at the so called, "booming economies", aka "BRIC" nations. 1) They all lack infrastructure, that is a fact not an opinion. 2) The majority of investment is foreign, also a fact. 3) Nobody is planning 10 years ahead. Short, medium and long term goals for a company are gospel.

 Look at the German automobile companies in China. Once
everyone in China has a car, Shanghai will be another Detroit. When hyper-inflation hits, the first containment issue is cutting out luxury goods, e.g., Mercedes, BMW, Audi, among other luxury brands. This is a failure in the making that is largely unaddressed up to this point.


 Summary: location is half of the battle, the other half is direct involvement in every single process of the company from the top, down. You always lead from the top, and demand accountability for all things both good and evil, that take place within. Risk Assessment matrix in hand, you always need to plan a "containment strategy", thereby limiting the number of things that can contribute to a failure, also helping you to avoid one from ever taking place. Always plan for bad weather.

During the moment of crisis one is expected to perform with limited resources and at the same time many commitment fails as a result stake holder gets frustrated,compounding problem for the enterprise. However to combat the said situation more than the policy of the organisation individual forte plays an important role i.e. integrity and discipline because it not only delineates confidence among the coworkers but also among the stake holders.






Ron Seide

I strikes me that the article and the comments seem to presuppose that start-ups are inherently VC funded. They're not, of course, a good portion of them even in the tech sector are bootstrapped. In those scenarios, failure is anything but a badge of honor, it's a loss of one's savings, one's home, the savings of others, etc. 

This all seems a bit antiseptic, that failure is a virtue, losing the investment of others is somehow a success. It's not, failure is failure and a belief otherwise breeds a mentality where the prices of homes in Florida never decrease, tulip bulbs are worth a thousand gilders a piece and dog food is sold over the internet is a viable business model.

The ideas in this article relating to developing our perception of human experience are interesting.  A  combination of learning from experience, our own and others and model construction and  testing  is shown to have value as a learning opportunity.

Some of the points raised in the article such as no proper business model and lack of funding are universal phenomena. But my observation is that one of the major reasons why businesses fail is that the entrepreneur himself should not be in business in the first place because he does not have the characteristics of a successful entrepreneur.






Suvendu Kr. Pratihari

I rather appreciate this as an human failure rather an Business failure, because ultimately human leads the business. My own experience in building a software company, where I have established at a point where I can foresee the whole business lying on failure only. 

It has now became an old saying. "We learn out of our failure". rather I must say, "We fail how to learn from the failure", which is quite significant with the logic of my saying that "Human fails, rather Business fails".

Thanks Mr. Ghosh for such dynamics.

All things fail ultimately. It's just the reality of a changing and evolving universe. Everything that comes into being - whatever Man or nature creates - eventually passes out of existence. Most of the species that lived on this planet are now extinct; most of the things we've made - our creations and artefacts - are obsolete, decayed, trashed or buried. Most of the organizations and groups we've gathered or assembled - social, commercial, political etc. - have passed into history.

But failure is a highly formative and powerful learning experience. We can learn more through our failures than through our successes. Every successful individual should be proud of their failures. Success is just a kind of deferred failure. Come on, let's celebrate our glorious failures!






Mathews Daniel Kapito
Director, Centre for Corporate Management and Finance

As an entrepreneur, I believe that the article is a revolution for may existing and up coming entrepreneurs. Where I come from, I never knew the need for or the procedure for preparing a business plan. I rolled out in to many forms of business each failed, from each failure I Learned something and every lesson is different. 
If one is a manager and they have never failed, they fail big time and must take a break to have a fresh start. Without failing we are nothing. Failing opens our minds and understanding and build new skills in a manager.
In my studies, I have learned that great men, Leaders and Managers faile many times. Think of Henry Ford, Thomas Edson, BIll Gates, just to mention a few.
Many people settle for mediocrity, once they make a dollar, they are happy and change their lifestyle. A true entrepreneur move step by step, no rush, no speed. Just one step at a time, mostly take regular review breaks (identify mistakes and failures to improve)
A great manager is someone who make and is willing to make mistakes, most of all take total responsibility for their mistakes.
I'm eager to make mistakes, fail and start up again.

Great topic. Good for building a positive attitude in this dynamic global environment






Dr. Sean Patrick Sassmannshausen
Lectrurer and Managing Director, Schumpeter School of Business and Economics, University of Wuppertal, Germany

At Schumpeter School of Business and Economics (University of Wuppertal, Germany) our research scholar Stefan Gladbach conducts research on "new venture abortion". Stopping the process of starting a venture is emotionally a very hard decision for entrepreneurs. But often such a decision could protect the founder and the venture's stakeholders from increased sunken costs. However, is new venture abortion just a certain form of failure or is it a neutral-successful form of exiting a venture? And how could new venture abortion been done "successfully"? In teaching entrepreneurship, we are so obsessed with reshaping defaulted projects that we hardly ever assessed when to better give advice to abort. Early abortion (previous to official new company registration) might also reduce high statistical new venture failure rates. 

As soon as we know more on "new venture abortion" from our research, we need to develop case studies and include chapters in text books, so that business schools will be enabled to teach how to abort a start-up successfully (i.e. with no or limited sunken costs). Learning how to fail/abort might then encourage "wannabe" entrepreneurs who are yet not willing to take the risks of new venture creation. It might also reduce the negative economic impact of new ventures which have gone wrong.

Given that 90-95% of startups fail, there are certainly lots of ways failure can happen... Most ways were not mentioned here, but this is a short blog that's well done.

The lean startup movement, and Steve Blank's work around customer development, have been very useful in helping founders build products that customers are interested in using/buying.  That increases startups' success likelihood. 

But I believe we can further enhance the likelihood of success by helping founders and investors understand and gain assess to the "mysterious" psychological factors, including team dynamics and important leadership factors, that are true differentiators of success and failure. 

I'd love to hear what readers believe are the top psychological reasons for startup failure (e.g., ego, over confidence, low conscientiousness, etc.)

Thanks for the article.  Failure is a hard thing - but hopefully it provides opportunity for growth.

Abstract
The case tells the story of a product manager within Intuit who develops an idea for a new product that spans two of the company's existing business units—professional tax software, sold to accountants, and the consumer focused TurboTax product. The new product —TurboTax Personal Pro—connects consumers with professional accountants online, allowing them to have their taxes prepared by a professional. The cycle of product development transpires within the larger, corporate context of Intuit, where founder Scott Cook has been attempting to transform the enterprise into a leaner, more innovative company. The case describes in detail the lean startup methods used by the new product team, and how their attempts bump up against the existing, entrenched systems and processes of the larger enterprise.

Skyhook Wireless
Shikhar Ghosh and Thomas R. Eisenmann
Ted Morgan, the founder of Skyhook Wireless just received a call from Steve Jobs of Apple asking for a meeting. Ted must decide how to prepare for a meeting that could finally give Skyhook an anchor customer. Ted and his team have worked for three years to build a new approach to location based services that uses WiFi rather than the well-established satellite based GPS technology. Skyhook's approach is more accurate than GPS in urban areas and, unlike GPS, it works indoors. Yet, large device manufacturers are reluctant to be the first ones to use it. Skyhook has no customers. The board and investors are getting restless. Should Ted offer Steve Jobs a free license, or pay him for Apple's user base—or should he insist on a substantial license fee? The case examines the challenges faced by entrepreneurs in creating a technology-based company and in getting market traction against an established standard.

                Harvard Business School


            In this note, we examine the extent to which venture capital is adequately positioned for the rapid commercialization of clean energy technologies in the United States. The need for a revolution in clean energy is driven not just by environmental consequences of energy use, but also by the need for energy security, to address growing concerns about a crisis in the balance of payments, and as a potentially important source of domestic jobs. Our premise in this note is that a key aspect of such widespread change is that these issues cannot be solved by a single technology. Rather, technological changes will have to be pervasive and will require a whole range of different products and processes to come to market. Some of the technological progress will come from incremental innovations that do not depend on venture capital.

Early life[edit]
Shikhar received his undergraduate degree from the University of Bombay. Subsequently, he received his MBA from the Harvard Business School in 1980.[3]
Career[edit]
Shikhar joined the Boston Consulting Group in 1980 after completing his MBA. At BCG he focused on organization and innovation in large organization. He was elected a worldwide partner of the firm in 1987. Shikhar left BCG in 1988 to become CEO of Appex, an early-stage venture backed company that built the inter-carrier infrastructure for the US mobile phone industry. Appex provided centralized services that enabled independent mobile carriers to operate as a single seamless network. Appex’s services included call forwarding across carriers, fraud prevention services, billing and customer service. Appex was bought by EDS in 1990. By the time Shikhar left in 1993, Appex’s revenues exceeded $100m with an order backlog of over $1 billion. It was selected by BusinessWeek as the fastest-growing private company in the US.
Shikhar founded Open Market in 1993. Open Market was one of the pioneering companies in the commercialization of the Internet. It built the first commercial infrastructure for enabling secure commerce on the Internet and provided the software and services that enabled companies like Time Warner and AT&T to offer their services on the Internet. Open Market was one of the first internet companies to go public. It was selected by numerous business publications as one of the companies that helped to make the Internet what it is today.
After leaving Open Market Shikhar has been the founder, CEO or Chairman of several companies in the wireless, payment, Internet marketing and online retailing industries. He has worked in all facets of the entrepreneurial process – starting companies with technical teams, providing and raising capital with venture capitalists, buying and selling companies, or taking them public and closing down unsuccessful companies. His ideas and interviews have multiple media. He has been a keynote speaker in numerous conferences on innovation, entrepreneurship, digital media and on the future of the Internet.

Shikhar has been a successful entrepreneur for the last 20 years. He has been the founder and CEO or Chairman of eight technology-based entrepreneurial companies and was the past Chairman of the Massachusetts Technology Leadership Council and The Indus Entrepreneurs - two leading entrepreneurial organizations. He was selected by BusinessWeek as one of the best Entrepreneurs in the US,[1] Forbes as one of the ‘Masters of the Internet Universe’ and Fortune as the CEO of one of the 10 most innovative companies in the US.

Early life[edit]
Shikhar received his undergraduate degree from the University of Bombay. Subsequently, he received his MBA from the Harvard Business School in 1980.[3]
Career[edit]
Shikhar joined the Boston Consulting Group in 1980 after completing his MBA. At BCG he focused on organization and innovation in large organization. He was elected a worldwide partner of the firm in 1987. Shikhar left BCG in 1988 to become CEO of Appex, an early-stage venture backed company that built the inter-carrier infrastructure for the US mobile phone industry. Appex provided centralized services that enabled independent mobile carriers to operate as a single seamless network. Appex’s services included call forwarding across carriers, fraud prevention services, billing and customer service. Appex was bought by EDS in 1990. By the time Shikhar left in 1993, Appex’s revenues exceeded $100m with an order backlog of over $1 billion. It was selected by BusinessWeek as the fastest-growing private company in the US.
Shikhar founded Open Market in 1993. Open Market was one of the pioneering companies in the commercialization of the Internet. It built the first commercial infrastructure for enabling secure commerce on the Internet and provided the software and services that enabled companies like Time Warner and AT&T to offer their services on the Internet. Open Market was one of the first internet companies to go public. It was selected by numerous business publications as one of the companies that helped to make the Internet what it is today.
After leaving Open Market Shikhar has been the founder, CEO or Chairman of several companies in the wireless, payment, Internet marketing and online retailing industries. He has worked in all facets of the entrepreneurial process – starting companies with technical teams, providing and raising capital with venture capitalists, buying and selling companies, or taking them public and closing down unsuccessful companies. His ideas and interviews have multiple media. He has been a keynote speaker in numerous conferences on innovation, entrepreneurship, digital media and on the future of the Internet.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
