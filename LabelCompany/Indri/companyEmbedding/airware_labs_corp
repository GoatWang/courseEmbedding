	AirWare Labs

Break Through Breathing Technology

	AirWare Labs is an innovator in breathing devices that enhance life, health and promote good breathing. Our AIR™ advanced nasal breathing products address a wide range of issues, including congestion, allergies, snoring, and travel-related illnesses. Utilizing a comfortable and discreet design that is soft, pliable and latex-free, AIR™ sits nearly invisibly inside the nose, gently lifting and supporting nasal passages – resulting in up to 38% increased airflow and better breathing. Air Essentials incorporate the powerful therapeutic properties of essential oils, and Air Filters feature filtration media from 3M, engineered to trap unhealthful particles before they enter the system. AIR™ is strategically poised to enter the Health and Wellness sector during a period of tremendous growth and expansion. Although breathing is the most basic of human functions, the expansive health benefits associated with improved breathing have thus far been greatly overlooked. Not only does AIR™ dramatically improve airflow, its innovative, cutting-edge design has no competition.

(  OTCQB :  AIRW ) today announced the addition of Mr. Dan Pool to its executive management team and the appointment of Dr. Lorrie Henderson, Ph.D., MBA to President and Chief Operating Officer.As Director of Product Development, Pool will oversee product design and development for the AIR® line of nasal dilators. Pool's impressive career spans over 30 years in the field of product design and development. He built his first company, PC MFG, up to $20,000,000 in annual sales and 200 employees over 10 years and sold it along with patents in 1992 in the high seven figure range to 3M Company. Pool has since sold nearly a dozen inventions to a variety of companies and gained vast experience securing the intellectual property rights for a myriad of products. In 2005, he developed a series of patents for CNS for nasal dilation products, which protected their Breathe Right Nasal Strips. Pool has licensed and developed products for Stanley Works, USG, DAP, 3M Company, Saint-Gobaine, and ShurTech Brands, among others. His unique and methodical approach to developing products is fostered by his belief that everything in everyday life has room for improvement and refinement."Dan Pool's accomplishments in product design and innovation, combined with his expertise in patents and intellectual property rights, are tremendous assets to AirWare and our AIR® line," said Jeffrey Rassás, CEO of AirWare Labs. "We are excited to have Dan join us in our mission to improve lives through better breathing."Dr. Henderson will continue in his new role as President and COO to further the business strategy and increase brand awareness, profitability and shareholder value globally.

Jonathan Downey (Founder) Yvonne Wassenaar (CEO)


Website
Airware.com


Airware (incorporated as Unmanned Innovation, Inc.) is an American venture-funded startup that provides commercial unmanned aerial vehicles for enterprises.[1] Airware was founded in 2011 in Newport Beach, California, by Jonathan Downey. The company relocated to San Francisco in January 2014.[2]
The company produces enterprise drones which combine hardware, on-aircraft and mobile software, and cloud services. Downey has stated the company is focused on building systems for drones for commercial uses, including anti-poaching efforts, infrastructure inspections, and precision agriculture.[3]

History[edit]
Airware was founded by Downey in 2011 out of a frustration with the "inflexible and costly" autopilot systems for unmanned aircraft.[4] Airware was incubated at both Lemnos Labs and Y Combinator. The company has raised $70 million in venture funding from Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Next World Capital, First Round Capital, Google Ventures, Intel Capital and GE Ventures.[5] In March 2016, the company announced a $30 million Series C round of financing led by Next World Capital with Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Cisco Systems executive chairman John T. Chambers.[6] Andreessen Horowitz partner Martin Casado, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers partner Mike Abbott, and John T. Chambers are members of the company’s board.[7] In 2015, Airware launched a new venture fund for commercial drones to support "scaling the use of drones across a variety of commercial applications."[8][9] Airware purchased Redbird, a drone analytics software company, in 2016.[10]
Products and services[edit]
Airware offers enterprise drone services combining hardware, on-aircraft and mobile software, and cloud services for industries like mining, insurance, and construction.[11] Airware offers navigation software for drones, table software to guide and monitors drones in flight, and cloud services to store and manage the information gathered by drones.[12] Where most software is designed for specific models of drones, Airware is developing a platform that enables compatibility across aircraft.[13] The company previously collaborated with commercial drone manufacturers to integrate its autopilot hardware and software, but now consults directly with enterprise clients to identify solutions and to ensure regulatory compliance.[7][14][15]

History[edit]
Airware was founded by Downey in 2011 out of a frustration with the "inflexible and costly" autopilot systems for unmanned aircraft.[4] Airware was incubated at both Lemnos Labs and Y Combinator. The company has raised $70 million in venture funding from Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Next World Capital, First Round Capital, Google Ventures, Intel Capital and GE Ventures.[5] In March 2016, the company announced a $30 million Series C round of financing led by Next World Capital with Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Cisco Systems executive chairman John T. Chambers.[6] Andreessen Horowitz partner Martin Casado, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers partner Mike Abbott, and John T. Chambers are members of the company’s board.[7] In 2015, Airware launched a new venture fund for commercial drones to support "scaling the use of drones across a variety of commercial applications."[8][9] Airware purchased Redbird, a drone analytics software company, in 2016.[10]
Products and services[edit]
Airware offers enterprise drone services combining hardware, on-aircraft and mobile software, and cloud services for industries like mining, insurance, and construction.[11] Airware offers navigation software for drones, table software to guide and monitors drones in flight, and cloud services to store and manage the information gathered by drones.[12] Where most software is designed for specific models of drones, Airware is developing a platform that enables compatibility across aircraft.[13] The company previously collaborated with commercial drone manufacturers to integrate its autopilot hardware and software, but now consults directly with enterprise clients to identify solutions and to ensure regulatory compliance.[7][14][15]
