(a portfolio company of Cortec Group Fund, IV, LP) pursuant to which CGI will become a wholly owned subsidiary of PGT.

Broaden manufacturing footprint and capabilities

“The acquisition of CGI Windows & Doors is consistent with our stated growth plan to acquire revenue generating products that leverage our core capabilities.

I couldn’t be more thrilled as this acquisition will allow us to diversify our brand and product portfolios in a cost-effective manner. By adding top line sales and achieving synergies, we are confident this will drive growth in stockholder value.”
Subject to customary closing conditions, the transaction is expected to close in September. Deutsche Bank and Keybanc NA have committed to providing a long-term debt facility of $235 million which, together with cash on hand, will be used to consummate the acquisition, repay existing indebtedness and for general corporate purposes. To learn more about the details of the transaction, there is an upcoming conference call related to our earnings release.
“A very exciting time for both companies, as this strategic and complementary combination will bring significant benefits to our collective customers,” said Steve Dawson, Executive Vice President of Sales of CGI.  “Our customers can expect to benefit from expanded product portfolios and increased manufacturing capabilities. In addition, our employees will have the advantage of being part of a larger organization, well positioned to meet the evolving needs of the 21st century consumer of impact-resistant windows and doors.”

PGT Innovations Announces Expansion Plans in Miami
Facility Needed to Meet Growing Demand
Venice, FL – April 20th, 2017 – PGT Innovations, Inc. announced today expansion plans for a new 330,000 sq. ft. manufacturing facility in Miami, Florida. The new facility will enhance the Company’s manufacturing capabilities to meet future expected growth of the impact-resistant window and door market.
The Company currently has 182,000 sq. ft. of offices and manufacturing space in Miami. The CGI brand will move its offices and manufacturing facility into the new space which is located approximately 12 miles from their current location. The new facility is designed to produce the Company’s CGI branded products, along with various other commercial and PGT aluminum products.
“This new facility demonstrates our commitment to make our products in America and to serve our core market of Florida which continues to be a positive environment for the growth of our Company,” commented Jeff Jackson, President, PGT Innovations. “This move also increases our manufacturing capabilities and enhances operational efficiencies by combining parts of our production, distribution and marketing efforts across all of our brands.

CGI Windows & Doors Donates Windows & Doors to South Florida Foster Care Program

Visit the link at: http://ir.pgtinnovations.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=1017526
MIAMI–(BUSINESS WIRE)– CGI®, a wholly-owned subsidiary of PGT Innovations (NYSE:PGTI), has long been recognized for strong support of their South Florida community. This ongoing generosity and outreach is evident in their recent in-kind donation of windows to the foster care organization 4KIDS of South Florida (http://www.4kidsofsfl.org/).
4KIDS of South Florida is a faith-based foster care agency working to provide hope, healing, and a home for abused and neglected children. Through the 4KIDS program, individuals in Broward, Palm Beach, and the Treasure Coast areas are trained and licensed to become foster parents. With teenagers typically being harder to place, 4KIDS offers four local residential facilities where children can live in an authentic home environment. The organization also assists expectant mothers by preparing them for independence with post-birth care, classes, and a residential option, if needed.
An attempted break-in at a 4KIDS residential home was prevented due to impact-resistant windows, which lead the group to approach CGI for their assistance.
“The donation of our impact-resistant windows adds not only weather protection to these important residences, but they add an additional layer of safety and security for these teenagers,” said Daryl Hendricks, Sr. Vice President of Operations, CGI Windows & Doors. “Businesses don’t often get the opportunity to step in and help those in need literally in our backyard, in our same zip code,” continued Daryl. “What an amazing chance we had to raise their level of security and safety with this donation. It’s an absolute honor to be part of the 4KIDS family.”
“The donation of windows from CGI Windows & Doors resulted in one less step needed on our part with regard to storm and security preparation,” said Deanna Prusinowski, the business engagement officer for 4KIDS of South Florida. “This was a great opportunity for CGI, and they stepped in and made a huge difference in both these kids’ lives, and their community. We are so grateful for their dedication to their local community.”
CGI Windows & Doors donated Sentinel Series 110 single-hung windows, Series 120 2-panel horizontal rollers with screens, and Series 150 2-panel sliding glass doors.
The products will be installed by CGI dealer Palm Beach Window and Door Design Center, a full-service company specializing in architectural impact windows and doors. Known as an elite-level distributor for industry-leading window and door manufacturers, Palm Beach Window and Door Design Center offers an in-house service center and support system that has made them the go-to dealer for many of South Florida’s most prestigious builders, architects, and designers.

About 4KIDS of South Florida
4KIDS of South Florida has been serving the community for 20 years as a registered 501(c)(3). They work to provide hope and homes to children in crisis. 4KIDS utilizes a unique continuum of care, beginning with children first removed from their homes, to young adults aging out of the foster care system. Whether a child is being removed from their home for the very first time, a teenage girl finds herself facing an unplanned pregnancy, or a young adult is aging out of the foster care system with nowhere to go, 4KIDS is there.

CGI Windows Gives Back with Community Donations

(Miami, FL) – CGI Windows & Doors made two impactful and meaningful donations to their local community this fall: one benefitting the Miami-Dade Fire Rescue Training Facility in Doral, and another the local Habitat for Humanity Chapter.
“We take pride in being an active member of our community, and this includes giving back whenever we can,” said Steven E. Dawson, vice president and general manager of CGI Windows & Doors. “We very much enjoyed hosting a few of our local firefighters at our facility and getting to know them; we’re so grateful for all they do.”
Representatives from the Miami-Dade Fire Rescue Training Facility received a large selection of windows and doors to be used in firefighter training. According to Wesley Lebron, a training captain with Miami-Dade, this donation helps solve a huge problem: “As hurricane-resistant windows become the norm, we need to ensure our people are trained in how to properly breach windows and doors and get inside; we’ve discovered we need to use the largest circular saws we have, due to the toughness of the CGI windows!” 
The hands-on approach is what makes the difference for the firefighters, says Lebron. “It’s not something you can just read about; we need to be able to actually work with the windows and doors so our firefighters can be as effective as possible.” Approximately 30-40 training crews will make use of the donated windows and doors.
Hardware, deadbolts, and levers – all brand-new and never used – were donated to a local Habitat chapter. The items will be used to build homes across the area.

Hurricane Season Preparedness: Five Tips

Media Contact:
Kim Drew, APR

(Miami, FL) – It’s here: the 2015 hurricane season. Thanks to 24-hour weather coverage, the exact minute a storm makes landfall can be calculated and reported – so lack of  preparedness is not an option. But what exactly should be done, and when, to prepare family and home for a storm? From CGI Windows & Doors, the Miami-based, impact-resistant window and door experts, here are five hurricane season preparedness tips:

Know the lingo. Living in a hurricane-prone area, an alphabet soup of weather terminology gets tossed around: various kinds of watches and warnings, eye, wall, surge, etc. Important subtle differences exist between many of these; educate and clarify.
Plan, plan, and plan. An existing plan previously discussed with the family makes stressful times flow more smoothly. Things to think about: Contact lists, disaster resources, designated safe spots within the home, community safe spots, personal protection, a set evacuation plan, and special considerations (elderly family members and pets, for example). Details are easier to manage without a hurricane on the map – plan ahead, and communicate the plan to the family.
Home safety assessment. Three key areas to consider: flood risks (know your elevation), home risks (evaluate security of garage door, rooftop, windows, and doors – all wind entry points for the building envelope), and outdoor/environmental risks (trees/shrubbery, porches/overhangs, loose outdoor items).
Weathering the storm. If evacuation isn’t an option, don’t make these mistakes:

Underestimating the storm. Take it seriously, no matter the category.
Overlooking flood concerns. The storm surge is often the deadliest part of a hurricane.
Not protecting the home. If the home isn’t hurricane-strong, it’s vulnerable to the full force of the storm. Plan ahead.
Not following safety regulations after the storm. What do carbon monoxide, alternative fuels used incorrectly, gas leaks, or improperly vented generators all have in common? They can all turn into killers. Follow all proper precautions.


After the storm. Check for leaks immediately. Wind can drive water throughout your home, so look everywhere. Wet-dry vacuums are a great way to mop up water, if the home has power. If not, sweep water pools into dust pans and dump them into buckets. Take all textiles outside to dry to prevent mold. For heavy flooding, call in professionals to evaluate the safety of the home and offer next steps.
