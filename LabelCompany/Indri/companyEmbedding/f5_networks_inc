	BIG-IP Application Delivery Controller platform | F5
 








<iframe src="//www.googletagmanager.com/ns.html?id=GTM-PPZPQ6"
			    height="0" width="0" style="display:none;visibility:hidden"></iframe>
































 BIG-IP Platform


A blend of software and hardware that’s a load balancer and a full proxy. It gives you the ability to control the traffic that passes through your network.









BIG-IP Platform












You work in an application world.

Make it fast, available, and secure.
The BIG-IP platform is a smart evolution of Application Delivery Controller (ADC) technology. Solutions built on this platform are load balancers. And they’re full proxies that give visibility into, and the power to control—inspect and encrypt or decrypt—all the traffic that passes through your network.










Heres how it works.

Software and hardware.
BIG-IP software runs on BIG-IP or VIPRION hardware or as a virtual edition on a client server. Hardware offers the greatest scalability, while virtual editions offer added deployment flexibility.
BIG-IP products provide application services ranging from access and acceleration to security to intelligent traffic management.









Watch the video











The BIG-IP platform runs the network. What runs the BIG-IP platform?Underlying all BIG-IP hardware and software is F5’s proprietary operating system, TMOS, which provides unified intelligence, flexibility, and programmability.
With its application control plane architecture, TMOS gives you control over the acceleration, security, and availability services your applications require.
TMOS establishes a virtual, unified pool of highly scalable, resilient, and reusable services that can dynamically adapt to the changing conditions in data centers and virtual and cloud infrastructures.
Take advantage of TMOS’s open API.F5 products built on TMOS offer flexibility via an open API.

Applications can cue TMOS-based devices to control traffic flow and maximize performance using the iControl API.
You gain granular control over traffic going through F5 devices using iRules, F5’s scripting language.
iApps templates let you deploy and manage network services for specific applications.

Securing your cloud: What you really need to know

 Brian A. McHenry · January 18, 2017 · 5 min. read 
Because your company has probably moved to the cloud, there are some things you are going to worry about, but shouldn't: the cloud operator stealing your data at rest, bad actors intercepting and reading your data in flight, bad actors "hacking the cloud" and stealing everything. When you eliminate these things, then you get back to the things that really matter.

In 2009, FedEx assessed its application portfolio and realized it had more than 2,600 applications, and more than 14,000 custom interfaces to these applications. Can you have too many? Here’s why, what the risks are and what to do about it.

Preserve your flexibility in the cloud

How to build a cloud architecture that responds to your business needs

 Dan Tynan · May 20, 2017 · 5 min. read 

If you want to work at the speed that private cloud can enable, you’ll have to remove as much human latency from your process as possible. As Tesla CEO Elon Musk famously put it, “you can’t have people in the production line itself, otherwise you drop to people speed.”





The cloud offers lots of benefits to employees and consumers, but lots of headaches for IT architects. When it comes to evaluating the impact that cloud will have on your digital transformation, there’s no easy explanation. The answer mostly depends on whom you ask.

Missed Volume 1 of this report? 


How in the world do Death Star-sized botnets come about? Attackers don’t possess such immense power on their own; they must commandeer it. That means they’re perpetually on the hunt for vulnerable IoT devices that they can compromise.
F5 Labs and our data partner, Loryka1, have been monitoring this hunt for over a year now. In our first report, DDoS’s Newest Minions: IoT Devices, we proved what many security experts had long suspected: IoT devices were not only vulnerable, they were already being heavily exploited to pull off large, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.
Data collected throughout the remainder of 2016 shows an even steeper growth in “the hunt” than we had imagined. The annual growth rate was 1,473%, with a clear spike in Q4—1.5 times the combined volume in Q1 through Q3. This isn’t surprising, given the timing of the Mirai botnet. And while the number of participating networks in the second half of 2016 stayed relatively flat at 10%, the number of unique IP addresses participating within those networks grew at a rate of 74%. Clearly, threat actors within the same networks have increased their activity.



So, who exactly is involved in the IoT hunt? Here are some key findings of this report:

Networks in China (primarily state-owned telecom companies and ISPs) headlined the threat actor list, accounting for 44% of all attacks in Q3 and 21% in Q4.
Trailing behind China, the top threat actors in Q3 were Vietnam and the US, and Russia and the UK in Q4. (The UK surprisingly jumped to third place in Q4 with most activity coming from an online gaming network.)
Russia, Spain, the US, and Turkey were the top 4 targeted countries (in that order) in Q3 and Q4.
Russia, at 31% in Q3 and 40% in Q4, was the number one target of all top 50 source countries.

What can concerned enterprises do to deal with the IoT threat?

Have a DDoS strategy that can support attack sizes beyond your network capacity.
Ensure all of your critical services have redundancy, even those you outsource.
Put pressure on IoT manufacturers to secure their products, and don’t buy products that are known to be insecure or compromised.
Share your knowledge—about vulnerable devices, attacks and threat actors, successful mitigation efforts, and potential solutions—with other security professionals.

In our first report, DDoS’s Newest Minions: IoT Devices, we proved what many security experts had long suspected: IoT devices were not only vulnerable, they were already being heavily exploited to pull off large, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.
Data collected throughout the remainder of 2016 shows an even steeper growth in “the hunt” than we had imagined. The annual growth rate was 1,473%, with a clear spike in Q4—1.5 times the combined volume in Q1 through Q3. This isn’t surprising, given the timing of the Mirai botnet. And while the number of participating networks in the second half of 2016 stayed relatively flat at 10%, the number of unique IP addresses participating within those networks grew at a rate of 74%. Clearly, threat actors within the same networks have increased their activity.



So, who exactly is involved in the IoT hunt? Here are some key findings of this report:

Networks in China (primarily state-owned telecom companies and ISPs) headlined the threat actor list, accounting for 44% of all attacks in Q3 and 21% in Q4.
Trailing behind China, the top threat actors in Q3 were Vietnam and the US, and Russia and the UK in Q4. (The UK surprisingly jumped to third place in Q4 with most activity coming from an online gaming network.)
Russia, Spain, the US, and Turkey were the top 4 targeted countries (in that order) in Q3 and Q4.
Russia, at 31% in Q3 and 40% in Q4, was the number one target of all top 50 source countries.

What can concerned enterprises do to deal with the IoT threat?

Have a DDoS strategy that can support attack sizes beyond your network capacity.
Ensure all of your critical services have redundancy, even those you outsource.
Put pressure on IoT manufacturers to secure their products, and don’t buy products that are known to be insecure or compromised.
Share your knowledge—about vulnerable devices, attacks and threat actors, successful mitigation efforts, and potential solutions—with other security professionals.

 The Motley Fool Secures Critical Websites with F5 Cloud-Based WAF Solution
Financial services company The Motley Fool needed more responsiveness and visibility from its web application firewall and content delivery network provider. Leveraging a cloud-based web application firewall solution from F5 in conjunction with a CDN from another vendor, the company now enjoys better visibility, flexibility, and technical support.












 Business Challenges
The Motley Fool offers stock picks, investment guides, and financial news to members and non-members alike through its websites and email newsletters. “Our members are highly engaged,” says systems engineer Nick Travis, “so the sites being down eliminates time that our members would spend reading new content or interacting on our message boards, and that’s obviously bad for us.”
The Motley Fool had been using a cloud-based web application firewall (WAF) and content delivery network (CDN) solution because it didn’t have the internal resources dedicated to keeping firewall rule sets up to date and analyzing alerts as they came up. “We knew that we didn’t have anyone who could focus solely on security,” says Travis, “and we were going to fall behind if we didn’t have some expert help.”
However, the company was experiencing ongoing support problems. “We would open a ticket,” Travis says, “and they would recognize that it was a valid issue. And then it would still be open two or three months later with no progress being made.”
Travis also wanted more visibility into what was happening with the firewall. “Our previous vendor wanted to charge us to see our logs,” says Travis, “and then there were also issues of the support team not knowing the ticket history and seemingly not understanding the general scope of what we were doing.”
The Motley Fool needed to make a change and augment its existing infrastructure. “We’ve used F5 BIG-IP Local Traffic Manager (LTM) for load balancing and availability for years,” says Travis, “so we decided to look at the F5 Silverline Web Application Firewall.”

Silverline completely eclipsed our former vendor in terms of responsiveness.            Nick Travis, Systems Engineer, The Motley Fool

 Solution
The Motley Fool needed a solution that married a powerful and flexible web application firewall with a fast, full-featured content delivery network. Initially, Travis was concerned about deploying a joint solution that leveraged both F5 and another partner. “We did consider the effects of an increase in latency from a two-partner solution,” he says. “But the difference in performance was so negligible that it didn’t really have an impact on our decision.”
The company then embarked on proof-of-concept trials with several vendors, pushing some of their production traffic through each of the services. In terms of protection, all the services performed well, but the Silverline service stood out in terms of ease of management and flexibility of implementation. In addition, the level of responsiveness from the F5 Security Operations Center (SOC) was a deciding factor in the company’s choice. “We see average change response times from the SOC of five or six minutes,” says Travis, “versus upwards of an hour with some of the other services we tested.”
The company’s trial of the Silverline service with their CDN partner ran smoothly, says Travis. “The SOC has been really responsive and, honestly, I don’t remember having any problems getting set up.” After the company went live with the service, Travis and his team continued to work closely with the SOC. “They helped us adjust the rules to allow our members to communicate freely on our message boards without triggering an alert,” says Travis. “We’ve gotten to a really good place with their help.”

Our tickets are responded to and closed within a matter of minutes instead of days, weeks, or even months.            Nick Travis, Systems Engineer, The Motley Fool

 Benefits
Using the cloud-based Silverline Web Application Firewall in conjunction with an integrated CDN enables The Motley Fool to leverage two market-leading solutions to secure and optimize their sites as they enjoy on-call technical expertise, detailed reporting of firewall activities, and the flexibility of the F5 iRules scripting language.
Expert guidance, anytime, all the time
With limited security resources within the company, Travis and his team knew they needed help from a partner to reduce the complexity of managing a WAF and increase the speed to deploy new policies. With the Silverline Web Application Firewall, The Motley Fool team receives constant access to a team of experts in the SOC who proactively monitor and fine-tune WAF policies against an evolving variety of threats.
“Working with the SOC has been great,” says Travis. “They completely eclipsed our former vendor in responsiveness. Now our tickets are responded to and closed within a matter of minutes instead of days, weeks, or even months.” In addition, says Travis, “I like seeing the same names on our tickets rather than a different person every time. They also caught us a few times when we were about to make a mistake, so we definitely appreciate having that support.”
Customer portal for visibility and control
While The Motley Fool had very little visibility into the performance of their former vendor’s web application firewall, they now enjoy having access to the granular details available through the F5 customer portal. “The availability of the logs coming out of the Silverline service is definitely superior,” Travis says. He and his team use the cloud-based portal and work with the SOC to incorporate external intelligence to secure their sites against established and evolving threats.
“Especially at the beginning, I was in there daily looking through the logs for false positives,” says Travis. “Having that visibility has also helped us identify and address a few other minor issues that have come up. It even gave us the awareness to write our own iRule, which blocks a specific kind of attack before it reaches our servers.”
Increased flexibility and customization with iRules
As long-time F5 customers, The Motley Fool team has written many iRules to customize their BIG-IP LTM product as it optimizes the availability and performance of the company’s applications. Being able to use their knowledge of the iRules scripting language in conjunction with technical support from the SOC team has supercharged the company’s use of the Silverline service.
 “We have a very complex underlying set of servers,” says Travis, “and the things that we want to block or allow make the flexibility of iRules extremely important. our familiarity with iRules and what they can do makes it that much easier to get the most out of the Silverline service.”

Corporate history[edit]
F5 Networks, originally named F5 Labs,[3] was established in 1996.[4] The company name was inspired by the 1996 movie Twister, in which reference was made to the fastest and most powerful tornado on the Fujita Scale: F5.
F5's first product (launched in 1997[5]) was a load balancer called BIG-IP. When a server went down or became overloaded, BIG-IP directed traffic away from that server to other servers that could handle the load.
In June 1999, the company had its initial public offering and was listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange with symbol FFIV.[6]
In 2010 and 2011, F5 Networks was on Fortune's list of 100 Fastest-Growing Companies.[7] The company was also rated one of the top ten best-performing stocks by S&P 500 in 2010.[8] F5 was also named a Best Place to Work by online jobs and recruiting site Glassdoor in 2015 and 2016.[9]
Competitors included Cisco Systems (until 2012[10]), Citrix Systems, and Radware.
François Locoh-Donou replaced John McAdam as president and CEO on April 3, 2017.[11]
Ben Gibson hired as CMO July 20, 2016. [12]

Acquisitions[edit]

uRoam (SSL VPN vendor) for USD $25 million in 2003[13]
Magnifire WebSystems (web application firewall) for USD $29 million in 2004[14]
Swan Labs (WAN acceleration and web acceleration) for USD $43 million in 2005.[15]
Acopia Networks (file virtualization) for USD $210 million in 2007[16]
DPI intellectual property from Crescendo Networks in 2011 (amount undisclosed) [17]
Traffix Systems (Diameter protocol switching technology) in 2012 (amount undisclosed) [18]
LineRate Systems in 2013 (high-performance, software-based Load Balancer for x86 systems with node.js datapath scripting)[19]
Versafe (anti-fraud, anti-phishing, and anti-malware solutions)[20] for USD $87.7 Million in 2013[21]
Defense.Net (cloud-based DDoS mitigation service)[22] for USD $49.4 million in 2014[23]

Products[edit]
BIG-IP[edit]
F5's BIG-IP product family comprises hardware, modularized software, and virtual appliances that run the F5 TMOS operating system.[24][25] Depending on the appliance selected, one or more BIG-IP product modules can be added. Acronyms used include:

Local Traffic Manager (LTM): Local load balancing based on a full-proxy architecture.
Application Security Manager (ASM): A web application firewall.
Access Policy Manager (APM): Provides access control and authentication for HTTP and HTTPS applications.
Advanced Firewall Manager (AFM): On-premises DDoS protection, data centre firewall.
Application Acceleration Manager (AAM): Accelerates and optimizes application performance through technologies such as compression and caching.
IP Intelligence (IPI): Blocking known bad IP addresses, prevention of phishing attacks and botnets.
WebSafe: Protects against sophisticated fraud threats, leveraging advanced encryption, client-less malware detection and session behavioral analysis capabilities.
BIG-IP DNS: Distributes DNS and application requests based user, network, and cloud performance conditions.

BIG-IP history[edit]
On September 7, 2004, F5 Networks released version 9.0 of the BIG-IP software in addition to appliances to run the software. Version 9.0 also marked the introduction of the company’s TMOS architecture,[26] with significant enhancements including:

Moved from BSD to Linux to handle system management functions (disks, logging, bootup, console access, etc.)
Creation of a Traffic Management Microkernel (TMM) to directly talk to the networking hardware and handle all network activities.[25][27][28]
Creation of the standard full-proxy mode, which fully terminates network connections at the BIG-IP and establishes new connections between the BIG-IP and the member servers in a pool. This allows for optimum TCP stacks on both sides as well as the complete ability to modify traffic in either direction.

Subsequent releases enhanced performance, improves application security, and supported cloud application deployments.
BIG-IQ[edit]
F5 describes BIG-IQ as a framework for managing BIG-IP devices and application services, irrespective of their form factors (hardware, software or cloud) or deployment model (on-premises, private/public cloud or hybrid). BIG-IQ supports integration with other ecosystem participants such as public cloud providers, and orchestration engines through cloud connectors and through a set of open RESTful APIs. BIG-IQ uses a multi-tenant approach to management. This allows organizations to move closer to IT as a Service without concern that it might affect the stability or security of the services fabric.[24]
Herculon[edit]
Herculon is a product for security administrators. DDoS Hybrid Defender and SSL Orchestrator, were introduced in January 2017.
Silverline[edit]
Silverline is a cloud-based application service. Its offerings include security services such as WAF and DDoS protection services.

Corporate history[edit]
F5 Networks, originally named F5 Labs,[3] was established in 1996.[4] The company name was inspired by the 1996 movie Twister, in which reference was made to the fastest and most powerful tornado on the Fujita Scale: F5.
F5's first product (launched in 1997[5]) was a load balancer called BIG-IP. When a server went down or became overloaded, BIG-IP directed traffic away from that server to other servers that could handle the load.
In June 1999, the company had its initial public offering and was listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange with symbol FFIV.[6]
In 2010 and 2011, F5 Networks was on Fortune's list of 100 Fastest-Growing Companies.[7] The company was also rated one of the top ten best-performing stocks by S&P 500 in 2010.[8] F5 was also named a Best Place to Work by online jobs and recruiting site Glassdoor in 2015 and 2016.[9]
Competitors included Cisco Systems (until 2012[10]), Citrix Systems, and Radware.
François Locoh-Donou replaced John McAdam as president and CEO on April 3, 2017.[11]
Ben Gibson hired as CMO July 20, 2016. [12]

Acquisitions[edit]

uRoam (SSL VPN vendor) for USD $25 million in 2003[13]
Magnifire WebSystems (web application firewall) for USD $29 million in 2004[14]
Swan Labs (WAN acceleration and web acceleration) for USD $43 million in 2005.[15]
Acopia Networks (file virtualization) for USD $210 million in 2007[16]
DPI intellectual property from Crescendo Networks in 2011 (amount undisclosed) [17]
Traffix Systems (Diameter protocol switching technology) in 2012 (amount undisclosed) [18]
LineRate Systems in 2013 (high-performance, software-based Load Balancer for x86 systems with node.js datapath scripting)[19]
Versafe (anti-fraud, anti-phishing, and anti-malware solutions)[20] for USD $87.7 Million in 2013[21]
Defense.Net (cloud-based DDoS mitigation service)[22] for USD $49.4 million in 2014[23]

Products[edit]
BIG-IP[edit]
F5's BIG-IP product family comprises hardware, modularized software, and virtual appliances that run the F5 TMOS operating system.[24][25] Depending on the appliance selected, one or more BIG-IP product modules can be added. Acronyms used include:

Local Traffic Manager (LTM): Local load balancing based on a full-proxy architecture.
Application Security Manager (ASM): A web application firewall.
Access Policy Manager (APM): Provides access control and authentication for HTTP and HTTPS applications.
Advanced Firewall Manager (AFM): On-premises DDoS protection, data centre firewall.
Application Acceleration Manager (AAM): Accelerates and optimizes application performance through technologies such as compression and caching.
IP Intelligence (IPI): Blocking known bad IP addresses, prevention of phishing attacks and botnets.
WebSafe: Protects against sophisticated fraud threats, leveraging advanced encryption, client-less malware detection and session behavioral analysis capabilities.
BIG-IP DNS: Distributes DNS and application requests based user, network, and cloud performance conditions.

BIG-IP history[edit]
On September 7, 2004, F5 Networks released version 9.0 of the BIG-IP software in addition to appliances to run the software. Version 9.0 also marked the introduction of the company’s TMOS architecture,[26] with significant enhancements including:

Moved from BSD to Linux to handle system management functions (disks, logging, bootup, console access, etc.)
Creation of a Traffic Management Microkernel (TMM) to directly talk to the networking hardware and handle all network activities.[25][27][28]
Creation of the standard full-proxy mode, which fully terminates network connections at the BIG-IP and establishes new connections between the BIG-IP and the member servers in a pool. This allows for optimum TCP stacks on both sides as well as the complete ability to modify traffic in either direction.

Subsequent releases enhanced performance, improves application security, and supported cloud application deployments.
BIG-IQ[edit]
F5 describes BIG-IQ as a framework for managing BIG-IP devices and application services, irrespective of their form factors (hardware, software or cloud) or deployment model (on-premises, private/public cloud or hybrid). BIG-IQ supports integration with other ecosystem participants such as public cloud providers, and orchestration engines through cloud connectors and through a set of open RESTful APIs. BIG-IQ uses a multi-tenant approach to management. This allows organizations to move closer to IT as a Service without concern that it might affect the stability or security of the services fabric.[24]
Herculon[edit]
Herculon is a product for security administrators. DDoS Hybrid Defender and SSL Orchestrator, were introduced in January 2017.
Silverline[edit]
Silverline is a cloud-based application service. Its offerings include security services such as WAF and DDoS protection services.

#FutureOfApps


Play all


        The Future of Apps report commissioned by F5 Networks highlights major trends and projections that will significantly impact society. The findings cover the evolution of artificial intelligence and machine learning, as well as the need for new collaborative models to support heightened transparency demands. It also charts the rise of new app interfaces, including augmented and virtual reality, and the potential-rich influence of blockchain technologies and edge computing. The report indicates how the balance of power is shifting away from businesses, creating immense opportunities for those capable of delivering apps with speed, adaptive functionality and security.

F5 BIG-IP and Cisco/Firepower - Network Optimization and Security Architecture

Since no one does it all, effective cybersecurity in the enterprise requires collaboration between best-of-breed technologies. Budgets are also limited which puts pressure on IT organizations to pick products that adhere to performance and total cost of ownership requirements, and to integrate them in ways that realize maximum value. At times, constraints have created environments and the notion that best in class performance does not allow for hardened security or visa versa, that hardened security postures and performance are mutually exclusive or unattainable without unrealistic investments.
Sourcefire, now part of Cisco, has partnered with F5 Networks, the global leader in Application Delivery Networking. Through the partnership, F5 and Cisco/Sourcefire have validated two deployment architectures that help customers secure critical networks, applications and end-points while achieving optimal performance. In addition, customers can architect for scale and redundancy by eliminating single points of failure.
To improve security through automation, Cisco/Sourcefire and F5 have created a remediation capability that allows critical security events such as malware (FireAMP) and IPS/IDS events to initiate rule configuration on F5’s BIG-IP appliances.



DescriptionFeaturesSupportResourcesCompatibility

Two Industry Leading Products 


Cisco/Sourcefire Next Generation IPS (NGIPS), Advanced Malware and the FirePOWER Platform 

Cisco/Sourcefire Next-Generation IPS (NGIPS) and Advanced Malware Protection (AM) set a new standard for advanced threat protection, integrating real-time contextual awareness, intelligent security policy automation and unprecedented performance.
These two solutions take advantage of the best hardware technology in the industry on the same device, providing IPS inspected throughput options ranging from 50Mbps to 60 Gbps, providing market leading performance with greater energy efficiency.

F5 Networks BIG-IP

Recognized as the industry-leading series of application delivery controllers (ADCs), the BIG-IP family of products ensure applications and infrastructures are fast, available, and secure. All BIG-IP products share a common underlying architecture, F5’s Traffic Management Operating System (TMOS), which provides unified intelligence, flexibility and programmability. Together, BIG-IP’s powerful platforms, advanced security modules, and centralized management system make up the most comprehensive set of application and security delivery tools in the industry.
Often positioned at the edge of the network, BIG-IP Local Traffic Manager and BIG-IP Global Traffic Manager allow you to scale applications and infrastructures and turn the tables on security threats. And you can rapidly scale and adjust your security solution as your security objectives or threat spectrum changes simply by activating additional BIG-IP security modules.

Deployment Architectures 

Traditional ADC for NGIPS Design (In-Line Layer 2) The first validated architecture is a simple configuration with the IPS placed behind the F5 BIG-IP ADC. This architecture ensures that traffic is directed to the back-end servers with all of it being inspected by the IPS before connections are made to the back-end application servers. The IPS must be adequately sized to meet the application’s performance requirement. In the figure 1 above Traditional ADC for NGIPS Design (In-line Layer 2)
 

F5 Security Services for NGIPS Design – Layer 3, Remediation Integration Architecture

The second validated architecture is a load-balanced pool of Sourcefire NGIPS / Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) sensors protecting application servers. Traffic is pre screened for DDoS attacks, then depending on the policy, balanced to the pool of Sourcefire sensors and then routed back through BIG-IP to the IPS protected servers. This ensures that traffic can be inspected and, if necessary, be blocked before forwarding on to their respective application servers. In the figure 2 above Real Time Response to Critical Security Events.

Remediation capability 

Cisco/Sourcefire’s FirePOWER appliances running NGIPS and FireAMP are managed by the FireSIGHT Management Center. FireSIGHT centralizes the management of all FirePOWER policy related configurations including IPS and Malware detection and collects all event data for analysis, correlation and reporting. A correlation rules engine allows users to configure a variety of actions in response to security events. Rules can be very simple or be more powerful by including multiple conditions and qualifiers. Actions include the ability automatically configure rules on the F5 appliance, such as blocking a device that is originating an attack, or exhibiting some other form of suspicious or unwanted behavior. supported by the remediation engine include:
IPS Events 
FireAMP (malware) Events
Compliance Events 
Connection Events

Two key areas of focus for the department are the management of projects through the PMO, and providing support for business applications, a particular concern for IT. One of the department's first priorities is ERP implementation.

The IT team has carried out several upgrades to its web services. The company's web site application, DevCentral, provides a locus for the resolution of technical issues concerning the company's products. The company has a global technical support organization, with operations for North America being the responsibility of the customer support team. This technical team works on initiatives in network engineering, help desk/desktop support, business intelligence, and IT operations for F5 Data Networks.

The company also maintains a product testing lab that is primarily of concern to quality assurance engineers. This lab itself has seen several upgrades. F5 products are rolled out internally before being launched in the market. IT works in concert with the engineers on these internal roll outs. F5 Networks also relies heavily on their data centers and there have been no plans as of yet for virtualization.

Corporate history[edit]
F5 Networks, originally named F5 Labs,[3] was established in 1996.[4] The company name was inspired by the 1996 movie Twister, in which reference was made to the fastest and most powerful tornado on the Fujita Scale: F5.
F5's first product (launched in 1997[5]) was a load balancer called BIG-IP. When a server went down or became overloaded, BIG-IP directed traffic away from that server to other servers that could handle the load.
In June 1999, the company had its initial public offering and was listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange with symbol FFIV.[6]
In 2010 and 2011, F5 Networks was on Fortune's list of 100 Fastest-Growing Companies.[7] The company was also rated one of the top ten best-performing stocks by S&P 500 in 2010.[8] F5 was also named a Best Place to Work by online jobs and recruiting site Glassdoor in 2015 and 2016.[9]
Competitors included Cisco Systems (until 2012[10]), Citrix Systems, and Radware.
François Locoh-Donou replaced John McAdam as president and CEO on April 3, 2017.[11]
Ben Gibson hired as CMO July 20, 2016. [12]

Acquisitions[edit]

uRoam (SSL VPN vendor) for USD $25 million in 2003[13]
Magnifire WebSystems (web application firewall) for USD $29 million in 2004[14]
Swan Labs (WAN acceleration and web acceleration) for USD $43 million in 2005.[15]
Acopia Networks (file virtualization) for USD $210 million in 2007[16]
DPI intellectual property from Crescendo Networks in 2011 (amount undisclosed) [17]
Traffix Systems (Diameter protocol switching technology) in 2012 (amount undisclosed) [18]
LineRate Systems in 2013 (high-performance, software-based Load Balancer for x86 systems with node.js datapath scripting)[19]
Versafe (anti-fraud, anti-phishing, and anti-malware solutions)[20] for USD $87.7 Million in 2013[21]
Defense.Net (cloud-based DDoS mitigation service)[22] for USD $49.4 million in 2014[23]

Products[edit]
BIG-IP[edit]
F5's BIG-IP product family comprises hardware, modularized software, and virtual appliances that run the F5 TMOS operating system.[24][25] Depending on the appliance selected, one or more BIG-IP product modules can be added. Acronyms used include:

Local Traffic Manager (LTM): Local load balancing based on a full-proxy architecture.
Application Security Manager (ASM): A web application firewall.
Access Policy Manager (APM): Provides access control and authentication for HTTP and HTTPS applications.
Advanced Firewall Manager (AFM): On-premises DDoS protection, data centre firewall.
Application Acceleration Manager (AAM): Accelerates and optimizes application performance through technologies such as compression and caching.
IP Intelligence (IPI): Blocking known bad IP addresses, prevention of phishing attacks and botnets.
WebSafe: Protects against sophisticated fraud threats, leveraging advanced encryption, client-less malware detection and session behavioral analysis capabilities.
BIG-IP DNS: Distributes DNS and application requests based user, network, and cloud performance conditions.

BIG-IP history[edit]
On September 7, 2004, F5 Networks released version 9.0 of the BIG-IP software in addition to appliances to run the software. Version 9.0 also marked the introduction of the company’s TMOS architecture,[26] with significant enhancements including:

Moved from BSD to Linux to handle system management functions (disks, logging, bootup, console access, etc.)
Creation of a Traffic Management Microkernel (TMM) to directly talk to the networking hardware and handle all network activities.[25][27][28]
Creation of the standard full-proxy mode, which fully terminates network connections at the BIG-IP and establishes new connections between the BIG-IP and the member servers in a pool. This allows for optimum TCP stacks on both sides as well as the complete ability to modify traffic in either direction.

Subsequent releases enhanced performance, improves application security, and supported cloud application deployments.
BIG-IQ[edit]
F5 describes BIG-IQ as a framework for managing BIG-IP devices and application services, irrespective of their form factors (hardware, software or cloud) or deployment model (on-premises, private/public cloud or hybrid). BIG-IQ supports integration with other ecosystem participants such as public cloud providers, and orchestration engines through cloud connectors and through a set of open RESTful APIs. BIG-IQ uses a multi-tenant approach to management. This allows organizations to move closer to IT as a Service without concern that it might affect the stability or security of the services fabric.[24]
Herculon[edit]
Herculon is a product for security administrators. DDoS Hybrid Defender and SSL Orchestrator, were introduced in January 2017.
Silverline[edit]
Silverline is a cloud-based application service. Its offerings include security services such as WAF and DDoS protection services.

Corporate history[edit]
F5 Networks, originally named F5 Labs,[3] was established in 1996.[4] The company name was inspired by the 1996 movie Twister, in which reference was made to the fastest and most powerful tornado on the Fujita Scale: F5.
F5's first product (launched in 1997[5]) was a load balancer called BIG-IP. When a server went down or became overloaded, BIG-IP directed traffic away from that server to other servers that could handle the load.
In June 1999, the company had its initial public offering and was listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange with symbol FFIV.[6]
In 2010 and 2011, F5 Networks was on Fortune's list of 100 Fastest-Growing Companies.[7] The company was also rated one of the top ten best-performing stocks by S&P 500 in 2010.[8] F5 was also named a Best Place to Work by online jobs and recruiting site Glassdoor in 2015 and 2016.[9]
Competitors included Cisco Systems (until 2012[10]), Citrix Systems, and Radware.
François Locoh-Donou replaced John McAdam as president and CEO on April 3, 2017.[11]
Ben Gibson hired as CMO July 20, 2016. [12]

Acquisitions[edit]

uRoam (SSL VPN vendor) for USD $25 million in 2003[13]
Magnifire WebSystems (web application firewall) for USD $29 million in 2004[14]
Swan Labs (WAN acceleration and web acceleration) for USD $43 million in 2005.[15]
Acopia Networks (file virtualization) for USD $210 million in 2007[16]
DPI intellectual property from Crescendo Networks in 2011 (amount undisclosed) [17]
Traffix Systems (Diameter protocol switching technology) in 2012 (amount undisclosed) [18]
LineRate Systems in 2013 (high-performance, software-based Load Balancer for x86 systems with node.js datapath scripting)[19]
Versafe (anti-fraud, anti-phishing, and anti-malware solutions)[20] for USD $87.7 Million in 2013[21]
Defense.Net (cloud-based DDoS mitigation service)[22] for USD $49.4 million in 2014[23]

Products[edit]
BIG-IP[edit]
F5's BIG-IP product family comprises hardware, modularized software, and virtual appliances that run the F5 TMOS operating system.[24][25] Depending on the appliance selected, one or more BIG-IP product modules can be added. Acronyms used include:

Local Traffic Manager (LTM): Local load balancing based on a full-proxy architecture.
Application Security Manager (ASM): A web application firewall.
Access Policy Manager (APM): Provides access control and authentication for HTTP and HTTPS applications.
Advanced Firewall Manager (AFM): On-premises DDoS protection, data centre firewall.
Application Acceleration Manager (AAM): Accelerates and optimizes application performance through technologies such as compression and caching.
IP Intelligence (IPI): Blocking known bad IP addresses, prevention of phishing attacks and botnets.
WebSafe: Protects against sophisticated fraud threats, leveraging advanced encryption, client-less malware detection and session behavioral analysis capabilities.
BIG-IP DNS: Distributes DNS and application requests based user, network, and cloud performance conditions.

BIG-IP history[edit]
On September 7, 2004, F5 Networks released version 9.0 of the BIG-IP software in addition to appliances to run the software. Version 9.0 also marked the introduction of the company’s TMOS architecture,[26] with significant enhancements including:

Moved from BSD to Linux to handle system management functions (disks, logging, bootup, console access, etc.)
Creation of a Traffic Management Microkernel (TMM) to directly talk to the networking hardware and handle all network activities.[25][27][28]
Creation of the standard full-proxy mode, which fully terminates network connections at the BIG-IP and establishes new connections between the BIG-IP and the member servers in a pool. This allows for optimum TCP stacks on both sides as well as the complete ability to modify traffic in either direction.

Subsequent releases enhanced performance, improves application security, and supported cloud application deployments.
BIG-IQ[edit]
F5 describes BIG-IQ as a framework for managing BIG-IP devices and application services, irrespective of their form factors (hardware, software or cloud) or deployment model (on-premises, private/public cloud or hybrid). BIG-IQ supports integration with other ecosystem participants such as public cloud providers, and orchestration engines through cloud connectors and through a set of open RESTful APIs. BIG-IQ uses a multi-tenant approach to management. This allows organizations to move closer to IT as a Service without concern that it might affect the stability or security of the services fabric.[24]
Herculon[edit]
Herculon is a product for security administrators. DDoS Hybrid Defender and SSL Orchestrator, were introduced in January 2017.
Silverline[edit]
Silverline is a cloud-based application service. Its offerings include security services such as WAF and DDoS protection services.

Corporate history[edit]
F5 Networks, originally named F5 Labs,[3] was established in 1996.[4] The company name was inspired by the 1996 movie Twister, in which reference was made to the fastest and most powerful tornado on the Fujita Scale: F5.
F5's first product (launched in 1997[5]) was a load balancer called BIG-IP. When a server went down or became overloaded, BIG-IP directed traffic away from that server to other servers that could handle the load.
In June 1999, the company had its initial public offering and was listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange with symbol FFIV.[6]
In 2010 and 2011, F5 Networks was on Fortune's list of 100 Fastest-Growing Companies.[7] The company was also rated one of the top ten best-performing stocks by S&P 500 in 2010.[8] F5 was also named a Best Place to Work by online jobs and recruiting site Glassdoor in 2015 and 2016.[9]
Competitors included Cisco Systems (until 2012[10]), Citrix Systems, and Radware.
François Locoh-Donou replaced John McAdam as president and CEO on April 3, 2017.[11]
Ben Gibson hired as CMO July 20, 2016. [12]

Acquisitions[edit]

uRoam (SSL VPN vendor) for USD $25 million in 2003[13]
Magnifire WebSystems (web application firewall) for USD $29 million in 2004[14]
Swan Labs (WAN acceleration and web acceleration) for USD $43 million in 2005.[15]
Acopia Networks (file virtualization) for USD $210 million in 2007[16]
DPI intellectual property from Crescendo Networks in 2011 (amount undisclosed) [17]
Traffix Systems (Diameter protocol switching technology) in 2012 (amount undisclosed) [18]
LineRate Systems in 2013 (high-performance, software-based Load Balancer for x86 systems with node.js datapath scripting)[19]
Versafe (anti-fraud, anti-phishing, and anti-malware solutions)[20] for USD $87.7 Million in 2013[21]
Defense.Net (cloud-based DDoS mitigation service)[22] for USD $49.4 million in 2014[23]

Products[edit]
BIG-IP[edit]
F5's BIG-IP product family comprises hardware, modularized software, and virtual appliances that run the F5 TMOS operating system.[24][25] Depending on the appliance selected, one or more BIG-IP product modules can be added. Acronyms used include:

Local Traffic Manager (LTM): Local load balancing based on a full-proxy architecture.
Application Security Manager (ASM): A web application firewall.
Access Policy Manager (APM): Provides access control and authentication for HTTP and HTTPS applications.
Advanced Firewall Manager (AFM): On-premises DDoS protection, data centre firewall.
Application Acceleration Manager (AAM): Accelerates and optimizes application performance through technologies such as compression and caching.
IP Intelligence (IPI): Blocking known bad IP addresses, prevention of phishing attacks and botnets.
WebSafe: Protects against sophisticated fraud threats, leveraging advanced encryption, client-less malware detection and session behavioral analysis capabilities.
BIG-IP DNS: Distributes DNS and application requests based user, network, and cloud performance conditions.

BIG-IP history[edit]
On September 7, 2004, F5 Networks released version 9.0 of the BIG-IP software in addition to appliances to run the software. Version 9.0 also marked the introduction of the company’s TMOS architecture,[26] with significant enhancements including:

Moved from BSD to Linux to handle system management functions (disks, logging, bootup, console access, etc.)
Creation of a Traffic Management Microkernel (TMM) to directly talk to the networking hardware and handle all network activities.[25][27][28]
Creation of the standard full-proxy mode, which fully terminates network connections at the BIG-IP and establishes new connections between the BIG-IP and the member servers in a pool. This allows for optimum TCP stacks on both sides as well as the complete ability to modify traffic in either direction.

Subsequent releases enhanced performance, improves application security, and supported cloud application deployments.
BIG-IQ[edit]
F5 describes BIG-IQ as a framework for managing BIG-IP devices and application services, irrespective of their form factors (hardware, software or cloud) or deployment model (on-premises, private/public cloud or hybrid). BIG-IQ supports integration with other ecosystem participants such as public cloud providers, and orchestration engines through cloud connectors and through a set of open RESTful APIs. BIG-IQ uses a multi-tenant approach to management. This allows organizations to move closer to IT as a Service without concern that it might affect the stability or security of the services fabric.[24]
Herculon[edit]
Herculon is a product for security administrators. DDoS Hybrid Defender and SSL Orchestrator, were introduced in January 2017.
Silverline[edit]
Silverline is a cloud-based application service. Its offerings include security services such as WAF and DDoS protection services.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
