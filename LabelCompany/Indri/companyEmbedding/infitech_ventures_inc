Welcome to INIFITECH 
            Ventures Inc (�The Company�). INFITECH with principal 
            executive offices in Toronto, Ontario, Canada is currently applying 
            for listing on a publicly traded stock exchange. INFITECH is an 
            environmental company, whose business is to remediate, clean, and 
            remove pollution from the environment. Our focus is in the field of 
            water & wastewater treatment, and hydrocarbon remediation. The 
            Company owns the worldwide intellectual property rights and sole 
            distribution rights for a patented hydrocarbon (�WAX�) technology 
            used to control, clean, and remediate oil leakage and other forms of 
            pollution on land and water....

MORE

INFITECH�s patented 
            technology (Patent CA 2314066) is a synthetic �hot wax� mixture of 
            paraffin wax and resins to clean oil spills in still bodies of water 
            and shorelines. 
When spread onto any 
            oil spill (water or ground), the �hot wax� will instantaneously 
            solidify with the entire oil spill. A chemical reaction occurs as 
            the hydrocarbon molecules of the spill automatically bond with 
            hydrocarbon molecules of the wax. Since, they are both hydrocarbon 
            (oil), the resulting mixture is easily collected in its solid state 
            (i.e. floats on water) and taken for disposal or incineration for 
            fuel. The technology is designed so any labourer can use it and 
            unlike current mechanical methods, easily scalable and very 
            economical to use. INFITECH�s technology significantly reduces costs 
            for oil spill and dangerous materials handlers and cleans to 
            exceeding existing environmental regulations.

Wastewater is one of 
            the primary environmental concerns facing communities everywhere in 
            the world. INFITECH is currently exploring opportunities in 
            providing wastewater treatment solutions.
Specifically, 
            INFITECH is seeking exclusive distribution rights from manufacturers 
            of ultraviolet disinfection ,membrane filtration and sequencing 
            batch reactor systems.

About Us 


INFITECH Ventures Inc. was 
              incorporated on October 24, 2000 under the laws of the State of 
              Nevada. The Company was formed in order to seek business 
              opportunities in the hydrocarbon remediation and water and 
              wastewater treatment area. The Company owns the worldwide 
              intellectual property rights and sole distribution rights for a 
              patented hydrocarbon technology (Canadian Patent CA 2314066) used 
              to control, clean, and remediate oil leakage and other forms on 
              pollution on land and water. Furthermore, the Company has 
              identified three technologies which it intends to focus on in the 
              field of water and wastewater treatment. The specific technologies 
              are membrane filtration, ultraviolet disinfection and sequencing 
              batch reactors. The Company will also investigate other applicable 
              technologies to service the needs of its customers. 
 

The Company plans to develop a 
              business for its WAX technology and potential acquire product 
              lines fro specific wastewater technologies through license 
              agreements and marketing arrangements with established suppliers. 
              Thus far, the Company is in its developmental stage and its 
              activities to date have been restricted to raising initial capital 
              for general corporate purposes and developing its business 
              strategy.

INFITECH�s patented 
              technology (Canadian Patent CA 2314066) is a synthetic �hot wax� 
              mixture of paraffin wax and resins to clean oil spills in still 
              bodies of water and shorelines.



When spread onto 
              any oil spill (water or ground), the �hot wax� will 
              instantaneously solidify with the entire oil spill.  A chemical 
              reaction occurs as the hydrocarbons molecules of the spill 
              automatically bond with hydrocarbon molecules of the wax.  Since, 
              they are both hydrocarbon (oil), the resulting mixture is easily 
              collected in its solid state (i.e. floats on water) and taken for 
              disposal or incineration for fuel.  The technology is designed so 
              any labourer can use it and unlike current mechanical methods, 
              easily scalable and very economical to use.  INFITECH�s technology 
              significantly reduces costs for oil spill and dangerous materials 
              handlers and cleans to exceeding existing environmental 
              regulations.  



The technology is 
              clearly either a replacement or complementary technology to the 
              existing method or procedures.  By spraying on a coat of hot wax, 
              like you spray paint a car, respondents save money and precious 
              time.  



            How it works


1.  The hot wax is poured 
              or sprayed onto the spilled oil.

 


 

 

               

               

2.  The �hot wax� adheres 
              physically and chemically to the oil in a liquid state.








               

               

3.  The �hot wax� and oil 
              solidify and can be collected for disposal or recycling.

	NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS





	(Expressed in United States Dollars)




	April 30, 2016




	(Unaudited)




	 









	1.





	HISTORY AND ORGANIZATION OF THE COMPANY






	 


	 







	Infitech Ventures Inc. (the Company) was incorporated
	on October 24, 2000 under the Laws of the State of Nevada. The Company
	intended to develop and market a wax technology relating to the process of
	solidifying and removing spilled oil on land and water. The Company is
	currently exploring new business opportunities. All of the Companys
	assets are held in Canada.





	 


	 







	All amounts are stated in United States dollars unless
	otherwise noted.





	 


	 





	2.





	GOING CONCERN






	 


	 







	These financial statements have been prepared in
	conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
	States of America with the on-going assumption that the Company will be
	able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal
	course of business. However, certain conditions noted below currently
	exist which raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to
	continue as a going concern.





	 


	 







	The operations of the Company have primarily been funded
	by the issuance of common stock and funding from related parties.
	Continued operations of the Company are dependent on the Companys ability
	to complete equity financings or generate profitable operations in the
	future. Managements plan in this regard is to secure additional funds
	through future equity sales. Such sales may not be available or may not be
	available on reasonable terms.





	 


	 







	There can be no assurance the Company will be able to
	continue to raise funds in which case the Company may be unable to meet
	its obligations. Should the Company be unable to realize economic benefit
	from its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of
	business, the net realizable value of assets may be materially less than
	the amounts recorded on the balance sheets. These financial statements do
	not include any adjustments to the amounts and classifications of assets
	and liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to
	continue as a going concern.





	 


	 







	The current market conditions and volatility increase the
	uncertainty of the Companys ability to continue as a going concern given
	the need to both curtail expenditures and to raise additional funds. The
	Company is experiencing, and has experienced, negative operating cash
	flows. The Company will continue to search for new or alternate sources of
	financing but anticipates that the current market conditions may impact
	the ability to source such funds.

	SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES






	 


	 







	The significant accounting policies adopted by the
	Company are as follows:





	 


	 








	Generally accepted accounting principles






	 


	 







	The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been
	prepared by the Company in conformity with accounting principles generally
	accepted in the United States of America applicable to interim financial
	information and with the rules and regulations of the United States
	Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, certain information and
	note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in
	accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been
	condensed, or omitted, pursuant to such rules and regulations. In the
	opinion of Management, the unaudited interim financial statements include
	all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the results of the
	interim periods presented. All adjustments are of a normal recurring
	nature, except as otherwise noted below. These financial statements should
	be read in conjunction with the Companys audited consolidated financial
	statements and notes thereto for the year ended July 31, 2015, included in
	the Companys Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange
	Commission. The results of operations for the interim periods are not
	necessarily indicative of the results of operations for any other interim
	period or for a full fiscal year.

	SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (contd)






	 


	 








	Use of estimates






	 


	 







	These financial statements have been prepared in
	conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
	States of America. The preparation of financial statements in conformity
	with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of
	America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
	the reported amount of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of
	contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
	and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting
	period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.





	 


	 








	Foreign currency translation






	 


	 







	Transaction amounts denominated in foreign currencies are
	translated at exchange rates prevailing at transaction dates. Carrying
	values of monetary assets and liabilities are adjusted at each balance
	sheet date to reflect the exchange rate at that date. Non-monetary assets
	and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate on the original
	transaction date. Gains and losses from restatement of foreign currency
	monetary assets and liabilities are included in the statements of
	operations. Revenues and expenses are translated at the rates of exchange
	prevailing on the dates such items are recognized in the statement of
	operations.





	 


	 








	Cash and cash equivalents






	 


	 







	The Company considers cash held at banks and all highly
	liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be
	cash and cash equivalents. At April 30, 2016 and July 31, 2015, the
	Company did not hold any cash equivalents.





	 


	 








	Accounting for impairment of long-lived assets and for
	long-lived assets to be disposed of






	 


	 







	Long-lived assets to be held and used by the Company are
	continually reviewed to determine whether any events or changes in
	circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be
	recoverable.





	 


	 







	For long-lived assets to be held and used, the Company
	bases its evaluation on such impairment indicators as the nature of the
	assets, the future economic benefit of the assets, any historical or
	future profitability measurements, as well as other external market
	conditions or factors that may be present. In the event that facts and
	circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
	recoverable and an estimate of future undiscounted cash flows is less than
	the carrying amount of an asset, an impairment loss will be
	recognized.





	 


	 








	Contributed executive services






	 


	 







	The Company is required to report all costs of conducting
	its business. Accordingly, the Company records the fair value of
	contributed executive services provided to the Company at no cost as
	compensation expense, with a corresponding increase to additional paid-in
	capital, in the year in which the services are provided.





	 


	 







	For each of the nine month periods ended April 30, 2016
	and 2015 the Company recorded contributed executive services in the amount
	of $45,000.

	SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (contd)






	 


	 








	Income taxes






	 


	 







	A deferred tax asset or liability is recorded for all
	temporary differences between financial and tax reporting and net
	operating loss carry forwards. Deferred tax expenses (benefit) result from
	the net change during the period of deferred tax assets and liabilities.
	Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the
	opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all
	of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and
	liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates
	on the date of enactment.





	 


	 








	Net loss per share






	 


	 







	Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss
	attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of
	shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per
	share takes into consideration shares of common stock outstanding
	(computed under basic net loss per share) and potentially dilutive shares
	of common stock.





	 


	 








	Recent accounting pronouncements






	 


	 







	Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-10 Development Stage
	Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting
	Requirements is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after
	December 15, 2014. The adoption of the update will allow the Company to
	remove the inception to date information and all references to development
	stage. The Company has evaluated this update and has early adopted
	beginning with the period ended January 31, 2015.





	 


	 







	There are no other recent accounting pronouncements which
	are expected to have a material effect on the Companys financial
	statements.

	CAPITAL STOCK






	 


	 







	Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each
	share held. There are no restrictions that limit the Company's ability to
	pay dividends on its common stock. The Company has not declared any
	dividends since incorporation.





	 


	 





	5.





	RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS






	 


	 







	At April 30, 2016, there is $261,650 (July 31, 2015-
	$230,543) due to a director and shareholder of the Company. The amounts
	are unsecured, non-interest bearing and are due on demand.





	 


	 







	For each of nine month periods ended April 30, 2016 and
	2015 the Company accrued rent of $1,800 to a director of the Company. Rent
	is accrued on a month to month basis. At April 30, 2016 there is $30,600
	(July 31, 2015 - $28,800) payable to a related party with respect to rent
	payable.





	 


	 







	For each of the nine month periods ended April 30, 2016
	and 2015 there was $45,000 in contributed executive services recorded in
	additional paid in capital in relation to services of the Companys sole
	director.





	 


	 







	These transactions were in the normal course of
	operations and were measured at the exchange value which represents the
	amount of consideration established and agreed to by the related
	parties.

	SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW DISCLOSURE






	 


	 







	During the nine month periods ended April 30, 2016 and

	services which was recorded as additional paid in capital.

	FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS






	 


	 







	The Company classifies financial assets and liabilities
	as held-for-trading, available-for-sale, held-to-maturity, loans and
	receivables or other financial liabilities depending on their nature.
	Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized at fair value on
	their initial recognition, except for those arising from certain related
	party transactions which are accounted for at the transferors carrying
	amount or exchange amount.





	 


	 







	Financial assets and liabilities classified as
	held-for-trading are measured at fair value, with gains and losses
	recognized in net income. Financial assets classified as held-to-maturity,
	loans and receivables, and financial liabilities other than those
	classified as held-for-trading are measured at amortized cost, using the
	effective interest method of amortization. Financial assets classified as
	available-for-sale are measured at fair value, with unrealized gains and
	losses being recognized as other comprehensive income until realized, or
	if an unrealized loss is considered other than temporary, the unrealized
	loss is recorded in income.





	 


	 







	Financial instruments measured at fair value are
	classified into one of three levels in the fair value hierarchy according
	to the relative reliability of the inputs used to estimate the fair
	values. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy
	are:








	 


	



	Level 1  Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for
	identical assets or liabilities;





	 


	



	Level 2  Inputs other than quoted prices that are
	observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly; and





	 


	



	Level 3  Inputs that are not based on observable market
	data.











	Cash is classified as held for trading, and is measured
	at fair value using Level 1 inputs. Accounts payable and accrued
	liabilities, accounts payable and accrued liabilities  related party, and
	due to related parties are classified as other financial liabilities, and
	have a fair value approximating their carrying value, due to their
	short-term nature.





	 


	 







	Unless otherwise noted, it is managements opinion that
	the Company is not exposed to significant interest, currency or credit
	risks arising from these financial instruments.

	SUBSEQUENT EVENTS






	 


	 







	On May 26, 2016, a loan was granted from a director and
	shareholder of the Company for $4,000. The amount is unsecured,
	non-interest bearing and is due on demand.





	 


	 







	On May 26, 2016, a loan was granted from a director and
	shareholder of the Company for $1,594 (Cdn $2,000). The amount is

	FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS



	Certain statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form
	10-Q constitute "forward-looking statements." These statements, identified by
	words such as plan, "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "should," "expect"
	and similar expressions include our expectations and objectives regarding our
	future financial position, operating results and business strategy. These
	statements reflect the current views of management with respect to future events
	and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our
	actual results, performance or achievements, or industry results, to be
	materially different from those described in the forward-looking statements.
	Such risks and uncertainties include those set forth under the caption Part II
	 Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. We do not
	intend to update the forward-looking information to reflect actual results or
	changes in the factors affecting such forward-looking information. We advise you
	to carefully review the reports and documents, particularly our Annual Reports,
	our Quarterly Reports and our Current Reports we file from time to time with the
	United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). Copies of all of
	our filings with the SEC may be accessed by visiting the SEC site
	(http://www.sec.gov) and performing a search of our electronic filings.



	INTRODUCTION



	The following discussion and analysis summarizes our results of
	operations for the three and nine months ended April 30, 2016, and changes in
	our financial condition from July 31, 2015. This discussion should be read in
	conjunction with the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
	and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
	fiscal year ended July 31, 2015 filed with the SEC on October 29, 2015.



	OVERVIEW



	We were incorporated on October 24, 2000 under the laws of the
	State of Nevada for the purpose of seeking business opportunities with respect
	to environmental technologies and products.


	Our business revolves around the development and marketing of a
	proprietary technology (the Wax Technology) that uses a molten wax compound
	consisting of paraffin wax and resins to control, clean and remediate oil and
	other liquid fuel spills on land and water. In addition, as part of our
	long-term business plan, we intend to pursue business opportunities in
	wastewater treatment solutions.


	We continue to require additional financing if we are to
	continue as a going concern and to finance our business operations. As of April
	30, 2016, we had cash on hand of $487. If we are not able to acquire sufficient
	financing in the near future, our business could fail and investors could lose
	their investment.

	Revenues



	We have not earned any revenues to date and we do not

	Our operating expenses increased during the three months ended
	April 30, 2016. Our operating expenses increased during the three months ended
	April 30, 2016 because of an increase in foreign exchange loss. The increase in
	operating expenses was partially offset by decreases in office expenses and
	professional fees.


	Our operating expenses increased during the nine months ended
	April 30, 2016. Our operating expenses increased because we recorded foreign
	exchange loss as compared to a foreign exchange gain during the previous period.
	The increase in operating expenses was partially offset by decreases in office
	expenses and professional fees.


	We are required to report all costs of conducting our business.
	As such, we have recorded as an expense the fair market value of contributed
	executive services provided to us at no cost. We recorded contributed executive
	services of $5,000 per month. These services are provided to us at no charge and
	a corresponding increase in additional paid-in capital has been recorded.


	If we are able to obtain sufficient financing to proceed with
	our plan of operation, of which there is no assurance, we expect that our
	expenses will increase significantly as we engage in product and business
	development activities.

	Our only sources of financing for the nine month period ended
	April 30, 2016 was an increase in amounts due to related parties.


	Our plan of operation calls for us to spend significantly more
	than our current capital resources or the amount of financing that we have been
	able to obtain to date. As such, there is a substantial doubt that we will be
	able to raise significant financing to complete our stated plan of operation.
	Any substantial financing that we are able to obtain is expected to be in the
	form of equity financing.


	To date, we have relied on short term loans from our sole
	executive officer and director and private placement sales of our equity
	securities in order to finance our ongoing activities and to meet our
	outstanding financial obligations. There is no assurance that we will be able to
	continue to obtain financing from these sources in the future. Our sole
	executive officer and director could refuse to provide us with any additional
	financing and we may not be able to find suitable investors willing to purchase
	our equity securities. If we are unable to obtain financing, our business could
	fail and shareholders could lose some or all of their investment.


	During the nine months ended April 30, 2016, we received loans
	of $18,500 and CAD $13,000 from Paul G. Daly, our sole director and executive
	officer. On May 26, 2016 we received loans of USD $4,000 and CAD $2,000 from
	Paul G. Daly. All of the loans are unsecured, non-interest bearing and due on
	demand. The form of promissory note used for the loans is attached as Exhibit
	10.3 to this current report on Form 10-Q.



	OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS



	We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have
	or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
	condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of
	operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is
	material to stockholders.



	CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES



	The financial statements presented with this Quarterly Report
	have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
	in the United States of America for interim financial information. These
	financial statements do not include all information and footnote disclosures
	required for an annual set of financial statements prepared under United States
	generally accepted accounting principles. In the opinion of our management, all
	adjustments (consisting solely of normal recurring accruals) considered
	necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, results of
	operations and cash flows as at April 30, 2016, and for all periods presented in
	the attached financial statements, have been included. Interim results for the
	quarter ended April 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that
	may be expected for the fiscal year as a whole.


	We have identified certain accounting policies, described
	below, that are most important to the portrayal of our current financial
	condition and results of operations. Our significant accounting policies are
	disclosed in the notes to the interim financial statements included with this
	Quarterly Report.




	Foreign Currency Translation






	Transaction amounts denominated in foreign currencies are
	translated at exchange rates prevailing at transaction dates. Carrying values of
	monetary assets and liabilities are adjusted at each balance sheet date to reflect the exchange rate at that date. Non-monetary assets
	and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate on the original transaction
	date. Gains and losses from restatement of foreign currency monetary assets and
	liabilities are included in the consolidated statements of operations. Revenues
	and expenses are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates
	such items are recognized in the statement of operations.

	Contributed Executive Services




	We are required to report all costs of conducting our business.
	Accordingly, we record the fair value of contributed executive services provided
	to us at no cost as compensation expense, with a corresponding increase to
	additional paid-in capital, in the year in which the services are provided.

	CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.



	Under the supervision and with the participation of our
	management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
	we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as
	required by Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) as of January 31, 2016
	(Evaluation Date). Based upon that evaluation our Chief Executive Officer and
	Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
	were not effective as of the Evaluation Date as a result of the material
	weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting discussed in our Annual
	Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2015 (the 2015 Annual Report).


	Notwithstanding the assessment that our internal controls over
	financial reporting were not effective and that there were material weaknesses
	as identified in our 2015 Annual Report, we believe that our financial
	statements contained in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter
	ended April 30, 2016 report fairly present our financial condition, results of
	operations and cash flows in all material respects.



	Changes in Internal Controls



	There were no changes in our internal control over financial
	reporting during the fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2016 that have materially
	affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
	control over financial reporting.







	PART II - OTHER INFORMATION






	ITEM
	1.               
	LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.



	We are not a party to any other legal proceedings and, to our
	knowledge, no other legal proceedings are pending, threatened or
	contemplated.








	ITEM
	1A.             RISK
	FACTORS.



	The following are some of the important factors that could
	affect our financial performance or could cause actual results to differ
	materially from estimates contained in our forward-looking statements. We may
	encounter risks in addition to those described below. Additional risks and
	uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be
	immaterial, may also impair or adversely affect our business, financial
	condition or results of operation.




	Need For Financing






	We do not currently have the financial resources to complete
	our plan of operation for the next twelve months. We anticipate that we will
	require financing in the amount of $750,000 in order to fund our plan of
	operation over the next twelve months. We presently do not have any sufficient
	financing arrangements in place and there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain
	sufficient financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If further financing
	is not available, our ability to meet our financial obligations and pursue our
	plan of operation will be substantially limited. If we are not able to meet our
	financial obligations as they come due, our business could fail and investors
	could lose a substantial portion or all of their investment.


	6








	Limited Operating History, Risks Of A New Business
	Venture




	We were incorporated on October 24, 2000 and, prior to our
	acquisition of the Wax Technology, we had been involved primarily in
	organizational activities and in seeking business opportunities related to
	environmental technologies and products. We have not earned any revenues to
	date.


	Potential investors should be aware of the difficulties
	normally encountered by a new enterprise and the high rate of failure of such
	enterprises. The potential for future success must be considered in light of the
	problems, expenses, difficulties complications and delays encountered in
	connection with the development of a business in the area in which we intend to
	operate and in connection with the formation and commencement of operations of a
	new business in general. These include, but are not limited to, unanticipated
	problems relating to research and development programs, marketing, approvals by
	government agencies, competition and additional costs and expenses that may
	exceed current estimates. There is no history upon which to base any assumption
	as to the likelihood that our business will prove successful, and there can be
	no assurance that we will generate any operating revenues or ever achieve
	profitable operations.




	Our Operations Will Be Subject To Extensive Government
	Regulations




	Our operations will be subject to extensive government
	regulations in the United States, Canada and in other countries in which we may
	operate. In order to sell our anticipated products, we may be required to obtain
	a number of regulatory approvals at the federal, state and local level,
	including the approval of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and
	Environment Canada. We may incur material costs or liabilities in obtaining such
	approvals and/or complying with applicable laws and regulations. Furthermore,
	our potential customers may be required to comply with numerous laws and
	regulations when engaging in environmental remediation activities. There can be
	no assurance that we will be able to successfully comply with all present or
	future government regulations. An inability to obtain necessary regulatory
	approvals or the imposition of onerous conditions on the use of our anticipated
	products will have a materially adverse effect on us, our business and our
	financial condition.




	Our Business Operations, Assets and Personnel Are Located
	Outside The United States




	Although we are incorporated in the United States, all of our
	current operating activities are conducted in, and all of our assets and
	personnel are located in, Canada. As such, investors in our securities may
	experience difficulty in enforcing judgments or liabilities against the Company
	or our personnel under United States securities laws.


	As a Nevada corporation, we are subject to the laws of the
	United States, including the federal securities laws of the United States, and
	to the jurisdiction of United States courts. As such, investors may bring
	proceedings against us, and enforce judgments obtained against us, in United
	States courts.


	Generally, original actions to enforce liabilities under United
	States federal securities laws may not be brought in a Canadian court. Such
	actions must be brought in a court in the United States with applicable
	jurisdiction. Persons obtaining judgments against us in United States courts,
	including judgments obtained under United States federal securities laws, will
	then be required to bring an application in a Canadian court to enforce such
	judgments in Canada.




	Competition Is Intense And We May Be Unable To Achieve
	Market Acceptance




	The business environment in which we intend to operate is
	highly competitive. Currently, there exist a number of established methods,
	products and technologies used to control, clean and remediate oil spills and we
	expect to experience competition from a number of established companies involved
	in the environmental remediation industry. Certain of our potential competitors will
	have greater technical, financial, marketing, sales and other resources than us.


	7






	In addition, while the environmental remediation industry is a
	mature one, there is no established market for products utilizing our Wax
	Technology. We are unable to provide assurances that our target customers and
	markets will accept our technologies or will purchase our products and services
	in sufficient quantities to achieve profitability. If a significant market fails
	to develop or develops more slowly than we anticipate, we may be unable to
	recover the losses incurred to develop products and we may be unable to meet our
	operational expenses. Acceptance of our anticipated products by environmental
	remediation firms and other organizations will depend upon a number of factors,
	including the cost competitiveness of our products, customer reluctance to try
	new products or services, regulatory requirements or the emergence of more
	competitive or effective products.




	Asserting And Defending Intellectual Property Rights May
	Impact The Results Of Our Operations




	We had applied for a patent from the CIPO, however, we did not
	receive a final grant of patent from the CIPO, and we have decided to abandon
	our patent application at this time. As patent applications are publicly
	available documents, competitors may be able to copy the formulations set out in
	our patent application. Due to our limited financial resources, we do not expect
	to apply for patent protection for any new developments that we make to the Wax
	Technology. As a result, in order to protect future developments, we will need
	to maintain the secrecy of our formulations and the methods we use. If we are
	unable to maintain the secrecy of those developments, then competitors may be
	able to copy our formulations and methodology, which would have a material
	adverse effect on our business.




	Dependence On Key Personnel






	Our success will largely depend on the performance of our
	directors and officers and our key consultants. Our success will also depend on
	our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical, research,
	management, regulatory compliance, sales and marketing personnel. Competition
	for such personnel is intense. The loss of the services of such personnel or the
	inability to attract and retain other key personnel could impair the development
	of our business, operating results and financial condition.




	Our Stock is a Penny Stock




	Because our stock is a penny stock, shareholders will be more
	limited in their ability to sell their stock. The SEC has adopted rules that
	regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny
	stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than
	$5.00, other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges
	or quoted on the Nasdaq system, provided that current price and volume
	information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the
	exchange or quotation system. Because our securities constitute penny stocks
	within the meaning of the rules, the rules apply to us and to our securities.
	The rules may further affect the ability of owners of shares to sell our
	securities in any market that might develop for them. As long as the trading
	price of our common stock is less than $5.00 per share, the common stock will be
	subject to Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act. The penny stock rules require a
	broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock, to deliver a
	standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC, that:




	1.



	contains a description of the nature and level of risk in
	the market for penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary
	trading;





	 


	 




	2.



	contains a description of the brokers or dealers duties
	to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer
	with respect to a violation to such duties or other requirements of
	securities laws;





	 


	 




	3.



	contains a brief, clear, narrative description of a
	dealer market, including bid and ask prices for penny stocks and the
	significance of the spread between the bid and ask price;





	 


	 




	4.



	contains a toll-free telephone number for inquiries on
	disciplinary actions;





	8









	5.



	defines significant terms in the disclosure document or
	in the conduct of trading in penny stocks; and





	 


	 




	6.



	contains such other information and is in such form,
	including language, type, size and format, as the SEC shall require by
	rule or regulation.





	The broker-dealer also must provide, prior to effecting any
	transaction in a penny stock, the customer with: (a) bid and offer quotations
	for the penny stock; (b) the compensation of the broker-dealer and its
	salesperson in the transaction; (c) the number of shares to which such bid and
	ask prices apply, or other comparable information relating to the depth and
	liquidity of the market for such stock; and (d) a monthly account statements
	showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customers account. In
	addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny
	stock not otherwise exempt from those rules; the broker-dealer must make a
	special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for
	the purchaser and receive the purchasers written acknowledgment of the receipt
	of a risk disclosure statement, a written agreement to transactions involving
	penny stocks, and a signed and dated copy of a written suitably statement. These
	disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in
	the secondary market for our stock.

BUSINESS.




General

We were
incorporated on October 24, 2000 under the laws of the State of
Nevada for the purpose of seeking business opportunities with
respect to environmental technologies and products.

Our
business revolves around the development and marketing of a
proprietary technology (the “Wax Technology”) that uses
a molten wax compound consisting of paraffin wax and resins to
control, clean and remediate oil and other liquid fuel spills on
land and water. In addition, as part of our long-term business
plan, we intend to pursue business opportunities in wastewater
treatment solutions.

We
continue to require additional financing if we are to continue as a
going concern and to finance our business operations. As of July
31, 2010, we had cash of $925. If we are not able to acquire
sufficient financing in the near future, our business could fail
and investors could lose their investment.

THE WAX
TECHNOLOGY

The Wax
Technology utilizes a wax compound made up of a proprietary mixture
of paraffin wax and synthetic resins to control and clean oil
spills on land, still bodies of water and shorelines. The wax
compound is heated to a liquid state and the molten wax compound is
then sprayed on top of the oil spill in a manner similar to spray
painting a car. Once the wax compound comes into contact with the
oil spill, whether the spill is on water or the ground, the wax
instantaneously solidifies. A chemical reaction occurs as the
hydrocarbon molecules present in the oil spill automatically bond
with the hydrocarbon molecules present in the wax. The result is a
solidified mixture that floats and which can then be easily
collected. The collected wax/oil mixture can then be reprocessed,
recycled by separating the oil from the wax, and reused. The Wax
Technology is designed for easy use by any laborer, significantly
reduces the costs and dangers associated with existing remediation
methods and cleans to existing environmental standards.

Previous
formulations of the Wax Technology utilized high grade petroleum
based waxes blended with polyethylene. However, due to high
petroleum prices, our management has decided to focus on lower cost
lower melt point waxes at this time.

PRODUCT
DEVELOPMENT AND PLANNED WAX APPLICATIONS

Currently,
we intend to market different formulations of the Wax Technology
for use on:

 




(a)



Large and
small still water, shoreline and inland water oil
spills;





(b)



Large and
small inland oil spills;




3

 
 

 




(c)



Industrial/commercial
factory oil spills; and





(d)



Consumer
inland oil spills.




Our
product development work to date has focused primarily on adjusting
the formulation of the wax itself, choosing waxes of different melt
points for specific applications, and experimenting with waxes with
different melt points and with different methods of application.
When conducting our development work, consideration is given
to:

 




 



(1)



Expected
weather conditions and season of the year;





 



(2)



Type of
oil spilled (e.g. bunker, diesel, gasoline, etc.);





 



(3)



Whether
the spill is on land or water;





 



(4)



Method to
be used to retrieve the spent solid wax/oil mixture;





 



(5)



Nature of
the terrain (e.g. sandy beach vs. rocky shoreline); and





 



(6)



Application
method and equipment.




By
varying the formulation of wax and synthetic resins and the melting
point of the wax, we are able to vary the structural strength of
the wax, its rigidity, its elasticity and its adhesive qualities.
Our tests have shown that paraffin waxes with a mid-range melt
point and a higher ratio of resins to wax are better suited for
treating oil coated beaches during summer climate conditions. The
mixture is heated in a container to 350°F and sprayed onto the
oil using a flare-jet nozzle 18 inches above the sand surface.
Gravity feed is all that is required for this application. The
resin speeds up the setting process and helps render the wax/oil
residual less sticky to handle and prevents clogging in the
application equipment.

When
treating oil spills on still water such as lakes, ponds or tide
pools, paraffin waxes having a lower range melt point and with a
lower ratio of resins to wax provide better results. This wax
formulation works well when used in conjunction with a synthetic
mesh netting used to retrieve the wax/oil residual. A flood nozzle
with a gravity feed would be used to apply this wax
formulation.

When
spraying cliffs or rocks, a formulation has been developed to
minimize the adhesive quality of the wax. This allows the
solidifying wax to flow down the face of the cliff and collect at
the base, increasing the efficiency of collecting the wax/oil
residual. This hot wax formulation would be sprayed on the rocks
using a flare jet nozzle of 5 to 10 psi of pressure.

Heavier
oils such as Bunker B or Bunker C oil require higher pressure
application to penetrate the thick viscous oil layer, regardless of
whether the oil is spilled on land or water. Our tests have shown
that a midrange melt point wax with a low ratio of resins to wax to
be more effective in cleaning up this type of oil. This wax
formulation can then be applied at increased pressures depending on
the depth and viscosity of the oil layer and the ambient
temperature.

PROTOTYPE
AND FIELD TESTING

Prototypes
of the Wax Technology have been field tested in a handful of
cases.

In 1974,
an oil spill occurred around the shores of the ecologically
sensitive Passage Island, located at the entrance to Howe Sound off
the coast of British Columbia, Canada. The spilled oil occupied an
area measuring approximately 450 feet long by 40 feet wide.
Environment Canada commissioned the Wax Technology’s
inventor, William Nelson, to clean the shoreline of Passage Island
using an early prototype of the Wax Technology. The prototype wax
formulation was sprayed on the contaminated area under low tide
conditions and all residual oil was removed within three days using
a crew of three men. Environment Canada inspected the shoreline
area after the clean up with a team of marine biologists who
verified that all oil and residual wax had been removed from the
area. The cleanup was conducted over a three day period with a crew
of three men working 12 hours per day. The equipment used consisted
of 5x50 gallon steel drums used to heat and store the wax and three
small spray containers for dispensing the wax onto the oil spill.
The oil spill was contained and removed from the shoreline using
approximately 2,000 pounds of wax. The total cost of the clean up
was approximately $2,000. In conducting the clean up at Passage
Island, the following deficiencies were identified and
addressed:

4

 
 

 




 



(1)



It was
observed that, when applying the wax to rocks with uneven or rough
surfaces, not all of the oil was removed. As a result, the wax is
now applied under pressure in order to dislodge oil located in
pockets and rock crevices.





 



 



 





 



(2)



It was
observed that, when applying the wax to oil resting in tidal areas,
in some cases, the wax was not fully congealed prior to the tide
coming back in. We addressed this issue by adding various resins to
the wax compound which has reduced the solidification
time.




In 1979,
Mr. Nelson conducted a demonstration of an early prototype of the
Wax Technology for the U.S. Coast Guard. The demonstration was
conducted on the actual Capeche Oil Spill which was caused by a
crude oil pipe fracture. The demonstration was conducted in an area
measuring approximately 30 feet long by 20 feet wide and removed
all of the oil spilled in this area. The spill was on both water
and land and was cleaned up by two men using approximately 10
gallons of wax. The oil was completely removed from the spill area
within one hour. The heated wax was applied by using a steel pail
to contain the wax, which was then poured over the spilled oil. The
total cost of the clean up was approximately $100.

In 1981,
Mr. Nelson conducted another demonstration of a prototype of the
Wax Technology for the U.S. Coast Guard in Honolulu, Hawaii. The
Wax Technology was tested on a tidal waters area containing sand,
rocks and water and measuring approximately 12 feet long by 5 feet
wide. Mr. Nelson was able to remove all of the oil from this area
using the Wax Technology prototype. The oil spill was contained and
removed within one hour by Mr. Nelson and an assistant from the
U.S. Coast Guard using three gallons of the Wax Technology
prototype. The total cost of the field trial, including preparation
time, was approximately $125.

Demonstrations
of the Wax Technology were conducted for Ontario Hydro in 1989,
1990, 1992 and 1994. The tests were conducted on both land and
inland waters on No. 2 fuel oil, turbine oil, lubricating oil,
thermal oil, transformer oil, crude oil, bunker oil, diesel fuel
and gasoline. The demonstrations were conducted at the Lennox TGS
in Bath, Ontario, Canada. One of these demonstrations was used to
clean up an actual oil spill over a land area measuring
approximately 40 feet by 30 feet. The prototype wax formulation was
successfully used to clean this area as well as machinery and
staircases affected by the oil spill. This oil spill was cleaned up
over a four hour period by two men using approximately 15 gallons
of the Wax Technology at a cost of approximately $400. Other
demonstrations were typically conducted by Mr. Nelson on areas
measuring 5 feet by 10 feet over a one hour period using
approximately one gallon of the Wax Technology. Each trial cost
approximately $100.

In 1989,
Mr. Nelson conducted a demonstration of the Wax Technology in the
Toronto Harbour for the Toronto Harbour Commission and the Canadian
Coast Guard. A mixture of diesel fuel and crude oil was spilled
into a cordoned area of the harbour measuring approximately 20 feet
by 15 feet. Two men using approximately five gallons of the
prototype wax formulation removed the spilled oil within one hour
at a cost of approximately $250. The wax compound was contained in
a 15 gallon steel drum that was then heated using a propane torch.
The heated wax was then poured over the spilled oil, which was then
completely entrained in the wax and completely removed upon
solidification.

In May of
2004, we engaged Bodycote Materials Testing Canada Inc.
(“Bodycote”), an independent testing facility, to
examine the effectiveness of the Wax Technology. In the Bodycote
experiment, a one centimeter thick layer of crude oil was poured on
top of water lying in a large bath container with a surface area of
approximately 10 square feet. The hot wax compound was then poured
onto the oil surface until the entire surface area had been
covered. According to Bodycote’s results, the molten wax
compound absorbed approximately 40% of its own weight in crude oil.
As the layer of spilled oil was relatively thin, pouring the wax
compound over the spilled oil was sufficient to encapsulate the oil
through the water surface. If the layer of oil had been two to
three inches thick, the wax compound would have been sprayed under
pressure in order to penetrate the oil surface to the oil-water
interface.

COMPETITION

There are
a number of existing and established technologies and techniques
currently being used to clean oil spills and with which our Wax
Technology would compete. Some of the techniques currently used in
the industry include:

5

 
 

 




(a)



Mechanical
Recovery and Containment :
Mechanical recovery and containment techniques utilize floating
booms to contain oil spills on water. These booms must be towed by
boats or other vessels in an effort to contain the spilled oil. The
oil is then collected by skimmers which remove oil and water from
the surface or by vacuum hoses which suck the oil and water from
the surface. The major limitation of mechanical containment
techniques is that they require the coordination of a number of
boats and vessels in order to surround and contain the oil spill,
which will naturally tend to disperse under the influence of waves
and currents. Generally the use of mechanical containment
techniques will require extensive logistical support. Further,
because the booms must be towed by boats, the ability to use booms
in shallow inshore waters is limited. In addition, as the oil
weathers and changes viscosity, the pumps and skimmers being used
may need to be changed, increasing the costs and time of recovery.
Finally, once the oil recovery is completed, the booms, skimmers
and vacuums must be cleaned, overhauled and repaired for use on the
next oil spill.





 



 





(b)



Chemical
Dispersants :
Dispersion of an oil spill will naturally occur when waves and
other turbulence at the water surface causes the oil to break into
tiny droplets and disperse into the surrounding water. Chemical
solvents in applied dispersants are used to accelerate this process
of physical and chemical break down. The dispersants are usually
sprayed onto the oil spill using boats or airplanes. The primary
disadvantage of chemical dispersants is that they involve the
deliberate introduction into the environment of additional chemical
pollutants. In open sea waters, the dispersal rate of the chemicals
is relatively high and concentrations of the chemicals after
introduction are unlikely to be high enough to produce adverse
effects. However, on still/calm waters and in shallow shore waters
where water exchange is poor, higher concentrations may persist for
long periods and may themselves present environmental
dangers.





 



 





(c)



In Situ
Burning : In situ
burning involves intentionally setting the oil spill ablaze in
order to burn the oil off the surface. Customarily, in situ burning
on water involves corralling the oil using booms and setting it
ablaze using flares, explosives or lasers. The oil fire then burns
until the fuel runs out or conditions favorable to combustion
change. Burning can pose a number of logistical problems in
addition to the obvious safety concern associated with a large oil
fire. Ignition of the oil can be problematic depending upon the
amount of dispersal which has occurred and the type of oil spilled.
In order to maintain the oil burn, the layer of oil on the surface
generally needs to be at least two to three millimeters thick. As a
result of naturally occurring dispersion, booms will often need to
be used in order to concentrate the oil. In addition, as the more
combustible elements of the oil burn off, the cooling effects of
the wind and sea may eventually extinguish the fire, leaving a
significant quantity of oil unburned. Vast quantities of smoke can
also be produced by in situ burning, threatening nearby
populations. If it rains during the burning, the smoke can result
in oily rain falling as far as 80 kilometers away. Finally, burning
can leave a viscous, toxic residue which may sink or otherwise be
difficult to recover.





 



 





(d)



Sorbents/Tissues
: Sorbents
or tissues may be used to wipe, absorb or adsorb the oil from the
surface of the water or from the land. A variety of natural or
synthetic materials may be used as absorbing agents. Each of these
materials has a number of advantages and disadvantages. Generally,
the size of the crews required to apply traditional sorbents grows
exponentially with the size of the oil spill. Also, spent sorbents
do not continue to collect much oil and must be disposed of or
incinerated at special hazardous materials sites.




Based on
our prototype tests and on field tests of the Wax Technology
conducted by Mr. Nelson, we believe that our Wax Technology will
provide distinct advantages over existing techniques and
technologies, such as:

 




 



(1)



The supply
costs for the paraffin wax, which forms the main ingredient of our
Wax Technology, are relatively low when compared to the cost of
materials and equipment required for existing mechanical techniques
and chemical dispersants;





 



 



 





 



(2)



Application
of our Wax Technology will not depend on water turbulence or water
exchange to facilitate clean up of the spilled oil;




6

 
 

 




 



(3)



The
solidified wax compound which remains after application of the Wax
Technology floats, facilitating easy removal of the residual from
calm/still waters;





 



 



 





 



(4)



Because
the heated wax compound is applied in liquid form, the mobility of
the wax allows it to seep into crevices between rocks and
machinery, unlike competing sorbent products;





 



 



 





 



(5)



Removal of
the solidified wax will not require the use of skimmers or vacuums,
allowing for easier clean up and post-application removal than
existing mechanical techniques;





 



 



 





 



(6)



Our Wax
Technology does not involve the lingering introduction of residual
chemicals into the environment;





 



 



 





 



(7)



The spent
wax compound can be collected and recycled for use without
incineration or other hazardous disposal; and





 



 



 





 



(8)



Field
tests conducted by Mr. Nelson have demonstrated that the wax can be
applied by a relatively small team of technicians utilizing mobile
spray application equipment.




Although
we have used prototype formulations of our Wax Technology in a
number of test cases, we have not yet completed commercial
development of products based on that technology and those
prototypes have only been used in a small number of situations.
Further, because our product is relatively novel, the Wax
Technology has not yet gained acceptance in the market place.
Ultimately, the ability of products based on our Wax Technology to
successfully compete on a commercial level with existing
remediation techniques will depend on our ability to establish a
competitive price for our products and on our ability to
demonstrate the efficiency and ease of use of our products and,
most importantly, their effectiveness in cleaning oil spills
compared to existing techniques.

CURRENT
DEVELOPMENT HURDLES

Our Wax
Technology is likely to be most effective when applied to oil
spills located on still water, shoreline and coastal waters as well
as on land. Even though the wax compound used in the Wax Technology
will float, because deep sea waters tend to be more turbulent than
coastal and inland waters, collection of the spent wax compound
will be more difficult. In addition, turbulent waters will tend to
cause the spilled oil to disperse more quickly, which would require
the wax compound to be applied over potentially very large
areas.

Currently,
we are still testing various formulations of our Wax Technology.
Depending upon the different formulations of paraffin wax and
synthetic resins, the effectiveness of the wax compound on cleaning
different types of spilled oil/fuels will vary. We hope to finalize
our different formulations within the next 6 months, subject to our
obtaining sufficient financing, of which there is no assurance (see
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis or Plan of
Operation” below).

In
addition to finalizing the different formulations of the Wax
Technology that we intend to market, we are currently working to
address the following engineering/safety related issues:

 




(a)



Liquefying
the Wax Compound : We are
currently working to solve logistical issues related to heating the
wax compound from a solid to liquid state and for maintaining the
wax in a liquid state. Different logistical problems present
themselves when attempting to use the wax compound in a large scale
environment (e.g. shoreline clean ups) or small scale environment
(e.g. industrial or individual consumer use). In order to use the
wax compound in a large scale environment, large but mobile heating
units must be used to keep the wax in a liquid state. For consumer
use, a method must be devised for consumers to safely and
effectively heat the wax compound.





 



 





 



We are
currently working with our wax supplier, The International Group,
Inc. (“IGI”), to utilize tanker trucks to ship the
liquefied wax to potential oil spill sites. The tankers would be
insulated units capable of maintaining the wax in a heated liquid
state for extended periods of time. We are also in the preliminary
stages of developing a mobile application unit for large scale
spills, complete with propane heaters, air compressors, tanks,
hoses, temperature controls and applicator nozzles. The unit is
being designed to be either self propelled or towed by an All
Terrain Vehicle or tractor.




7

 
 

 




 



In
addition, for smaller industrial site spills and consumer spills,
we are working on design prototypes of insulated wax canisters,
complete with heat controls and dispensing equipment. As designed,
the canisters could be replenished with refill wax
cartridges.





 



 





(b)



Applying
the Wax Compound : We are
currently working to design new equipment or reconfigure existing
technologies to be used to apply the wax in a timely manner.
Effective remediation of oil spills requires the timely application
of remediation technologies. To use the technology on large oil
spills, we must ensure that the applicator equipment is mobile to
ensure a speedy response. We are currently working to develop
different types of applicators for use on different types of oil
spills (see above).





 



 





(c)



Recovery
of Wax Compound : We are
currently working on methods to improve the efficiency of
collecting the spent wax compound. One of the methods that we have
developed is the use of a synthetic mesh netting which can be laid
down on both land and water prior to application of the wax. Once
the applied wax solidifies, the oil, wax and netting can be removed
in one clean sweep.




Previous
formulations for our Wax Technology utilized a high grade petroleum
based wax blended with polyethylene. Due to sharp increases in
petroleum prices, our management believes that using high grade
petroleum based waxes is no longer cost effective. As a result, we
are focusing on the use and development of lower melt point waxes,
which at present are more cost effective.

In
addition to the above technical development issues, before we are
able to market our product, we will need to secure a supplier for
our wax compound (see “Manufacturing and Production”
below). Further, we may be required to obtain the approval of
various regulatory agencies (see “Government
Regulations” below).

MANUFACTURING
AND PRODUCTION

Once we
have completed the development of our anticipated products, we plan
to market those products directly to emergency response
contractors, insurance companies and other emergency response
organizations involved in the clean up and remediation of oil
spills. Although we have developed and successfully tested
prototypes of our Wax Technology, we are in the process of
developing and refining various formulations and have not completed
the development of our products for commercial application, nor
have we received any revenues to date. In the past, we have worked
with the International Group, Inc. (“IGI”), an
unrelated independent supplier of paraffin wax, to refine our
formulation for various applications. Mr. Nelson has collaborated
with IGI for a number of years on different wax related projects.
Based on Mr. Nelson’s long-standing personal relationship
with IGI, they have verbally agreed to assist us and to provide us
with limited supplies of paraffin wax formulated according to Mr.
Nelson’s specifications during the prototype refinement
process free of charge. IGI has also verbally agreed to provide us
with bench scale quantities of paraffin wax and quantities for
small field trials free of charge while we are still in the
development stage of our business.

Although
IGI has verbally agreed to provide us with small amounts of
paraffin wax during the development stage of our business, we do
not have a formal agreement with IGI. As such, IGI may, at their
discretion, cease to supply us with paraffin wax.

Once we
have completed the development of our commercial products, we
intend to enter into a formal agreement with IGI for the
manufacture and supply of our wax compound. There are a number of
suppliers who provide paraffin wax in raw form, however, there are
a limited number of suppliers willing and able to supply
specialized wax composites. We have not yet entered into a formal
agreement with IGI for the manufacture and supply of wax products
and there is no assurance that we will be able to reach such an
agreement with them in the future. If we are unable to reach an
agreement with IGI for the manufacture and supply of our products,
we will have to seek alternative suppliers, which may have a
materially adverse effect on our business.

8

 
 

We also
intend to produce “mini-kits” of our wax products to be
used by consumers. The kits would be targeted to allow everyday
consumers to use our products to clean minor oil spills. We hope to
introduce these kits as part of our product introduction strategy
and intend to sell them directly to consumers either online or by
telephone. We would also provide consumers with after-sales
services and support.

MARKETING
AND SALES PLAN

We have
not yet completed the development of our products for commercial
application and have not received any revenues or completed any
sales of our products to date. Once we have completed the
refinement and development of our products for commercial sale, we
expect to focus our marketing and sales efforts on markets within
the United States and Canada, especially in industrialized areas
vulnerable to, and with a history of, spill occurrences.

We expect
to concentrate our marketing and sales efforts directly at approved
emergency response contractors, insurance companies and other
organizations involved in the control and remediation of oil
spills. We also intend to license our products to global sales
agents who will assist us in marketing our products
worldwide.

WASTEWATER
TREATMENT PRODUCTS

In
addition to pursuing the development and marketing of the Wax
Technology, as part of our long-term business plan, we are also
exploring opportunities in wastewater treatment solutions. We
intend to provide process design solutions and to supply equipment
for ultraviolet disinfection, membrane filtration and sequencing
batch reactor wastewater treatment systems. Although we will
explore opportunities in this area if they present themselves,
because of our limited financial resources, we do not expect to
actively pursue opportunities in this area in the near term as we
intend to focus our available resources on developing and marketing
the Wax Technology.

Through
Paul G. Daly, our founder, sole director and our Chief Executive
Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Secretary and
Treasurer, we have over 20 years of experience in providing
environmental and wastewater solutions. It is expected that Mr.
Daly’s experience will form the foundation of this planned
business. In addition to our plans to provide process design
services, we intend to seek opportunities to:

 




(a)



obtain
exclusive rights to supply proprietary ultraviolet disinfection,
membrane filtration and sequencing batch reactor equipment;
or





 



 





(b)



obtain
rights to act as suppliers for manufacturers of such
equipment.




Currently,
we do not have any contracts to act as a dealer for manufacturers
of ultraviolet disinfection, membrane filtration or sequencing
batch reactor equipment and there is no assurance that we will be
able to obtain such contracts in the future.

PATENTS
AND TRADEMARKS

The
inventor of the Wax Technology, Mr. Nelson, registered a patent
application with the Canadian Intellectual Property Office (the
“CIPO”) under the application number CA 2,314,066 on
July 17, 2000. In March, 2007, we received notice of the first
examination report from the CIPO in connection with our patent
application. The CIPO raised a number of objections to our patent
application regarding the wording of our claims, which were
considered to be indefinite or ambiguous. In order to avoid
abandonment of our patent application, we were required to file a
reply to the first examination report by August 1, 2007. Due to a
lack of financing, we were unable to file a reply within the
required time period. As a result, our patent application was
abandoned. Due to our limited financial resources and the high
expected cost of reviving this patent application, we do not intend
revive this patent application. In addition, during the past year,
the price of petroleum has increased significantly, increasing the
cost of the high grade petroleum based waxes called for in the
formulation set out in this patent application. As a result, in the
opinion of our management, this current formulation would no longer
be cost effective. We are currently focusing on the development of
lower melt point waxes, which are less expensive. We do not
currently have plans to file a patent application for any new
developments that we make in the use of waxes for oil spill
remediation, and we will need to protect our interests by
maintaining the secrecy of any new formulations that we
develop.

GOVERNMENT
REGULATIONS

Because
our Wax Technology is a chemically inert product and does not
involve the lingering introduction of residual chemicals into the
environment, we believe that it will be unnecessary for us to
obtain prior approval from Canadian and U.S. environmental
regulatory agencies to use our planned products to clean oil spills
on land. However, we may be required to obtain the prior approval
of federal regulatory agencies such as Environment Canada and the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) or
state or local agencies before our planned products can be used to
treat oil spills on inland or coastal waters. We may incur material
costs or liabilities in obtaining such approvals and/or complying
with applicable laws and regulations. Furthermore, our potential
customers may be required to comply with numerous laws and
regulations when engaging in environmental remediation
activities.

We do not
anticipate any material costs associated with complying with local,
state or federal environmental laws in the production of our
anticipated products as we intend to contract out the manufacturing
of our anticipated wax products.

Environment
Canada Approval Requirements

In
Canada, where an oil spill will potentially affect inland or
coastal waters subject to the Canadian Fisheries Act, permission
must be obtained from the regional office of Environment Canada to
use oil spill treatment agents or products. Permission is granted
by Environment Canada on a case-by-case basis, but is not required
for oil spills not affecting waters subject to the Fisheries Act.
In order for remediation personnel to obtain permission to use our
planned products, those products must be submitted to the
Environmental Technology Centre of Environment Canada (the
“ETC”) for testing and approval. Although we have not
yet submitted our products to the ETC for testing, we have made
initial contact with the ETC with respect to obtaining their
approval for our planned products. In our discussions with the ETC,
they have expressed concerns with regards to the use of the Wax
Technology on fast moving waters, the Wax Technology’s
absorption rate and on the recoverability of the spent wax.
However, the ETC’s comments are based on a twenty-year old,
early prototype of the Wax Technology that Mr. Nelson had
demonstrated for Environment Canada in the 1970’s. We are
working to address those concerns in our current development
activities, including increasing the absorption capacity of the wax
compound and the use of a synthetic mesh netting to remove the
spent solidified wax (see “Product Development and Planned
Wax Applications” and “Current Development
Hurdles” above). Further, we intend to restrict marketing for
the use of our product to calm/still waters and shoreline clean ups
where we believe use of the Wax Technology will be most beneficial.
Subject to our ability to obtain additional financing, of which
there is no assurance, once we have completed the development of
our planned products, we hope to make a formal submission to the
ETC for their approval.

U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency Approval
Requirements

In the
United States, federal authorization is required to use a product
on a specific oil spill incident only where the oil spill has the
potential to affect U.S. navigable waters, as defined by Section
300.5 of the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution
Contingency Plan (“NCP”) Regulations. Where the oil
spill does not have the potential to affect U.S. navigable waters,
federal authorization is not required, although individual state
and local governments may impose their own authorization
requirements.

Where an
oil spill does have the potential to affect U.S. navigable waters,
a regional response team (“RRT”) consisting of
representatives of a number of federal and state agencies,
including a representative of the EPA, will have jurisdiction over
the clean up of the oil spill. If the product to be used in the
clean up of the oil spill is a chemical or biological agent, as
defined by Section 300.5 of the NCP Regulations, the product must
be listed on the NCP Product Schedule and incident specific RRT
member approval is required to use the product. The EPA is
responsible for determining whether a product must be listed on the
NCP Product Schedule. Because our Wax Technology is a chemically
inert product used to remove the spilled oil, we believe that our
planned products will be classified as a sorbent under the NCP
Regulations and will not require listing on the NCP Product
Schedule and will thus not require approval prior to their use on
specific spill incidents. However, in order to confirm the status
of our planned products, once we have completed the development of
our products and subject to our obtaining additional financing, of
which there is no assurance, we intend to submit our products to
the EPA to confirm that those products meet the definition of a
sorbent under the NCP Regulations.

EMPLOYEES

We
currently have only one full-time employee, who is our founder,
sole director and President, Secretary and Treasurer, Paul G. Daly.
However, we have retained the services of the inventor of the Wax
Technology, William Nelson as a consultant (see “Directors
and Executive Officers, Promoters and Control Persons”
below).

RISK
FACTORS.




The
following are some of the important factors that could affect our
financial performance or could cause actual results to differ
materially from estimates contained in our forward-looking
statements. We may encounter risks in addition to those described
below. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to
us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, may also impair or
adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of
operation.

Need For
Financing

We do not
currently have the financial resources to complete our plan of
operation for the next twelve months. We anticipate that we will
require financing in the amount of $750,000 in order to fund our
plan of operation over the next twelve months. We presently do not
have any financing arrangements in place and there is no assurance
that we will be able to obtain sufficient financing on terms
acceptable to us or at all. If further financing is not available,
our ability to meet our financial obligations and pursue our plan
of operation will be substantially limited. If we are not able to
meet our financial obligations as they come due, our business could
fail and investors could lose a substantial portion or all of their
investment.

Limited
Operating History, Risks Of A New Business
Venture

We were
incorporated on October 24, 2000 and, prior to our acquisition of
the Wax Technology, we had been involved primarily in
organizational activities and in seeking business opportunities
related to environmental technologies and products. We have not
earned any revenues to date.

Potential
investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered
by a new enterprise and the high rate of failure of such
enterprises. The potential for future success must be considered in
light of the problems, expenses, difficulties complications and
delays encountered in connection with the development of a business
in the area in which we intend to operate and in connection with
the formation and commencement of operations of a new business in
general. These include, but are not limited to, unanticipated
problems relating to research and development programs, marketing,
approvals by government agencies, competition and additional costs
and expenses that may exceed current estimates. There is no history
upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that our
business will prove successful, and there can be no assurance that
we will generate any operating revenues or ever achieve profitable
operations.

Our
Operations Will Be Subject To Extensive Government
Regulations

Our
operations will be subject to extensive government regulations in
the United States, Canada and in other countries in which we may
operate. In order to sell our anticipated products, we may be
required to obtain a number of regulatory approvals at the federal,
state and local level, including the approval of the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency and Environment Canada. We may
incur material costs or liabilities in obtaining such approvals
and/or complying with applicable laws and regulations. Furthermore,
our potential customers may be required to comply with numerous
laws and regulations when engaging in environmental remediation
activities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to
successfully comply with all present or future government
regulations. An inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals
or the imposition of onerous conditions on the use of our
anticipated products will have a materially adverse effect on us,
our business and our financial condition.

11

 
 

Our
Business Operations, Assets and Personnel Are Located Outside The
United States

Although
we are incorporated in the United States, all of our current
operating activities are conducted in, and all of our assets and
personnel are located in, Canada. As such, investors in our
securities may experience difficulty in enforcing judgments or
liabilities against the Company or our personnel under United
States securities laws.

Our
corporate headquarters are located at 20 Lyall Avenue, Toronto,
Ontario, Canada, M4E 1V9. As we are a Nevada corporation, we are
required to maintain a resident agent in the State of Nevada for
the purpose of receiving service of process. Under Section 78.090
of the Nevada Revised Statutes, all legal process and any demand or
notice authorized by law to be served upon the Company may be
served upon our resident agent in Nevada. Our resident agent for
this purpose is Camlex Management (Nevada) Inc. of 8275 S. Eastern
Avenue, Suite 200, Las Vegas, Nevada, 89123.

As a
Nevada corporation, we are subject to the laws of the United
States, including the federal securities laws of the United States,
and to the jurisdiction of United States courts. As such, investors
may bring proceedings against us, and enforce judgments obtained
against us, in United States courts.

Generally,
original actions to enforce liabilities under United States federal
securities laws may not be brought in a Canadian court. Such
actions must be brought in a court in the United States with
applicable jurisdiction. Persons obtaining judgments against us in
United States courts, including judgments obtained under United
States federal securities laws, will then be required to bring an
application in a Canadian court to enforce such judgments in
Canada.

Competition
Is Intense And We May Be Unable To Achieve Market
Acceptance

The
business environment in which we intend to operate is highly
competitive. Currently, there exist a number of established
methods, products and technologies used to control, clean and
remediate oil spills and we expect to experience competition from a
number of established companies involved in the environmental
remediation industry. Certain of our potential competitors will
have greater technical, financial, marketing, sales and other
resources than us.

In
addition, while the environmental remediation industry is a mature
one, there is no established market for products utilizing our Wax
Technology. We are unable to provide assurances that our target
customers and markets will accept our technologies or will purchase
our products and services in sufficient quantities to achieve
profitability. If a significant market fails to develop or develops
more slowly than we anticipate, we may be unable to recover the
losses incurred to develop products and we may be unable to meet
our operational expenses. Acceptance of our anticipated products by
environmental remediation firms and other organizations will depend
upon a number of factors, including the cost competitiveness of our
products, customer reluctance to try new products or services,
regulatory requirements or the emergence of more competitive or
effective products.

Asserting
And Defending Intellectual Property Rights May Impact The Results
Of Our Operations

We had
applied for a patent from the CIPO, however, we did not receive a
final grant of patent from the CIPO, and we have decided to abandon
our patent application at this time. As patent applications are
publicly available documents, competitors may be able to copy the
formulations set out in our patent application. Due to our limited
financial resources, we do not expect to apply for patent
protection for any new developments that we make to the Wax
Technology. As a result, in order to protect future developments,
we will need to maintain the secrecy of our formulations and the
methods we use. If we are unable to maintain the secrecy of those
developments, then competitors may be able to copy our formulations
and methodology, which would have a material adverse effect on our
business.

12

 
 

Dependence
On Key Personnel

Our
success will largely depend on the performance of our directors and
officers and our key consultants. Our success will also depend on
our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical,
research, management, regulatory compliance, sales and marketing
personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense. The loss of
the services of such personnel or the inability to attract and
retain other key personnel could impair the development of our
business, operating results and financial condition.

Our Stock
is a Penny Stock

Because
our stock is a penny stock, shareholders will be more limited in
their ability to sell their stock. The SEC has adopted rules that
regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in
penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a
price of less than $5.00, other than securities registered on
certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the Nasdaq
system, provided that current price and volume information with
respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the
exchange or quotation system. Because our securities constitute
“penny stocks” within the meaning of the rules, the
rules apply to us and to our securities. The rules may further
affect the ability of owners of shares to sell our securities in
any market that might develop for them. As long as the trading
price of our common stock is less than $5.00 per share, the common
stock will be subject to Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act. The
penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction
in a penny stock, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure
document prepared by the SEC, that:

 




 



1.



contains a
description of the nature and level of risk in the market for penny
stocks in both public offerings and secondary trading;





 



 



 





 



2.



contains a
description of the broker’s or dealer’s duties to the
customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer
with respect to a violation to such duties or other requirements of
securities laws;





 



 



 





 



3.



contains a
brief, clear, narrative description of a dealer market, including
bid and ask prices for penny stocks and the significance of the
spread between the bid and ask price;





 



 



 





 



4.



contains a
toll-free telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary
actions;





 



 



 





 



5.



defines
significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of
trading in penny stocks; and





 



 



 





 



6.



contains
such other information and is in such form, including language,
type, size and format, as the SEC shall require by rule or
regulation.




The
broker-dealer also must provide, prior to effecting any transaction
in a penny stock, the customer with: (a) bid and offer quotations
for the penny stock; (b) the compensation of the broker-dealer and
its salesperson in the transaction; (c) the number of shares to
which such bid and ask prices apply, or other comparable
information relating to the depth and liquidity of the market for
such stock; and (d) a monthly account statements showing the market
value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account. In
addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction
in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules; the
broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the
penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive
the purchaser’s written acknowledgment of the receipt of a
risk disclosure statement, a written agreement to transactions
involving penny stocks, and a signed and dated copy of a written
suitably statement. These disclosure requirements may have the
effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for
our stock.

PROPERTIES.




We
currently do not own any real property. We currently lease an
office space located at 20 Lyall Avenue, Toronto, Ontario, Canada,
M4E 1V9, consisting of approximately 700 square feet at a cost of
$200 per month. We rent this office space from Paul G. Daly, who is
our sole director and our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial
Officer, President, Secretary and Treasurer.

Although
our shares began trading on the OTC Bulletin Board on December 2,
2005, no information on the high, low and bid prices for our common
stock was available from the OTC Bulletin Board. Our share are
quoted under the symbol “IFTV.” OTC Bulletin Board
quotations reflect inter-dealer prices, without retail mark-up,
mark-down or commissions and may not represent actual
transactions.

REGISTERED
HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK

Our
authorized capital consists of 100,000,000 shares of common stock,
par value $0.001 per share. As of October 26, 2010, there were 103
registered holders of our common stock. Some of our stockholders
hold stock on deposit with their brokers or investment bankers
registered in the name of stock depositories.

DIVIDENDS

We have
not declared any dividends on our common stock since our inception.
There are no dividend restrictions that limit our ability to pay
dividends on our common stock in our Articles of Incorporation or
Bylaws. Chapter 78 of the Nevada Revised Statutes (the
“NRS”), does provide certain limitations on our ability
to declare dividends. Section 78.288 of Chapter 78 of the NRS
prohibits us from declaring dividends where, after giving effect to
the distribution of the dividend:

 




(a)



we would
not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course
of business; or





 



 





(b)



except as
may be allowed by our Articles of Incorporation, our total assets
would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus the amount
that would be needed, if we were to be dissolved at the time of the
distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution
of stockholders who may have preferential rights and whose
preferential rights are superior to those receiving the
distribution.




We have
neither declared nor paid any cash dividends on our capital stock
and do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable
future. Our current policy is to retain any earnings in order to
finance the expansion of our operations. Our board of directors
will determine future declaration and payment of dividends, if any,
in light of the then-current conditions they deem relevant and in
accordance with the NRS.

RECENT
SALES OF UNREGISTERED SECURITIES

On
October 25, 2007, we issued 400,000 shares of our common stock to
Sanibel Intertrade Co. (“Sanibel”) at a price of $0.06
per share for proceeds of $24,000. We completed the offering
pursuant to Regulation S of the Securities Act. We did n

Welcome to INIFITECH 
            Ventures Inc (�The Company�). INFITECH with principal 
            executive offices in Toronto, Ontario, Canada is currently applying 
            for listing on a publicly traded stock exchange. INFITECH is an 
            environmental company, whose business is to remediate, clean, and 
            remove pollution from the environment. Our focus is in the field of 
            water & wastewater treatment, and hydrocarbon remediation. The 
            Company owns the worldwide intellectual property rights and sole 
            distribution rights for a patented hydrocarbon (�WAX�) technology 
            used to control, clean, and remediate oil leakage and other forms of 
            pollution on land and water....

MORE

INFITECH�s patented 
            technology (Patent CA 2314066) is a synthetic �hot wax� mixture of 
            paraffin wax and resins to clean oil spills in still bodies of water 
            and shorelines. 
When spread onto any 
            oil spill (water or ground), the �hot wax� will instantaneously 
            solidify with the entire oil spill. A chemical reaction occurs as 
            the hydrocarbon molecules of the spill automatically bond with 
            hydrocarbon molecules of the wax. Since, they are both hydrocarbon 
            (oil), the resulting mixture is easily collected in its solid state 
            (i.e. floats on water) and taken for disposal or incineration for 
            fuel. The technology is designed so any labourer can use it and 
            unlike current mechanical methods, easily scalable and very 
            economical to use. INFITECH�s technology significantly reduces costs 
            for oil spill and dangerous materials handlers and cleans to 
            exceeding existing environmental regulations. 
MORE


Wastewater is one of 
            the primary environmental concerns facing communities everywhere in 
            the world. INFITECH is currently exploring opportunities in 
            providing wastewater treatment solutions.
Specifically, 
            INFITECH is seeking exclusive distribution rights from manufacturers 
            of ultraviolet disinfection ,membrane filtration and sequencing 
            batch reactor systems.
