Tipalti removes the manual effort and complexity that’s required to pay affiliates and other performance-based partners. Tipalti integrates with your ERP, performance data, or accepts a payment instruction file, then takes care of securing approvals, making sure funds exist, and paying in the supplier’s chosen payment method (e.g. ACH, wire transfer, PayPal, etc.). No more logging into individual banking portals or reconciling payments from across multiple accounts.Tipalti takes care of communicating with affiliate marketers, sending out automated emails regarding payment status or allowing them to update their payment information from a branded portal. Affiliates are also asked in the very beginning to submit their W-9, W-8, or VAT tax information through a guided interface eliminating an unnecessary hassle later. Tipalti streamlines the payment reconciliation process for a faster financial close. A single person can do all this in just minutes a day.Experience the World’s Most Powerful Affiliate Payments Automation SystemGet a Guided Product Tour

  Tax Form and Reporting ComplianceCollecting IRS tax forms (W-9, W-8 series, etc.) from suppliers and partners is usually an afterthought, at times not even considered until the end of the year when companies begin the 1099 and 1042-S reporting process. In many organizations, the accounting team must email or call that payee and send them a form, which they then fill out and scan then email it back or fax it. Then the AP team records it somewhere. But what happens if that supplier is no longer there or if the relationship isn’t so great any more? What happens if the partner is in a foreign country and has to maneuver the complicated nature of the W-8 series of forms? If you’re located outside of the US, how do you collect local and VAT tax IDs?The new FATCA requirements instituted by the Internal Revenue Service are designed to collect taxes from entities outside the US, but are also making what use to be a simple handshake relationship into an elaborate protocol involving international treaties. In some cases, the paying company may even need to perform tax withholding. While the risk of not collecting forms prior to payment becomes a potential tax violation.United States Tax ComplianceAll supplier payees are required to fill out tax forms as part of their self-registration on the Tipalti portal.For US entities, a W-9 (Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification) is required.Non-US entities are required to complete a declaration stating that they are not a “US Person” as per the IRS definitions and are asked to submit the necessary W-8 paperwork.A premium Tipalti service, approved by auditing firm KPMG, includes the ability to walk payees through a guided tax form selection process. This includes the ability to digitally submit a W-9, W-8BEN, and W-8BEN-E. Tipalti also provides TIN validation on Social Security Numbers and Employer Identification Numbers. For other forms, such as W-8EXP, W-8IMY, W-8ECI, W-4 and Form 8233, a download link is provided as well as the ability to upload a document. This automated process is designed to streamline compliance with the FATCA (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act) as part of the 2010 Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment (“HIRE”) Act.Depending on the payee’s country and company structure, Tipalti can also establish the necessary tax withholding.Tipalti also generates an end of year filing report to submit to the Internal Revenue Service that includes data to generate 1099 and 1042-S tax forms.Digitally Collect W-9 and W-8 Series Tax FormsTipalti solves the complex, highly-manual process of collecting tax information with a guided wizard in the Payee Portal. Payees answer simple questions and are directed to the right form. For some forms, they can digitally complete them which are recording in Tipalti. No printing. No signing paper. No scanning. No filing.Guide suppliers with form selection from over eight different tax forms including Forms W-9, W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E, W-8EXP, W-8IMY, W-8ECI, W-4 and Form 8233 during the onboarding process based on their country and business structureIntegrated TIN validation where Employer Identification Numbers (EIN) and Social Security Numbers (SSN) are automatically verifiedWithholding, when required for specific payees, is automatically performed with each paymentAll payments are rolled up into a year-end report that’s ready to submit to a 1099 and 1042-S distribution serviceInternational Tax CapabilitiesFor international companies using Tipalti, local and VAT tax ID support is available in 49 countries. Tipalti easily and securely collects the supplier tax IDs and our built-in tax engine validates against 3,000+ rules to help prevent tax ID errors and issues. For European countries, we also support document collection so suppliers can provide additional information needed for tax compliance and self-billing invoices for countries where suppliers must approve invoices before payments can be processed.Because tax IDs are collected and validated up front, information is vetted in a safe and secure way while ensuring suppliers are legitimate. Tax ID collection is seamlessly integrated into the onboarding experience, so suppliers easily enter the necessary ID, saving time for the AP team. Tax IDs and values are also built in to Tipalti ERP integration bundles, so no manual work is required to input or upload important tax information to ERP systems.Supported countries are: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Honduras, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, Netherlands, Paraguay, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, South Korea, Sweden, Ukraine, United Kingdom, and Uruguay.SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER

	Accelerize Inc. (ACLZ: OTCBB) - Global Expansion & Product Innovation Drives Growth

News Room /  Accelerize Inc. (ACLZ: OTCBB) - Global Expansion & Product Innovation Drives Growth

                    










Accelerize Inc. (ACLZ: OTCBB) - Global Expansion & Product Innovation Drives Growth


SEATTLE, WA / ACCESSWIRE / January 13, 2016 / Accelerize Inc. (OTCBB: ACLZ) is on pace to achieve another year of record revenue in 2015, according to a corporate update issued in November, driven by a combination of product evolution and global expansion into new markets.
The worldwide digital advertising market is expected to grow from $138 billion in 2014 to $204 billion by 2018, according to eMarketer, with a significant part of that growth coming from overseas markets. After successfully launching a presence in Europe in 2014, the company established additional customer acquisition offices in Australia and India in 2015. This resulted in revenue derived from outside the U.S. now accounting for 27% of consolidated revenue during the first six months of 2015, which is up 21% from the same period last year.
Advertising agencies and brand advertisers are also starting to insource the management of their digital marketing in areas where they previously relied on a network of service providers. In response to these trends, the company evolved CAKE into a pioneering enterprise platform to help larger companies insource the management of their customer acquisition efforts by solving a critical issue: Companies simply have too many marketing channels and platforms to monitor, making data evaluation of cross channel performance difficult and time consuming.
As traditional ad spending shifts online, advertisers and agencies choose between a wide variety of digital methods to reach their target customers and measure performance across multiple channels, including search, affiliate, social, mobile, video, and e-mail, among others. They must then quantify in real-time the results of their efforts in order to maximize the return on investment for their ad dollars. After all, what's the point of having access to customer acquisition data if - by the time you're able to analyze it - it's no longer relevant?
Alliance Data Systems' (NYSE: ADS) CommissionJunction and Rakuten Inc.'s (OTC: RKUNY) LinkShare may provide large advertising platforms, but Accelerize seamlessly tracks the customer journey in real-time across the digital marketing spectrum in order to maximize the effectiveness of an advertiser's digital spending across many platforms. In 2015, the company completed a wide variety of integrations with popular platforms - including a large integration with IBM (NYSE: IBM) - and onboarded more than 100 advertisers.
The company's software-as-a-service approach generates solid and highly predictable recurring revenue base with extremely high customer retention rates.
"We see a resumption of growth in the fourth quarter leading to total revenues exceeding $21 million, which represents a record year and we expect more than a 30% increase compared to 2014 revenues of $16.5 million," said Chairman and CEO Brian Ross in the shareholders' letter. "As we resume our growth track heading into the new year, we are committed to achieve a minimum of 30% revenue growth in 2016 and we are working hard to exceed that goal."
"More importantly, the steps we have taken to improve operations are already becoming visible in our performance in the current quarter and we now see Accelerize achieving cash flow positive operations beginning in the first quarter of 2016," added Mr. Ross. "I believe we are now poised and well positioned to achieve substantial growth in our top and bottom line financial performance for the foreseeable future."

The funds will be used to retire the outstanding balance of the Company's current credit facility (approximately $4.6 million as of December 31, 2015), drive global sales growth of its CAKE digital marketing solutions into new and existing markets, and further its leading position in digital marketing software through continued product innovation. Accelerize recently reported record full-year 2015 revenue with 30% year-over-year sales growth and achieved profitability on an adjusted EBITDA basis in Q4.
"We are pleased to have secured this new facility with SaaS Capital, a partner who truly understands the SaaS business model. It provides us with significant, efficient capital to grow for the foreseeable future," said Anthony Mazzarella, CFO at Accelerize. "This new facility is substantially larger than our previous line of credit and features a structure and covenants designed specifically for growing SaaS companies. With this new larger and more flexible facility we are focused on accelerating our revenue growth and increasing bottom-line profitability. We also look forward to exploring strategic opportunities to further enhance the value of our Company for the benefit of our stockholders."
Accelerize owns and operates CAKE, a marketing technology provider of solutions that track and analyze the performance of digital marketing spend, in real-time. CAKE's powerful software-as-a-service (SaaS) enterprise platform is an industry standard for affiliate networks, advertisers, publishers and agencies to measurably improve and optimize campaign performance and return on investment.
Digital media will continue its meteoric rise and marketers are being driven to invest more in technology to optimize their digital marketing spend. According to Statista, worldwide digital ad spending grew 16.4% last year, to $170.1 billion, and it is projected to reach $252.02 billion by 2018. By the end of 2017, digital ad spend is expected to overtake TV as the biggest advertising category (Interpublic Group's Magna Global).
"Marketing is more important than ever and the CAKE product is at the center of that industry – if you don't understand the ROIs of your different marketing efforts, then you are being inefficient and ineffective. And it's not enough to just track one or two channels; CAKE optimizes marketing campaigns across all digital channels," said Rob Belcher, Managing Director of SaaS Capital. "The product, team, and track record are all very impressive and we're excited to partner with Accelerize for the next phase of the company's story."

  Tax Form and Reporting ComplianceCollecting IRS tax forms (W-9, W-8 series, etc.) from suppliers and partners is usually an afterthought, at times not even considered until the end of the year when companies begin the 1099 and 1042-S reporting process. In many organizations, the accounting team must email or call that payee and send them a form, which they then fill out and scan then email it back or fax it. Then the AP team records it somewhere. But what happens if that supplier is no longer there or if the relationship isn’t so great any more? What happens if the partner is in a foreign country and has to maneuver the complicated nature of the W-8 series of forms? If you’re located outside of the US, how do you collect local and VAT tax IDs?The new FATCA requirements instituted by the Internal Revenue Service are designed to collect taxes from entities outside the US, but are also making what use to be a simple handshake relationship into an elaborate protocol involving international treaties. In some cases, the paying company may even need to perform tax withholding. While the risk of not collecting forms prior to payment becomes a potential tax violation.United States Tax ComplianceAll supplier payees are required to fill out tax forms as part of their self-registration on the Tipalti portal.For US entities, a W-9 (Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification) is required.Non-US entities are required to complete a declaration stating that they are not a “US Person” as per the IRS definitions and are asked to submit the necessary W-8 paperwork.A premium Tipalti service, approved by auditing firm KPMG, includes the ability to walk payees through a guided tax form selection process. This includes the ability to digitally submit a W-9, W-8BEN, and W-8BEN-E. Tipalti also provides TIN validation on Social Security Numbers and Employer Identification Numbers. For other forms, such as W-8EXP, W-8IMY, W-8ECI, W-4 and Form 8233, a download link is provided as well as the ability to upload a document. This automated process is designed to streamline compliance with the FATCA (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act) as part of the 2010 Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment (“HIRE”) Act.Depending on the payee’s country and company structure, Tipalti can also establish the necessary tax withholding.Tipalti also generates an end of year filing report to submit to the Internal Revenue Service that includes data to generate 1099 and 1042-S tax forms.Digitally Collect W-9 and W-8 Series Tax FormsTipalti solves the complex, highly-manual process of collecting tax information with a guided wizard in the Payee Portal. Payees answer simple questions and are directed to the right form. For some forms, they can digitally complete them which are recording in Tipalti. No printing. No signing paper. No scanning. No filing.Guide suppliers with form selection from over eight different tax forms including Forms W-9, W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E, W-8EXP, W-8IMY, W-8ECI, W-4 and Form 8233 during the onboarding process based on their country and business structureIntegrated TIN validation where Employer Identification Numbers (EIN) and Social Security Numbers (SSN) are automatically verifiedWithholding, when required for specific payees, is automatically performed with each paymentAll payments are rolled up into a year-end report that’s ready to submit to a 1099 and 1042-S distribution serviceInternational Tax CapabilitiesFor international companies using Tipalti, local and VAT tax ID support is available in 49 countries. Tipalti easily and securely collects the supplier tax IDs and our built-in tax engine validates against 3,000+ rules to help prevent tax ID errors and issues. For European countries, we also support document collection so suppliers can provide additional information needed for tax compliance and self-billing invoices for countries where suppliers must approve invoices before payments can be processed.Because tax IDs are collected and validated up front, information is vetted in a safe and secure way while ensuring suppliers are legitimate. Tax ID collection is seamlessly integrated into the onboarding experience, so suppliers easily enter the necessary ID, saving time for the AP team. Tax IDs and values are also built in to Tipalti ERP integration bundles, so no manual work is required to input or upload important tax information to ERP systems.Supported countries are: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Honduras, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, Netherlands, Paraguay, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, South Korea, Sweden, Ukraine, United Kingdom, and Uruguay.SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER
