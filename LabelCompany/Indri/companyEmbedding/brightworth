Personal wealth planning for your future.
 









The Brightworth Difference is both the personal and the professional touch that has allowed us to maintain an average 98% client retention rate* since we began measuring in 2000. As our name implies, Brightworth advisors are optimistic about ensuring a bright financial future for our clients, and we take the management of their resources very seriously. The experience our clients have when working with Brightworth is what separates our firm from the rest. While we are headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, our clients live nationwide. Here are some examples of the level of service you will experience as a member of the Brightworth community:
We Put You First You deserve objective advice that is not driven by your advisor's compensation. As a fee-only firm, we are paid solely by our clients and therefore are free to choose investment strategies that make sense for our clients without the conflict of commission-based or proprietary products.
Accountability and Transparency We use third-party custodians who independently report on your holdings. The Brightworth Performance Report gives you a clear picture of your investment portfolio from day one, net of all fees. We also keep a documented track record showing how Brightworth investment portfolios have performed over time.
Personal and Comprehensive Approach You need an advisor who can integrate and monitor all the major financial aspects of your life. Our wealth advisors have deep expertise across the financial disciplines to provide ongoing advice and coordinated leadership with your other advisors.
Global Investment Solution Investing is a means to accomplishing your goals. We listen to our clients and customize their investment strategy based on their personal objectives. Each client benefits from our extensive research and the best thinking of our experienced investment team.
Longevity Brightworth has been built to last. Our firm’s succession plan is designed for Brightworth to operate independently into the future and includes plans for multiple generations of shareholders. As such, our team is positioned to be here when you and your family need us most, whether that time is now, or later on down the road.

Risk Management | Brightworth



















Skip to main content







Risk Management
HomeOur ServicesRisk Management 














When it comes to protecting your family’s financial future from catastrophic risks — physical or legal — what you don't know can hurt you.
 



Risk Management
	Without proper planning, a problem can become devastatingly clear at just the wrong time. We can work with your attorney, insurance specialist and other professionals to develop a risk management and asset protection plan. Key areas include life, health, disability, long-term care, liability, and property and casualty. We can also help you evaluate more advanced asset protection strategies through the proper titling of assets, beneficiary designations and trusts. At Brightworth we do not sell insurance, as it could present a conflict of interest to our clients. Rather, we do the research to help you find the best insurance available for your needs and connect you with an insurance specialist if you need product assistance.

Company Description


Brightworth Brightworth uses asset allocation strategies to create investment portfolios for clients. The following broad asset classes are the major components of their client portfolios: stocks, bonds, and alternative & real assets. The stock portion invests globally in both U.S. and internationally-based companies. The bond portion is broadly diversified across the global fixed income markets and will normally maintain an intermediate maturity. The alternative & real assets portion of the portfolio may include a variety of non-traditional asset classes and strategies such as real estate, hedge funds, trading strategies, and private equity. Based on the client’s situation, Brightworth may use different types of investment vehicles to implement a portfolio including, but not necessarily limited to mutual funds, separate stock and bond accounts, limited partnerships, as well as hedge fund-of-funds. Brightworth manages portfolios on an enterprise level to provide their current thinking across their clients and to create consistency in returns for clients with similar objectives. In general, the firm invests each client’s portfolio in a Brightworth model portfolio and may further customize the client’s investments based on the specific goals and objectives for each account (based on factors including the size of the account, the net worth of the client, risk tolerance of the client, and the specific goals and objectives of the client). In certain situations, clients may request that Brightworth use managers that place limited restrictions on investing in certain securities or types of securities (such as the securities of companies whose primary revenue comes from the manufacturing of alcohol or tobacco products). The firm''s Investment Committee and investment analysts research and conduct due diligence on third party money managers that Brightworth recommends for client accounts. The firm uses independent money managers who specialize in the different components of their clients’ portfolios. Brightworth evaluates, selects, and monitors these managers using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. The firm generally uses multiple managers in each client account to allow for focused expertise in each asset class or sector (such as small-cap US stocks or inflation-protected bonds).

Background Information:


Brightworth LLC »
Brightworth Brightworth uses asset allocation strategies to create investment portfolios for clients. The following broad asset classes are the major components of their client portfolios: stocks, bonds, and alternative & real assets. The stock portion invests globally in both U.S. and internationally-based companies. The bond portion is broadly diversified across the global fixed income markets and will normally maintain an intermediate maturity. The alternative & real assets portion of the portfolio may include a variety of non-traditional asset classes and strategies such as real estate, hedge funds, trading strategies, and private equity. Based on the client’s situation, Brightworth may use different types of investment vehicles to implement a portfolio including, but not necessarily limited to mutual funds, separate stock and bond accounts, limited partnerships, as well as hedge fund-of-funds. Brightworth manages portfolios on an enterprise level to provide their current thinking across their clients and to create consistency in returns for clients with similar objectives. In general, the firm invests each client’s portfolio in a Brightworth model portfolio and may further customize the client’s investments based on the specific goals and objectives for each account (based on factors including the size of the account, the net worth of the client, risk tolerance of the client, and the specific goals and objectives of the client). In certain situations, clients may request that Brightworth use managers that place limited restrictions on investing in certain securities or types of securities (such as the securities of companies whose primary revenue comes from the manufacturing of alcohol or tobacco products). The firm''s Investment Committee and investment analysts research and conduct due diligence on third party money managers that Brightworth recommends for client accounts. The firm uses independent money managers who specialize in the different components of their clients’ portfolios. Brightworth evaluates, selects, and monitors these managers using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. The firm generally uses multiple managers in each client account to allow for focused expertise in each asset class or sector (such as small-cap US stocks or inflation-protected bonds).
