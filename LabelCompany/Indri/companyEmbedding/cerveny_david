Current Research
Homelessness and Non-recreational Camping on National Forests and Grasslands. A survey of law enforcement officers in 2015 revealed interesting patterns in residential use of national forests and grasslands. Long-term encampments have implications for the biophysical environment as well as the social environment. Cleaning up sites after extended use requires significant resources. Research Partners: Oregon State University; San Jose State University. Forest Collaboratives as Enduring Forms of Resource Governance.  Over the past 20 years, there has been a proliferation of community-based collaborative groups throughout the western US. Federal, tribal, state, and local agencies as well as non-governmental organizations are forming collaboratives to address resource needs at multiple scales. Two studies are underway to explore the structure and function of forest collaboratives. One study examines forest collaboratives in Oregon, Washington and Idaho to understand the relationship between formal governance mechanisms and collaborative success. A second study examines social networks and community capacity in forest collaboratives in the Blue Mountains region of Oregon. Research Partners: Oregon State University Extension; Portland State University.
Human Ecology Mapping. This body of work explores how socio-spatial tools can be developed to collect information about human values, land uses, and forest benefits for use in forest planning. We began this work on the Olympic National Forest in Washington with a participatory mapping project to understand human-forest interactions on the landscape scale. We also helped the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest develop a protocol for collecting public use data on priority forest roads and destinations. A current project focuses on the Deschutes and Ochoco National Forests where we are developing a tool for gathering public information about special forest places. Research Partner: Portland State University, Institute for Sustainable Solutions.
Residential Location Decisions at the Urban-Wildland Interface. This project focuses on understanding the role of nature and public lands in shaping the values and residential choices of residents at the outer ring of King County (Seattle). Specifically, we seek to understand the factors that influence people to live in and move to suburban and exurban communities, the role of nature and public lands in their daily decisions, and the diversity of environmental values, attitudes, and behaviors held by suburban and exurban residents. Research Partner: Oregon State University.
Science, Planning and Decision-making in the Forest Service. Several studies have explored aspects of natural resource planning and decision-making. One study examined the role of values in resource planning and decision-making for riparian recreation. Another study investigated the interactions between scientists and managers and the role of scientific information in recreation decision-making. A third study explored implementation of the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA) and the use of scientific tools and interdisciplinary teams for NEPA projects in recreation and travel management. Two current studies investigate the role of social science information in forest planning. Research Partners: University of Washington; Virginia Tech University; Portland State University.
 
Research Interests
Natural resource governance, recreation and human use planning for public land management agencies, the public health benefits of public lands 
 
 
Past Research
Tourism and Community Change. Tourism is an industry that often sprouts in rural regions rich in natural and cultural resources. Tourism provides seasonal employment and also has the capacity to alter resident relationships with their communities and the environment. In 2000-2004, I conducted research on tourism in Southeast Alaska which is host to cruise ships, charter fishing guests, and adventure travelers. This resulted in several published technical reports, manuscripts, and a book, Nature and Tourists in the Last Frontier (2008). Tourism remains a research interest, although no current studies are underway.Forest Service Partnerships. This research on Forest Service partnerships was developed in consultation with the National Partnership Office, Washington, DC. This multi-phased study seeks to identify the types of partners working with the US Forest Service, the diversity of work in which partners are engaged, the structure and function of partnerships, motivations to partner, and the benefits and challenges associated with partnerships. The study is currently in its third phase, a national survey of 13 national forests. Research Partner: North Carolina State University.

Taylor Guitars - Taylor 214ce Deluxe ES2 Grand Auditorium A/E Guitar with Case, 6 String A 


                        Versatility is what Taylor Guitars is all about. If you are looking for an acoustic guitar that will serve you well in just about any musical situation, the Grand Auditorium 214ce Deluxe is your answer. Yet another marvelous creation from Taylor, its solid Sitka spruce top and layered rosewood back                        
                             and sides make the 214ce Deluxe the paragon of balanced sounding acoustic guitars. Perfect for recording in the studio, playing live, or just strumming in your living room, the 214ce Deluxe is a professional grade instrument that will not let you down. With outstanding features such as a full-gloss body, the original Taylor Expression System 2 acoustic electronics, diamond fretboard inlay, and a standard hardshell case, this guitar is one of the best values in its class on the market! Beginners and professionals alike will revel in the beautiful tones and design of the Taylor 214ce Deluxe. It looks great, sounds great, and feels wonderful in your hands. What else could you ask for in an acoustic guitar? Taylor 214ce Deluxe ES2 Grand Auditorium Acoustic Electric Guitar Features Solid Sitka spruce top Layered Rosewood Back and Sides Taylor Expression System® 2 Electronics Sapele Neck with Ebony Fingerboard Case Included Grand Auditorium (GA): Body Length: 20 / Body Width: 16 / Body Depth: 4 5/8 The popular Taylor Grand Auditorium body! In 1994, Taylor unveiled the mid-sized Grand Auditorium body style. It has since become their most popular and desirable shape, fitting nicely between the Dreadnought and Grand Concert guitar bodies. It was designed to take the best of both guitars, the fingerstyle playability of the Dreadnought and the flatpicking style of the Grand Concert, and meld the two. The result is a perfectly balanced and rounded tone that can project whether you are flatpicking, fingerpicking or strumming. The midrange tones are equally impressive, ringing clear no matter how hard the string is plucked. The Grand Auditorium 214ce Deluxe has become a favorite among singer-songwriters for its proficiency on the stage and its clarity in the studio. The guitar sits very well with other instruments in a mix and has become the trusty travel companion of touring musicians due to its smaller shape. If you’re looking for one guitar to cover a myriad of styles, the 214ce Deluxe is the way to go! As Taylor’s number one selling guitar shape, it is an instrument well-suited for even the most particular of players . Rosewood Back and Sides The Taylor 214ce Deluxe uses layered rosewood for its back and sides. The layered rosewood features an all-wood laminated construction, with inner and outer layers of beautiful Indian rosewood veneer, which are separated by a middle layer of poplar. Since solid wood guitars are known to produce a highly complex tonal quality, Taylor has constructed a way to utilize layered woods to highly rival those solid-body sounds. By using this method, the company is able to conserve more expensive tone wood, and thus build affordable professional instruments at a more palatable price point. The combination of solid spruce top and legendary Taylor craftsmanship put the finishing touches on an instrument that will project and ring with clarity. Expression System® 2 Taylor’s latest advancement in acoustic guitar amplification is The Taylor Expression System® 2 (ES2). Its revolutionary, proprietary behind-the-saddle pickup (patent pending) boasts three strategically placed and calibrated pickup sensors. Because of the placement of the sensors, a much wider dynamic range of acoustic sounds can be attained. The Expression System® 2 (ES2) teams up with Taylor’s professional grade preamp to produce incredible amplified sounds with unparalleled responsiveness. The Taylor 214ce Deluxe transcends its pristine acoustic properties whether plugged into a PA system or when directly recording into your favorite DAW. Similar to the original Expression System, the ES2 features the same volume and tone knob configurati

                             rear port that allows for better blending with a subwoofer. The curved enclosure design offers a rigid inert enclosure and reduces the internal surface resonance, giving you less bumping and more music. Its 3/4 ring radiator tweeter lends a smooth response and a transducer that uses Dynamic Balance driver technology to produce a flat frequency response for a balanced sound.

Definitive Technology SR-8040BP BiPolar Surround Speaker 


                        FeaturesBipolar dispersion pattern for totally enveloping surround sound that puts you in the actionMatching high quality drivers of that found in main and center Definitive Technolgy speakers for seamless sound stagingTwo 3-1/2 cast basket patented BDSS drivers and two 1 pure Alluminum dome                        
                             tweetersEasy wall mounting system includedThe SR-8040BP is built to the same high performance standards as Definitive Technology's main left and right front speakers and includes features like high-definition second generation patented BDSS bass/midrange drivers with butyl rubber surrounds, wide-dispersion pure aluminum dome tweeters, complex crossover networks and rock-solid cabinet construction. It can be mounted to a wall with the integrated keyhole plate or placed on a shelf or stand. However you use the SR-8040BP, you'll enjoy superior surround sound realism.The Bipolar AdvantageDefinitive's SR-8040BP surround speaker is a bipolar system containing two complete full-range speaker systems, one on each side of the cabinet. Bipolar radiation spreads the surround signals evenly throughout your room for a more enveloping sense of you-are-there realism than could be achieved with conventional forward-firing speakers.The SR-8040BP is a full-range, extremely linear, low-distortion system which is timbre-matched to blend perfectly with all Definitive BP series speakers as well as other high-quality speaker systems. The SR-8040BP wide dynamic range, high-definition sound quality and its bipolar radiation pattern results in total immersion in the musical event or movie soundstage.Bipolar Surrounds are Easy to UseDefinitive's bipolar surrounds are designed for easy and unobtrusive placement in your room. Easy-to-use mounting plates are included for wall mounting. Definitive's BP surround speakers may be located on the sides or rear of the room (or both as in 6.1 and 7.1 channel installations) with excellent results.Patented Technology Delivers High Definition and Wide DispersionDispersing the surround channel sound evenly over a broad area of the room is vital for creating the enveloping you're-in-the-action experience movie directors intend for you to experience. To achieve this, the SR series is engineered with the latest generation of ultra-high-definition midrange drivers that set new standards for wide dispersion and clean, accurate reproduction.The drivers used in the SR-8040BP are 3-1/2 second generation BDSS drivers. BDSS is Definitive's patented Balanced Double Surround System technology that supports the speaker cone at both the inner and outer edges allowing longer, more linear excursion for greater clarity and finely textured inner detail.

Klipsch Cornwall III Floor Standing Speakers 


                        Initially introduced in 1959, the Cornwall speaker was designed to serve as a larger, full-range alternative to the Heresy when used as a center channel speaker between two widely spaced Klipschorns. When it was discontinued in 1990, there was an outcry from consumers resulting in a letter-writing                        
                             campaign and even a petition to bring back this storied loudspeaker. This famed speaker, now dubbed the Cornwall III, is back and better than ever. A three-way design using horn-loaded compression drivers for the midrange and treble and a direct-radiating 15-inch woofer for the low frequencies, the Cornwall delivers the full-range bass response of the Klipschorn with sensitivity and output approaching the fully horn-loaded models.
