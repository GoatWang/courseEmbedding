Our History





  
  
                Our History        


	Envestnet is one of the largest providers of wealth management solutions to independent financial advisors today. See how we've grown since our beginnings in 1999.






 2016 
 Powering the Future of Advice 
Envestnet introduces a customizable smart client portal that can aggregate personal finances with investment accounts, all white-labeled for the advisor. Through our unified technology, end-clients can leverage a set of online tools that give them greater insight and control to chart their expenses and income, monitor cash flow, and determine net worth—all while providing a holistic view of their wealth. Our client portal is designed to make it easy for advisors to connect with clients during different stages of their financial life.
Also this year, Envestnet acquired Wheelhouse Analytics LLC, a technology company that provides data analytics, mobile sales solutions, and online education tools to financial advisors, asset managers, and enterprises. By combining Wheelhouse Analytics' tools with Yodlee’s industry-leading data and analytics solutions, Envestnet strengthens its data-driven insights that enable firms to better manage their businesses and client relationships and deliver better outcomes to their clients.
As of December 31, 2016, the Company has grown to serve more than 2000 enterprises in more than 15 countries, empower over 54,000 advisors, and surpassed $1 trillion in total platform assets.
  

 2015 
 Crossing the digital divide 
Envestnet announces the acquisition of Yodlee, Inc., the leading cloud-based platform for data aggregation, data analytics, and personal financial and wealth management. The acquisition enables investors and the advisors who serve them to access and make better sense out of their disparate and complicated financial picture. Combining Yodlee’s data aggregation and analytics expertise with Envestnet’s end-to-end unified wealth management platform will empower advisors to cross the digital divide and provide broader visibility into their clients’ financial well-being.
Also, this year, Envestnet acquired Finance Logix, a technology company that provides leading-edge financial planning and wealth management software solutions to banks, broker-dealers, and RIA firms, and Upside, a technology company providing digital advice solutions to financial advisors. Both firms enable Envestnet to further deliver technology innovation that will increase the relevance of the financial advisor.
  

 2014 
 Welcome Placemark 
Envestnet announces the acquisition of Placemark Holdings, Inc., a leading developer of Unified Managed Accounts (UMA) programs for banks, full-service broker-dealers, and RIA firms. The acquisition delivers immediate access to Envestnet’s full suite of wealth management services including advisor-driven portfolio management, rebalancing, and aggregated reporting solutions to existing Placemark clients. Conversely, Placemark’s portfolio overlay and tax optimization technologies will complement Envestnet | PMC’s product offerings.
As of October 1, 2014, the firm has grown to serve more than $683B in total platform assets—nearly double the assets since September 30, 2012—and nearly 2.8 million investor accounts. With the addition of Placemark, Envestnet has grown to more than 1,200 employees worldwide.
Additionally, Envestnet is recognized for several industry awards including Outsourcing Solution of the Year by the Family Wealth Report and Advisory Solutions Service Provider of the Year by Money Management Institute.  Visit our Awards page for a full list of firm accolades.                
  

 2013 
 Enhanced Technology and Innovation 
Envestnet introduces the next generation of its platform, ENV 2 that features an enhanced advisor console with access to macro risk analytical tools via a fully mobile end-to-end wealth management platform. In addition, the firm unveils Envestnet Intelligence, a groundbreaking platform enhancement set to provide our advisor-partners with the ability to benchmark their practice. The solution aims to deliver critical market insights, intelligence, and reporting—spanning all of an investor’s accounts—that enable more responsive and customized portfolio design, implementation, and communication.
An innovative new investment offering, Quantitative Portfolios, was also launched by Envestnet | PMC®. This new solution enables advisors to combine the benefits of low cost market access, similar to an exchange-traded fund, with the benefits of separately managed accounts, including active tax management and portfolio customization.
Additionally, Envestnet acquires the Wealth Management Solutions (WMS) division of Prudential Investments, a leading provider of wealth management products and services to banks and bank trust departments.
  

 2012 
 Welcome Prima and Tamarac 
Envestnet announces the acquisition of Prima Capital Holdings, Inc., a provider of investment manager due diligence, research applications, asset allocation modeling, and multi-manager portfolios to the wealth management and retirement industries, as well as the acquisition of Tamarac Inc., a provider of sophisticated portfolio management technology that enables registered investment advisers (RIAs) to efficiently deliver customized individual account management.
As one of the largest prevailing providers of technology-enabled wealth management solutions, the firm has grown to serve more than $316B in total platform assets and more than 1.5 million investor accounts as of June 30, 2012. With the addition of Prima and Tamarac, Envestnet now has more than 650 employees worldwide.
Additionally, in April, CEO Jud Bergman is named one of the "Top 25 Most Influential People in the Investment Advisory Business" by Investment Advisor magazine.
In May, Envestnet revitalizes its national conference—the Envestnet Advisor Summit—to an enthusiastic audience of nearly 600 attendees.
  

 2011 
 Introducing Vantage™ Reporting Solutions 
Envestnet introduces Vantage Reporting Solutions, the firm's premium aggregated performance reporting service, which enables advisors to attain a clear perspective on clients' entire financial landscape. Two key partnerships are established with ByAllAccounts Inc., a leader in data aggregation services, and DST Systems, Inc., a provider of sophisticated information processing and computer software.
Additionally, Envestnet continues to be recognized as a leader in the industry. Lori Hardwick, the firm's Executive Vice President of Advisory Services, is named one of the "Top 50 Women in Wealth" by AdvisorOne, a leading online media destination for independent advisors, wealth managers, and financial planners. And, the firm is highlighted on the cover of Investment Advisor magazine in June as "Agents of Change."
In December, Envestnet acquires FundQuest Inc., BNP Paribas' U.S. provider of fee-based managed services and solutions. The firm grows to more than 928,000 investor accounts with more than $139B in total platform assets.
 
 
  

 2010 
 The Fiduciary Opportunity and Envestnet Goes Public 
Envestnet responds to growing concerns about trust in the financial industry and creates thought leadership around advisors' fiduciary responsibility. The firm unveils "Fiduciary Oversight Notes," a platform tool that offers the ability to document decision-making on behalf of clients. Outreach regarding the "Fiduciary Opportunity" garners Envestnet significant attention and a cover story in Financial Planning magazine.
Additionally, the firm introduces a Unified Managed Household (UMH) offering, which empowers advisors to analyze and report on all of a client's assets, including those not managed by the advisor.
On July 29, Envestnet goes public, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ENV. The firm grows to more than $139B in total platform assets and more than 910,000 investor accounts. More than 21,500 advisors now work with Envestnet.
  

 2009 
 Adding Depth to Investing Solutions 
Envestnet introduces three new investing solutions: an enhanced version of the UMA that enable a higher degree of customization capabilities; PlanHorizon, a time-segmented distribution retirement program; and data aggregation services that offer technology integration of various assets and enhanced reporting.
Additionally, Envestnet|PMC introduces PMC Tax Management Services, a tax solution that can be used to unlock frozen assets and the Ultra-Short Fixed Income Portfolios, an attractive alternative to prevailing low money market fund yields.
The firm grows to more than 400 employees with more than $89B in total platform assets and more than 685,000 investor accounts. By year-end, more than 900 firms have service contracts with Envestnet.

Additionally, Envestnet signs a service agreement with another major independent broker-dealer to deliver service, support, and technology to 1,500 financial advisors nationwide.
The firm grows to more than $82B in total platform assets and more than 598,000 investor accounts. By year-end, more than 550 firms have service contracts with Envestnet.

In December, Envestnet is named Forbes Magazine's "Best of the Web."
  

 2000 
 Entering the Field 
Envestnet launches its technology platform for wealth management with two major custodial options, Schwab Institutional and Pershing Advisory Services. Headquartered in Chicago with an office in New York, the firm has 50 employees.
  

 1999 
 Realizing a Vision 
Our founder and CEO, Jud Bergman, an accomplished leader in the asset management industry, recognizes that newly independent advisors would need a software "desktop" that integrates the complex set of services and capabilities required to run a wealth management practice. He assembles a seasoned team of former colleagues and industry peers and together, they begin development of a wealth management platform that will provide advisors with the tools necessary to meet the growing expectations of investors.

DALLAS, May 2, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Envestnet (NYSE:   ENV), a leading provider of integrated portfolio, practice management, and reporting solutions to financial advisors and institutions, today announced an expanded data analytics product lineup that harnesses the power of data intelligence to efficiently uncover growth opportunities and provide critical insights for Envestnet, Yodlee, and Tamarac clients.








With Envestnet Analytics, wealth advisory enterprises, investment managers, and advisors can leverage data intelligence through robust analytics solutions that help to answer their most essential business questions. Today at the Envestnet Advisor Summit, the company introduces seven new modules expanding its analytics, forecasting, and performance reporting services for Envestnet, Yodlee, and Tamarac clients. 
Envestnet is turning data intelligence into real, meaningful and practical analytics solutions that help our clients answer their most important business and personal financial questions. "Knowing the right questions to ask is more important than having all the answers, which is where Envestnet Analytics comes into play," said Frank Coates, Executive Managing Director of Envestnet | Yodlee. "Our domain expertise and cutting edge data science tools, coupled with our vast data resources, allow us to define and answer the really important questions for businesses and individuals."
One of the key modules is the Envestnet Fee Analytics offering that enables advisors to easily and efficiently set competitive fees, ensure they address any regulatory fee issues, and analyze their fees for compliance purposes through the use of comprehensive, user-friendly dashboards. These dashboards provide actionable benchmarks that allow for comparison of account level fees across advisors within the user's firm, against the user's industry segment, and against the industry as a whole. 
"The newly enhanced Envestnet Analytics offering helps financial advisors and investment managers who often face difficulty finding a deep level of business intelligence that is specific to their firms and helps them analyze key competitive factors like fees and performance in a quick, cost-effective way," said Bill Crager, President of Envestnet. 
"Leveraging the data intelligence tools from Envestnet Analytics, we have supercharged our multi-asset class investment business with analytics. They have helped us focus on and measure the essential drivers of success that enable us to better serve the financial advisors and investors we have the privilege to work with," said Noreen D. Beaman, CEO of Brinker Capital.
