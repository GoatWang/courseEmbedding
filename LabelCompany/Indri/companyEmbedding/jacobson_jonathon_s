Jon Jacobson previously worked at Harvard Management Co which provided $500 million of the $1.5 billion Highfields raised in 1998. Highfields Capital returned around 12.6% between 1998 and 2010, vs. 3.6% return for the S&P 500 index during the same time period.   Jonathon Jacobson and Richard Grubman founded Highfields Capital Management in 1998. Jon Jacobson previously worked at Harvard Management Co which provided $500 million of the $1.5 billion Highfields raised in 1998. Highfields Capital returned around 12.6% between 1998 and 2010, vs. 3.6% return for the S&P 500 index during the same time period.Jonathon Jacobson has admitted that the holy grail of value investing- a good company trading at a cheap price- is very elusive in the modern financial markets, even with the resources of a hedge fund research team. As a result he claims that Highfields end up looking at unattractive businesses which carry low valuations because the market expects that poor performance to continue. If the price is low enough, or if the company’s struggles have been due to problems which are getting weaker, then it might be a buy.Considering that the hedge fund tends to manage a moderately concentrated portfolio- in its most recent 13F filing, the six largest positions were responsible for about 40% of the reported investments- it seems to us that the fund doesn’t need to find too many “close enough” picks to match its large size as long as it can invest high amounts of capital. The smallest of these six largest positions was over $350 million. In turn, the large size of the positions and the concentration of the portfolio generally results in fairly long holding periods for Highfields; Jonathon Jacobson has claimed that a holding period can be two to three years. Between September 2011 and September 2012 the same three stocks have held the top three slots in the fund’s 13F portfolio according to our database of filings, and two more of the most recent top six had Highfields report a position of at least $200 million a year earlier.

Jonathon S. Jacobson founded Highfields Capital Management LP in July 1998. Prior to founding Highfields, he spent eight years as a senior equity portfolio manager at Harvard Management Company, Inc. ("HMC"), which is responsible for investing Harvard University's endowment. At HMC, Mr. Jacobson managed both a U.S. and an Emerging Markets equity fund. From 1987 to 1990, he was Vice President in the Equity Arbitrage Group at Lehman Brothers in New York, where he managed a proprietary trading account focused on options-oriented arbitrage strategies. From 1983 to 1985, he was an investment banking analyst at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New York and Sydney, Australia.
Mr. Jacobson currently serves as a Director of CC Media Holdings, Inc. and is a member of the Asset Managers' Committee of the President's Working Group on Financial Markets, which was formed in 2007 to foster a dialogue with the Federal Reserve Board and Department of the Treasury on issues of significance to the investment industry.
Mr. Jacobson is devoted to numerous philanthropic causes. He is a Trustee of Brandeis University, where he is a member of both the Executive and Investment Committees, and Gilman School, where he also serves on the investment committee. He also serves on the boards of the Birthright Israel Foundation and Facing History and Ourselves and is a member of the Board of Dean's Advisors at the Harvard Business School. Mr. Jacobson received an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School in 1987 and graduated magna cum laude with a B.S. in Economics from the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania in 1983.

TIMELINE
1960 Born, Framingham, Massachusetts
1982 Earns BA, International Relations, University of Pennsylvania
1982 Joins Greenwich Associates
1987 Earns MBA
1987 Joins Colgate–Palmolive, Product Manager
1991 Named SVP of Marketing and Product Development, Converse
1994 Joins Core Strategy Group, Partner
1996 Named President, Keds
2002 Launches Strategic Grant Partners
2013 SGP has granted more than $40 million to 30 organizations

Joanna Jacobson has worked since she was 13–at a summer camp, a camera shop, and, during high school, a gas station. "I pumped gas on the Hutchinson River Parkway," she says. "I worked all summer and three to eleven o'clock during the school year." Hard work, exceeding expectations, and remarkable success have been constant themes throughout Jacobson's life.
At the University of Pennsylvania, Jacobson studied international relations with a specialization in China. After college, she worked in operations at Greenwich Associates and was soon promoted to run the department. "I learned that I loved business. I also learned how much I didn't know," she says. Greenwich CEO Charley Ellis (MBA 1963) encouraged her to apply to HBS, and with the company profit-sharing program, she was able to finance her graduate education.
"I was hell-bent on making the most of the opportunity at HBS," says Jacobson, noting that initially she turned down a date from her future husbancd (classmate Jonathon Jacobson) because she didn't want to be distracted from her studies. Soon after arriving at Soldiers Field, Jacobson realized her ability to listen and express herself meshed well with the skills needed to thrive at HBS. "The case method is spectacularly good at opening people's ears to others and requiring them to make an articulate argument," she observes.
Having discovered a passion for marketing at HBS, Jacobson moved to New York to join Colgate-Palmolive and was promoted to product management in the US toothpaste business. When Jon accepted a position at Harvard Management Company in Boston, the pair commuted for nine months until Joanna relocated, eventually accepting a position as SVP of marketing for Converse, which was in bankruptcy at the time. "I had to convince the board and CEO that Nike was a serious competitive threat," recalls Jacobson, who also led the product development team. "It was an incredible turnaround. The team grew the company by $200 million."
With Converse back on its feet, in 1994 Jacobson left to work as a consultant and was then recruited to join Keds, as president. "The Keds' tagline was 'They Feel Good,' yet the employees were wearing Reeboks," she recounts. "So I established new rules—don't bring a shoe in for a line review unless it feels good to the consumer, meaning comfortable, and feels good to shareholders, meaning profitable." She also introduced new product and marketing concept lines around comfort. Jacobson and her team reversed Keds' 25 percent annual sales  declines with double-digit growth in sales and profits. After a few years, the parent company, Stride Rite, wanted to promote her to COO.
"The position required working six days a week. With three young children, this opportunity wasn't the life I wanted at that point," says Jacobson, who resigned, then taught at HBS, consulted, and began to focus on philanthropy. She and Jon had started a family foundation and were interested in finding ways to have an impact on society's most difficult problems.
"In 2002, 'venture philanthropy' as we know it today didn't exist, but we saw the opportunity to use business practices to create real social change," says Jacobson of the origins of Strategic Grant Partners, a coalition of 15 family foundations that she cofounded. With the strategy of "great leaders, game-changing ideas," SGP is both a foundation and a pro bono consulting firm focusing on nonprofit scale and systemic change, primarily in Massachusetts. "We find social entrepreneurs with promising ideas and work alongside them as partners to  achieve success," she says, noting that their work centers on education, youth development, and economic self-sufficiency.
SGP's track record speaks for itself, having helped to launch or scale many of Massachusetts's most effective social ventures, several of which have gone national. In the past 10 years, SGP has completed four rounds of funding, the most recent totaling $36 million. "We identify people who are smart and passionate. We invest in them and provide strategic and tactical support to ensure their success."
Helping others do their best work, in fact, is what drives Joanna Jacobson, whether she's turning around a failing sneaker company or coaching the CEO of a charter school management organization. "I love working with spectacular people and helping break down the barriers that stand in their way."
