Seasoned software executive brings rich experience across enterprise and SMB markets to contribute to Jive's growth plan

PALO ALTO, Calif., Aug. 10, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Jive Software, Inc. (Nasdaq: JIVE) today named Jeff Lautenbach as its new president of worldwide field operations. Lautenbach will lead the company's sales, business development and indirect channels around the globe, with a focus on accelerating Jive's growth and advancing its position as the world's leading provider of modern communications and collaboration solutions for business.

"Jeff brings a proven, successful track record of leading go-to-market strategies across all types of markets in every industry – from large health systems to emerging and medium-sized tech companies," said Elisa Steele, CEO of Jive Software. "As we make progress on our strategic priorities and continued product innovation, Jeff's global experience and operational excellence will be instrumental in helping expand our reach in both new and existing markets."
Lautenbach brings extensive experience in building cloud and SaaS businesses to scale and leading direct and indirect teams, including tours at both Salesforce.com, where he ran commercial sales for North America, and SAP, where he was responsible for the global CRM business. He also spent nearly 20 years with IBM, leading over 1,300 sales and technical professionals that supported IBM's software customers. In addition, Lautenbach most recently served as chief revenue officer at hc1.com, where he led all go-to-market strategies for the rapidly growing cloud healthcare relationship management company. Lautenbach will join Jive August 25 and report directly to Steele.
"One of the biggest trends I've observed over the past several years is a significant shift in how companies create personal digital relationships with their customers and employees. Jive has set the standard that all businesses want to reach and as a result, interactive intranets and external communities are no longer a nice-to-have but a must-have in order to compete," said Lautenbach. "There's still a massive untapped opportunity in the market for innovative new communications and collaboration solutions, and Jive is the clear leader right in the heart of this exciting space."
About Jive SoftwareJive (Nasdaq: JIVE) is the leading provider of modern communication and collaboration solutions for business. Recognized as a leader by the industry's top analyst firms in multiple categories, Jive enables employees, partners and customers to work better together. More information can be found at www.jivesoftware.com or the Jive News Blog.
