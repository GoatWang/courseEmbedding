Leon G. "Lee" Cooperman (born April 25, 1943) is an American investor, hedge fund manager, and philanthropist. He is the chairman and CEO of Omega Advisors,[2] a New York-based investment advisory firm managing over $3.5 billion in assets under management, the majority consisting of his personal wealth.
On September 21, 2016 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged Cooperman and Omega Advisors with insider trading, more specifically for "trading stocks, bonds and call options of Atlas Pipeline Partners in July 2010 on information he obtained from an executive at the company."[3] Cooperman has denied these charges saying they were "totally without merit," and his attorney has argued that "no court has upheld a misappropriation theory of insider trading based on a purported promise to keep information confidential (or to refrain from trading) made after the information was acquired.""[4][5]

Early life and education[edit]
Cooperman was born to a Jewish[6] family in the South Bronx, New York City.[7] He is the son of immigrants from Poland.[8] Cooperman was the first in his family to earn a college degree.[9][10] As an undergraduate at Hunter College, Cooperman joined and was an active member of the Alpha Epsilon Pi. After graduating, he became a quality control engineer at Xerox in 1965.[1] Cooperman later received his MBA from Columbia Business School, graduating in 1967.[11]
Investment career[edit]
Early career and Goldman Sachs[edit]
Directly after graduating from Columbia, Cooperman joined Goldman Sachs. He spent his first twenty two years at Goldman in the Investment Research Department as partner-in-charge, co-chairman of the Investment Policy Committee and chairman of the Stock Selection Committee. In 1989, he became chairman and chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs Asset Management[12][13] and was chief investment officer of the equity product line including managing the GS Capital Growth Fund, an open-end mutual fund, for one and one-half years.[14]
While at Goldman Sachs, for nine consecutive years, Cooperman was voted the number-one portfolio strategist in the Institutional Investor "All-America Research Team" survey.[15][16]
At the end of 1991 after twenty five years of service, Cooperman retired from his positions as a general partner of Goldman, Sachs & Co. and as chairman and chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs Asset Management.[17]
Founding of Omega[edit]
After leaving Goldman Sachs, he organized a private investment partnership,Omega Advisors, Inc.[18][19][20][21]
2016 SEC investigation[edit]
On September 21, 2016, Cooperman was charged with insider trading by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.[5][22] He denied the charges.[23][24][25] Cooperman faces criminal charges in a related parallel proceeding and has asserted his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination before a SEC hearing.[26] In May 2017 Cooperman's firm agreed to a $4.9 million settlement with the SEC. As part of the agreement, Omega Advisers admitted no wrongdoing. Following the settlement, Cooperman commented: "The process in my opinion was totally abusive. It's a problem that the government should address,"[27]
Personal life[edit]
With his wife Toby, he has two sons, Wayne and Michael, and three grandchildren.[6][28][29][9] Since the late 1970s, Cooperman has been a resident of the Short Hills neighborhood of Millburn, New Jersey.[30] He has an honorary doctorate in finance from Roger Williams University in Rhode Island.[31][32][33]
Political and economic views[edit]
In November 2011, Cooperman gained attention for an open letter to U.S. President Barack Obama in which among other things charged the president with engaging in class warfare.[34][35] This letter has been characterized by Joseph Palermo of The Huffington Post as a rant bemoaning the mistreatment of billionaires by the president and his "minions" (Cooperman's word).[36]
Wealth and philanthropy[edit]
He and his wife Toby are signators of The Giving Pledge[37] and manage the Leon and Toby Cooperman Family Foundation. In 2012, Cooperman was included in the 50 Most Influential list of Bloomberg Markets magazine.[38] Forbes listed him as one of the 40 Highest-Earning hedge fund managers in 2013,[39] and the next year it listed him among the top 25.[40]
Cooperman has a long history of supporting Columbia Business School. In 2011, he donated $25 million to support the expansion of the school's campus. In 2007, he created the Cooperman Scholarship Challenge, helping to create over 40 need based scholarships. In 2000, he established the Leon Cooperman Scholarship to support financial aid for need based students. In 1995, he endowed the Leon Cooperman Professorship of Finance and Economics.[41]
Cooperman was the first in the country to endow Birthright Israel, a program that sends Jews aged 18–26 on free short-term visits to Israel to promote Jewish identity. Cooperman states: "We are very proud of our religion, our heritage, the many accomplishments of the Jewish people, and the enormous contribution they make to society. But we are very concerned about the pace of assimilation and really the disappearance of the Jewish religion. Through intermarriage and rapid assimilation, we’re disappearing. We’re trying to make our effort to help either slow that down or reverse it.”[6]
He is also a founding Master Player of the Portfolios with Purpose virtual stock trading contest.[42]
In April 2014, the Leon and Toby Cooperman Family Foundation pledged $25 million to the Saint Barnabas Medical Center for the construction of a new 200,000 square-foot Cooperman Family Pavilion.[43]
He is on the board of the Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation.[15][44]

Leon G. "Lee" Cooperman (born April 25, 1943) is an American investor, hedge fund manager, and philanthropist.

On September 21, 2016 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged Cooperman and Omega Advisors with insider trading, more specifically for "trading stocks, bonds and call options of Atlas Pipeline Partners in July 2010 on information he obtained from an executive at the company."[3] Cooperman has denied these charges saying they were "totally without merit," and his attorney has argued that "no court has upheld a misappropriation theory of insider trading based on a purported promise to keep information confidential (or to refrain from trading) made after the information was acquired.""[4][5]

Early life and education[edit]
Cooperman was born to a Jewish[6] family in the South Bronx, New York City.[7] He is the son of immigrants from Poland.[8] Cooperman was the first in his family to earn a college degree.[9][10] As an undergraduate at Hunter College, Cooperman joined and was an active member of the Alpha Epsilon Pi. After graduating, he became a quality control engineer at Xerox in 1965.[1] Cooperman later received his MBA from Columbia Business School, graduating in 1967.[11]
Investment career[edit]
Early career and Goldman Sachs[edit]
Directly after graduating from Columbia, Cooperman joined Goldman Sachs. He spent his first twenty two years at Goldman in the Investment Research Department as partner-in-charge, co-chairman of the Investment Policy Committee and chairman of the Stock Selection Committee. In 1989, he became chairman and chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs Asset Management[12][13] and was chief investment officer of the equity product line including managing the GS Capital Growth Fund, an open-end mutual fund, for one and one-half years.[14]
While at Goldman Sachs, for nine consecutive years, Cooperman was voted the number-one portfolio strategist in the Institutional Investor "All-America Research Team" survey.[15][16]
At the end of 1991 after twenty five years of service, Cooperman retired from his positions as a general partner of Goldman, Sachs & Co. and as chairman and chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs Asset Management.[17]
Founding of Omega[edit]
After leaving Goldman Sachs, he organized a private investment partnership,Omega Advisors, Inc.[18][19][20][21]
2016 SEC investigation[edit]
On September 21, 2016, Cooperman was charged with insider trading by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.[5][22] He denied the charges.[23][24][25] Cooperman faces criminal charges in a related parallel proceeding and has asserted his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination before a SEC hearing.[26] In May 2017 Cooperman's firm agreed to a $4.9 million settlement with the SEC. As part of the agreement, Omega Advisers admitted no wrongdoing. Following the settlement, Cooperman commented: "The process in my opinion was totally abusive. It's a problem that the government should address,"[27]
Personal life[edit]
With his wife Toby, he has two sons, Wayne and Michael, and three grandchildren.[6][28][29][9] Since the late 1970s, Cooperman has been a resident of the Short Hills neighborhood of Millburn, New Jersey.[30] He has an honorary doctorate in finance from Roger Williams University in Rhode Island.[31][32][33]
Political and economic views[edit]
In November 2011, Cooperman gained attention for an open letter to U.S. President Barack Obama in which among other things charged the president with engaging in class warfare.[34][35] This letter has been characterized by Joseph Palermo of The Huffington Post as a rant bemoaning the mistreatment of billionaires by the president and his "minions" (Cooperman's word).[36]
Wealth and philanthropy[edit]
He and his wife Toby are signators of The Giving Pledge[37] and manage the Leon and Toby Cooperman Family Foundation. In 2012, Cooperman was included in the 50 Most Influential list of Bloomberg Markets magazine.[38] Forbes listed him as one of the 40 Highest-Earning hedge fund managers in 2013,[39] and the next year it listed him among the top 25.[40]
Cooperman has a long history of supporting Columbia Business School. In 2011, he donated $25 million to support the expansion of the school's campus. In 2007, he created the Cooperman Scholarship Challenge, helping to create over 40 need based scholarships. In 2000, he established the Leon Cooperman Scholarship to support financial aid for need based students. In 1995, he endowed the Leon Cooperman Professorship of Finance and Economics.[41]
Cooperman was the first in the country to endow Birthright Israel, a program that sends Jews aged 18–26 on free short-term visits to Israel to promote Jewish identity. Cooperman states: "We are very proud of our religion, our heritage, the many accomplishments of the Jewish people, and the enormous contribution they make to society. But we are very concerned about the pace of assimilation and really the disappearance of the Jewish religion. Through intermarriage and rapid assimilation, we’re disappearing. We’re trying to make our effort to help either slow that down or reverse it.”[6]
He is also a founding Master Player of the Portfolios with Purpose virtual stock trading contest.[42]
In April 2014, the Leon and Toby Cooperman Family Foundation pledged $25 million to the Saint Barnabas Medical Center for the construction of a new 200,000 square-foot Cooperman Family Pavilion.[43]
He is on the board of the Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation.[15][44]

Leon G. "Lee" Cooperman (born April 25, 1943) is an American investor, hedge fund manager, and philanthropist. He is the chairman and CEO of Omega Advisors,[2] a New York-based investment advisory firm managing over $3.5 billion in assets under management, the majority consisting of his personal wealth.
On September 21, 2016 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged Cooperman and Omega Advisors with insider trading, more specifically for "trading stocks, bonds and call options of Atlas Pipeline Partners in July 2010 on information he obtained from an executive at the company."[3] Cooperman has denied these charges saying they were "totally without merit," and his attorney has argued that "no court has upheld a misappropriation theory of insider trading based on a purported promise to keep information confidential (or to refrain from trading) made after the information was acquired.""[4][5]

Early life and education[edit]
Cooperman was born to a Jewish[6] family in the South Bronx, New York City.[7] He is the son of immigrants from Poland.[8] Cooperman was the first in his family to earn a college degree.[9][10] As an undergraduate at Hunter College, Cooperman joined and was an active member of the Alpha Epsilon Pi. After graduating, he became a quality control engineer at Xerox in 1965.[1] Cooperman later received his MBA from Columbia Business School, graduating in 1967.[11]
Investment career[edit]
Early career and Goldman Sachs[edit]
Directly after graduating from Columbia, Cooperman joined Goldman Sachs. He spent his first twenty two years at Goldman in the Investment Research Department as partner-in-charge, co-chairman of the Investment Policy Committee and chairman of the Stock Selection Committee. In 1989, he became chairman and chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs Asset Management[12][13] and was chief investment officer of the equity product line including managing the GS Capital Growth Fund, an open-end mutual fund, for one and one-half years.[14]
While at Goldman Sachs, for nine consecutive years, Cooperman was voted the number-one portfolio strategist in the Institutional Investor "All-America Research Team" survey.[15][16]
At the end of 1991 after twenty five years of service, Cooperman retired from his positions as a general partner of Goldman, Sachs & Co. and as chairman and chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs Asset Management.[17]
Founding of Omega[edit]
After leaving Goldman Sachs, he organized a private investment partnership,Omega Advisors, Inc.[18][19][20][21]
2016 SEC investigation[edit]
On September 21, 2016, Cooperman was charged with insider trading by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.[5][22] He denied the charges.[23][24][25] Cooperman faces criminal charges in a related parallel proceeding and has asserted his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination before a SEC hearing.[26] In May 2017 Cooperman's firm agreed to a $4.9 million settlement with the SEC. As part of the agreement, Omega Advisers admitted no wrongdoing. Following the settlement, Cooperman commented: "The process in my opinion was totally abusive. It's a problem that the government should address,"[27]
Personal life[edit]
With his wife Toby, he has two sons, Wayne and Michael, and three grandchildren.[6][28][29][9] Since the late 1970s, Cooperman has been a resident of the Short Hills neighborhood of Millburn, New Jersey.[30] He has an honorary doctorate in finance from Roger Williams University in Rhode Island.[31][32][33]
Political and economic views[edit]
In November 2011, Cooperman gained attention for an open letter to U.S. President Barack Obama in which among other things charged the president with engaging in class warfare.[34][35] This letter has been characterized by Joseph Palermo of The Huffington Post as a rant bemoaning the mistreatment of billionaires by the president and his "minions" (Cooperman's word).[36]
Wealth and philanthropy[edit]
He and his wife Toby are signators of The Giving Pledge[37] and manage the Leon and Toby Cooperman Family Foundation. In 2012, Cooperman was included in the 50 Most Influential list of Bloomberg Markets magazine.[38] Forbes listed him as one of the 40 Highest-Earning hedge fund managers in 2013,[39] and the next year it listed him among the top 25.[40]
Cooperman has a long history of supporting Columbia Business School. In 2011, he donated $25 million to support the expansion of the school's campus. In 2007, he created the Cooperman Scholarship Challenge, helping to create over 40 need based scholarships. In 2000, he established the Leon Cooperman Scholarship to support financial aid for need based students. In 1995, he endowed the Leon Cooperman Professorship of Finance and Economics.[41]
Cooperman was the first in the country to endow Birthright Israel, a program that sends Jews aged 18–26 on free short-term visits to Israel to promote Jewish identity. Cooperman states: "We are very proud of our religion, our heritage, the many accomplishments of the Jewish people, and the enormous contribution they make to society. But we are very concerned about the pace of assimilation and really the disappearance of the Jewish religion. Through intermarriage and rapid assimilation, we’re disappearing. We’re trying to make our effort to help either slow that down or reverse it.”[6]
He is also a founding Master Player of the Portfolios with Purpose virtual stock trading contest.[42]
In April 2014, the Leon and Toby Cooperman Family Foundation pledged $25 million to the Saint Barnabas Medical Center for the construction of a new 200,000 square-foot Cooperman Family Pavilion.[43]
He is on the board of the Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation.[15][44]

Fund Accused of Insider Trading


Was hedge fund pioneer Leon Cooperman turned in by his own son? “It could be a Shakespearean drama,” said Alexandra Stevenson, a New York Times reporter.

Leon G. Cooperman, one of the early titans of the hedge fund industry, is gearing up for the biggest fight of his career: preserving his Wall Street legacy as regulators accuse him and his multibillion-dollar firm of insider trading.The stakes are high, too, for the Securities and Exchange Commission, which on Wednesday sued Mr. Cooperman, a 73-year-old billionaire, accusing his firm, Omega Advisors, of reaping $4 million in illegal profit by using nonpublic information about an energy deal in 2010. The case is the most prominent to be brought by the agency since a court ruling that narrowed the definition of insider trading.Hours after the civil complaint was filed, Mr. Cooperman fired back with a detailed five-page rebuttal sent to investors. He followed with a defiant conference call, opening with an off-color joke about an 80-year-old man bragging about having sex with an 18-year-old woman. He told investors on the call that he had refused to settle and that he would fight the S.E.C. in court.The stage is set for what is expected to be a no-holds-barred legal battle between a gruff, outspoken investor and an agency that has come under criticism for not taking more cases to trial.

Mr. Cooperman, the son of a South Bronx plumber, is known for not holding back. In 2011, he wrote a much publicized “open letter” accusing President Obama of “villainizing the American dream” and the wealthy. Continue reading the main story

“It took me 50 years of hard work and playing by the rules to get where I got. I’m not going to let these people destroy my legacy,” Mr. Cooperman told investors on Wednesday.Regulators contend that Mr. Cooperman used his position as one of the biggest shareholders in Atlas Pipeline Partners to gain confidential information from an unidentified executive at the company about the sale of one of its gas-processing facilities to another energy company in July 2010.Mr. Cooperman had assured the executive that he would not trade on the information, but regulators said that despite making that promise, he had his firm accumulate a bigger position and profited when Atlas’s stock jumped 31 percent after the sale was announced.The case also involves some family drama. Mr. Cooperman’s timely trades indirectly benefited a grandson, whose account Mr. Cooperman managed. Regulators said the money manager bought an Atlas Pipeline bond that rose in value after the deal.And in another twist, Mr. Cooperman’s son, Wayne, who runs another hedge fund, may get drawn into the fray because of his own trading in the same stock.In his letter, Mr. Cooperman said his son was prepared to testify on his behalf, noting that his son’s fund, Cobalt Capital Management, was betting against shares of Atlas Pipeline at the time and he is one of the biggest investors in his son’s firm.Mr. Cooperman said he did not share any information about the sale of the gas-processing facility with his son.

In the complaint, however, the S.E.C. quoted an email that Mr. Cooperman sent to an unidentified relative — described as the manager of another hedge fund — informing him of the yet-unannounced $682 million deal. This same relative may have been the first to have sounded the alarm about unusual trading in shares and options of Atlas Pipeline the day the deal was announced, according to the S.E.C. 



                Document            

                Insider Trading Charges Against Cooperman            

                The S.E.C. charged hedge fund manager Leon G. Cooperman and his firm Omega Advisors with insider trading.            








                    OPEN Document                




In a separate email, the relative writes to an executive at Atlas Pipeline, calling the options trading before the sale announcement “fishy” and “shady.” The relative goes on to say that “somebody should investigate” and then asks: “How do I become a whistle-blower.”Mr. Cooperman’s son did not return a phone call seeking comment. But his firm did buy shares in Atlas Pipeline later in 2010, according to regulatory filings. Wayne Cooperman has not been charged with any wrongdoing.Regulators also contended that Mr. Cooperman tried to conceal his actions after Omega received a subpoena relating to the Atlas trades some 17 months later by contacting one of Atlas’s executives in an attempt to “fabricate” a cover story in the event that either man was questioned by regulators about the trade.

Mr. Cooperman “allegedly undermined the public confidence in the securities markets and took advantage of other investors who did not have this information,” Andrew J. Ceresney, the S.E.C.’s chief of enforcement, said in a statement.The civil case against Mr. Cooperman, filed in the Federal District Court in Philadelphia, would appear to sidestep a monkey wrench thrown into some insider trading prosecutions by a recent appellate court decision. That ruling made it more difficult to charge someone with insider trading if the person improperly leaking confidential information was not getting a personal benefit of some consequence.The personal benefit issue would not seem to arise in this matter because regulators contend that Mr. Cooperman “misappropriated” the confidential information about the impending sale from the unidentified executive at Atlas Pipeline.Ted Wells and Daniel Kramer, his lawyers at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, issued a statement in which they called the allegations “entirely baseless.”Mr. Cooperman said he was being charged with trading on paper gains and added that his firm never sold shares after the deal was announced. He said much of the firm’s trading was related to short-term positions in a stock that the firm had been bullish on for many years.

In some insider trading cases, hedge fund managers have been forced to shut their firms and return money to investors. On Wednesday, Mr. Cooperman emphasized that 35 percent of Omega Advisors’ $5.4 billion in assets under management belonged to members of the firm and that business would continue as usual. He added, however, that if the firm concluded that the S.E.C. case had “become too much of a distraction,” it would voluntarily give back money.Omega is the second large hedge fund to be rocked by an insider trading investigation this year.In June, securities regulators and federal prosecutors charged a top manager at Visium Asset Management with insider trading. The manager, Sanjay Valvani, committed suicide a week later. Visium’s founder, Jacob Gottlieb, whom the authorities did not charge, is in the process of shuttering the hedge fund after selling some of its funds to AllianceBernstein.The two cases show that insider trading remains an issue in the nearly $3 trillion hedge fund industry even after a sweeping crackdown by federal prosecutors in Manhattan. That push led to convictions and guilty pleas from more than 80 people, including Raj Rajaratnam, the billionaire co-founder of the Galleon Group. Another firm, SAC Capital Advisors, a one-time $14 billion hedge fund, pleaded guilty to insider trading and paid $1.8 billion in fines to federal authorities.In the civil complaint on Wednesday, the S.E.C. also accused Mr. Cooperman of failing to report in a timely manner information about his hedge fund’s holdings and other transactions in publicly traded companies in violation of federal securities laws more than 40 times.Regulators said Mr. Cooperman “repeatedly violated” federal securities laws requiring investors to disclose when their equity interest in a publicly traded company rises above either a 5 or 10 percent stake.Speaking at a private charity event in June at the Metropolitan Club in Manhattan, Mr. Cooperman addressed the looming investigation, telling the Wall Street audience, “I call companies, that’s what I do for a living.”He said: “Every time I speak with a company I say the same thing: Don’t disenfranchise me if I ask you a question. Don’t answer a question if you’re not prepared to give anyone else that information, just tell me it’s confidential and we’ll move on.”

 Correction: September 23, 2016  
An article on Thursday about a federal insider trading suit against Leon G. Cooperman, founder of the hedge fund Omega Advisors, rendered incorrectly the name of another firm where a top manager was charged in June with insider trading. It is Visium Asset Management, not Visium Asset Manager.

  At Goldman Sachs, Lee spent 15 years as partner and, from 1990 to 1991, as counsel to the management committee. In 1989 he became chairman and chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs Asset Management and was chief investment officer of the equity product line, including managing the GS Capital Growth Fund, an open-end mutual fund, for one and a half years. Prior to those appointments, Lee spent 22 years in the investment research department as partner-in-charge, co-chairman of the Investment Policy Committee and chairman of the Stock Selection Committee. For nine consecutive years, Lee was voted the No. 1 portfolio strategist in the Institutional Investor All-America Research Team survey. 
  As a designated chartered financial analyst, Lee is a senior member and past president of the New York Society of Security Analysts. Lee is chairman emeritus of the Saint Barnabas Development Foundation, a member of the board of overseers of the Columbia University Graduate School of Business, a member of the board of directors of the Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation, a member of the investment committee of the New Jersey Performing Arts Center and board chairman of Green Spaces, a committee organized to rebuild 13 parks in Newark, New Jersey. 








  Lee received his MBA from Columbia University and his undergraduate degree from Hunter College.  He is a recipient of Roger Williams University's Honorary Doctor of Finance and a recipient of Hunter College's Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters, was inducted to Hunter College's Hall of Fame, is a recipient of the 2003 American Jewish Committee Humanitarian Award, the 2006 Seton Hall Humanitarian of the Year Award, the 2009 Boys & Girls Clubs of Newark Award for Caring, and the 2009 UJA-Federation of New York's Wall Street and Financial Services Division Lifetime Achievement Award.

Leon G. "Lee" Cooperman (born April 25, 1943) is an American investor, hedge fund manager, and philanthropist. He is the chairman and CEO of Omega Advisors,[2] a New York-based investment advisory firm managing over $3.5 billion in assets under management, the majority consisting of his personal wealth.
On September 21, 2016 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged Cooperman and Omega Advisors with insider trading, more specifically for "trading stocks, bonds and call options of Atlas Pipeline Partners in July 2010 on information he obtained from an executive at the company."[3] Cooperman has denied these charges saying they were "totally without merit," and his attorney has argued that "no court has upheld a misappropriation theory of insider trading based on a purported promise to keep information confidential (or to refrain from trading) made after the information was acquired.""[4][5]

Early life and education[edit]
Cooperman was born to a Jewish[6] family in the South Bronx, New York City.[7] He is the son of immigrants from Poland.[8] Cooperman was the first in his family to earn a college degree.[9][10] As an undergraduate at Hunter College, Cooperman joined and was an active member of the Alpha Epsilon Pi. After graduating, he became a quality control engineer at Xerox in 1965.[1] Cooperman later received his MBA from Columbia Business School, graduating in 1967.[11]
Investment career[edit]
Early career and Goldman Sachs[edit]
Directly after graduating from Columbia, Cooperman joined Goldman Sachs. He spent his first twenty two years at Goldman in the Investment Research Department as partner-in-charge, co-chairman of the Investment Policy Committee and chairman of the Stock Selection Committee. In 1989, he became chairman and chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs Asset Management[12][13] and was chief investment officer of the equity product line including managing the GS Capital Growth Fund, an open-end mutual fund, for one and one-half years.[14]
While at Goldman Sachs, for nine consecutive years, Cooperman was voted the number-one portfolio strategist in the Institutional Investor "All-America Research Team" survey.[15][16]
At the end of 1991 after twenty five years of service, Cooperman retired from his positions as a general partner of Goldman, Sachs & Co. and as chairman and chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs Asset Management.[17]
Founding of Omega[edit]
After leaving Goldman Sachs, he organized a private investment partnership,Omega Advisors, Inc.[18][19][20][21]
2016 SEC investigation[edit]
On September 21, 2016, Cooperman was charged with insider trading by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.[5][22] He denied the charges.[23][24][25] Cooperman faces criminal charges in a related parallel proceeding and has asserted his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination before a SEC hearing.[26] In May 2017 Cooperman's firm agreed to a $4.9 million settlement with the SEC. As part of the agreement, Omega Advisers admitted no wrongdoing. Following the settlement, Cooperman commented: "The process in my opinion was totally abusive. It's a problem that the government should address,"[27]
Personal life[edit]
With his wife Toby, he has two sons, Wayne and Michael, and three grandchildren.[6][28][29][9] Since the late 1970s, Cooperman has been a resident of the Short Hills neighborhood of Millburn, New Jersey.[30] He has an honorary doctorate in finance from Roger Williams University in Rhode Island.[31][32][33]
Political and economic views[edit]
In November 2011, Cooperman gained attention for an open letter to U.S. President Barack Obama in which among other things charged the president with engaging in class warfare.[34][35] This letter has been characterized by Joseph Palermo of The Huffington Post as a rant bemoaning the mistreatment of billionaires by the president and his "minions" (Cooperman's word).[36]
Wealth and philanthropy[edit]
He and his wife Toby are signators of The Giving Pledge[37] and manage the Leon and Toby Cooperman Family Foundation. In 2012, Cooperman was included in the 50 Most Influential list of Bloomberg Markets magazine.[38] Forbes listed him as one of the 40 Highest-Earning hedge fund managers in 2013,[39] and the next year it listed him among the top 25.[40]
Cooperman has a long history of supporting Columbia Business School. In 2011, he donated $25 million to support the expansion of the school's campus. In 2007, he created the Cooperman Scholarship Challenge, helping to create over 40 need based scholarships. In 2000, he established the Leon Cooperman Scholarship to support financial aid for need based students. In 1995, he endowed the Leon Cooperman Professorship of Finance and Economics.[41]
Cooperman was the first in the country to endow Birthright Israel, a program that sends Jews aged 18–26 on free short-term visits to Israel to promote Jewish identity. Cooperman states: "We are very proud of our religion, our heritage, the many accomplishments of the Jewish people, and the enormous contribution they make to society. But we are very concerned about the pace of assimilation and really the disappearance of the Jewish religion. Through intermarriage and rapid assimilation, we’re disappearing. We’re trying to make our effort to help either slow that down or reverse it.”[6]
He is also a founding Master Player of the Portfolios with Purpose virtual stock trading contest.[42]
In April 2014, the Leon and Toby Cooperman Family Foundation pledged $25 million to the Saint Barnabas Medical Center for the construction of a new 200,000 square-foot Cooperman Family Pavilion.[43]
He is on the board of the Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation.[15][44]

                                    Omega Advisors, Inc. was founded in 1991 by Leon G. Cooperman, and is registered as an investment advisor with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. After 25 years of service, Leon Cooperman retired in 1991 from his positions as general partner of Goldman, Sachs & Co. and as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Goldman Sachs Asset Management in order to organize Omega. For nine consecutive years while at Goldman Sachs, Lee was voted the number-one portfolio strategist in Institutional Investor Magazine’s “All-America Research Team” survey. In 1999, Steve Einhorn joined Lee at Omega as Vice Chairman. Steve, who spent most of his career at Goldman Sachs, most recently as partner-in-charge of Global Investment Research and co-chairman of the firm’s Investment Policy Committee, was a member of Institutional Investor’s “All-America Research Team” for 16 consecutive years. 
                                

                                    Omega has approximately $3.6 billion under management (as of June 30, 2017). With a significant amount of personal general partner capital invested in the Omega funds, we (to quote Warren E. Buffett) eat our own cooking; our interests are very much aligned with that of our investors.

Leon G. "Lee" Cooperman (born April 25, 1943) is an American investor, hedge fund manager, and philanthropist. He is the chairman and CEO of Omega Advisors,[2] a New York-based investment advisory firm managing over $3.5 billion in assets under management, the majority consisting of his personal wealth.
On September 21, 2016 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged Cooperman and Omega Advisors with insider trading, more specifically for "trading stocks, bonds and call options of Atlas Pipeline Partners in July 2010 on information he obtained from an executive at the company."[3] Cooperman has denied these charges saying they were "totally without merit," and his attorney has argued that "no court has upheld a misappropriation theory of insider trading based on a purported promise to keep information confidential (or to refrain from trading) made after the information was acquired.""[4][5]

Leon G. "Lee" Cooperman (born April 25, 1943) is an American investor, hedge fund manager, and philanthropist. He is the chairman and CEO of Omega Advisors,[2] a New York-based investment advisory firm managing over $3.5 billion in assets under management, the majority consisting of his personal wealth.
On September 21, 2016 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged Cooperman and Omega Advisors with insider trading, more specifically for "trading stocks, bonds and call options of Atlas Pipeline Partners in July 2010 on information he obtained from an executive at the company."[3] Cooperman has denied these charges saying they were "totally without merit," and his attorney has argued that "no court has upheld a misappropriation theory of insider trading based on a purported promise to keep information confidential (or to refrain from trading) made after the information was acquired.""[4][5]

Early life and education[edit]
Cooperman was born to a Jewish[6] family in the South Bronx, New York City.[7] He is the son of immigrants from Poland.[8] Cooperman was the first in his family to earn a college degree.[9][10] As an undergraduate at Hunter College, Cooperman joined and was an active member of the Alpha Epsilon Pi. After graduating, he became a quality control engineer at Xerox in 1965.[1] Cooperman later received his MBA from Columbia Business School, graduating in 1967.[11]
Investment career[edit]
Early career and Goldman Sachs[edit]
Directly after graduating from Columbia, Cooperman joined Goldman Sachs. He spent his first twenty two years at Goldman in the Investment Research Department as partner-in-charge, co-chairman of the Investment Policy Committee and chairman of the Stock Selection Committee. In 1989, he became chairman and chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs Asset Management[12][13] and was chief investment officer of the equity product line including managing the GS Capital Growth Fund, an open-end mutual fund, for one and one-half years.[14]
While at Goldman Sachs, for nine consecutive years, Cooperman was voted the number-one portfolio strategist in the Institutional Investor "All-America Research Team" survey.[15][16]
At the end of 1991 after twenty five years of service, Cooperman retired from his positions as a general partner of Goldman, Sachs & Co. and as chairman and chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs Asset Management.[17]
Founding of Omega[edit]
After leaving Goldman Sachs, he organized a private investment partnership,Omega Advisors, Inc.[18][19][20][21]
2016 SEC investigation[edit]
On September 21, 2016, Cooperman was charged with insider trading by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.[5][22] He denied the charges.[23][24][25] Cooperman faces criminal charges in a related parallel proceeding and has asserted his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination before a SEC hearing.[26] In May 2017 Cooperman's firm agreed to a $4.9 million settlement with the SEC. As part of the agreement, Omega Advisers admitted no wrongdoing. Following the settlement, Cooperman commented: "The process in my opinion was totally abusive. It's a problem that the government should address,"[27]
Personal life[edit]
With his wife Toby, he has two sons, Wayne and Michael, and three grandchildren.[6][28][29][9] Since the late 1970s, Cooperman has been a resident of the Short Hills neighborhood of Millburn, New Jersey.[30] He has an honorary doctorate in finance from Roger Williams University in Rhode Island.[31][32][33]
Political and economic views[edit]
In November 2011, Cooperman gained attention for an open letter to U.S. President Barack Obama in which among other things charged the president with engaging in class warfare.[34][35] This letter has been characterized by Joseph Palermo of The Huffington Post as a rant bemoaning the mistreatment of billionaires by the president and his "minions" (Cooperman's word).[36]
Wealth and philanthropy[edit]
He and his wife Toby are signators of The Giving Pledge[37] and manage the Leon and Toby Cooperman Family Foundation. In 2012, Cooperman was included in the 50 Most Influential list of Bloomberg Markets magazine.[38] Forbes listed him as one of the 40 Highest-Earning hedge fund managers in 2013,[39] and the next year it listed him among the top 25.[40]
Cooperman has a long history of supporting Columbia Business School. In 2011, he donated $25 million to support the expansion of the school's campus. In 2007, he created the Cooperman Scholarship Challenge, helping to create over 40 need based scholarships. In 2000, he established the Leon Cooperman Scholarship to support financial aid for need based students. In 1995, he endowed the Leon Cooperman Professorship of Finance and Economics.[41]
Cooperman was the first in the country to endow Birthright Israel, a program that sends Jews aged 18–26 on free short-term visits to Israel to promote Jewish identity. Cooperman states: "We are very proud of our religion, our heritage, the many accomplishments of the Jewish people, and the enormous contribution they make to society. But we are very concerned about the pace of assimilation and really the disappearance of the Jewish religion. Through intermarriage and rapid assimilation, we’re disappearing. We’re trying to make our effort to help either slow that down or reverse it.”[6]
He is also a founding Master Player of the Portfolios with Purpose virtual stock trading contest.[42]
In April 2014, the Leon and Toby Cooperman Family Foundation pledged $25 million to the Saint Barnabas Medical Center for the construction of a new 200,000 square-foot Cooperman Family Pavilion.[43]
He is on the board of the Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation.[15][44]

LEON COOPERMAN UNLOADS: High-Frequency Traders Are Turning Markets Into A Casino

Omega Advisors founder Leon Cooperman was on CNBC this afternoon to talk 
  about the scathing letter he sent to President Obama two days
  ago. He shared some of his ideas for the economy, and also
  took time to comment on the state of regulation in the financial
  industry.


  Cooperman's ideas for the finance world? Uptick rules—which only
  allow a shorting when the stock price is rising—should be
  reinstated, high frequency trading should be banned or at least
  curtailed and credit default swap trades should be limited to
  only those that own the underlying bonds.


  He also had a choice statement for why uptick rules should come
  back and high frequency trading should end:


  "The high frequency traders are turning the best capital markets
  in the world into a casino, and scaring the public, and it's not
  in the public interest."

The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
