The Case for Value Investing | Why Value Stocks over Growth Stocks












<iframe  src="//www.googletagmanager.com/ns.html?id=GTM-KSPJXS" height="0" width="0" style="display:none;visibility:hidden">





















































  































THE CASE FOR VALUE INVESTING
Are you the tortoise or the hare? The hare is frantic and white-knuckled during market volatility. But the tortoise watches for undervalued stocks ignored and hot stocks overpriced, and beams a placid smile. The tortoise is the value investor, and his hard shell is his nerves of steel.
The hare is growth investing. We believe that you pre-pay for expectations in growth stocks, whereas value stocks have already been discounted. This is why over the long-term, growth stocks have trailed value stocks, returning an annualized average of 9.4% while value stocks have returned an annualized average of 13.6% over the same time period1.  The Prudent Speculator Newsletter Portfolio has averaged 17% over its 40-year history of value investing2.
Don’t you want to be the tortoise? Yes, it helps to have support to keep you on the path. Start by downloading this report and see the historical case for value investing.
This report explains why we think:

Fed tightening is not fatal
Not all stocks are expensive
Those with a long investment horizon should consider value stocks
Value has historically outperformed growth
Dividend-paying stocks are valuable











































[1] From 06.30.27 through 03.31.17. Logarithmic scale. SOURCE: Al Frank using data from Professors Eugene F. Fama and Kenneth R. French.
[2] The Prudent Speculator newsletter portfolio returns, net of fee, 3.10.1977-12.31.2016, 17.84%. S&P 500 returned 11.19%.
Please note that neither newsletter performance, nor the performance of any of its four portfolios, either individually or in concert, is or is intended to be representative of any individual product available through AFAM Capital, Inc.
Newsletter portfolio returns are calculated on a total return basis and reflect the reinvestment of dividends, if any, margin leverage and margin interest charges, trading costs and subscription costs. Data for periods greater than one year are annualized.
TPS Portfolio is Al Frank’s actual investment portfolio. Though not presently leveraged, it has been so in the past. The use of leverage magnifies gains and losses and increases risk to a portfolio.
The performance of growth stocks as discussed is comprised of 50% small growth stock returns and 50% large growth stock returns (06/30/1927-12/31/2016, rebalanced monthly) and is derived using data from Professors Eugene F. Fama and Kenneth R. French. The performance of value stocks as discussed is comprised of 50% small value stock returns and 50% large value stock returns (06/30/1927-12/31/2016, rebalanced monthly) and is derived using data from Professors Eugene F. Fama and Kenneth R. French.
The S&P 500 Index is a broad market sample based on the market capitalizations of 500 large companies having common stock listed on the NYSE or NASDAQ. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.
Investing involves risk, principal loss is possible, and there can be no assurance that investment objectives will be achieved. The information presented herein is for discussion and illustrative purposes only and does not constitute investment advice. It is not a recommendation or an offer or solicitation to buy or sell any securities.
Information provided reflects AFAM's views as of a particular time. Such views are subject to change at any point and AFAM shall not be obligated to provide notice of any change. While AFAM has used reasonable efforts to obtain information from reliable sources, we make no representations or warranties as to the accuracy, reliability or completeness of third party information presented herein. No guarantee of investment performance is being provided and no inference to the contrary should be made.

AFAM Capital, Inc. is a rapidly growing asset manager that specializes in the management of quantitatively-driven exchange-traded fund and equity portfolios that currently advises upon more than $1.5B in accounts.

Our Innealta Division leverages a quantitative econometric model to dynamically shift investments between equity and fixed income ETFs based upon the highest risk adjusted rates of return with a strong emphasis on risk (e.g. variance of returns, downside market protection).

Our Value division applies a disciplined ‘buy and harvest’ long term all-cap, value-oriented equity strategy based on selection, diversification and patience that has been highly regarded for 40 years. We seek out and buy undervalued U.S. Equities irrespective of company size or industry.

AFAM Capital is a Registered Investment Advisor. Innealta Capital is a division of AFAM Capital. ETFs and stocks are subject to risks, such as market risk, and investors that have their funds invest in accordance with the portfolios may experience losses. Additionally, fixed income (bond) ETFs are subject to interest rate risk which is the risk that debt securities in a portfolio will decline in value because of increases in market interest rates. Investments in foreign investments may incur greater risks than domestic investments. Our ADV Part 2A contains more detailed information regarding investment risk.

Diversification does not protect against loss in declining markets.
