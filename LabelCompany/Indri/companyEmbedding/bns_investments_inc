Canada Company Go is a free information site that offers company registered in Canada . The information of this website is available to the public in accordance with legislation (see Public disclosure of corporate information). The corporate laws that govern federal corporations require the public disclosure of this information. This applies even after a corporation has been dissolved, amalgamated or discontinued. Corporate information is made public to help people, like investors, financial institutions and other stakeholders, make timely and informed decisions about Canadian corporations.
Information about directors is corporate information, and as such, is required to be made public.

Those who may want to access public corporate information include shareholders, investors or legal counsel. While a person’s home address is usually considered to be personal information, the Privacy Act allows for this information to be made available to the public because corporate laws require its disclosure.
