What Our Clients Are Saying






Amanda Johns Vaden, Senior Partner - Southwestern Consulting


					We joined in August of 2013 and our goal was to get a ROI within the next 9-12 months … we made our money back 10x over in the first 3 months of joining Accelerent.  Yes 10x over.  I know that may seem hard to believe but in the first 90 days of joining Accelerent we closed over $200k in business from our Accelerent relationships!  And the relationships and opportunities just keep coming in.  We joined because we wanted...										Read More











Dave Hartman, President - Hartman Executive Advisors


					“For me, it’s the relationships with the other Accelerent partners that makes the difference.  Through the Accelerent platform, we’ve been able to forge meaningful personal and professional relationships with the owners of dozens of growing and thriving Baltimore area businesses.   Once you develop connections at that level, the potential for meaningful partnerships and mutual business opportunities are limitless.”
 										Read More











Doug Hall, Chief Executive Officer - Musselman & Hall Contractors


					For more than 100 years Musselman and Hall Contractors, LLC and its predecessor companies have provided high quality concrete, asphalt, and railroad services to its governmental, private, and industrial custom ers in the Greater Kansas City area and around the Midwest. We are always working to grow our business.
We joined Accelerent in 2010 and we are very pleased with the results. This process works and we continue to receive the executive...										Read More











Kelly Roy, Vice President - Century II


					Accelerent has provided nearly $350,000 in recurring revenue for Century II since we joined - we're so happy with Accelerent that we recently renewed our three-year  agreement and are committed  to the platform.
Outsourced human resources is not an easy sell. Prospects are not typically comparing our price against a competitor - we are usually competing against complacency. Change is difficult, and for most of our clients they are...										Read More











Martin T. Fletcher, Managing Partner - Whiteford, Taylor & Preston LLP


					“There is no substitute for having a network of truly trusted friends who you can turn to when your business confronts a challenge. Accelerent has given us that broad network and it has already helped us in extremely valuable ways."
 										Read More











Mary Ann Scully, President and CEO - Howard Bank 


					"Accelerent, like Howard Bank, is about building lasting relationships through partnerships that, in turn , are all about making meaningful and mutually beneficial connections.    In our time as the Accelerent Title sponsor we have used the power of these connections to forge new relationships, deepen existing relationships and enhance the power of our brand.  We are proud to be part of Accelerent, a great organization taking networking to the next level."										Read More











Mathew Neuberger, President & CEO - Neuberger & Company, Inc. 


					" I couldn't have doubled my business without the involvement in Accelerent the past 3 years."										Read More











Mickey Randolph, CEO/Owner - Randolph Business Resources, LLC


					Accelerent has been a great business development investment for Randolph Business Resources. I was cautions about the capital outlay to join Accelerent but I have been very pleased with the payback of my investment.
When I started with Accelerent, I had four employees and withing 18 months, our staff has grown to 14 employees and I'm looking to hire more. Over 75% of all my introductions to potential new clients come through my Accelerent...										Read More











Proforma Printelligence


					Proforma Printelligence could be called a full service print and promotional agency. But that's really cliche and boring. What we really do is CHUM, not SWAG. SWAG stands for S(tuff) We All Get - it implies a throwaway that's given little thought. We are battling against that term and that view of promotional or print suppliers. What we do is chum. What's chum? It's the right mix of stuff placed in the right 'body of water' to lure the right...										Read More








Ryan Wilkerson, President - Hass & Wilkerson Insurance


					As Title Sponsor of Accelerent Kansas City we have benefited greatly in several areas of our business. In our first year we developed several new Commercial Insurance clients as well as a surprising number of new personal lines clients. One of the new commercial clients is a large HVAC Cooling contractor that we likely would never have signed had we not been able to build a relationship through Accelerent.
One of my concerns when we were...										Read More











Scott Eckart and Kevin Gutwern, Partners - Westpoint Private Client Group


					When we were first approached about joining Accelerent, we were very impressed with its platform, and we are pleased that our decision to be a Partner has been most successful!
Your group is very diligent about listening to our business needs and helping us to achieve our outlined goals. In the first six months we have added new clientele and prospects because of Accelerent introductions. These clients will help contribute to our bottom line...										Read More

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
