What's a D&B D‑U‑N‑S Number?The D&B D-U-N-S® Number is a unique nine-digit identifier for businesses. It is used to establish a business credit file, which is often referenced by lenders and potential business partners to help predict the reliability and/or financial stability of the company in question. D-U-N-S, which stands for data universal number system, is used to and maintain accurate and timely information on +265M global businesses.

Why do I need a D‑U‑N‑S Number?The D-U-N-S Number is used in dozens of countries around the world, including the U.S., Australia, and the European Union, and confers numerous benefits on businesses that participate.

Even after you’ve signed a contract or accepted a loan, your D-U-N-S Number can be used to help get a clear view of your business, which can help you negotiate for improved terms and conditions or a favorable line of credit.

History[edit]
1800s[edit]
Dun & Bradstreet traces its history back to July 20, 1841, with the formation of The Mercantile Agency in New York City by Lewis Tappan, later called R.G. Dun & Company.[8] Recognizing the need for a centralized credit reporting system, Tappan formed the company to create a network of correspondents who would provide reliable, objective credit information to subscribers.[9] As an advocate for civil rights, Tappan used his abolitionist connections to expand and update the company’s credit information.[10] In spite of accusations for invading personal privacy, by 1844 the Mercantile Agency had over 280 clients. The agency continued to expand allowing offices to open in Boston, Philadelphia, and Baltimore. By 1849, Tappan retired, allowing Benjamin Douglass to take over the booming business.
In 1859, Douglass transferred the company over to Robert Graham Dun, who immediately changed the firm’s name to R.G. Dun & Company.[11] Over the next 40 years, Graham Dun continued to expand the business across international boundaries.
1900s[edit]
In 1933, Dun merged with competitor, John M. Bradstreet to form today's Dun & Bradstreet.[12] The merger was engineered by Dun's CEO Arthur Whiteside.[13] Whiteside's successor, J. Wilson Newman, worked to increase Dun's range of products and services and expanded dramatically during the 1960s by engineering ways to apply new technologies to evolving operations.[13] The Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) was invented in 1962.[14] In 1996 the company tri-vested creating three entities D&B Companies, Nielsen and the Cognizant Corporation. Cognizant Corporation included Nielsen TV Ratings, Gartner Group, Clarke-O'Neill, Erisco and several other lesser known entities. In 1999 Cognizant Corporation spun off Nielsen TV Ratings and shortly thereafter divested all its holdings emerging as IMS Health. IMS Health continued to hold its prize incubator company that is today known as Cognizant Corporation. ACNielsen (1996),[15] Cognizant Technology Solutions (1996),[16] and Moody's (1999)[17]
2000s[edit]
On February 5, 2003, Dun & Bradstreet restated prior period results to correct timing errors in the recognition of some of the revenue associated with 14 of the Company's 200+ products, after a review of its revenue recognition from 1997 through 2002.[18] In August 2010, Dun & Bradstreet spun off and sold their credit monitoring and management business to a newly formed company, Dun & Bradstreet Credibility Corp.[19] In 2012, Dun & Bradstreet acquired AllBusiness.com.[20]
Operations[edit]
Dun & Bradstreet maintains a database of over 240 million companies globally[3] and over 100 million professional contact names using a variety of sources including public records, trade references, telco providers, telephone interviews, print, digital and trade publications, among others.[21] The company derives revenues through subscriptions as well as pay-per-business report, and to a smaller extent, third-party licensing agreements. Additional revenue is derived from business subsidiaries including Hoover's.[22]
Products and services[edit]
Dun & Bradstreet products and services fall under three main categories: finance solutions (credit and risk management), operations solutions (supply chain management) and sales and marketing solutions (Hoover's, lead generation, API-integrated corporate, social media and third-party information and DaaS tools).[5][23]
Risk management products include the Business Information Report, Comprehensive Report, D&B Direct and the DNBi platform, often offered to listed participants as a way to improve their rating. These solutions provide current and historical business information primarily used for third party marketing.[24]
Sales and marketing products such as the DUNS Market Identifier database, Optimizer, D&B 360 and D&B Professional Contacts provide sales and marketing professionals with business data for both prospecting and CRM activity. In the DNBi platform customers can view ECF reports, decision based on data, view alerts.[25][26]
Dun & Bradstreet also owns the business research corporation Hoover's.[27]
International branches[edit]
Dun & Bradstreet has offices in five continents – North and South America, Australia - (In Australia, Dun & Bradstreet are one of 2 major credit reporting agencies), Asia and Europe.[28] The company has had offices in Australia since 1887, Mexico since 1896, New Zealand since 1903, Argentina since 1911, Venezuela since 1920, Brazil since 1933 and Peru since 1981. The company’s core office locations are in the US and Canada, Ireland, the UK, the Netherlands, Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, Philippines, Brazil and Australia.[21][29] It has several offices in India as well, with its head office in Mumbai.[30]

History[edit]
1800s[edit]
Dun & Bradstreet traces its history back to July 20, 1841, with the formation of The Mercantile Agency in New York City by Lewis Tappan, later called R.G. Dun & Company.[8] Recognizing the need for a centralized credit reporting system, Tappan formed the company to create a network of correspondents who would provide reliable, objective credit information to subscribers.[9] As an advocate for civil rights, Tappan used his abolitionist connections to expand and update the company’s credit information.[10] In spite of accusations for invading personal privacy, by 1844 the Mercantile Agency had over 280 clients. The agency continued to expand allowing offices to open in Boston, Philadelphia, and Baltimore. By 1849, Tappan retired, allowing Benjamin Douglass to take over the booming business.
In 1859, Douglass transferred the company over to Robert Graham Dun, who immediately changed the firm’s name to R.G. Dun & Company.[11] Over the next 40 years, Graham Dun continued to expand the business across international boundaries.
1900s[edit]
In 1933, Dun merged with competitor, John M. Bradstreet to form today's Dun & Bradstreet.[12] The merger was engineered by Dun's CEO Arthur Whiteside.[13] Whiteside's successor, J. Wilson Newman, worked to increase Dun's range of products and services and expanded dramatically during the 1960s by engineering ways to apply new technologies to evolving operations.[13] The Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) was invented in 1962.[14] In 1996 the company tri-vested creating three entities D&B Companies, Nielsen and the Cognizant Corporation. Cognizant Corporation included Nielsen TV Ratings, Gartner Group, Clarke-O'Neill, Erisco and several other lesser known entities. In 1999 Cognizant Corporation spun off Nielsen TV Ratings and shortly thereafter divested all its holdings emerging as IMS Health. IMS Health continued to hold its prize incubator company that is today known as Cognizant Corporation. ACNielsen (1996),[15] Cognizant Technology Solutions (1996),[16] and Moody's (1999)[17]
2000s[edit]
On February 5, 2003, Dun & Bradstreet restated prior period results to correct timing errors in the recognition of some of the revenue associated with 14 of the Company's 200+ products, after a review of its revenue recognition from 1997 through 2002.[18] In August 2010, Dun & Bradstreet spun off and sold their credit monitoring and management business to a newly formed company, Dun & Bradstreet Credibility Corp.[19] In 2012, Dun & Bradstreet acquired AllBusiness.com.[20]
Operations[edit]
Dun & Bradstreet maintains a database of over 240 million companies globally[3] and over 100 million professional contact names using a variety of sources including public records, trade references, telco providers, telephone interviews, print, digital and trade publications, among others.[21] The company derives revenues through subscriptions as well as pay-per-business report, and to a smaller extent, third-party licensing agreements. Additional revenue is derived from business subsidiaries including Hoover's.[22]
Products and services[edit]
Dun & Bradstreet products and services fall under three main categories: finance solutions (credit and risk management), operations solutions (supply chain management) and sales and marketing solutions (Hoover's, lead generation, API-integrated corporate, social media and third-party information and DaaS tools).[5][23]
Risk management products include the Business Information Report, Comprehensive Report, D&B Direct and the DNBi platform, often offered to listed participants as a way to improve their rating. These solutions provide current and historical business information primarily used for third party marketing.[24]
Sales and marketing products such as the DUNS Market Identifier database, Optimizer, D&B 360 and D&B Professional Contacts provide sales and marketing professionals with business data for both prospecting and CRM activity. In the DNBi platform customers can view ECF reports, decision based on data, view alerts.[25][26]
Dun & Bradstreet also owns the business research corporation Hoover's.[27]
International branches[edit]
Dun & Bradstreet has offices in five continents – North and South America, Australia - (In Australia, Dun & Bradstreet are one of 2 major credit reporting agencies), Asia and Europe.[28] The company has had offices in Australia since 1887, Mexico since 1896, New Zealand since 1903, Argentina since 1911, Venezuela since 1920, Brazil since 1933 and Peru since 1981. The company’s core office locations are in the US and Canada, Ireland, the UK, the Netherlands, Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, Philippines, Brazil and Australia.[21][29] It has several offices in India as well, with its head office in Mumbai.[30]

History[edit]
1800s[edit]
Dun & Bradstreet traces its history back to July 20, 1841, with the formation of The Mercantile Agency in New York City by Lewis Tappan, later called R.G. Dun & Company.[8] Recognizing the need for a centralized credit reporting system, Tappan formed the company to create a network of correspondents who would provide reliable, objective credit information to subscribers.[9] As an advocate for civil rights, Tappan used his abolitionist connections to expand and update the company’s credit information.[10] In spite of accusations for invading personal privacy, by 1844 the Mercantile Agency had over 280 clients. The agency continued to expand allowing offices to open in Boston, Philadelphia, and Baltimore. By 1849, Tappan retired, allowing Benjamin Douglass to take over the booming business.
In 1859, Douglass transferred the company over to Robert Graham Dun, who immediately changed the firm’s name to R.G. Dun & Company.[11] Over the next 40 years, Graham Dun continued to expand the business across international boundaries.
1900s[edit]
In 1933, Dun merged with competitor, John M. Bradstreet to form today's Dun & Bradstreet.[12] The merger was engineered by Dun's CEO Arthur Whiteside.[13] Whiteside's successor, J. Wilson Newman, worked to increase Dun's range of products and services and expanded dramatically during the 1960s by engineering ways to apply new technologies to evolving operations.[13] The Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) was invented in 1962.[14] In 1996 the company tri-vested creating three entities D&B Companies, Nielsen and the Cognizant Corporation. Cognizant Corporation included Nielsen TV Ratings, Gartner Group, Clarke-O'Neill, Erisco and several other lesser known entities. In 1999 Cognizant Corporation spun off Nielsen TV Ratings and shortly thereafter divested all its holdings emerging as IMS Health. IMS Health continued to hold its prize incubator company that is today known as Cognizant Corporation. ACNielsen (1996),[15] Cognizant Technology Solutions (1996),[16] and Moody's (1999)[17]

Dun & Bradstreet teams up with Microsoft to reimagine the power of data in the cloud


July 19, 2017

			|				
Microsoft News Center





REDMOND, Wash., and SHORT HILLS, N.J. — July 19, 2017 — Dun & Bradstreet, the global leader in commercial data, analytics and insights for business, is teaming up with Microsoft Corp. to give companies worldwide direct access to its data through Microsoft’s cloud services.
Together the companies announced the following:

Dun & Bradstreet has selected Microsoft as a strategic cloud provider to accelerate the company’s digital transformation and deliver its customers more efficient and seamless access to its commercial data. Dun & Bradstreet will power core applications and build new services on Microsoft Azure, and plans to use Microsoft intelligent cloud services to modernize applications.
Dun & Bradstreet data will be made available within Microsoft Dynamics 365. Leveraging Microsoft’s Common Data Service, the industry-standard D-U-N-S® Number and core business data will be integrated to help joint customers qualify sales leads and stay synchronized with Dun & Bradstreet’s global business database of over 265 million business records.
Dun & Bradstreet will reach Microsoft’s commercial users and prospects through a joint, co-sell arrangement focused on Dynamics 365, Dun & Bradstreet’s core business data and D&B Hoovers.
The first offerings are expected to be in market later this year.

No stranger to business evolution, under the leadership of Dun & Bradstreet Chairman and CEO Bob Carrigan, the 176-year-old company has taken significant steps to transform and modernize by investing in its data, analytics and insights to ensure they are the most up-to-date available. This move with Microsoft builds on the past four years of business transformation that has seen the company offer more of its products and solutions on the cloud through data-as-a-service offerings. The trusted, global Azure cloud platform will help Dun & Bradstreet meet its customers’ demand for real-time connectivity to their global business ecosystem by enabling it to update and scale faster and increase velocity and timeliness for customers that rely on their data to look for new business opportunities.
“We want our customers to have the most up-to-date data when they need it and where they want it,” said Josh Peirez, president and chief operating officer of Dun & Bradstreet. “By partnering strategically with Microsoft, we can take advantage of the scale and speed of cloud-based technologies, accelerate our innovation, and power seamless access to our data and insights. By delivering our content through the cloud, our customers will better discover — and grow — their most valuable business relationships.”
Native integrations with Microsoft Dynamics 365 business applications will introduce Dun & Bradstreet to new users and use cases as well as deliver more seamless solutions than previously possible. Today companies use Dun & Bradstreet data and analytics services for business-to-business (B2B) sales and marketing, risk management, supply-chain management, sales lead scoring, and credit history management. Dynamics 365 is the next generation of intelligent business applications that enables organizations to grow, evolve and transform to meet customer needs and capture new opportunities. With this data integration, existing Dun & Bradstreet customers that are also Microsoft Dynamics 365 customers will benefit from data integrated directly into their CRM, streamlining the process so that they are able to access information in a way that saves a significant amount of time and improves productivity.
“Microsoft is honored Dun & Bradstreet selected our cloud to power its most fundamental and key industry offerings. Digital transformation is not simply about technology — it requires business leaders to re-envision existing business models and embrace a different way of bringing together people, data and processes,” said Judson Althoff, Microsoft executive vice president of Worldwide Commercial Business. “Dun & Bradstreet is leveraging technology to power its innovation and create value for its customers. The opportunity for mutual customers to thrive with rich data when you combine Dynamics 365 and Dun & Bradstreet is incredible.”
With a joint go-to-market approach, both companies will co-sell the Dun & Bradstreet core business data and D&B Hoovers with Dynamics 365. This offering will be available in the U.S., yielding new incremental sales opportunities for Dun & Bradstreet’s sales and marketing solutions and incremental Azure consumption for Microsoft.

History[edit]
1800s[edit]
Dun & Bradstreet traces its history back to July 20, 1841, with the formation of The Mercantile Agency in New York City by Lewis Tappan, later called R.G. Dun & Company.[8] Recognizing the need for a centralized credit reporting system, Tappan formed the company to create a network of correspondents who would provide reliable, objective credit information to subscribers.[9] As an advocate for civil rights, Tappan used his abolitionist connections to expand and update the company’s credit information.[10] In spite of accusations for invading personal privacy, by 1844 the Mercantile Agency had over 280 clients. The agency continued to expand allowing offices to open in Boston, Philadelphia, and Baltimore. By 1849, Tappan retired, allowing Benjamin Douglass to take over the booming business.
In 1859, Douglass transferred the company over to Robert Graham Dun, who immediately changed the firm’s name to R.G. Dun & Company.[11] Over the next 40 years, Graham Dun continued to expand the business across international boundaries.
1900s[edit]
In 1933, Dun merged with competitor, John M. Bradstreet to form today's Dun & Bradstreet.[12] The merger was engineered by Dun's CEO Arthur Whiteside.[13] Whiteside's successor, J. Wilson Newman, worked to increase Dun's range of products and services and expanded dramatically during the 1960s by engineering ways to apply new technologies to evolving operations.[13] The Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) was invented in 1962.[14] In 1996 the company tri-vested creating three entities D&B Companies, Nielsen and the Cognizant Corporation. Cognizant Corporation included Nielsen TV Ratings, Gartner Group, Clarke-O'Neill, Erisco and several other lesser known entities. In 1999 Cognizant Corporation spun off Nielsen TV Ratings and shortly thereafter divested all its holdings emerging as IMS Health. IMS Health continued to hold its prize incubator company that is today known as Cognizant Corporation. ACNielsen (1996),[15] Cognizant Technology Solutions (1996),[16] and Moody's (1999)[17]
2000s[edit]
On February 5, 2003, Dun & Bradstreet restated prior period results to correct timing errors in the recognition of some of the revenue associated with 14 of the Company's 200+ products, after a review of its revenue recognition from 1997 through 2002.[18] In August 2010, Dun & Bradstreet spun off and sold their credit monitoring and management business to a newly formed company, Dun & Bradstreet Credibility Corp.[19] In 2012, Dun & Bradstreet acquired AllBusiness.com.[20]
Operations[edit]
Dun & Bradstreet maintains a database of over 240 million companies globally[3] and over 100 million professional contact names using a variety of sources including public records, trade references, telco providers, telephone interviews, print, digital and trade publications, among others.[21] The company derives revenues through subscriptions as well as pay-per-business report, and to a smaller extent, third-party licensing agreements. Additional revenue is derived from business subsidiaries including Hoover's.[22]
Products and services[edit]
Dun & Bradstreet products and services fall under three main categories: finance solutions (credit and risk management), operations solutions (supply chain management) and sales and marketing solutions (Hoover's, lead generation, API-integrated corporate, social media and third-party information and DaaS tools).[5][23]
Risk management products include the Business Information Report, Comprehensive Report, D&B Direct and the DNBi platform, often offered to listed participants as a way to improve their rating. These solutions provide current and historical business information primarily used for third party marketing.[24]
Sales and marketing products such as the DUNS Market Identifier database, Optimizer, D&B 360 and D&B Professional Contacts provide sales and marketing professionals with business data for both prospecting and CRM activity. In the DNBi platform customers can view ECF reports, decision based on data, view alerts.[25][26]

History[edit]
1800s[edit]
Dun & Bradstreet traces its history back to July 20, 1841, with the formation of The Mercantile Agency in New York City by Lewis Tappan, later called R.G. Dun & Company.[8] Recognizing the need for a centralized credit reporting system, Tappan formed the company to create a network of correspondents who would provide reliable, objective credit information to subscribers.[9] As an advocate for civil rights, Tappan used his abolitionist connections to expand and update the company’s credit information.[10] In spite of accusations for invading personal privacy, by 1844 the Mercantile Agency had over 280 clients. The agency continued to expand allowing offices to open in Boston, Philadelphia, and Baltimore. By 1849, Tappan retired, allowing Benjamin Douglass to take over the booming business.
In 1859, Douglass transferred the company over to Robert Graham Dun, who immediately changed the firm’s name to R.G. Dun & Company.[11] Over the next 40 years, Graham Dun continued to expand the business across international boundaries.
1900s[edit]
In 1933, Dun merged with competitor, John M. Bradstreet to form today's Dun & Bradstreet.[12] The merger was engineered by Dun's CEO Arthur Whiteside.[13] Whiteside's successor, J. Wilson Newman, worked to increase Dun's range of products and services and expanded dramatically during the 1960s by engineering ways to apply new technologies to evolving operations.[13] The Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) was invented in 1962.[14] In 1996 the company tri-vested creating three entities D&B Companies, Nielsen and the Cognizant Corporation. Cognizant Corporation included Nielsen TV Ratings, Gartner Group, Clarke-O'Neill, Erisco and several other lesser known entities. In 1999 Cognizant Corporation spun off Nielsen TV Ratings and shortly thereafter divested all its holdings emerging as IMS Health. IMS Health continued to hold its prize incubator company that is today known as Cognizant Corporation. ACNielsen (1996),[15] Cognizant Technology Solutions (1996),[16] and Moody's (1999)[17]
2000s[edit]
On February 5, 2003, Dun & Bradstreet restated prior period results to correct timing errors in the recognition of some of the revenue associated with 14 of the Company's 200+ products, after a review of its revenue recognition from 1997 through 2002.[18] In August 2010, Dun & Bradstreet spun off and sold their credit monitoring and management business to a newly formed company, Dun & Bradstreet Credibility Corp.[19] In 2012, Dun & Bradstreet acquired AllBusiness.com.[20]
Operations[edit]
Dun & Bradstreet maintains a database of over 240 million companies globally[3] and over 100 million professional contact names using a variety of sources including public records, trade references, telco providers, telephone interviews, print, digital and trade publications, among others.[21] The company derives revenues through subscriptions as well as pay-per-business report, and to a smaller extent, third-party licensing agreements. Additional revenue is derived from business subsidiaries including Hoover's.[22]
Products and services[edit]
Dun & Bradstreet products and services fall under three main categories: finance solutions (credit and risk management), operations solutions (supply chain management) and sales and marketing solutions (Hoover's, lead generation, API-integrated corporate, social media and third-party information and DaaS tools).[5][23]
Risk management products include the Business Information Report, Comprehensive Report, D&B Direct and the DNBi platform, often offered to listed participants as a way to improve their rating. These solutions provide current and historical business information primarily used for third party marketing.[24]
Sales and marketing products such as the DUNS Market Identifier database, Optimizer, D&B 360 and D&B Professional Contacts provide sales and marketing professionals with business data for both prospecting and CRM activity. In the DNBi platform customers can view ECF reports, decision based on data, view alerts.[25][26]
Dun & Bradstreet also owns the business research corporation Hoover's.[27]
International branches[edit]
Dun & Bradstreet has offices in five continents – North and South America, Australia - (In Australia, Dun & Bradstreet are one of 2 major credit reporting agencies), Asia and Europe.[28] The company has had offices in Australia since 1887, Mexico since 1896, New Zealand since 1903, Argentina since 1911, Venezuela since 1920, Brazil since 1933 and Peru since 1981. The company’s core office locations are in the US and Canada, Ireland, the UK, the Netherlands, Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, Philippines, Brazil and Australia.[21][29] It has several offices in India as well, with its head office in Mumbai.[30]

Looking for an International Business Report?
D&B&reg business credit reports cover a wide variety of international destinations including but not limited to: Europe, Latin America, Asia, and Canada.  In order to find the international business your looking for, please visit our  International Reports page. 










Benefits of Monitoring Other Companies’ Credit
When you consider entering a business relationship with a partner, supplier, or customer, there is a good chance you will want to know how risky doing business with them might be. A company’s credit file contains its D&B scores and ratings along with other company information, such as the exact line of business and any judgments, suits, or liens associated with the company. The information you gather from a company’s business credit report can help determine your decision on establishing payment terms and credit limits. It may be the deciding factor on whether to do business with the company altogether. Bottom line, to protect your business, every company should consider monitoring the business credit of those they do business with.















How to use a D&B Credit Report
A full business credit report contains five critical D&B scores and ratings. Three predictive scores indicate how a business may perform over the next 12 months. First, the Delinquency Predictor Score predicts whether a business will pay its bills on time. Second, the Financial Stress Score predicts the likelihood that a business will experience financial distress. Third, the Supplier Evaluation Risk Rating predicts whether a business will stop delivering their goods or services. Two performance scores reflect a company’s past performance using only the information in D&B’s database. The first is the PAYDEX score, which indicates how a company has paid its bills over the last 24 months. The next is the D&B Rating, which indicates a company’s net worth range based on company financial statements.

History[edit]
1800s[edit]
Dun & Bradstreet traces its history back to July 20, 1841, with the formation of The Mercantile Agency in New York City by Lewis Tappan, later called R.G. Dun & Company.[8] Recognizing the need for a centralized credit reporting system, Tappan formed the company to create a network of correspondents who would provide reliable, objective credit information to subscribers.[9] As an advocate for civil rights, Tappan used his abolitionist connections to expand and update the company’s credit information.[10] In spite of accusations for invading personal privacy, by 1844 the Mercantile Agency had over 280 clients. The agency continued to expand allowing offices to open in Boston, Philadelphia, and Baltimore. By 1849, Tappan retired, allowing Benjamin Douglass to take over the booming business.
In 1859, Douglass transferred the company over to Robert Graham Dun, who immediately changed the firm’s name to R.G. Dun & Company.[11] Over the next 40 years, Graham Dun continued to expand the business across international boundaries.
1900s[edit]
In 1933, Dun merged with competitor, John M. Bradstreet to form today's Dun & Bradstreet.[12] The merger was engineered by Dun's CEO Arthur Whiteside.[13] Whiteside's successor, J. Wilson Newman, worked to increase Dun's range of products and services and expanded dramatically during the 1960s by engineering ways to apply new technologies to evolving operations.[13] The Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) was invented in 1962.[14] In 1996 the company tri-vested creating three entities D&B Companies, Nielsen and the Cognizant Corporation. Cognizant Corporation included Nielsen TV Ratings, Gartner Group, Clarke-O'Neill, Erisco and several other lesser known entities. In 1999 Cognizant Corporation spun off Nielsen TV Ratings and shortly thereafter divested all its holdings emerging as IMS Health. IMS Health continued to hold its prize incubator company that is today known as Cognizant Corporation. ACNielsen (1996),[15] Cognizant Technology Solutions (1996),[16] and Moody's (1999)[17]
2000s[edit]
On February 5, 2003, Dun & Bradstreet restated prior period results to correct timing errors in the recognition of some of the revenue associated with 14 of the Company's 200+ products, after a review of its revenue recognition from 1997 through 2002.[18] In August 2010, Dun & Bradstreet spun off and sold their credit monitoring and management business to a newly formed company, Dun & Bradstreet Credibility Corp.[19] In 2012, Dun & Bradstreet acquired AllBusiness.com.[20]
Operations[edit]
Dun & Bradstreet maintains a database of over 240 million companies globally[3] and over 100 million professional contact names using a variety of sources including public records, trade references, telco providers, telephone interviews, print, digital and trade publications, among others.[21] The company derives revenues through subscriptions as well as pay-per-business report, and to a smaller extent, third-party licensing agreements. Additional revenue is derived from business subsidiaries including Hoover's.[22]
Products and services[edit]
Dun & Bradstreet products and services fall under three main categories: finance solutions (credit and risk management), operations solutions (supply chain management) and sales and marketing solutions (Hoover's, lead generation, API-integrated corporate, social media and third-party information and DaaS tools).[5][23]
Risk management products include the Business Information Report, Comprehensive Report, D&B Direct and the DNBi platform, often offered to listed participants as a way to improve their rating. These solutions provide current and historical business information primarily used for third party marketing.[24]
Sales and marketing products such as the DUNS Market Identifier database, Optimizer, D&B 360 and D&B Professional Contacts provide sales and marketing professionals with business data for both prospecting and CRM activity. In the DNBi platform customers can view ECF reports, decision based on data, view alerts.[25][26]
Dun & Bradstreet also owns the business research corporation Hoover's.[27]
International branches[edit]
Dun & Bradstreet has offices in five continents – North and South America, Australia - (In Australia, Dun & Bradstreet are one of 2 major credit reporting agencies), Asia and Europe.[28] The company has had offices in Australia since 1887, Mexico since 1896, New Zealand since 1903, Argentina since 1911, Venezuela since 1920, Brazil since 1933 and Peru since 1981. The company’s core office locations are in the US and Canada, Ireland, the UK, the Netherlands, Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, Philippines, Brazil and Australia.[21][29] It has several offices in India as well, with its head office in Mumbai.[30]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creator

deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
