The articles posted here discuss the divergence between the corporate goal of profit maximization and the country’s welfare, the often misunderstood relationship between science, technology, productivity and a successful economy, the inherent conflict between trading partners found in economic models, and research on linear and integer programming.
Ralph Gomory is well-known for his mathematical research and his technical leadership. For twenty years he was responsible for IBM’s Research Division, and then for 18 years was the President of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. He is currently a Research Professor at New York University. In addition to mathematics, he has written extensively about globalization, trade, research, and technology, and has testified before Congress on numerous occasions. He has been awarded the National Medal of Science.








Gomory’s book “Global Trade and Conflicting National Interests,” co-written with William J. Baumol and published by MIT Press in 2001, is a prescient analysis of how globalization has upended classic trade models. Nobel Laureate Robert M. Solow says, “this book should be read carefully, but above all it should be read,” while Columbia economist Jagdish Bhagwati says, “When you pair a world-class mathematician with a world-class economist, you should be prepared for a spectacular outcome. The Gomory-Baumol book is an apt illustration.”

Trade

These articles describe the inherent conflict between trading partners that can be found in both the standard linear equilibrium model of international trade and in models with economies of scale.
Can This President Change the Direction of Our Economy?
The Hill, January 2017
Stronger U.S. economic growth requires taking actions that work even in a mercantilist world. The proposed Border Adjustment Tax will not work against mercantilism. The very different and very simple concept of Import Certificates will.
How to Rebuild Manufacturing
Remarks to the National Press Club, September 14, 2016
An agenda for the first 100 days: laying out what the next president of the United States should do about rebuilding American manufacturing in a mercantilist age.
America Rethinks Free Trade
Huffington Post, May 11, 2016
This extraordinary primary season has clearly shown that many Americans, whether Democrats or Republicans, have finally rebelled against “free trade.” It is high time.
Trade Pact Contains a Hidden Danger
Remarks to the National Press Club, February 11, 2016
The Investor-State Dispute Settlement language included in trade deals is elevating the interests of international corporations over the interests of our country.
Dagger Aimed at the Heart of Democracy
The Hill, June 2015
Within a “trade” agreement, a structure is being proposed that will subvert democracy in this country.
A Trade Pact in the Corporate Interest
Huffington Post, May 2015
This article is about the proposed Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) and related “fast track” legislation. It asserts that TPP’s special court aimed at protecting corporate investments against national decisions would pose a threat to our democratic system.
It Takes More than Economics 101 to Compete with China
The Huffington Post, October 24, 2013
This article discusses the likelihood of a revival of manufacturing in the United States.
On Manufacturing and Innovation
The Huffington Post, July  2013
This article calls for a national debate on the decline of the manufacturing industry and a discussion on what is really happening with manufacturing, innovation and unbalanced trade.
On Technical Progress and the Gains and Losses from Outsourcing (with William J. Baumol)
Oxford Handbook of Offshoring and Global Employment, May 2013
This is the published version of the New America Leture “Ricardo Revisited” listed two paragraphs below.
Trade, Education, and Innovation: Prospects for the U.S. Economy (with William J. Baumol)
Journal of Policy Modeling, July 7, 2011
Reliance on the doctrine of mutual gains from trade, even in the face of mercantilist practices, can be a significant mistake. Efforts to advance innovation, without considering the retention of the economic activity and jobs created by the innovation, will not ensure continued prosperity. This calls for the rethinking of trade policy by the United States and other developed nations if they are to ensure continued economic growth.
Ricardo Revisited: Sino-American Trade and Economic Conflict (with William J. Baumol)
Public Lecture given at the New America Foundation, January 18, 2011
We describe what a very standard model, the Ricardo model, shows about the impact on a developed nation, such as the U.S., of the economic development of a trading partner, such as China. We show that: (1) there is a dominant and dominated relation possible between the two countries that is good for the dominant one and bad for the dominated one. (2) A country can attain a dominant position either by having a naturally undeveloped trading partner, or by mercantilist actions that destroy the partner’s industries. (3) While a country cannot gain a dominant position solely by building up its industries, it can avoid a dominated position by developing its own industries and not allowing them to be destroyed.
Globalization: Country and Company Interests in Conflict (with William J. Baumol)
Journal of Policy Modeling, 2009
The same theory that shows that free trade is beneficial also shows that globalization can be harmful to at least one of the trading countries. Moreover, with globalization, the interests of a country and its companies may diverge. These conclusions emerge from some of the oldest and most time honored models in economics. We identify some of the key policy issues that must be addressed in today’s interdependent world.
Global Trade and Conflicting National Interests Book (with William J. Baumol)
MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 2001
This book provides in a more accessible form many of the results on trade conflicts described below. It deals with the conflicts that can appear in models with economies of scale and with those that can appear in models with linear production functions when countries change their productivities. The book is divided into two parts, the first for interested non-economists, and the second for economists.
National Trade Conflicts Caused by Productivity Change: The Analysis With Full Proofs (with William J. Baumol)
C. V. Starr Economic Research Report (New York University), November 1998, RR # 98-35.
This combines in one report the central results on both economies of scale models and linear production models. It contains the full proofs of these results. In addition it provides several new results such as proving that the linear programming boundaries of the individual country regions have single peaks and obtaining exact formulas for the boundaries in many situations.
Analysis of Linear Trade Models and Relation to Scale Economies (with William J. Baumol)
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, U.S.A., 1997, Vol. 94,  pp. 10002-10005
We show that the exact boundary of the region of equilibria can be obtained by an integer programming calculation. This result applies to models with small numbers of industries as well as to those having the large number of industries such as the models already discussed below. It also describes the close connection of equilibria from a single economies model to the maximal productivity equilibria of a family of linear models.
Productivity Differences, World-Market Shares and Conflicting National Interests in Linear Trade Models (with William J. Baumol)
Japan and the World Economy, International Journal of Theory and Policy, Elsevier Science Publishers B.V. (North Holland), 9 (1997), pp. 123-150.
This paper amplifies and explains the NAS Proceedings note described below and shows that conflict in the interests of countries can arise with the usual linear production functions. It uses the standard Ricardo equilibrium model with linear productivities. It obtains multiple equilibria by considering all productivities in the two trading countries that do not exceed some given technological limits. We show that the resulting regions of equilibria have the same characteristic shape as those produced by economies of scale. We discuss the inherent conflict in the interests of the two trading countries due to the fact that the best equilibria for one country are usually poor ones for its the trading partner.
Inefficient and Locally Stable Trade Equilibria Under Scale Economies: Comparative Advantage Revisited (with William J. Baumol)
KYKLOS, International Review for Social Sciences, Switzerland, 1996, Vol. 49, Fasc. 4, pp. 509-540.
In a world of scale economies market forces can easily maintain inefficient equilibria. We introduce the concept of degree of efficiency and of local efficiency to bring structure into the concept of efficiency in the presence of scale economies.
A Linear Ricardo Model With Varying Parameters (with William J. Baumol)
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, U.S.A., 1995, Vol. 92,  pp. 1205-1207.
This note shows that if we consider all possible productivities, that is all productivities that do not exceed some given technological limits, in the standard linear Ricardo model, that the resulting multiple equiibria form regions having the same characteristic shape and economic consequences as the regions produced by the multiple equilibria resulting from economies of scale.
Scale Economies, The Regions of Multiple Trade Equilibria, and Gains From Acquisition of Industries (with William J. Baumol)
C. V. Starr Economic Research Report (New York University), June 1992, RR # 92-10.
This positions the economies of scale model into the background of the existing literature. It also describes the transition from the traditional linear model to the economies of scale model as more of the industries of the model are allowed to have economies of scale.
Ricardo Model with Economies of Scale
Journal of Economic Theory, April 1994, Volume 62, No. 2, pp. 394-419.
This carefully develops the methods and results summarized in the proceedings note below. It shows that the shape of the region of equilibria, for large numbers of industries, is obtained by a linear programming calculation. It also discusses the consequences of the regional shape; in particular the inherent conflict that can exist between the interests of the trading nations.
A Ricardo Model With Economies of Scale
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, U.S.A., 1991, Vol. 88, Issue 18, pp. 8267-8271.
This introduces the standard equilibrium model of international trade (Ricardo Model) changed only in there are economies of scale in the production function.  It shows that the multiple equilibra that then result form a well defined region of equilibria with a characteristic shape having significant economic consequences. It introduces the mathematical methods required to understand the shape and other characteristics of the region of equilibria.

                           This is the first book in the Selecta, the collected works of Benoit Mandelbrot. This volume incorporates his original contributions
                              to finance and is a major contribution to the understanding of how speculative prices vary in time. The chapters consist of
                              much new material prepared for this volume, as well as reprints of his classic papers. Much of this work helps to lay a foundation
                              for evaluating risks in trading strategies. Statistical Papers, 2000: " ... this is a most useful collection of Mandelbrot's
                              work economics, it provides an excellent starting point for anybody interested in the origin of many current topics in empirical
                              finance or the distribution of income."

                           An algorithm is given for the numerical solution of the 'mixed integer' linear programming problem, the problem of maximizing
                              a linear form in finitely many variables constrained both by linear inequalities and the requirement that a proper subset
                              of the variables assume only integral values. The algorithm is an extension of the cutting plane technique for the solution
                              of the 'pure integer' problem. (Author)

                                 with palnar r-separating sets C whose removal from the plane (R sub 2) r-separates two points a and b in (R sub 2) - C. More

Ralph E. Gomory
Ralph E. Gomory was born May 7, 1929, in
      Brooklyn Heights, New York. He graduated from Williams College in 1950, studied
      at Cambridge University, and received his Ph.D. in mathematics from Princeton
      University in 1954. Gomory then served in the Navy (1954-57) and then was a
      Higgins Lecturer and Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Princeton before
      joining IBM's newly formed Research Division in 1959 as a research
      mathematician.
In his student and graduate student years
      (Williams, Cambridge, Princeton), Gomory did research on nonlinear differential
      equations, but his years in the Navy turned his attention to the applied
      mathematics of operations research. Back at Princeton he obtained the first
      general cutting-plane algorithms, which established the field of integer
      programming. It remains an active area of research today.
At IBM Research in the early 1960's,
      Gomory published papers with Paul Gilmore on the knapsack, traveling salesman
      and cutting-stock problems, and with T. C. Hu on flows in multi-terminal
      networks and continua. In the late 1960's, he developed the asymptotic theory
      of integer programming and introduced the concept of corner polyhedra. In the
      early 1970's, he collaborated with Ellis Johnson in investigating subadditive
      functions related to corner polyhedra that could also play a role in producing
      cutting-planes.
Gomory served as Chairman of IBM
      Research's Mathematical Sciences Department from 1965-67 and 1968-70 during an
      important period of its growth and evolution. This period saw the beginning of
      Samuel Winograd's work on limits of algorithms and of Benoit Mandelbrot's work
      on fractals.
Gomory became Director of Research for
      IBM in 1970, with line responsibility for IBM's Research Division. During his
      18 years as Director of Research the Research Division made a wide range of
      contributions to IBM's products, to the computer industry, and to science. The
      Zurich Research Laboratory did the work that resulted in two successive Nobel
      Prizes in physics, Yorktown Heights Research was the birthplace of what is now
      known as RISC architecture, and San Jose was the birthplace of the concept, theory
      and first prototype of relational databases.
Gomory, who had become the IBM Senior
      Vice President for Science and Technology retired from IBM in 1989 and became
      President of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. During his tenure as President he
      led the foundation into a long list of fields relevant to major national
      issues. The foundation pioneered in the field of on-line learning supporting
      this work before there was even a public Internet, and then supported its
      growth to more than three million people taking courses for credit. They
      started the now widespread program of industry studies, and engaged a major
      program advocating a more flexible workplace. The foundation developed a novel
      and successful approach to the problem of producing minority PhD?s in scientific
      and technical fields. The foundation was early in perceiving the threat of
      bioterrorism and was active in that area for years before the events of 9/11.
      On the scientific side the foundation supported the widely recognized Sloan Sky
      Survey, which has made major contributions to the problem of dark energy and
      initiated a major worldwide effort to survey life in the oceans known as the
      Census of Marine Life. In December 2007, after 18 years as President, Gomory
      became President Emeritus.
Gomory has served in many capacities in
      academic, industrial and governmental organizations. He was a Trustee of
      Hampshire College from 1977-1986 and of Princeton University from 1985-1989. He
      served on the President?s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST)
      from 1984 to 1992, and again from 2001 to 2009. ?He served for a number of terms on the
      National Academies? Committee on Science, Engineering and Public Policy
      (COSEPUP). He has recently joined STEP, the Board on Science Technology and
      Economic Policy of the National Academies.
Gomory has been a director of a number of
      companies including the Washington Post Company and the Bank of New York. He is
      currently a director of Lexmark International, Inc., and of a small start-up
      company. ?He was named one of America?s
      ten best directors by Director?s Alert magazine in 2000.
Gomory has been elected to the National
      Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, and the American
      Philosophical Society. He was subsequently elected to the Councils of all three
      societies. He has been awarded eight honorary degrees and many prizes including
      the Lanchester Prize in 1963, the Harry Goode Memorial Award of the American
      Federation of Information Processing Societies in 1984, the John von Neumann
      Theory Prize in 1984, the Medal of the Industrial Research Society in 1985, the
      IEEE Engineering Leadership Recognition Award in 1988, the National Medal of
      Science awarded by the President in 1988, the Arthur M. Bueche Award of the
      National Academy of Engineering in 1993, the Heinz Award for Technology, the
      Economy and Employment in 1998, the Madison Medal Award of Princeton University
      in 1999, the Sheffield Fellowship Award of the Yale University Faculty of
      Engineering in 2000, the International Federation of Operational Research
      Societies? Hall of Fame in 2005, and the Harold Larnder Prize of the Canadian
      Operational Research Society in 2006.
While continuing his research on integer
      programming Gomory has written on the nature of technology development, research
      in industry, and industrial competitiveness, and on models of international
      trade involving changing technologies and economies of scale. He is the author,
      with Professor William Baumol, of the book Global Trade and Conflicting
      National Interests (MIT Press 2001).

During his tenure IBM researchers made major contributions to the understanding of memory devices (Dennard Scalling), made major advances possible in high-density storage devices and produced advanced silicon processing methods. They also invented the relational database (Codd) and the RISC computer architecture. His researchers also won two successive Nobel Prizes in Physics and it was at IBM Research that Benoit Mandelbrot created the now widely accepted concept of Fractals.[7] He continued in a leadership role for the next 20 years eventually becoming IBM Senior Vice President for Science and Technology.[6]
After reaching the mandatory retirement age of 60 for corporate officers at IBM, Gomory became president of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation in 1989.[3]
During his tenure as president he led the foundation’s effort to sponsor research in numerous fields relevant to major national issues. The foundation’ work in the field of online learning predated the public Internet; its continued support has resulted in nearly seven million people taking online courses for credit as of 2012.[8] The foundation started the now-widespread program of industry studies, and launched a program advocating a more flexible workplace. It developed an approach to overcoming the problem of underrepresented minority Ph.D.’s in scientific and technical fields. Among scientific achievements, the foundation supported the widely recognized Sloan Digital Sky Survey, which has made major contributions to the problem of dark energy, and initiated a worldwide effort to survey life in the oceans known as the Census of Marine Life. Under Gomory's leadership the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation also supported programs on public understanding of science and the development of the Professional Science Masters, designed to allow students to pursue advanced training in science or mathematics while simultaneously developing workplace skills.[3]
In December 2007, after 18 years as President of the Sloan Foundation, Gomory became president emeritus and joined the Stern School of Business at New York University as a research professor.[9] Currently he focuses his work on addressing the increasing complexities of the globalized economy and the differing goals of countries and companies. His 2001 book, co-written with Professor William Baumol, Global Trade and Conflicting National Interests, focuses on the roles and responsibilities of American corporations in the modern American economy.
He served on the U.S. President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) from 1984 to 1992, and again from 2001 to 2009, advising three Presidents.[10]
He has also served as director of The Washington Post Company and The Bank of New York,[9] and he currently serves on the Board of the National Academies Board on Science, Technology and Economic Policy.[11]
Gomory currently blogs at The Huffington Post[4] and his work has been profiled in The Nation [12] and The Wall Street Journal.[13]
Awards and honors[edit]
Gomory has been awarded eight honorary degrees and many significant awards including the National Medal of Science.[14]
Awards: Lanchester Prize of the Operations Research Society, 1963; Harry Goode Memorial Award of the American Federation of Information Processing Societies, 1984; John von Neumann Theory Prize of INFORMS, 1984; IRI Medal of the Industrial Research Institute, 1985; National Medal of Science, 1988; IEEE Engineering Leadership Recognition Award, 1988;[15] Arthur M. Bueche Award of the National Academy of Engineering, 1993; the 4th Annual Heinz Award for Technology, the Economy and Employment, 1998; Madison Medal of Princeton University, 1999; Sheffield Fellowship Award of the Yale University Faculty of Engineering, 2000; International Federation of Operational Research Societies’ Hall of Fame, 2005; Harold Larnder Prize of the Canadian Operational Research Society, 2006.[5]
Gomory has been elected to many honorific societies including the National Academy of Science, the National Academy of Engineering, and the American Philosophical Society. Additionally three awards have been established in Gomory’s honor. The National Academy of Science’s Award for the industrial application of science, established by IBM,[16] the Ralph Gomory Prize of the Business History Conference, established by the Sloan Foundation,[17] and the Ralph E. Gomory Award for quality online education presented annually by the On-Line Consortium.[18]
Publication[edit]
In addition to the book Global Trade and Conflicting National Interests, Gomory has published more than 80 articles on a great variety of subjects including mathematics, economics, the management and impact of science and technology, and the role and function of corporations.[19]

Ralph Edward Gomory (born 7 May 1929) is an American applied mathematician and executive. Gomory worked at IBM as a researcher and later as an executive. During that time, his research led to the creation of new areas of applied mathematics.[2]
After his career in the corporate world, Gomory became the president of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, where he oversaw programs dedicated to broadening public understanding in three key areas: the economic importance of science and research; the effects of globalization on the United States; and the role of technology in education.[3]
Gomory has written extensively on the nature of technology development, industrial competitiveness, models of international trade, and the function of the corporation in a globalizing world.[4]

Biography[edit]
Gomory is the son of Andrew L. Gomory and Marian Schellenberg. He graduated from George School in Newtown, PA in 1946. He received his B.A. from Williams College in 1950, studied at Cambridge University, and received his Ph.D. in mathematics from Princeton University in 1954.[5]
He served in the U.S. Navy from 1954 to 1957. While serving in the Navy, he shifted his focus to applied mathematics in operations research. Among his mathematical achievements were founding contributions to the field of integer programming, an active area of research to this day. He was Higgins lecturer and assistant professor at Princeton University, 1957-59. He joined the Research Division of IBM in 1959.[6] In 1964 he was appointed IBM Fellow. In 1970, Gomory became Director of Research with line responsibility for IBM's Research Division. During his tenure IBM researchers made major contributions to the understanding of memory devices (Dennard Scalling), made major advances possible in high-density storage devices and produced advanced silicon processing methods. They also invented the relational database (Codd) and the RISC computer architecture. His researchers also won two successive Nobel Prizes in Physics and it was at IBM Research that Benoit Mandelbrot created the now widely accepted concept of Fractals.[7] He continued in a leadership role for the next 20 years eventually becoming IBM Senior Vice President for Science and Technology.[6]
After reaching the mandatory retirement age of 60 for corporate officers at IBM, Gomory became president of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation in 1989.[3]
During his tenure as president he led the foundation’s effort to sponsor research in numerous fields relevant to major national issues. The foundation’ work in the field of online learning predated the public Internet; its continued support has resulted in nearly seven million people taking online courses for credit as of 2012.[8] The foundation started the now-widespread program of industry studies, and launched a program advocating a more flexible workplace. It developed an approach to overcoming the problem of underrepresented minority Ph.D.’s in scientific and technical fields. Among scientific achievements, the foundation supported the widely recognized Sloan Digital Sky Survey, which has made major contributions to the problem of dark energy, and initiated a worldwide effort to survey life in the oceans known as the Census of Marine Life. Under Gomory's leadership the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation also supported programs on public understanding of science and the development of the Professional Science Masters, designed to allow students to pursue advanced training in science or mathematics while simultaneously developing workplace skills.[3]
In December 2007, after 18 years as President of the Sloan Foundation, Gomory became president emeritus and joined the Stern School of Business at New York University as a research professor.[9] Currently he focuses his work on addressing the increasing complexities of the globalized economy and the differing goals of countries and companies. His 2001 book, co-written with Professor William Baumol, Global Trade and Conflicting National Interests, focuses on the roles and responsibilities of American corporations in the modern American economy.
He served on the U.S. President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) from 1984 to 1992, and again from 2001 to 2009, advising three Presidents.[10]
He has also served as director of The Washington Post Company and The Bank of New York,[9] and he currently serves on the Board of the National Academies Board on Science, Technology and Economic Policy.[11]

Ralph Edward Gomory (born 7 May 1929) is an American applied mathematician and executive. Gomory worked at IBM as a researcher and later as an executive. During that time, his research led to the creation of new areas of applied mathematics.[2]
After his career in the corporate world, Gomory became the president of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, where he oversaw programs dedicated to broadening public understanding in three key areas: the economic importance of science and research; the effects of globalization on the United States; and the role of technology in education.[3]
Gomory has written extensively on the nature of technology development, industrial competitiveness, models of international trade, and the function of the corporation in a globalizing world.[4]

Biography[edit]
Gomory is the son of Andrew L. Gomory and Marian Schellenberg. He graduated from George School in Newtown, PA in 1946. He received his B.A. from Williams College in 1950, studied at Cambridge University, and received his Ph.D. in mathematics from Princeton University in 1954.[5]
He served in the U.S. Navy from 1954 to 1957. While serving in the Navy, he shifted his focus to applied mathematics in operations research. Among his mathematical achievements were founding contributions to the field of integer programming, an active area of research to this day. He was Higgins lecturer and assistant professor at Princeton University, 1957-59. He joined the Research Division of IBM in 1959.[6] In 1964 he was appointed IBM Fellow. In 1970, Gomory became Director of Research with line responsibility for IBM's Research Division. During his tenure IBM researchers made major contributions to the understanding of memory devices (Dennard Scalling), made major advances possible in high-density storage devices and produced advanced silicon processing methods. They also invented the relational database (Codd) and the RISC computer architecture. His researchers also won two successive Nobel Prizes in Physics and it was at IBM Research that Benoit Mandelbrot created the now widely accepted concept of Fractals.[7] He continued in a leadership role for the next 20 years eventually becoming IBM Senior Vice President for Science and Technology.[6]
After reaching the mandatory retirement age of 60 for corporate officers at IBM, Gomory became president of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation in 1989.[3]
During his tenure as president he led the foundation’s effort to sponsor research in numerous fields relevant to major national issues. The foundation’ work in the field of online learning predated the public Internet; its continued support has resulted in nearly seven million people taking online courses for credit as of 2012.[8] The foundation started the now-widespread program of industry studies, and launched a program advocating a more flexible workplace. It developed an approach to overcoming the problem of underrepresented minority Ph.D.’s in scientific and technical fields. Among scientific achievements, the foundation supported the widely recognized Sloan Digital Sky Survey, which has made major contributions to the problem of dark energy, and initiated a worldwide effort to survey life in the oceans known as the Census of Marine Life. Under Gomory's leadership the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation also supported programs on public understanding of science and the development of the Professional Science Masters, designed to allow students to pursue advanced training in science or mathematics while simultaneously developing workplace skills.[3]
In December 2007, after 18 years as President of the Sloan Foundation, Gomory became president emeritus and joined the Stern School of Business at New York University as a research professor.[9] Currently he focuses his work on addressing the increasing complexities of the globalized economy and the differing goals of countries and companies. His 2001 book, co-written with Professor William Baumol, Global Trade and Conflicting National Interests, focuses on the roles and responsibilities of American corporations in the modern American economy.
He served on the U.S. President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) from 1984 to 1992, and again from 2001 to 2009, advising three Presidents.[10]
He has also served as director of The Washington Post Company and The Bank of New York,[9] and he currently serves on the Board of the National Academies Board on Science, Technology and Economic Policy.[11]
Gomory currently blogs at The Huffington Post[4] and his work has been profiled in The Nation [12] and The Wall Street Journal.[13]
Awards and honors[edit]
Gomory has been awarded eight honorary degrees and many significant awards including the National Medal of Science.[14]
Awards: Lanchester Prize of the Operations Research Society, 1963; Harry Goode Memorial Award of the American Federation of Information Processing Societies, 1984; John von Neumann Theory Prize of INFORMS, 1984; IRI Medal of the Industrial Research Institute, 1985; National Medal of Science, 1988; IEEE Engineering Leadership Recognition Award, 1988;[15] Arthur M. Bueche Award of the National Academy of Engineering, 1993; the 4th Annual Heinz Award for Technology, the Economy and Employment, 1998; Madison Medal of Princeton University, 1999; Sheffield Fellowship Award of the Yale University Faculty of Engineering, 2000; International Federation of Operational Research Societies’ Hall of Fame, 2005; Harold Larnder Prize of the Canadian Operational Research Society, 2006.[5]
Gomory has been elected to many honorific societies including the National Academy of Science, the National Academy of Engineering, and the American Philosophical Society. Additionally three awards have been established in Gomory’s honor. The National Academy of Science’s Award for the industrial application of science, established by IBM,[16] the Ralph Gomory Prize of the Business History Conference, established by the Sloan Foundation,[17] and the Ralph E. Gomory Award for quality online education presented annually by the On-Line Consortium.[18]
Publication[edit]
In addition to the book Global Trade and Conflicting National Interests, Gomory has published more than 80 articles on a great variety of subjects including mathematics, economics, the management and impact of science and technology, and the role and function of corporations.[19]

Ralph Edward Gomory (born 7 May 1929) is an American applied mathematician and executive. Gomory worked at IBM as a researcher and later as an executive. During that time, his research led to the creation of new areas of applied mathematics.[2]
After his career in the corporate world, Gomory became the president of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, where he oversaw programs dedicated to broadening public understanding in three key areas: the economic importance of science and research; the effects of globalization on the United States; and the role of technology in education.[3]
Gomory has written extensively on the nature of technology development, industrial competitiveness, models of international trade, and the function of the corporation in a globalizing world.[4]

Biography[edit]
Gomory is the son of Andrew L. Gomory and Marian Schellenberg. He graduated from George School in Newtown, PA in 1946. He received his B.A. from Williams College in 1950, studied at Cambridge University, and received his Ph.D. in mathematics from Princeton University in 1954.[5]
He served in the U.S. Navy from 1954 to 1957. While serving in the Navy, he shifted his focus to applied mathematics in operations research. Among his mathematical achievements were founding contributions to the field of integer programming, an active area of research to this day. He was Higgins lecturer and assistant professor at Princeton University, 1957-59. He joined the Research Division of IBM in 1959.[6] In 1964 he was appointed IBM Fellow. In 1970, Gomory became Director of Research with line responsibility for IBM's Research Division. During his tenure IBM researchers made major contributions to the understanding of memory devices (Dennard Scalling), made major advances possible in high-density storage devices and produced advanced silicon processing methods. They also invented the relational database (Codd) and the RISC computer architecture. His researchers also won two successive Nobel Prizes in Physics and it was at IBM Research that Benoit Mandelbrot created the now widely accepted concept of Fractals.[7] He continued in a leadership role for the next 20 years eventually becoming IBM Senior Vice President for Science and Technology.[6]
After reaching the mandatory retirement age of 60 for corporate officers at IBM, Gomory became president of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation in 1989.[3]
During his tenure as president he led the foundation’s effort to sponsor research in numerous fields relevant to major national issues. The foundation’ work in the field of online learning predated the public Internet; its continued support has resulted in nearly seven million people taking online courses for credit as of 2012.[8] The foundation started the now-widespread program of industry studies, and launched a program advocating a more flexible workplace. It developed an approach to overcoming the problem of underrepresented minority Ph.D.’s in scientific and technical fields. Among scientific achievements, the foundation supported the widely recognized Sloan Digital Sky Survey, which has made major contributions to the problem of dark energy, and initiated a worldwide effort to survey life in the oceans known as the Census of Marine Life. Under Gomory's leadership the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation also supported programs on public understanding of science and the development of the Professional Science Masters, designed to allow students to pursue advanced training in science or mathematics while simultaneously developing workplace skills.[3]
In December 2007, after 18 years as President of the Sloan Foundation, Gomory became president emeritus and joined the Stern School of Business at New York University as a research professor.[9] Currently he focuses his work on addressing the increasing complexities of the globalized economy and the differing goals of countries and companies. His 2001 book, co-written with Professor William Baumol, Global Trade and Conflicting National Interests, focuses on the roles and responsibilities of American corporations in the modern American economy.
He served on the U.S. President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) from 1984 to 1992, and again from 2001 to 2009, advising three Presidents.[10]
He has also served as director of The Washington Post Company and The Bank of New York,[9] and he currently serves on the Board of the National Academies Board on Science, Technology and Economic Policy.[11]
Gomory currently blogs at The Huffington Post[4] and his work has been profiled in The Nation [12] and The Wall Street Journal.[13]
Awards and honors[edit]
Gomory has been awarded eight honorary degrees and many significant awards including the National Medal of Science.[14]
Awards: Lanchester Prize of the Operations Research Society, 1963; Harry Goode Memorial Award of the American Federation of Information Processing Societies, 1984; John von Neumann Theory Prize of INFORMS, 1984; IRI Medal of the Industrial Research Institute, 1985; National Medal of Science, 1988; IEEE Engineering Leadership Recognition Award, 1988;[15] Arthur M. Bueche Award of the National Academy of Engineering, 1993; the 4th Annual Heinz Award for Technology, the Economy and Employment, 1998; Madison Medal of Princeton University, 1999; Sheffield Fellowship Award of the Yale University Faculty of Engineering, 2000; International Federation of Operational Research Societies’ Hall of Fame, 2005; Harold Larnder Prize of the Canadian Operational Research Society, 2006.[5]
Gomory has been elected to many honorific societies including the National Academy of Science, the National Academy of Engineering, and the American Philosophical Society. Additionally three awards have been established in Gomory’s honor. The National Academy of Science’s Award for the industrial application of science, established by IBM,[16] the Ralph Gomory Prize of the Business History Conference, established by the Sloan Foundation,[17] and the Ralph E. Gomory Award for quality online education presented annually by the On-Line Consortium.[18]
Publication[edit]
In addition to the book Global Trade and Conflicting National Interests, Gomory has published more than 80 articles on a great variety of subjects including mathematics, economics, the management and impact of science and technology, and the role and function of corporations.[19]

Ralph Edward Gomory (born 7 May 1929) is an American applied mathematician and executive. Gomory worked at IBM as a researcher and later as an executive. During that time, his research led to the creation of new areas of applied mathematics.[2]
After his career in the corporate world, Gomory became the president of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, where he oversaw programs dedicated to broadening public understanding in three key areas: the economic importance of science and research; the effects of globalization on the United States; and the role of technology in education.[3]
Gomory has written extensively on the nature of technology development, industrial competitiveness, models of international trade, and the function of the corporation in a globalizing world.[4]

Biography[edit]
Gomory is the son of Andrew L. Gomory and Marian Schellenberg. He graduated from George School in Newtown, PA in 1946. He received his B.A. from Williams College in 1950, studied at Cambridge University, and received his Ph.D. in mathematics from Princeton University in 1954.[5]
He served in the U.S. Navy from 1954 to 1957. While serving in the Navy, he shifted his focus to applied mathematics in operations research. Among his mathematical achievements were founding contributions to the field of integer programming, an active area of research to this day. He was Higgins lecturer and assistant professor at Princeton University, 1957-59. He joined the Research Division of IBM in 1959.[6] In 1964 he was appointed IBM Fellow. In 1970, Gomory became Director of Research with line responsibility for IBM's Research Division. During his tenure IBM researchers made major contributions to the understanding of memory devices (Dennard Scalling), made major advances possible in high-density storage devices and produced advanced silicon processing methods. They also invented the relational database (Codd) and the RISC computer architecture. His researchers also won two successive Nobel Prizes in Physics and it was at IBM Research that Benoit Mandelbrot created the now widely accepted concept of Fractals.[7] He continued in a leadership role for the next 20 years eventually becoming IBM Senior Vice President for Science and Technology.[6]
After reaching the mandatory retirement age of 60 for corporate officers at IBM, Gomory became president of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation in 1989.[3]
During his tenure as president he led the foundation’s effort to sponsor research in numerous fields relevant to major national issues. The foundation’ work in the field of online learning predated the public Internet; its continued support has resulted in nearly seven million people taking online courses for credit as of 2012.[8] The foundation started the now-widespread program of industry studies, and launched a program advocating a more flexible workplace. It developed an approach to overcoming the problem of underrepresented minority Ph.D.’s in scientific and technical fields. Among scientific achievements, the foundation supported the widely recognized Sloan Digital Sky Survey, which has made major contributions to the problem of dark energy, and initiated a worldwide effort to survey life in the oceans known as the Census of Marine Life. Under Gomory's leadership the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation also supported programs on public understanding of science and the development of the Professional Science Masters, designed to allow students to pursue advanced training in science or mathematics while simultaneously developing workplace skills.[3]
In December 2007, after 18 years as President of the Sloan Foundation, Gomory became president emeritus and joined the Stern School of Business at New York University as a research professor.[9] Currently he focuses his work on addressing the increasing complexities of the globalized economy and the differing goals of countries and companies. His 2001 book, co-written with Professor William Baumol, Global Trade and Conflicting National Interests, focuses on the roles and responsibilities of American corporations in the modern American economy.
He served on the U.S. President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) from 1984 to 1992, and again from 2001 to 2009, advising three Presidents.[10]
He has also served as director of The Washington Post Company and The Bank of New York,[9] and he currently serves on the Board of the National Academies Board on Science, Technology and Economic Policy.[11]
Gomory currently blogs at The Huffington Post[4] and his work has been profiled in The Nation [12] and The Wall Street Journal.[13]
Awards and honors[edit]
Gomory has been awarded eight honorary degrees and many significant awards including the National Medal of Science.[14]
Awards: Lanchester Prize of the Operations Research Society, 1963; Harry Goode Memorial Award of the American Federation of Information Processing Societies, 1984; John von Neumann Theory Prize of INFORMS, 1984; IRI Medal of the Industrial Research Institute, 1985; National Medal of Science, 1988; IEEE Engineering Leadership Recognition Award, 1988;[15] Arthur M. Bueche Award of the National Academy of Engineering, 1993; the 4th Annual Heinz Award for Technology, the Economy and Employment, 1998; Madison Medal of Princeton University, 1999; Sheffield Fellowship Award of the Yale University Faculty of Engineering, 2000; International Federation of Operational Research Societies’ Hall of Fame, 2005; Harold Larnder Prize of the Canadian Operational Research Society, 2006.[5]
Gomory has been elected to many honorific societies including the National Academy of Science, the National Academy of Engineering, and the American Philosophical Society. Additionally three awards have been established in Gomory’s honor. The National Academy of Science’s Award for the industrial application of science, established by IBM,[16] the Ralph Gomory Prize of the Business History Conference, established by the Sloan Foundation,[17] and the Ralph E. Gomory Award for quality online education presented annually by the On-Line Consortium.[18]
Publication[edit]
In addition to the book Global Trade and Conflicting National Interests, Gomory has published more than 80 articles on a great variety of subjects including mathematics, economics, the management and impact of science and technology, and the role and function of corporations.[19]

Born:           May 7, 1929                

Brief Biography
Ralph Gomory is a pioneer in integer optimization who has served as Chairman of IBM Research’s Mathematical Sciences Department, Director of Research for IBM, President of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, and research professor at NYU’s Leonard N. Stern School of Business.  Earlier, he spent a pivotal summer at RAND and was an Andrew Dickson White Professor at Cornell. He has been elected to the National Academy of Sciences, the national Academy of Engineering and the American Philosophical Society, and to the Councils of all three societies.  In addition to his major contributions to Operations Research, he has written on the nature of industrial research and on global trade.Gomory originally studied physics at Williams College but was drawn to mathematics there, and wrote a Princeton Ph.D. thesis on nonlinear differential equations.  After completing his Ph.D. he joined the U.S. Navy as an officer and was assigned to the Physics Branch of Office of Naval Research in DC.  There he discovered the Operations Research Group (ORG) and learned linear programming from Alan Goldman. He remained with ORG as a consultant after joining the Princeton faculty, traveling to Washington to consult on Navy problems.  One of these dealt with LP solutions that proposed such oddities as fractional aircraft carriers.  He discovered that constraints could be added to the problem that cut away fractional solutions, incorporated this cutting-plane approach into an algorithm, and proved that it converged to an integer optimum in a finite number of steps. His appointment as IBM’s Director of Research reduced his own research output, but he continued to explore the geometry, algebra, computation and economics of integer programming, with new contributions more than 45 years after his original cutting-plane paper.Through his exposure to ORG, Gomory learned of OR as “mathematics applied to everyday problems: problems of a company, scheduling problems, etc.” and thought “oh, that’s what I want to do!”  Later, at IBM, he collaborated with co-authors including Michel Balinski, Paul Gilmore, T.C. Hu, Alan Hoffman and others on papers that tackled many core OR problems, such as the knapsack, traveling salesman, cutting stock, network flow, machine sequencing, lot size and inventory problems.  With Gilmore, he visited a number of IBM customer sites to understand their problems.  At paper mills, they hit upon the problem of minimizing waste in cutting a large standard-sized roll of paper into a mix of smaller rolls ordered by customers. Their solution to this practical problem won the Lanchester Prize in 1963.  This work, together with his contributions to the theoretical underpinnings of OR, earned Gomory the 1984 John von Neumann Theory Prize awarded by INFORMS. He became an IBM Fellow, the highest honor a scientist, engineer or programmer can achieve at the company, and moved into management, first of the Mathematical Sciences department and then all of IBM Research.  During his 20 year tenure as research head the Research Division made such technology advances as the single-transistor memory cell, high-density storage devices, silicon processing methods, the relational database and the RISC computer architecture. His researchers also won two successive Nobel Prizes in Physics.During his eighteen years as Sloan Foundation President, the Foundation pioneered work on the threat of bioterrorism, online learning, under-represented minorities in science and technology, the Sloan Sky Survey, the Census of Marine Life, and the development of the Professional Science Masters degree.

Ralph Edward Gomory (born 7 May 1929) is an American applied mathematician and executive. Gomory worked at IBM as a researcher and later as an executive. During that time, his research led to the creation of new areas of applied mathematics.[2]
After his career in the corporate world, Gomory became the president of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, where he oversaw programs dedicated to broadening public understanding in three key areas: the economic importance of science and research; the effects of globalization on the United States; and the role of technology in education.[3]
Gomory has written extensively on the nature of technology development, industrial competitiveness, models of international trade, and the function of the corporation in a globalizing world.[4]

Biography[edit]
Gomory is the son of Andrew L. Gomory and Marian Schellenberg. He graduated from George School in Newtown, PA in 1946. He received his B.A. from Williams College in 1950, studied at Cambridge University, and received his Ph.D. in mathematics from Princeton University in 1954.[5]
He served in the U.S. Navy from 1954 to 1957. While serving in the Navy, he shifted his focus to applied mathematics in operations research. Among his mathematical achievements were founding contributions to the field of integer programming, an active area of research to this day. He was Higgins lecturer and assistant professor at Princeton University, 1957-59. He joined the Research Division of IBM in 1959.[6] In 1964 he was appointed IBM Fellow. In 1970, Gomory became Director of Research with line responsibility for IBM's Research Division. During his tenure IBM researchers made major contributions to the understanding of memory devices (Dennard Scalling), made major advances possible in high-density storage devices and produced advanced silicon processing methods. They also invented the relational database (Codd) and the RISC computer architecture. His researchers also won two successive Nobel Prizes in Physics and it was at IBM Research that Benoit Mandelbrot created the now widely accepted concept of Fractals.[7] He continued in a leadership role for the next 20 years eventually becoming IBM Senior Vice President for Science and Technology.[6]
After reaching the mandatory retirement age of 60 for corporate officers at IBM, Gomory became president of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation in 1989.[3]
During his tenure as president he led the foundation’s effort to sponsor research in numerous fields relevant to major national issues. The foundation’ work in the field of online learning predated the public Internet; its continued support has resulted in nearly seven million people taking online courses for credit as of 2012.[8] The foundation started the now-widespread program of industry studies, and launched a program advocating a more flexible workplace. It developed an approach to overcoming the problem of underrepresented minority Ph.D.’s in scientific and technical fields. Among scientific achievements, the foundation supported the widely recognized Sloan Digital Sky Survey, which has made major contributions to the problem of dark energy, and initiated a worldwide effort to survey life in the oceans known as the Census of Marine Life. Under Gomory's leadership the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation also supported programs on public understanding of science and the development of the Professional Science Masters, designed to allow students to pursue advanced training in science or mathematics while simultaneously developing workplace skills.[3]
In December 2007, after 18 years as President of the Sloan Foundation, Gomory became president emeritus and joined the Stern School of Business at New York University as a research professor.[9] Currently he focuses his work on addressing the increasing complexities of the globalized economy and the differing goals of countries and companies. His 2001 book, co-written with Professor William Baumol, Global Trade and Conflicting National Interests, focuses on the roles and responsibilities of American corporations in the modern American economy.
He served on the U.S. President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) from 1984 to 1992, and again from 2001 to 2009, advising three Presidents.[10]
He has also served as director of The Washington Post Company and The Bank of New York,[9] and he currently serves on the Board of the National Academies Board on Science, Technology and Economic Policy.[11]
Gomory currently blogs at The Huffington Post[4] and his work has been profiled in The Nation [12] and The Wall Street Journal.[13]
Awards and honors[edit]
Gomory has been awarded eight honorary degrees and many significant awards including the National Medal of Science.[14]
Awards: Lanchester Prize of the Operations Research Society, 1963; Harry Goode Memorial Award of the American Federation of Information Processing Societies, 1984; John von Neumann Theory Prize of INFORMS, 1984; IRI Medal of the Industrial Research Institute, 1985; National Medal of Science, 1988; IEEE Engineering Leadership Recognition Award, 1988;[15] Arthur M. Bueche Award of the National Academy of Engineering, 1993; the 4th Annual Heinz Award for Technology, the Economy and Employment, 1998; Madison Medal of Princeton University, 1999; Sheffield Fellowship Award of the Yale University Faculty of Engineering, 2000; International Federation of Operational Research Societies’ Hall of Fame, 2005; Harold Larnder Prize of the Canadian Operational Research Society, 2006.[5]
Gomory has been elected to many honorific societies including the National Academy of Science, the National Academy of Engineering, and the American Philosophical Society. Additionally three awards have been established in Gomory’s honor. The National Academy of Science’s Award for the industrial application of science, established by IBM,[16] the Ralph Gomory Prize of the Business History Conference, established by the Sloan Foundation,[17] and the Ralph E. Gomory Award for quality online education presented annually by the On-Line Consortium.[18]
Publication[edit]
In addition to the book Global Trade and Conflicting National Interests, Gomory has published more than 80 articles on a great variety of subjects including mathematics, economics, the management and impact of science and technology, and the role and function of corporations.[19]

Ralph Edward Gomory (born 7 May 1929) is an American applied mathematician and executive. Gomory worked at IBM as a researcher and later as an executive. During that time, his research led to the creation of new areas of applied mathematics.[2]
After his career in the corporate world, Gomory became the president of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, where he oversaw programs dedicated to broadening public understanding in three key areas: the economic importance of science and research; the effects of globalization on the United States; and the role of technology in education.[3]
Gomory has written extensively on the nature of technology development, industrial competitiveness, models of international trade, and the function of the corporation in a globalizing world.[4]

Biography[edit]
Gomory is the son of Andrew L. Gomory and Marian Schellenberg. He graduated from George School in Newtown, PA in 1946. He received his B.A. from Williams College in 1950, studied at Cambridge University, and received his Ph.D. in mathematics from Princeton University in 1954.[5]
He served in the U.S. Navy from 1954 to 1957. While serving in the Navy, he shifted his focus to applied mathematics in operations research. Among his mathematical achievements were founding contributions to the field of integer programming, an active area of research to this day. He was Higgins lecturer and assistant professor at Princeton University, 1957-59. He joined the Research Division of IBM in 1959.[6] In 1964 he was appointed IBM Fellow. In 1970, Gomory became Director of Research with line responsibility for IBM's Research Division. During his tenure IBM researchers made major contributions to the understanding of memory devices (Dennard Scalling), made major advances possible in high-density storage devices and produced advanced silicon processing methods. They also invented the relational database (Codd) and the RISC computer architecture. His researchers also won two successive Nobel Prizes in Physics and it was at IBM Research that Benoit Mandelbrot created the now widely accepted concept of Fractals.[7] He continued in a leadership role for the next 20 years eventually becoming IBM Senior Vice President for Science and Technology.[6]
After reaching the mandatory retirement age of 60 for corporate officers at IBM, Gomory became president of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation in 1989.[3]
During his tenure as president he led the foundation’s effort to sponsor research in numerous fields relevant to major national issues. The foundation’ work in the field of online learning predated the public Internet; its continued support has resulted in nearly seven million people taking online courses for credit as of 2012.[8] The foundation started the now-widespread program of industry studies, and launched a program advocating a more flexible workplace. It developed an approach to overcoming the problem of underrepresented minority Ph.D.’s in scientific and technical fields. Among scientific achievements, the foundation supported the widely recognized Sloan Digital Sky Survey, which has made major contributions to the problem of dark energy, and initiated a worldwide effort to survey life in the oceans known as the Census of Marine Life. Under Gomory's leadership the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation also supported programs on public understanding of science and the development of the Professional Science Masters, designed to allow students to pursue advanced training in science or mathematics while simultaneously developing workplace skills.[3]
In December 2007, after 18 years as President of the Sloan Foundation, Gomory became president emeritus and joined the Stern School of Business at New York University as a research professor.[9] Currently he focuses his work on addressing the increasing complexities of the globalized economy and the differing goals of countries and companies. His 2001 book, co-written with Professor William Baumol, Global Trade and Conflicting National Interests, focuses on the roles and responsibilities of American corporations in the modern American economy.
He served on the U.S. President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) from 1984 to 1992, and again from 2001 to 2009, advising three Presidents.[10]
He has also served as director of The Washington Post Company and The Bank of New York,[9] and he currently serves on the Board of the National Academies Board on Science, Technology and Economic Policy.[11]
Gomory currently blogs at The Huffington Post[4] and his work has been profiled in The Nation [12] and The Wall Street Journal.[13]
Awards and honors[edit]
Gomory has been awarded eight honorary degrees and many significant awards including the National Medal of Science.[14]
Awards: Lanchester Prize of the Operations Research Society, 1963; Harry Goode Memorial Award of the American Federation of Information Processing Societies, 1984; John von Neumann Theory Prize of INFORMS, 1984; IRI Medal of the Industrial Research Institute, 1985; National Medal of Science, 1988; IEEE Engineering Leadership Recognition Award, 1988;[15] Arthur M. Bueche Award of the National Academy of Engineering, 1993; the 4th Annual Heinz Award for Technology, the Economy and Employment, 1998; Madison Medal of Princeton University, 1999; Sheffield Fellowship Award of the Yale University Faculty of Engineering, 2000; International Federation of Operational Research Societies’ Hall of Fame, 2005; Harold Larnder Prize of the Canadian Operational Research Society, 2006.[5]
Gomory has been elected to many honorific societies including the National Academy of Science, the National Academy of Engineering, and the American Philosophical Society. Additionally three awards have been established in Gomory’s honor. The National Academy of Science’s Award for the industrial application of science, established by IBM,[16] the Ralph Gomory Prize of the Business History Conference, established by the Sloan Foundation,[17] and the Ralph E. Gomory Award for quality online education presented annually by the On-Line Consortium.[18]
Publication[edit]
In addition to the book Global Trade and Conflicting National Interests, Gomory has published more than 80 articles on a great variety of subjects including mathematics, economics, the management and impact of science and technology, and the role and function of corporations.[19]

Ralph Edward Gomory (born 7 May 1929) is an American applied mathematician and executive. Gomory worked at IBM as a researcher and later as an executive. During that time, his research led to the creation of new areas of applied mathematics.[2]
After his career in the corporate world, Gomory became the president of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, where he oversaw programs dedicated to broadening public understanding in three key areas: the economic importance of science and research; the effects of globalization on the United States; and the role of technology in education.[3]
Gomory has written extensively on the nature of technology development, industrial competitiveness, models of international trade, and the function of the corporation in a globalizing world.[4]

Biography[edit]
Gomory is the son of Andrew L. Gomory and Marian Schellenberg. He graduated from George School in Newtown, PA in 1946. He received his B.A. from Williams College in 1950, studied at Cambridge University, and received his Ph.D. in mathematics from Princeton University in 1954.[5]
He served in the U.S. Navy from 1954 to 1957. While serving in the Navy, he shifted his focus to applied mathematics in operations research. Among his mathematical achievements were founding contributions to the field of integer programming, an active area of research to this day. He was Higgins lecturer and assistant professor at Princeton University, 1957-59. He joined the Research Division of IBM in 1959.[6] In 1964 he was appointed IBM Fellow. In 1970, Gomory became Director of Research with line responsibility for IBM's Research Division. During his tenure IBM researchers made major contributions to the understanding of memory devices (Dennard Scalling), made major advances possible in high-density storage devices and produced advanced silicon processing methods. They also invented the relational database (Codd) and the RISC computer architecture. His researchers also won two successive Nobel Prizes in Physics and it was at IBM Research that Benoit Mandelbrot created the now widely accepted concept of Fractals.[7] He continued in a leadership role for the next 20 years eventually becoming IBM Senior Vice President for Science and Technology.[6]
After reaching the mandatory retirement age of 60 for corporate officers at IBM, Gomory became president of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation in 1989.[3]
During his tenure as president he led the foundation’s effort to sponsor research in numerous fields relevant to major national issues. The foundation’ work in the field of online learning predated the public Internet; its continued support has resulted in nearly seven million people taking online courses for credit as of 2012.[8] The foundation started the now-widespread program of industry studies, and launched a program advocating a more flexible workplace. It developed an approach to overcoming the problem of underrepresented minority Ph.D.’s in scientific and technical fields. Among scientific achievements, the foundation supported the widely recognized Sloan Digital Sky Survey, which has made major contributions to the problem of dark energy, and initiated a worldwide effort to survey life in the oceans known as the Census of Marine Life. Under Gomory's leadership the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation also supported programs on public understanding of science and the development of the Professional Science Masters, designed to allow students to pursue advanced training in science or mathematics while simultaneously developing workplace skills.[3]
In December 2007, after 18 years as President of the Sloan Foundation, Gomory became president emeritus and joined the Stern School of Business at New York University as a research professor.[9] Currently he focuses his work on addressing the increasing complexities of the globalized economy and the differing goals of countries and companies. His 2001 book, co-written with Professor William Baumol, Global Trade and Conflicting National Interests, focuses on the roles and responsibilities of American corporations in the modern American economy.
He served on the U.S. President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) from 1984 to 1992, and again from 2001 to 2009, advising three Presidents.[10]
He has also served as director of The Washington Post Company and The Bank of New York,[9] and he currently serves on the Board of the National Academies Board on Science, Technology and Economic Policy.[11]
Gomory currently blogs at The Huffington Post[4] and his work has been profiled in The Nation [12] and The Wall Street Journal.[13]
Awards and honors[edit]
Gomory has been awarded eight honorary degrees and many significant awards including the National Medal of Science.[14]
Awards: Lanchester Prize of the Operations Research Society, 1963; Harry Goode Memorial Award of the American Federation of Information Processing Societies, 1984; John von Neumann Theory Prize of INFORMS, 1984; IRI Medal of the Industrial Research Institute, 1985; National Medal of Science, 1988; IEEE Engineering Leadership Recognition Award, 1988;[15] Arthur M. Bueche Award of the National Academy of Engineering, 1993; the 4th Annual Heinz Award for Technology, the Economy and Employment, 1998; Madison Medal of Princeton University, 1999; Sheffield Fellowship Award of the Yale University Faculty of Engineering, 2000; International Federation of Operational Research Societies’ Hall of Fame, 2005; Harold Larnder Prize of the Canadian Operational Research Society, 2006.[5]
Gomory has been elected to many honorific societies including the National Academy of Science, the National Academy of Engineering, and the American Philosophical Society. Additionally three awards have been established in Gomory’s honor. The National Academy of Science’s Award for the industrial application of science, established by IBM,[16] the Ralph Gomory Prize of the Business History Conference, established by the Sloan Foundation,[17] and the Ralph E. Gomory Award for quality online education presented annually by the On-Line Consortium.[18]
Publication[edit]
In addition to the book Global Trade and Conflicting National Interests, Gomory has published more than 80 articles on a great variety of subjects including mathematics, economics, the management and impact of science and technology, and the role and function of corporations.[19]

Ralph Edward Gomory (born 7 May 1929) is an American applied mathematician and executive. Gomory worked at IBM as a researcher and later as an executive. During that time, his research led to the creation of new areas of applied mathematics.[2]
After his career in the corporate world, Gomory became the president of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, where he oversaw programs dedicated to broadening public understanding in three key areas: the economic importance of science and research; the effects of globalization on the United States; and the role of technology in education.[3]
Gomory has written extensively on the nature of technology development, industrial competitiveness, models of international trade, and the function of the corporation in a globalizing world.[4]

Biography[edit]
Gomory is the son of Andrew L. Gomory and Marian Schellenberg. He graduated from George School in Newtown, PA in 1946. He received his B.A. from Williams College in 1950, studied at Cambridge University, and received his Ph.D. in mathematics from Princeton University in 1954.[5]
He served in the U.S. Navy from 1954 to 1957. While serving in the Navy, he shifted his focus to applied mathematics in operations research. Among his mathematical achievements were founding contributions to the field of integer programming, an active area of research to this day. He was Higgins lecturer and assistant professor at Princeton University, 1957-59. He joined the Research Division of IBM in 1959.[6] In 1964 he was appointed IBM Fellow. In 1970, Gomory became Director of Research with line responsibility for IBM's Research Division. During his tenure IBM researchers made major contributions to the understanding of memory devices (Dennard Scalling), made major advances possible in high-density storage devices and produced advanced silicon processing methods. They also invented the relational database (Codd) and the RISC computer architecture. His researchers also won two successive Nobel Prizes in Physics and it was at IBM Research that Benoit Mandelbrot created the now widely accepted concept of Fractals.[7] He continued in a leadership role for the next 20 years eventually becoming IBM Senior Vice President for Science and Technology.[6]
After reaching the mandatory retirement age of 60 for corporate officers at IBM, Gomory became president of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation in 1989.[3]
During his tenure as president he led the foundation’s effort to sponsor research in numerous fields relevant to major national issues. The foundation’ work in the field of online learning predated the public Internet; its continued support has resulted in nearly seven million people taking online courses for credit as of 2012.[8] The foundation started the now-widespread program of industry studies, and launched a program advocating a more flexible workplace. It developed an approach to overcoming the problem of underrepresented minority Ph.D.’s in scientific and technical fields. Among scientific achievements, the foundation supported the widely recognized Sloan Digital Sky Survey, which has made major contributions to the problem of dark energy, and initiated a worldwide effort to survey life in the oceans known as the Census of Marine Life. Under Gomory's leadership the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation also supported programs on public understanding of science and the development of the Professional Science Masters, designed to allow students to pursue advanced training in science or mathematics while simultaneously developing workplace skills.[3]
In December 2007, after 18 years as President of the Sloan Foundation, Gomory became president emeritus and joined the Stern School of Business at New York University as a research professor.[9] Currently he focuses his work on addressing the increasing complexities of the globalized economy and the differing goals of countries and companies. His 2001 book, co-written with Professor William Baumol, Global Trade and Conflicting National Interests, focuses on the roles and responsibilities of American corporations in the modern American economy.
He served on the U.S. President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) from 1984 to 1992, and again from 2001 to 2009, advising three Presidents.[10]
He has also served as director of The Washington Post Company and The Bank of New York,[9] and he currently serves on the Board of the National Academies Board on Science, Technology and Economic Policy.[11]
Gomory currently blogs at The Huffington Post[4] and his work has been profiled in The Nation [12] and The Wall Street Journal.[13]
Awards and honors[edit]
Gomory has been awarded eight honorary degrees and many significant awards including the National Medal of Science.[14]
Awards: Lanchester Prize of the Operations Research Society, 1963; Harry Goode Memorial Award of the American Federation of Information Processing Societies, 1984; John von Neumann Theory Prize of INFORMS, 1984; IRI Medal of the Industrial Research Institute, 1985; National Medal of Science, 1988; IEEE Engineering Leadership Recognition Award, 1988;[15] Arthur M. Bueche Award of the National Academy of Engineering, 1993; the 4th Annual Heinz Award for Technology, the Economy and Employment, 1998; Madison Medal of Princeton University, 1999; Sheffield Fellowship Award of the Yale University Faculty of Engineering, 2000; International Federation of Operational Research Societies’ Hall of Fame, 2005; Harold Larnder Prize of the Canadian Operational Research Society, 2006.[5]
Gomory has been elected to many honorific societies including the National Academy of Science, the National Academy of Engineering, and the American Philosophical Society. Additionally three awards have been established in Gomory’s honor. The National Academy of Science’s Award for the industrial application of science, established by IBM,[16] the Ralph Gomory Prize of the Business History Conference, established by the Sloan Foundation,[17] and the Ralph E. Gomory Award for quality online education presented annually by the On-Line Consortium.[18]
Publication[edit]
In addition to the book Global Trade and Conflicting National Interests, Gomory has published more than 80 articles on a great variety of subjects including mathematics, economics, the management and impact of science and technology, and the role and function of corporations.[19]

Classic Movie Actresses...when they were young


























 
 


 




  
 







MovieMaidens is dedicated to the most beautiful classic actresses during the first 75 years of Hollywood...remembering them when they were young and beautiful. 

We are so sick of seeing history's most beautiful female actors portrayed as old women. How many times have you seen Joan Crawford with enormous eyebrows and clown-like lipstick, Bette Davis as a shaky old woman with a cigarette, Elizabeth Taylor at 220 pounds, or any aging actress after too many plastic surgeries?  
 These actresses burst onto the Hollywood scene as beautiful young women, and they should be remembered as the gorgeous girls that they were.   We want everyone to experience the beauty of these women, to encourage you to watch their old movies, and to fall in love with them, as moviegoers did, when they were young. 



Dame of the Day:

                            Ann  Sheridan

The "Oomph" Girl1940s


“They nicknamed me "The Oomph Girl", and I loathe that nickname! Just being known by a nickname indicates that you're not thought of as a true actress.”

#5: Audrey Hepburn

#6: Ava Gardner

1940s beauty1940s

#12: Sophia Loren

1950s movie star1950s

The "It" Girl1920s



“We had individuality. We did as we pleased. We stayed up late. We dressed the way we wanted.”
 

















#21: Jane Russell

1950s movie star1950s

#22: Vivien Leigh

Vivling1940s



“Some critics saw fit to say that I was a great actress. I thought that was a foolish, wicked thing to say...”

#24: Ginger Rogers

1940s movie star1940s

#25: Joan Fontaine

1940s beautiful actress1940s



“The main problem in marriage is that, for a man, sex is a hunger. If he is hungry and can't get to a fancy French restaurant, he'll go to a hot dog stand.”

"The British Open"1950s



“The problem with beauty is that it's like being born rich and getting poorer.”

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
