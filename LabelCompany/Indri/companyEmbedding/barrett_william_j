How the BuildZoom Score works








Follow this contractor

















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Michigan:













Does Barrett, William J Jr carry a valid contracting license?



Michigan requires contractors performing any work on residential properties to be licensed with the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs. 
Barrett, William J Jr currently holds license 2101194865 (Builder Individual), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Michigan?



Contractors in Michigan must complete a 60 hour approved prelicensure education class prior to taking a buisness and law exam. Contractors are required to take continuing education upon renewal of an active license. 











Your liability risk when hiring Barrett, William J Jr



Michigan requires licensed contractors to carry an active workers' compensation policy. Although general liability insurance is not required under Michigan state law, it is always advisable to hire contractors who carry it. Request copies of the certificates for both forms of insurance for your records. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Michigan, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

introduction




Over the years, when the firm was small, Bill handled all types of cases from inception through jury verdict, including motor vehicle, products liability, premises liability, no-fault, labor law construction, defamation and insurance coverage matters. Bill has particular and significant products liability experience including a myriad of products, including cutting and grinding machines, stun guns, furnaces, tires and rims, deep fryers, automobiles, printing machines and computers. Many of Bill's cases have had catastrophic exposure including quadriplegia, wrongful death and brain injuries. As the firm grew and litigation became more complicated Bill assumed the position of Managing Partner, overseeing attorney assignments, case strategy and work flow in the office, while continuing to litigate complicated and high profile cases from initial investigation through the conclusion of discovery, including motion practice. His experience in all aspects of municipal liability, including road design, and school district liability is extensive. He has also established a reputation in directing and personally conducting the immediate investigation of potentially high value subrogation cases, often on the day the loss is reported.Bill serves as the firm's voice to many clients because of his planned availability in covering the office calls for any of the firm's attorneys, and his ability to keep ahead of a file's progress at any given time.

LEGAL TERMS



VENIREMENPeople who are summoned to the courthouse so that they may be questioned and perhaps chosen as jurors in trials of civil or criminal cases.

(more...)A decision by a judge or jury that a defendant in a criminal case is not guilty of a crime. An acquittal is not a finding of innocence; it is simply a conclusion that the prosecution has not proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt.

PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCEOne of the most sacred principles in the American criminal justice system, holding that a defendant is innocent until proven guilty. In other words, the prosecu... (more...)One of the most sacred principles in the American criminal justice system, holding that a defendant is innocent until proven guilty. In other words, the prosecution must prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, each element of the crime charged.

(more...)The earliest and most common test for criminal insanity, in which a criminal defendant is judged legally insane only if he could not distinguish right from wrong at the time he committed the crime. For example, a delusional psychotic who believed that his assaultive acts were in response to the will of God would not be criminally responsible for his acts.

ARRAIGNMENTA court appearance in which the defendant is formally charged with a crime and asked to respond by pleading guilty, not guilty or nolo contendere. Other matters... (more...)A court appearance in which the defendant is formally charged with a crime and asked to respond by pleading guilty, not guilty or nolo contendere. Other matters often handled at the arraignment are arranging for the appointment of a lawyer to represent the defendant and the setting of bail.

DISCOVERYA formal investigation -- governed by court rules -- that is conducted before trial. Discovery allows one party to question other parties, and sometimes witness... (more...)A formal investigation -- governed by court rules -- that is conducted before trial. Discovery allows one party to question other parties, and sometimes witnesses. It also allows one party to force the others to produce requested documents or other physical evidence. The most common types of discovery are interrogatories, consisting of written questions the other party must answer under penalty of perjury, and depositions, which involve an in-person session at which one party to a lawsuit has the opportunity to ask oral questions of the other party or her witnesses under oath while a written transcript is made by a court reporter. Other types of pretrial discovery consist of written requests to produce documents and requests for admissions, by which one party asks the other to admit or deny key facts in the case. One major purpose of discovery is to assess the strength or weakness of an opponent's case, with the idea of opening settlement talks. Another is to gather information to use at trial. Discovery is also present in criminal cases, in which by law the prosecutor must turn over to the defense any witness statements and any evidence that might tend to exonerate the defendant. Depending on the rules of the court, the defendant may also be obliged to share evidence with the prosecutor.

JUSTICE SYSTEMA term lawyers use to describe the courts and other bureaucracies that handle American's criminal legal business, including offices of various state and federal... (more...)A term lawyers use to describe the courts and other bureaucracies that handle American's criminal legal business, including offices of various state and federal prosecutors and public defenders. Many people caught up in this system refer to it by less flattering names.

(more...)The privilege that allows the president and other high officials of the executive branch to keep certain communications private if disclosing those communications would disrupt the functions or decisionmaking processes of the executive branch. As demonstrated by the Watergate hearings, this privilege does not extend to information germane to a criminal investigation.

DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE (DUI)The crime of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, including prescription drugs. Complete intoxication is not required; the l... (more...)The crime of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, including prescription drugs. Complete intoxication is not required; the level of alcohol or drugs in the driver's body must simply be enough to prevent him from thinking clearly or driving safely. State laws specify the levels of blood alcohol content at which a person is presumed to be under the influence. Also called driving while intoxicated (DWI and drunk driving).

SAMPLE LEGAL CASES

 Court's review of defendants' challenge to the legal sufficiency of the evidence. ... A grand jury

introduction




Over the years, when the firm was small, Bill handled all types of cases from inception through jury verdict, including motor vehicle, products liability, premises liability, no-fault, labor law construction, defamation and insurance coverage matters. Bill has particular and significant products liability experience including a myriad of products, including cutting and grinding machines, stun guns, furnaces, tires and rims, deep fryers, automobiles, printing machines and computers. Many of Bill's cases have had catastrophic exposure including quadriplegia, wrongful death and brain injuries. As the firm grew and litigation became more complicated Bill assumed the position of Managing Partner, overseeing attorney assignments, case strategy and work flow in the office, while continuing to litigate complicated and high profile cases from initial investigation through the conclusion of discovery, including motion practice. His experience in all aspects of municipal liability, including road design, and school district liability is extensive. He has also established a reputation in directing and personally conducting the immediate investigation of potentially high value subrogation cases, often on the day the loss is reported.Bill serves as the firm's voice to many clients because of his planned availability in covering the office calls for any of the firm's attorneys, and his ability to keep ahead of a file's progress at any given time.
