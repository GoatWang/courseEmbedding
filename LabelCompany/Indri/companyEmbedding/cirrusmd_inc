A telemedicine exam is not a complete physical exam as would normally take place in person. Telemedicine is further limited by its dependence on the use of technology to allow communication between the health care provider and patient.For Residents of Texas: Notice Concerning ComplaintsComplaints about physicians, as well as other licensees and registrants of the texas medical board, including physician assistants, acupuncturists, and surgical assistants may be reported for investigation at the following address: texas medical board, attention: investigations, 333 guadalupe, tower 3, suite 610, p.o. box mc-263, austin, tx 78768-2018. assistance in filing a complaint is available by calling the following telephone number: 1-800-201-9353, for more information, please visit our website at http://www.tmb.state.tx.us.Aviso sobre las quejas, las quejas sobre medicos, asi como sobre otros profesionales acreditados e inscritos del consejo medico de tejas, incluyendo asistentes de medicos, practicantes de acupuntura y asistentes de cirugia, se pueden presentar en la siguiente direccion para ser investigadas: texas medical board, attention investigations, 333 guadalupe, tower 3, suite 610, p.o. box mc-263, austin, tx 78768-2018, si necesita ayuda para presentar una queja, llame al: 1-800-201-9353, para obtener mas informacion, visite nuestro sitio web en http://www.tmb.state.tx.us.SeverabilityIf for any reason some section, part or parts of these Terms are deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of these Terms will remain valid and in full force and effect.Contact InformationIf you have any questions or concerns about these Terms or CirrusMD Services, please send us a thorough description by email to [email protected] or call us at (800) 449-4512.  Privacy PolicyCirrusMD has developed and operates a mobile application and Internet-based healthcare communications software platform designed to offer secure patient-to-healthcare-provider messaging and video chat, scheduling, patient data capture/access and other related services and products (the "Platform").By accepting CirrusMD's Terms of Use, you consent to the use and disclosure of personally identifiable information provided to us as outlined in this privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy").CirrusMD takes the utmost care when it comes to patient data security and privacy.

ABOUT CIRRUSMD












WHAT WE DOCirrusMD provides patients immediate access to providers via secure text messaging so your healthcare organization can excel in a value based care environment.We build an asynchronous, text messaging-first platform for healthcare organizations poised to succeed in a value based care environment. Our platform currently serves over 1.5 million people, giving them access to local physicians anytime of day, from any location through their mobile device or computer.












 It all Started with a Text We were founded in 2012 when co-founder Blake McKinney, an emergency physician, realized the transformative role of telemedicine in the future of health care.He’d been answering his family’s medical questions for years, but after advising his sister with a sick baby over text and FaceTime, he recognized the power of iPhones and smart devices to fundamentally change the way medical services are delivered.Since then, CirrusMD has grown from an idea to a dynamic team with a headquarters in Denver, CO and offices in California, Texas, and Washington DC.

A telemedicine exam is not a complete physical exam as would normally take place in person. Telemedicine is further limited by its dependence on the use of technology to allow communication between the health care provider and patient.For Residents of Texas: Notice Concerning ComplaintsComplaints about physicians, as well as other licensees and registrants of the texas medical board, including physician assistants, acupuncturists, and surgical assistants may be reported for investigation at the following address: texas medical board, attention: investigations, 333 guadalupe, tower 3, suite 610, p.o. box mc-263, austin, tx 78768-2018. assistance in filing a complaint is available by calling the following telephone number: 1-800-201-9353, for more information, please visit our website at http://www.tmb.state.tx.us.Aviso sobre las quejas, las quejas sobre medicos, asi como sobre otros profesionales acreditados e inscritos del consejo medico de tejas, incluyendo asistentes de medicos, practicantes de acupuntura y asistentes de cirugia, se pueden presentar en la siguiente direccion para ser investigadas: texas medical board, attention investigations, 333 guadalupe, tower 3, suite 610, p.o. box mc-263, austin, tx 78768-2018, si necesita ayuda para presentar una queja, llame al: 1-800-201-9353, para obtener mas informacion, visite nuestro sitio web en http://www.tmb.state.tx.us.SeverabilityIf for any reason some section, part or parts of these Terms are deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of these Terms will remain valid and in full force and effect.Contact InformationIf you have any questions or concerns about these Terms or CirrusMD Services, please send us a thorough description by email to [email protected] or call us at (800) 449-4512.  Privacy PolicyCirrusMD has developed and operates a mobile application and Internet-based healthcare communications software platform designed to offer secure patient-to-healthcare-provider messaging and video chat, scheduling, patient data capture/access and other related services and products (the "Platform").By accepting CirrusMD's Terms of Use, you consent to the use and disclosure of personally identifiable information provided to us as outlined in this privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy").CirrusMD takes the utmost care when it comes to patient data security and privacy. Only health care providers, their approved physician call groups, specifically approved members of a healthcare provider's staff (collectively "Providers"), any Business Associates (as such term is defined pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 – "HIPAA") of a Provider, and you will have access to your Protected Health Information ("PHI"). CirrusMD is HIPAA compliant, and we utilize industry best practices regarding data security.

This information may be checked and confirmed by Providers for accuracy. After initial registration is complete, both you and Providers may update your health profile within CirrusMD.CirrusMD offers various forms of communication services, including messaging, phone and video chat, and the Platform contains an online personal health record. Your participation in these forms of communication is voluntary. Any information disclosed to any Provider via the Platform is at your sole discretion.

We may also maintain records dealing with site usage and activity, some of which are required for security purposes.Private CommunicationsCertain communications (for example, messages) are recorded and maintained by CirrusMD. CirrusMD will not edit the content of the communication between you and any Provider. We consider these communications to be personal and private and will not use or disclose these communications except as provided for in this Privacy Policy or where required by law.Based on our Terms of Use, CirrusMD reserves the right to terminate the account of any user for sending offensive, threatening, abusive or otherwise unacceptable communications via the Platform or otherwise.Data IntegrationProviders may utilize medical or other information contained in your medical records or patient files to update or supplement your health profile or other information about you within the Platform. In addition, information about you (including but not limited to PHI) may be shared via electronic or other forms of integration between the Platform and various systems used by Providers or other healthcare organizations (for example, medical record-keeping/storage systems, Electronic Health Records, Electronic Medical Records, health information exchanges and billing systems)..HIPAA & Data SecurityCirrusMD is in compliance with HIPAA and with all pertinent laws and regulations associated with the storage and transmission of PHI.

In aggregate this data may be provided or sold to third parties. This data will not identify you but will be used as statistical information to determine things like user demographics and usage patterns. CirrusMD may also use aggregated data within Platform to better understand the needs of you and other users.PasswordsYou should make sure to create and use a password to access the Platform that is both sufficiently complex and private to ensure security.
