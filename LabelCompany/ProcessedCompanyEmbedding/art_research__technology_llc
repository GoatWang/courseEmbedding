swilsonsfsuedu copyright  cultural importance of scientific research  technology development the arts are perplexed about what to do in response to the growing importance of scientific and technological research in shaping culture one response positions artists as consumers of the new tools using them to create new images sounds and video another response sees artists emphasizing the critical functions of art to comment on the developments from the distance a final approach urges artists to enter into the heart of research as core participants see my paper dark  light visions  siggraph visual proceedings art show catalog acm chicago  also available at httpuserwwwsfsueduswilson for a more detailed analysis it is a critical error to conceive of contemporary research as merely a technical enterprise it has profound practical and philosophical implications for the culture the shaping of research and development agendas could benefit from the involvement of a wider range of participants including artists scientific and technological research is not as objective as many of its practitioners would like to believe while some of its practices strive toward objectivity the whole enterprise is subject to larger political economic and social forces historians of science and technology have documented the winds that determine what research ends up getting supported promoted and accepted and what products win in the marketplace thomas kuhns the structure of scientific revolutions university of chicago press  shows how paradigms dominate thought and scientific practice until new paradigms develop many possibly significant theories and technologies are ignored as research increases in general cultural importance it becomes more dangerous to accept this triage as inevitable valuable lines of inquiry die from lack of support because they are not within favor of particular scientific disciplines new technologies with fascinating potential are abandoned because they are judged not marketable our culture must develop methods to avoid the premature snuffing of valuable lines of inquiry and development i believe the arts can fill a critical role as an independent zone of research everyday life is increasingly dominated by the objects and cultural forms created by technology research for example telephones computers entertainment systems medical equipment transportation systems governmental and policing systems and product distribution technologies shape the ways people in the developed world spend their days interact with others and conceptualize the present and the future the output of technology research is not confined to small technical niches theorists such as baudrillard and virilio for example expose the hidden assumptions shaping of categories and pervasive consequences of technology scientific research similarly reaches beyond narrow academic questions astronomers attempt to understand the origins and shape of the universe breaking with all prior human history they can look at the universe using radio wave ultraviolet and infrared eyes and see a universe quite different than what has been known biologists increasingly unravel mysteries of life and invent methods for manipulating the genetic heart of life scientific research will have profound practical and philosophical implications survey of areas of emerging research of interest to artists what is an appropriate role for the arts throughout the last centuries after leonardo during which science and technology have been increasing in importance the arts have failed to develop a viable role often they have tried to ignore these developments and treat them as peripheral to the core of culture even when artists did attend to these developments they did so as distant commentators sniping from the audience often without deep understanding of the world views and processes of scientific research i believe there is a much stronger role for the arts in which artists integrate critical commentary with high level knowledge and participation in the science and technology worlds for the last sixteen years i have been exploring this approach of artist as researcher i have incorporated the monitoring of research developments into my artistic discipline i monitor science and technology journals participate in online forums and attend technology trade shows and academic meetings i engage the developers in discussion about their products i have been appointed as beta tester and developer for several technology companies and acted as artist in residence in corporate research centers i have functioned as an inventor and won a patent for a method i developed to integrate interactive electronics with print emerging technologies are my medium i seek them out before they become widely known i focus on them to understand where they come from where they might go and what might be their cultural implications i experiment with them to see if they have unexplored potentials these years as a shadow researcher have been illuminating i have read in the literature of intriguing developments that never saw the light of day i have seen many inventions and emerging technologies killed because marketing departments judged that no money could be made i have seen entire rd departments and their years of research blown away by the winds of corporate politics government and corporate support for basic research has almost disappeared and the concern with the bottom line has shortened the payback horizon to the point that few risks are taken i have encountered debates in the scientific community that devalue approaches that do not fit the paradigms currently in favor i am worried that the invisible hand of the marketplace might not be so wise as many would like to believe the judgments that make short term sense for stockholders do not make sense for the culture the peer review referees of scientific journals cannot always see beyond their disciplinary blinders many good ideas are orphaned unheeded in the wilderness scientific and technological research are so critical that we cannot afford the premature elimination of these ideas and efforts that do not find favor through traditional channels the arts can function as an independent zone of research they could become the place where abandoned discredited and unorthodox inquires could be pursued they might very well value research according to criteria quite different from those of the commercial and scientific worlds the roles of artists could incorporate other roles such as researcher inventor hacker and entrepreneur even within research labs artist participation in research teams could add a perspective that could help drive the research process see my editorial industrial research artist leonardo vol no   several traditions of the arts uniquely equip them for this function artistic traditions of iconoclasm mean that artists are likely to take up lines of inquiry devalued by others the valuing of social commentary means that artists are likely to integrate widely ranging cultural issues in their research artists are more likely to incorporate criteria such as celebration and wonder than commercial enterprizes the arts interest in communication means that artists could bring the scientific and technological possibilities to a wider public better than peers in other fields artistic valuing of creativity and innovation meant that new perspectives might be applied to inquiries the recent history of the personal computer illustrates the need for this independent research function and the role the arts might serve early developers such as apple computer founders steve wozniak and steve jobs found little support for their ideas about the personal computer from the companies they worked for supervisors signed waivers on the ideas because they could not imagine any market for a desktop computer used by individuals similarly the discipline of computer science was mostly uninterested in software and hardware issues related to these computers advances often came from individuals who worked outside traditional academic and business channels teenagers became world experts and artists made significant contributions in the development of interface design and image sound processing similarly demonstrating the value of artresearch cross fertilization  the siggraph acm international organization for computer graphics research annual meetings have included an art show since their beginnings these shows have been influential in several ways artists have been able to learn about emerging computer graphics research and technologies long before they became products to the extent that they could start experimenting with them in parallel fashion researchers have become acquainted with artistic work that pushed the technology in unanticipated directions and offered ideas for new research directions if the culture had to rely only on traditional lines of research we might have had to wait much longer for the developments that have profoundly shaped the last decades this story potentially could be repeated many times in many other fields of inquiry if alternative venues for research are developed the arts could well serve this function if artists are prepared to learn the knowledge language work styles self discipline and information networks that are instrumental in their fields of interest preparing artist researchers what must artists do differently than they always have done to prepare to participate in the world of research they must broaden their definitions of art materials and contexts they must become curious about scientific and technological research and acquire the skills and knowledge that will allow them to significantly participate in these worlds see my article research and development as source of ideas and inspiration for artists  leonardo vol no   for examples of research that could be of interest for artists they must expand conventional notions of what constitutes an artistic education the parameters of the science and technology education required is not yet clear can artists find the right mix of objective and subjective processes can artists learn enough to engage in research at a nondilettante level scientists and technology researchers who have devoted their entire professional lives to educating themselves about topics being investigated might be sceptical at the same time artists must keep alive artistic traditions of iconoclasm critical perspectives play and sensual communication with audiences they must be willing to undertake art explorations that do not neatly fit in historically validated media and offer their work in new contexts here are some concrete steps artists can take to prepare pay attention to discourse about technical and scientific topics in popular and professional media develop the ability to penetrate beneath the surface presentation to think about unexplored research directions and unanticipated implications acquire background knowledge and skills related to technological topics either through formal and informal means learn about the information sources used by scientists and engineers to learn about emerging fields including academic and professional journals trade shows academic meetings and equipment supply sources many of the trade magazines are free for validated research practitioners artists can acquire this validation by selfidentifying their art investigations as research learn about relevant online information resources such as mailing lists newsgroups and web sites that have become so crucial in scientific communication luckily the growth of the internet and world wide web have made it easier than ever for artists in enter into these information networks develop new kinds of mutually beneficial collaborations with companies universities and other organizations involved in research what is a viable role for artists in research settings the viability of this kind of collaboration is so critical to the future of both art and research that it is worth thinking about in more detail what can researchers contribute to art and what can artists contribute to research why can high tech companies gain from artists being involved much of the most well known collaborations between artists and scientistsengineers do not provide good models for example the eat experiments in art and technology in the s and the la county museum collaborations in art  technology produced some interesting art but did not profoundly address the role of artists in research often the engineers functioned as technical assistants to the artists or the artists dabbled with new technologies better models would provide more mutual benefit early examples include bell labs involvement of artists in sound research that was instrumental to telephony electronic sound and electronic voice research and electronic music also artist sonia sheridans artist in residency at the m research center in the s helped influence the development of color copier technology as well as shaping her development of the generative systems program at the art institute of chicago that influenced so many artists more contemporary examples include the artistinresidency programs initiated by the xerox parc research center and interval research company these collaborations experimented with mutual definitions of research agendas the xerox parc experience will be described more fully in a book to be published by mit press skeptics sometimes wonder what possible contribution artists can make to serious research and development artists can augment the research process in several ways they can define new kinds of research questions provide unorthodox interpretations of results point out missed opportunities for development explore and articulate wide ranging implications of the research represent potential user perspectives and help communicate research findings in effective and provocative ways they can bring centuries of artistic experience to bear on the technological future they often approach problems in ways quite different than those of scientists and engineers the critical role of designers and artists in computer human interface research over the last years demonstrates this new model of interdisciplinary research computer art is not the future  new challenges many high tech artists believe they have already addressed the future by becoming computer artists who work with digital image sound and interactive multimedia they have made a critical error they have misunderstood the real significance of artists work with computers during the last decade and a half the new media are interesting but more important is the fact that artists were experimenting with microcomputers at almost the same time that other kinds of developers and researchers were artists were not merely using the results of research conducted by others but were actually participating as researchers themselves many new technologies such as genetic microbiology promise to have similar or even greater impact on life and thought artists need to actively patrol the frontiers of scientific and technological research to identify future trends that could benefit from the artistresearch inquiry knowledge of computers and the internet will be valuable assets because they will be required tools in most areas of research artists who think however they are in the vanguard because they work will computers may soon find themselves in the backguard below i list some areas of scientific inquiry and technological development that i believe may have cultural impact and will be fruitful areas for artistic inquiry this diverse idiosyncratic list is by no means exhaustive and identification of other areas of interest should be considered an important artistic activity of our era new biology extrasensory phenomena animal consciousness brain physiology medical technology touch taste and smell research biosensors artificial life alternative energy materials science cosmology non visual astronomy space science artificial intelligence hypermedia robotics gesture recognition speech recognition  synthesis wearable computing information visualization groupware computertelephone integration inspectable movies virtual reality ubiquitous computing surveillance  remote sensing bar codes and auto id gps geographic locating systems intelligent home intelligent hiway the integration of research and art research is shaping the future in profound ways beyond the utilitarian confines of the technology produced our culture desperately needs wide involvement in the definition of research agendas the actual investigation processes and in the exploration of the implications of what is discovered artists can contribute significantly to this discourse by developing a new kind of artistresearcher role the appropriate contours of this involvement are not yet defined much experimentation is required how can research settings learn to be open enough to benefit from the unorthodox contributions artists might make how can artists learn to involve themselves in the ways and byways of researchers without losing touch with their artistic roots many of the best young artists i had as students who became involved as researchers ultimately ended up being seduced by the recognition and economic rewards of research that they quit functioning as artists also scientific inquiry and technology development are not identical processes what kind of involvement in each might artists fashion for themselves i am not claiming that artists should act exactly like researchers if they did they would be unlikely to make any unique contribution contemporary art often includes elements of commentary irony and critique missing from serious research similarly scientists and technologists strive toward objectivity artists cultivate their idiosyncratic subjectivity as a major feature of what they do the research that artists created will most likely look different than that produced by traditional researchers it would work like art always does  provoking and moving audiences through its communicative power and unique perspectives still it might simultaneously work as research  using systematic investigative processes to develop new technological possibilities or to discover useful new knowledge or perspectives maybe the segmented categorization of artist and researcher will itself prove to be a historical anachronism maybe new kinds of integrated roles will develop signs of this happening already appear some of the hackers who pioneered microcomputer developments may one day be seen as artists because of their intensity and their culturally revolutionary views and work similarly some art shows such as ars electronica now define research ideas as core themes for example artificial life and invite researchers along with artists as key presenters research has radically altered our culture and will continue to do so art must be an essential part of this process  this page created by stephen wilson professor conceptual design information arts sfsu httpuserwwwsfsueduswilson swilsonsfsuedu  more

produce most of the electricity that people use electricity consumption and living standards are highly correlated electrification is believed to be the most important engineering achievement of the th century technology science of craft from greek τέχνη techne art skill cunning of hand and λογία logia is the collection of techniques skills methods and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives such as scientific investigation technology can be the knowledge of techniques processes and the like or it can be embedded in machines which can be operated without detailed knowledge of their workings the simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools the prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later neolithic revolution increased the available sources of food and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment developments in historic times including the printing press the telephone and the internet have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale the steady progress of military technology has brought weapons of everincreasing destructive power from clubs to nuclear weapons technology has many effects it has helped develop more advanced economies including todays global economy and has allowed the rise of a leisure class many technological processes produce unwanted byproducts known as pollution and deplete natural resources to the detriment of earths environment innovations have always influenced the values of a society and raised new questions of the ethics of technology examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity and the challenges of bioethics philosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it neoluddism anarchoprimitivism and similar reactionary movements criticise the pervasiveness of technology arguing that it harms the environment and alienates people proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and technoprogressivism view continued

definition and usage the spread of paper and printing to the west as in this printing press helped scientists and politicians communicate their ideas easily leading to the age of enlightenment an example of technology as cultural force the use of the term technology has changed significantly over the last  years before the th century the term was uncommon in english and usually referred to the description or study of the useful arts the term was often connected to technical education as in the massachusetts institute of technology chartered in  the term technology rose to prominence in the th century in connection with the second industrial revolution the terms meanings changed in the early th century when american social scientists beginning with thorstein veblen translated ideas from the german concept of technik into technology in german and other european languages a distinction exists between technik and technologie that is absent in english which usually translates both terms as technology by the s technology referred not only to the study of the industrial arts but to the industrial arts themselves in  the american sociologist read bain wrote that technology includes all tools machines utensils weapons instruments housing clothing communicating and transporting devices and the skills by which we produce and use them bains definition remains common among scholars today especially social scientists scientists and engineers usually prefer to define technology as applied science rather than as the things that people make and use more recently scholars have borrowed from european philosophers of technique to extend the meaning of technology to various forms of instrumental reason as in foucaults work on technologies of the self techniques de soi dictionaries and scholars have offered a variety of definitions the merriamwebster learners dictionary offers a definition of the term the use of science in industry engineering etc to invent useful things or to solve problems and a machine piece of equipment method etc that is created by technology ursula franklin in her  real world of technology lecture gave another definition of the concept it is practice the way we do things around here the term is often used to imply a specific field of technology or to refer to high technology or just consumer electronics rather than technology as a whole bernard stiegler in technics and time  defines technology in two ways as the pursuit of life by means other than life and as organized inorganic matter technology can be most broadly defined as the entities both material and immaterial created by the application of mental and physical effort in order to achieve some value in this usage technology refers to tools and machines that may be used to solve realworld problems it is a farreaching term that may include simple tools such as a crowbar or wooden spoon or more complex machines such as a space station or particle accelerator tools and machines need not be material virtual technology such as computer software and business methods fall under this definition of technology w brian arthur defines technology in a similarly broad way as a means to fulfill a human purpose the word technology can also be used to refer to a collection of techniques in this context it is the current state of humanitys knowledge of how to combine resources to produce desired products to solve problems fulfill needs or satisfy wants it includes technical methods skills processes techniques tools and raw materials when combined with another term such as medical technology or space technology it refers to the state of the respective fields knowledge and tools stateoftheart technology refers to the high technology available to humanity in any field the invention of integrated circuits and the microprocessor here an intel  chip from  led to the modern computer revolution technology can be viewed as an activity that forms or changes culture additionally technology is the application of math science and the arts for the benefit of life as it is known a modern example is the rise of communication technology which has lessened barriers to human interaction and as a result has helped spawn new subcultures the rise of cyberculture has at its basis the development of the internet and the computer not all technology enhances culture in a creative way technology can also help facilitate political oppression and war via tools such as guns as a cultural activity technology predates both science and engineering each of which formalize some aspects of technological endeavor science engineering and technology antoine lavoisier conducting an experiment with combustion generated by amplified sun light the distinction between science engineering and technology is not always clear science is systematic knowledge of the physical or material world gained through observation and experimentation technologies are not usually exclusively products of science because they have to satisfy requirements such as utility usability and safety engineering is the goaloriented process of designing and making tools and systems to exploit natural phenomena for practical human means often but not always using results and techniques from science the development of technology may draw upon many fields of knowledge including scientific engineering mathematical linguistic and historical knowledge to achieve some practical result technology is often a consequence of science and engineering although technology as a human activity precedes the two fields for example science might study the flow of electrons in electrical conductors by using alreadyexisting tools and knowledge this newfound knowledge may then be used by engineers to create new tools and machines such as semiconductors computers and other forms of advanced technology in this sense scientists and engineers may both be considered technologists the three fields are often considered as one for the purposes of research and reference the exact relations between science and technology in particular have been debated by scientists historians and policymakers in the late th century in part because the debate can inform the funding of basic and applied science in the immediate wake of world war ii for example it was widely considered in the united states that technology was simply applied science and that to fund basic science was to reap technological results in due time an articulation of this philosophy could be found explicitly in vannevar bushs treatise on postwar science policy science – the endless frontier new products new industries and more jobs require continuous additions to knowledge of the laws of nature  this essential new knowledge can be obtained only through basic scientific research in the lates however this view came under direct attack leading towards initiatives to fund science for specific tasks initiatives resisted by the scientific community the issue remains contentious though most analysts resist the model that technology simply is a result of scientific research history main articles history of technology timeline of historic inventions and timeline of electrical and electronic engineering paleolithic  ma –  ka a primitive chopper further information outline of prehistoric technology the use of tools by early humans was partly a process of discovery and of evolution early humans evolved from a species of foraging hominids which were already bipedal with a brain mass approximately one third of modern humans tool use remained relatively unchanged for most of early human history approximately  years ago the use of tools and complex set of behaviors emerged believed by many archaeologists to be connected to the emergence of fully modern language stone tools hand axes from the acheulian period a clovis point made via pressure flaking hominids started using primitive stone tools millions of years ago the earliest stone tools were little more than a fractured rock but approximately  years ago pressure flaking provided a way to make much finer work fire main article control of fire by early humans the discovery and utilization of fire a simple energy source with many profound uses was a turning point in the technological evolution of humankind the exact date of its discovery is not known evidence of burnt animal bones at the cradle of humankind suggests that the domestication of fire occurred before  ma scholarly consensus indicates that homo erectus had controlled fire by between  and  ka fire fueled with wood and charcoal allowed early humans to cook their food to increase its digestibility improving its nutrient value and broadening the number of foods that could be eaten clothing and shelter other technological advances made during the paleolithic era were clothing and shelter the adoption of both technologies cannot be dated exactly but they were a key to humanitys progress as the paleolithic era progressed dwellings became more sophisticated and more elaborate as early as  ka humans were constructing temporary wood huts clothing adapted from the fur and hides of hunted animals helped humanity expand into colder regions humans began to migrate out of africa by  ka and into other continents such as eurasia neolithic through classical antiquity  ka –  ce an array of neolithic artifacts including bracelets axe heads chisels and polishing tools humans technological ascent began in earnest in what is known as the neolithic period new stone age the invention of polished stone axes was a major advance that allowed forest clearance on a large scale to create farms this use of polished stone axes increased greatly in the neolithic but were originally used in the preceding mesolithic in some areas such as ireland agriculture fed larger populations and the transition to sedentism allowed simultaneously raising more children as infants no longer needed to be carried as nomadic ones must additionally children could contribute labor to the raising of crops more readily than they could to the huntergatherer economy with this increase in population and availability of labor came an increase in labor specialization what triggered the progression from early neolithic villages to the first cities such as uruk and the first civilizations such as sumer is not specifically known however the emergence of increasingly hierarchical social structures and specialized labor of trade and war amongst adjacent cultures and the need for collective action to overcome environmental challenges such as irrigation are all thought to have played a role metal tools continuing improvements led to the furnace and bellows and provided the ability to smelt and forge native metals naturally occurring in relatively pure form gold copper silver and lead were such early metals the advantages of copper tools over stone bone and wooden tools were quickly apparent to early humans and native copper was probably used from near the beginning of neolithic times about  ka native copper does not naturally occur in large amounts but copper ores are quite common and some of them produce metal easily when burned in wood or charcoal fires eventually the working of metals led to the discovery of alloys such as bronze and brass about  bce the first uses of iron alloys such as steel dates to around  bce energy and transport the wheel was invented circa  bce main article history of transport meanwhile humans were learning to harness other forms of energy the earliest known use of wind power is the sailboat the earliest record of a ship under sail is that of a nile boat that dates back to the th millennium bce from prehistoric times egyptians probably used the power of the annual flooding of the nile to irrigate their lands gradually learning to regulate much of it through purposely built irrigation channels and catch basins similarly the early peoples of mesopotamia the sumerians learned to use the tigris and euphrates rivers for much the same purposes however more extensive use of wind and water and even human power required another invention according to archaeologists the wheel was invented around  bce probably independently and nearly simultaneously in mesopotamia in presentday iraq the northern caucasus maykop culture and central europe estimates on when this may have occurred range from  to  bce with most experts putting it closer to  bce the oldest artifacts with drawings that depict wheeled carts date from about  bce however the wheel may have been in use for millennia before these drawings were made there is also evidence from the same period for the use of the potters wheel more recently the oldestknown wooden wheel in the world was found in the ljubljana marshes of slovenia the invention of the wheel revolutionized trade and war it did not take long to discover that wheeled wagons could be used to carry heavy loads fast rotary potters wheels enabled early mass production of pottery but it was the use of the wheel as a transformer of energy through water wheels windmills and even treadmills that revolutionized the application of nonhuman power sources medieval and modern history  ce – present main articles medieval technology renaissance technology industrial revolution second industrial revolution information technology and productivity improving technologies economic history innovations continued through the middle ages with innovations such as silk the horse collar and horseshoes in the first few hundred years after the fall of the roman empire medieval technology saw the use of simple machines such as the lever the screw and the pulley being combined to form more complicated tools such as the wheelbarrow windmills and clocks the renaissance brought forth many of these innovations including the printing press which facilitated the greater communication of knowledge and technology became increasingly associated with science beginning a cycle of mutual advancement the advancements in technology in this era allowed a more steady supply of food followed by the wider availability of consumer goods the automobile revolutionized personal transportation starting in the united kingdom in the th century the industrial revolution was a period of great technological discovery particularly in the areas of agriculture manufacturing mining metallurgy and transport driven by the discovery of steam power technology took another step in a second industrial revolution with the harnessing of electricity to create such innovations as the electric motor light bulb and countless others scientific advancement and the discovery of new concepts later allowed for powered flight and advancements in medicine chemistry physics and engineering the rise in technology has led to skyscrapers and broad urban areas whose inhabitants rely on motors to transport them and their food supply communication was also greatly improved with the invention of the telegraph telephone radio and television the late th and early th centuries saw a revolution in transportation with the invention of the airplane and automobile f and f flying over kuwaiti oil fires during the gulf war in  the th century brought a host of innovations in physics the discovery of nuclear fission has led to both nuclear weapons and nuclear power computers were also invented and later miniaturized utilizing transistors and integrated circuits information technology subsequently led to the creation of the internet which ushered in the current information age humans have also been able to explore space with satellites later used for telecommunication and in manned missions going all the way to the moon in medicine this era brought innovations such as openheart surgery and later stem cell therapy along with new medications and treatments complex manufacturing and construction techniques and organizations are needed to make and maintain these new technologies and entire industries have arisen to support and develop succeeding generations of increasingly more complex tools modern technology increasingly relies on training and education – their designers builders maintainers and users often require sophisticated general and specific training moreover these technologies have become so complex that entire fields have been created to support them including engineering medicine and computer science and other fields have been made more complex such as construction transportation and architecture philosophy technicism generally technicism is the belief in the utility of technology for improving human societies taken to an extreme technicism reflects a fundamental attitude which seeks to control reality to resolve all problems with the use of scientifictechnological methods and tools in other words human beings will someday be able to master all problems and possibly even control the future using technology some such as stephen v monsma connect these ideas to the abdication of religion as a higher moral authority optimism see also extropianism optimistic assumptions are made by proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and singularitarianism which view technological development as generally having beneficial effects for the society and the human condition in these ideologies technological development is morally good transhumanists generally believe that the point of technology is to overcome barriers and that what we commonly refer to as the human condition is just another barrier to be surpassed singularitarians believe in some sort of accelerating change that the rate of technological progress accelerates as we obtain more technology and that this will culminate in a singularity after artificial general intelligence is invented in which progress is nearly infinite hence the term estimates for the date of this singularity vary but prominent futurist ray kurzweil estimates the singularity will occur in  kurzweil is also known for his history of the universe in six epochs  the physicalchemical epoch  the life epoch  the humanbrain epoch  the technology epoch  the artificial intelligence epoch and  the universal colonization epoch going from one epoch to the next is a singularity in its own right and a period of speeding up precedes it each epoch takes a shorter time which means the whole history of the universe is one giant singularity event some critics see these ideologies as examples of scientism and technoutopianism and fear the notion of human enhancement and technological singularity which they support some have described karl marx as a technooptimist skepticism and critics see also luddite neoluddism anarchoprimitivism and bioconservatism luddites smashing a power loom in  on the somewhat skeptical side are certain philosophers like herbert marcuse and john zerzan who believe that technological societies are inherently flawed they suggest that the inevitable result of such a society is to become evermore technological at the cost of freedom and psychological health many such as the luddites and prominent philosopher martin heidegger hold serious although not entirely deterministic reservations about technology see the question concerning technology according to heidegger scholars hubert dreyfus and charles spinosa heidegger does not oppose technology he hopes to reveal the essence of technology in a way that in no way confines us to a stultified compulsion to push on blindly with technology or what comes to the same thing to rebel helplessly against it indeed he promises that when we once open ourselves expressly to the essence of technology we find ourselves unexpectedly taken into a freeing claim what this entails is a more complex relationship to technology than either technooptimists or technopessimists tend to allow some of the most poignant criticisms of technology are found in what are now considered to be dystopian literary classics such as aldous huxleys brave new world anthony burgesss a clockwork orange and george orwells nineteen eightyfour in goethes faust faust selling his soul to the devil in return for power over the physical world is also often interpreted as a metaphor for the adoption of industrial technology more recently modern works of science fiction such as those by philip k dick and william gibson and films such as blade runner and ghost in the shell project highly ambivalent or cautionary attitudes toward technologys impact on human society and identity the late cultural critic neil postman distinguished toolusing societies from technological societies and from what he called technopolies societies that are dominated by the ideology of technological and scientific progress to the exclusion or harm of other cultural practices values and worldviews darin barney has written about technologys impact on practices of citizenship and democratic culture suggesting that technology can be construed as  an object of political debate  a means or medium of discussion and  a setting for democratic deliberation and citizenship as a setting for democratic culture barney suggests that technology tends to make ethical questions including the question of what a good life consists in nearly impossible because they already give an answer to the question a good life is one that includes the use of more and more technology nikolas kompridis has also written about the dangers of new technology such as genetic engineering nanotechnology synthetic biology and robotics he warns that these technologies introduce unprecedented new challenges to human beings including the possibility of the permanent alteration of our biological nature these concerns are shared by other philosophers scientists and public intellectuals who have written about similar issues eg francis fukuyama jürgen habermas william joy and michael sandel another prominent critic of technology is hubert dreyfus who has published books such as on the internet and what computers still cant do a more infamous antitechnological treatise is industrial society and its future written by the unabomber ted kaczynski and printed in several major newspapers and later books as part of an effort to end his bombing campaign of the technoindustrial infrastructure appropriate technology see also technocriticism and technorealism the notion of appropriate technology was developed in the th century by thinkers such as e f schumacher and jacques ellul to describe situations where it was not desirable to use very new technologies or those that required access to some centralized infrastructure or parts or skills imported from elsewhere the ecovillage movement emerged in part due to this concern optimism and skepticism in the st century this section mainly focuses on american concerns even if it can reasonably be generalized to other western countries the inadequate quantity and quality of american jobs is one of the most fundamental economic challenges we face  whats the linkage between technology and this fundamental problem — bernstein jared it’s not a skills gap that’s holding wages down it’s the weak economy among other things in the american prospect october  in his article jared bernstein a senior fellow at the center on budget and policy priorities questions the widespread idea that automation and more broadly technological advances have mainly contributed to this growing labor market problem his thesis appears to be a third way between optimism and skepticism essentially he stands for a neutral approach of the linkage between technology and american issues concerning unemployment and declining wages he uses two main arguments to defend his point first because of recent technological advances an increasing number of workers are losing their jobs yet scientific evidence fails to clearly demonstrate that technology has displaced so many workers that it has created more problems than it has solved indeed automation threatens repetitive jobs but higherend jobs are still necessary because they complement technology and manual jobs that requires flexibility judgment and common sense remain hard to replace with machines second studies have not shown clear links between recent technology advances and the wage trends of the last decades therefore according to bernstein instead of focusing on technology and its hypothetical influences on current american increasing unemployment and declining wages one needs to worry more about bad policy that fails to offset the imbalances in demand trade income and opportunity complex technological systems thomas p hughes stated that because technology has been considered as a key way to solve problems we need to be aware of its complex and varied characters to use it more efficiently what is the difference between a wheel or a compass and cooking machines such as an oven or a gas stove can we consider all of them only a part of them or none of them as technologies technology is often considered too narrowly according to hughes technology is a creative process involving human ingenuity this definitions emphasis on creativity avoids unbounded definitions that may mistakenly include cooking “technologies but it also highlights the prominent role of humans and therefore their responsibilities for the use of complex technological systems yet because technology is everywhere and has dramatically changed landscapes and societies hughes argues that engineers scientists and managers have often believed that they can use technology to shape the world as they want they have often supposed that technology is easily controllable and this assumption has to be thoroughly questioned for instance evgeny morozov particularly challenges two concepts “internetcentrism” and “solutionism internetcentrism refers to the idea that our society is convinced that the internet is one of the most stable and coherent forces solutionism is the ideology that every social issue can be solved thanks to technology and especially thanks to the internet in fact technology intrinsically contains uncertainties and limitations according to alexis madrigals review of morozovs theory to ignore it will lead to “unexpected consequences that could eventually cause more damage than the problems they seek to address benjamin r cohen and gwen ottinger also discussed the multivalent effects of technology therefore recognition of the limitations of technology and more broadly scientific knowledge is needed – especially in cases dealing with environmental justice and health issues ottinger continues this reasoning and argues that the ongoing recognition of the limitations of scientific knowledge goes hand in hand with scientists and engineers’ new comprehension of their role such an approach of technology and science require technical professionals to conceive of their roles in the process differently they have to consider themselves as collaborators in research and problem solving rather than simply providers of information and technical solutions competitiveness technology is properly defined as any application of science to accomplish a function the science can be leading edge or well established and the function can have high visibility or be significantly more mundane but it is all technology and its exploitation is the foundation of all competitive advantage technologybased planning is what was used to build the us industrial giants before wwii eg dow dupont gm and it is what was used to transform the us into a superpower it was not economicbased planning other animal species see also tool use by animals structures built by animals and ecosystem engineer this adult gorilla uses a branch as a walking stick to gauge the waters depth an example of technology usage by nonhuman primates the use of basic technology is also a feature of other animal species apart from humans these include primates such as chimpanzees some dolphin communities and crows considering a more generic perspective of technology as ethology of active environmental conditioning and control we can also refer to animal examples such as beavers and their dams or bees and their honeycombs the ability to make and use tools was once considered a defining characteristic of the genus homo however the discovery of tool construction among chimpanzees and related primates has discarded the notion of the use of technology as unique to humans for example researchers have observed wild chimpanzees utilising tools for foraging some of the tools used include leaf sponges termite fishing probes pestles and levers west african chimpanzees also use stone hammers and anvils for cracking nuts as do capuchin monkeys of boa vista brazil future technology main article emerging technologies theories of technology often attempt to predict the future of technology based on the high technology and science of the time as with all predictions of the future however technologys is uncertain futurist ray kurzweil predicts that the future of technology will be mainly consist of an overlapping gnr revolution of genetics nanotechnology and robotics with robotics being the most important of the three see

the use and knowledge of techniques and processes for producing goods and services for other uses see technology disambiguation a steam turbine with the case opened such turbines produce most of the electricity that people use electricity consumption and living standards are highly correlated electrification is believed to be the most important engineering achievement of the th century technology science of craft from greek τέχνη techne art skill cunning of hand and λογία logia is the collection of techniques skills methods and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives such as scientific investigation technology can be the knowledge of techniques processes and the like or it can be embedded in machines which can be operated without detailed knowledge of their workings the simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools the prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later neolithic revolution increased the available sources of food and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment developments in historic times including the printing press the telephone and the internet have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale the steady progress of military technology has brought weapons of everincreasing destructive power from clubs to nuclear weapons technology has many effects it has helped develop more advanced economies including todays global economy and has allowed the rise of a leisure class many technological processes produce unwanted byproducts known as pollution and deplete natural resources to the detriment of earths environment innovations have always influenced the values of a society and raised new questions of the ethics of technology examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity and the challenges of bioethics philosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it neoluddism anarchoprimitivism and similar reactionary movements criticise the pervasiveness of technology arguing that it harms the environment and alienates people proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and technoprogressivism view continued

definition and usage the spread of paper and printing to the west as in this printing press helped scientists and politicians communicate their ideas easily leading to the age of enlightenment an example of technology as cultural force the use of the term technology has changed significantly over the last  years before the th century the term was uncommon in english and usually referred to the description or study of the useful arts the term was often connected to technical education as in the massachusetts institute of technology chartered in  the term technology rose to prominence in the th century in connection with the second industrial revolution the terms meanings changed in the early th century when american social scientists beginning with thorstein veblen translated ideas from the german concept of technik into technology in german and other european languages a distinction exists between technik and technologie that is absent in english which usually translates both terms as technology by the s technology referred not only to the study of the industrial arts but to the industrial arts themselves in  the american sociologist read bain wrote that technology includes all tools machines utensils weapons instruments housing clothing communicating and transporting devices and the skills by which we produce and use them bains definition remains common among scholars today especially social scientists scientists and engineers usually prefer to define technology as applied science rather than as the things that people make and use more recently scholars have borrowed from european philosophers of technique to extend the meaning of technology to various forms of instrumental reason as in foucaults work on technologies of the self techniques de soi dictionaries and scholars have offered a variety of definitions the merriamwebster learners dictionary offers a definition of the term the use of science in industry engineering etc to invent useful things or to solve problems and a machine piece of equipment method etc that is created by technology ursula franklin in her  real world of technology lecture gave another definition of the concept it is practice the way we do things around here the term is often used to imply a specific field of technology or to refer to high technology or just consumer electronics rather than technology as a whole bernard stiegler in technics and time  defines technology in two ways as the pursuit of life by means other than life and as organized inorganic matter technology can be most broadly defined as the entities both material and immaterial created by the application of mental and physical effort in order to achieve some value in this usage technology refers to tools and machines that may be used to solve realworld problems it is a farreaching term that may include simple tools such as a crowbar or wooden spoon or more complex machines such as a space station or particle accelerator tools and machines need not be material virtual technology such as computer software and business methods fall under this definition of technology w brian arthur defines technology in a similarly broad way as a means to fulfill a human purpose the word technology can also be used to refer to a collection of techniques in this context it is the current state of humanitys knowledge of how to combine resources to produce desired products to solve problems fulfill needs or satisfy wants it includes technical methods skills processes techniques tools and raw materials when combined with another term such as medical technology or space technology it refers to the state of the respective fields knowledge and tools stateoftheart technology refers to the high technology available to humanity in any field the invention of integrated circuits and the microprocessor here an intel  chip from  led to the modern computer revolution technology can be viewed as an activity that forms or changes culture additionally technology is the application of math science and the arts for the benefit of life as it is known a modern example is the rise of communication technology which has lessened barriers to human interaction and as a result has helped spawn new subcultures the rise of cyberculture has at its basis the development of the internet and the computer not all technology enhances culture in a creative way technology can also help facilitate political oppression and war via tools such as guns as a cultural activity technology predates both science and engineering each of which formalize some aspects of technological endeavor science engineering and technology antoine lavoisier conducting an experiment with combustion generated by amplified sun light the distinction between science engineering and technology is not always clear science is systematic knowledge of the physical or material world gained through observation and experimentation technologies are not usually exclusively products of science because they have to satisfy requirements such as utility usability and safety engineering is the goaloriented process of designing and making tools and systems to exploit natural phenomena for practical human means often but not always using results and techniques from science the development of technology may draw upon many fields of knowledge including scientific engineering mathematical linguistic and historical knowledge to achieve some practical result technology is often a consequence of science and engineering although technology as a human activity precedes the two fields for example science might study the flow of electrons in electrical conductors by using alreadyexisting tools and knowledge this newfound knowledge may then be used by engineers to create new tools and machines such as semiconductors computers and other forms of advanced technology in this sense scientists and engineers may both be considered technologists the three fields are often considered as one for the purposes of research and reference the exact relations between science and technology in particular have been debated by scientists historians and policymakers in the late th century in part because the debate can inform the funding of basic and applied science in the immediate wake of world war ii for example it was widely considered in the united states that technology was simply applied science and that to fund basic science was to reap technological results in due time an articulation of this philosophy could be found explicitly in vannevar bushs treatise on postwar science policy science – the endless frontier new products new industries and more jobs require continuous additions to knowledge of the laws of nature  this essential new knowledge can be obtained only through basic scientific research in the lates however this view came under direct attack leading towards initiatives to fund science for specific tasks initiatives resisted by the scientific community the issue remains contentious though most analysts resist the model that technology simply is a result of scientific research history main articles history of technology timeline of historic inventions and timeline of electrical and electronic engineering paleolithic  ma –  ka a primitive chopper further information outline of prehistoric technology the use of tools by early humans was partly a process of discovery and of evolution early humans evolved from a species of foraging hominids which were already bipedal with a brain mass approximately one third of modern humans tool use remained relatively unchanged for most of early human history approximately  years ago the use of tools and complex set of behaviors emerged believed by many archaeologists to be connected to the emergence of fully modern language stone tools hand axes from the acheulian period a clovis point made via pressure flaking hominids started using primitive stone tools millions of years ago the earliest stone tools were little more than a fractured rock but approximately  years ago pressure flaking provided a way to make much finer work fire main article control of fire by early humans the discovery and utilization of fire a simple energy source with many profound uses was a turning point in the technological evolution of humankind the exact date of its discovery is not known evidence of burnt animal bones at the cradle of humankind suggests that the domestication of fire occurred before  ma scholarly consensus indicates that homo erectus had controlled fire by between  and  ka fire fueled with wood and charcoal allowed early humans to cook their food to increase its digestibility improving its nutrient value and broadening the number of foods that could be eaten clothing and shelter other technological advances made during the paleolithic era were clothing and shelter the adoption of both technologies cannot be dated exactly but they were a key to humanitys progress as the paleolithic era progressed dwellings became more sophisticated and more elaborate as early as  ka humans were constructing temporary wood huts clothing adapted from the fur and hides of hunted animals helped humanity expand into colder regions humans began to migrate out of africa by  ka and into other continents such as eurasia neolithic through classical antiquity  ka –  ce an array of neolithic artifacts including bracelets axe heads chisels and polishing tools humans technological ascent began in earnest in what is known as the neolithic period new stone age the invention of polished stone axes was a major advance that allowed forest clearance on a large scale to create farms this use of polished stone axes increased greatly in the neolithic but were originally used in the preceding mesolithic in some areas such as ireland agriculture fed larger populations and the transition to sedentism allowed simultaneously raising more children as infants no longer needed to be carried as nomadic ones must additionally children could contribute labor to the raising of crops more readily than they could to the huntergatherer economy with this increase in population and availability of labor came an increase in labor specialization what triggered the progression from early neolithic villages to the first cities such as uruk and the first civilizations such as sumer is not specifically known however the emergence of increasingly hierarchical social structures and specialized labor of trade and war amongst adjacent cultures and the need for collective action to overcome environmental challenges such as irrigation are all thought to have played a role metal tools continuing improvements led to the furnace and bellows and provided the ability to smelt and forge native metals naturally occurring in relatively pure form gold copper silver and lead were such early metals the advantages of copper tools over stone bone and wooden tools were quickly apparent to early humans and native copper was probably used from near the beginning of neolithic times about  ka native copper does not naturally occur in large amounts but copper ores are quite common and some of them produce metal easily when burned in wood or charcoal fires eventually the working of metals led to the discovery of alloys such as bronze and brass about  bce the first uses of iron alloys such as steel dates to around  bce energy and transport the wheel was invented circa  bce main article history of transport meanwhile humans were learning to harness other forms of energy the earliest known use of wind power is the sailboat the earliest record of a ship under sail is that of a nile boat that dates back to the th millennium bce from prehistoric times egyptians probably used the power of the annual flooding of the nile to irrigate their lands gradually learning to regulate much of it through purposely built irrigation channels and catch basins similarly the early peoples of mesopotamia the sumerians learned to use the tigris and euphrates rivers for much the same purposes however more extensive use of wind and water and even human power required another invention according to archaeologists the wheel was invented around  bce probably independently and nearly simultaneously in mesopotamia in presentday iraq the northern caucasus maykop culture and central europe estimates on when this may have occurred range from  to  bce with most experts putting it closer to  bce the oldest artifacts with drawings that depict wheeled carts date from about  bce however the wheel may have been in use for millennia before these drawings were made there is also evidence from the same period for the use of the potters wheel more recently the oldestknown wooden wheel in the world was found in the ljubljana marshes of slovenia the invention of the wheel revolutionized trade and war it did not take long to discover that wheeled wagons could be used to carry heavy loads fast rotary potters wheels enabled early mass production of pottery but it was the use of the wheel as a transformer of energy through water wheels windmills and even treadmills that revolutionized the application of nonhuman power sources medieval and modern history  ce – present main articles medieval technology renaissance technology industrial revolution second industrial revolution information technology and productivity improving technologies economic history innovations continued through the middle ages with innovations such as silk the horse collar and horseshoes in the first few hundred years after the fall of the roman empire medieval technology saw the use of simple machines such as the lever the screw and the pulley being combined to form more complicated tools such as the wheelbarrow windmills and clocks the renaissance brought forth many of these innovations including the printing press which facilitated the greater communication of knowledge and technology became increasingly associated with science beginning a cycle of mutual advancement the advancements in technology in this era allowed a more steady supply of food followed by the wider availability of consumer goods the automobile revolutionized personal transportation starting in the united kingdom in the th century the industrial revolution was a period of great technological discovery particularly in the areas of agriculture manufacturing mining metallurgy and transport driven by the discovery of steam power technology took another step in a second industrial revolution with the harnessing of electricity to create such innovations as the electric motor light bulb and countless others scientific advancement and the discovery of new concepts later allowed for powered flight and advancements in medicine chemistry physics and engineering the rise in technology has led to skyscrapers and broad urban areas whose inhabitants rely on motors to transport them and their food supply communication was also greatly improved with the invention of the telegraph telephone radio and television the late th and early th centuries saw a revolution in transportation with the invention of the airplane and automobile f and f flying over kuwaiti oil fires during the gulf war in  the th century brought a host of innovations in physics the discovery of nuclear fission has led to both nuclear weapons and nuclear power computers were also invented and later miniaturized utilizing transistors and integrated circuits information technology subsequently led to the creation of the internet which ushered in the current information age humans have also been able to explore space with satellites later used for telecommunication and in manned missions going all the way to the moon in medicine this era brought innovations such as openheart surgery and later stem cell therapy along with new medications and treatments complex manufacturing and construction techniques and organizations are needed to make and maintain these new technologies and entire industries have arisen to support and develop succeeding generations of increasingly more complex tools modern technology increasingly relies on training and education – their designers builders maintainers and users often require sophisticated general and specific training moreover these technologies have become so complex that entire fields have been created to support them including engineering medicine and computer science and other fields have been made more complex such as construction transportation and architecture philosophy technicism generally technicism is the belief in the utility of technology for improving human societies taken to an extreme technicism reflects a fundamental attitude which seeks to control reality to resolve all problems with the use of scientifictechnological methods and tools in other words human beings will someday be able to master all problems and possibly even control the future using technology some such as stephen v monsma connect these ideas to the abdication of religion as a higher moral authority optimism see also extropianism optimistic assumptions are made by proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and singularitarianism which view technological development as generally having beneficial effects for the society and the human condition in these ideologies technological development is morally good transhumanists generally believe that the point of technology is to overcome barriers and that what we commonly refer to as the human condition is just another barrier to be surpassed singularitarians believe in some sort of accelerating change that the rate of technological progress accelerates as we obtain more technology and that this will culminate in a singularity after artificial general intelligence is invented in which progress is nearly infinite hence the term estimates for the date of this singularity vary but prominent futurist ray kurzweil estimates the singularity will occur in  kurzweil is also known for his history of the universe in six epochs  the physicalchemical epoch  the life epoch  the humanbrain epoch  the technology epoch  the artificial intelligence epoch and  the universal colonization epoch going from one epoch to the next is a singularity in its own right and a period of speeding up precedes it each epoch takes a shorter time which means the whole history of the universe is one giant singularity event some critics see these ideologies as examples of scientism and technoutopianism and fear the notion of human enhancement and technological singularity which they support some have described karl marx as a technooptimist skepticism and critics see also luddite neoluddism anarchoprimitivism and bioconservatism luddites smashing a power loom in  on the somewhat skeptical side are certain philosophers like herbert marcuse and john zerzan who believe that technological societies are inherently flawed they suggest that the inevitable result of such a society is to become evermore technological at the cost of freedom and psychological health many such as the luddites and prominent philosopher martin heidegger hold serious although not entirely deterministic reservations about technology see the question concerning technology according to heidegger scholars hubert dreyfus and charles spinosa heidegger does not oppose technology he hopes to reveal the essence of technology in a way that in no way confines us to a stultified compulsion to push on blindly with technology or what comes to the same thing to rebel helplessly against it indeed he promises that when we once open ourselves expressly to the essence of technology we find ourselves unexpectedly taken into a freeing claim what this entails is a more complex relationship to technology than either technooptimists or technopessimists tend to allow some of the most poignant criticisms of technology are found in what are now considered to be dystopian literary classics such as aldous huxleys brave new world anthony burgesss a clockwork orange and george orwells nineteen eightyfour in goethes faust faust selling his soul to the devil in return for power over the physical world is also often interpreted as a metaphor for the adoption of industrial technology more recently modern works of science fiction such as those by philip k dick and william gibson and films such as blade runner and ghost in the shell project highly ambivalent or cautionary attitudes toward technologys impact on human society and identity the late cultural critic neil postman distinguished toolusing societies from technological societies and from what he called technopolies societies that are dominated by the ideology of technological and scientific progress to the exclusion or harm of other cultural practices values and worldviews darin barney has written about technologys impact on practices of citizenship and democratic culture suggesting that technology can be construed as  an object of political debate  a means or medium of discussion and  a setting for democratic deliberation and citizenship as a setting for democratic culture barney suggests that technology tends to make ethical questions including the question of what a good life consists in nearly impossible because they already give an answer to the question a good life is one that includes the use of more and more technology nikolas kompridis has also written about the dangers of new technology such as genetic engineering nanotechnology synthetic biology and robotics he warns that these technologies introduce unprecedented new challenges to human beings including the possibility of the permanent alteration of our biological nature these concerns are shared by other philosophers scientists and public intellectuals who have written about similar issues eg francis fukuyama jürgen habermas william joy and michael sandel another prominent critic of technology is hubert dreyfus who has published books such as on the internet and what computers still cant do a more infamous antitechnological treatise is industrial society and its future written by the unabomber ted kaczynski and printed in several major newspapers and later books as part of an effort to end his bombing campaign of the technoindustrial infrastructure appropriate technology see also technocriticism and technorealism the notion of appropriate technology was developed in the th century by thinkers such as e f schumacher and jacques ellul to describe situations where it was not desirable to use very new technologies or those that required access to some centralized infrastructure or parts or skills imported from elsewhere the ecovillage movement emerged in part due to this concern optimism and skepticism in the st century this section mainly focuses on american concerns even if it can reasonably be generalized to other western countries the inadequate quantity and quality of american jobs is one of the most fundamental economic challenges we face  whats the linkage between technology and this fundamental problem — bernstein jared it’s not a skills gap that’s holding wages down it’s the weak economy among other things in the american prospect october  in his article jared bernstein a senior fellow at the center on budget and policy priorities questions the widespread idea that automation and more broadly technological advances have mainly contributed to this growing labor market problem his thesis appears to be a third way between optimism and skepticism essentially he stands for a neutral approach of the linkage between technology and american issues concerning unemployment and declining wages he uses two main arguments to defend his point first because of recent technological advances an increasing number of workers are losing their jobs yet scientific evidence fails to clearly demonstrate that technology has displaced so many workers that it has created more problems than it has solved indeed automation threatens repetitive jobs but higherend jobs are still necessary because they complement technology and manual jobs that requires flexibility judgment and common sense remain hard to replace with machines second studies have not shown clear links between recent technology advances and the wage trends of the last decades therefore according to bernstein instead of focusing on technology and its hypothetical influences on current american increasing unemployment and declining wages one needs to worry more about bad policy that fails to offset the imbalances in demand trade income and opportunity complex technological systems thomas p hughes stated that because technology has been considered as a key way to solve problems we need to be aware of its complex and varied characters to use it more efficiently what is the difference between a wheel or a compass and cooking machines such as an oven or a gas stove can we consider all of them only a part of them or none of them as technologies technology is often considered too narrowly according to hughes technology is a creative process involving human ingenuity this definitions emphasis on creativity avoids unbounded definitions that may mistakenly include cooking “technologies but it also highlights the prominent role of humans and therefore their responsibilities for the use of complex technological systems yet because technology is everywhere and has dramatically changed landscapes and societies hughes argues that engineers scientists and managers have often believed that they can use technology to shape the world as they want they have often supposed that technology is easily controllable and this assumption has to be thoroughly questioned for instance evgeny morozov particularly challenges two concepts “internetcentrism” and “solutionism internetcentrism refers to the idea that our society is convinced that the internet is one of the most stable and coherent forces solutionism is the ideology that every social issue can be solved thanks to technology and especially thanks to the internet in fact technology intrinsically contains uncertainties and limitations according to alexis madrigals review of morozovs theory to ignore it will lead to “unexpected consequences that could eventually cause more damage than the problems they seek to address benjamin r cohen and gwen ottinger also discussed the multivalent effects of technology therefore recognition of the limitations of technology and more broadly scientific knowledge is needed – especially in cases dealing with environmental justice and health issues ottinger continues this reasoning and argues that the ongoing recognition of the limitations of scientific knowledge goes hand in hand with scientists and engineers’ new comprehension of their role such an approach of technology and science require technical professionals to conceive of their roles in the process differently they have to consider themselves as collaborators in research and problem solving rather than simply providers of information and technical solutions competitiveness technology is properly defined as any application of science to accomplish a function the science can be leading edge or well established and the function can have high visibility or be significantly more mundane but it is all technology and its exploitation is the foundation of all competitive advantage technologybased planning is what was used to build the us industrial giants before wwii eg dow dupont gm and it is what was used to transform the us into a superpower it was not economicbased planning other animal species see also tool use by animals structures built by animals and ecosystem engineer this adult gorilla uses a branch as a walking stick to gauge the waters depth an example of technology usage by nonhuman primates the use of basic technology is also a feature of other animal species apart from humans these include primates such as chimpanzees some dolphin communities and crows considering a more generic perspective of technology as ethology of active environmental conditioning and control we can also refer to animal examples such as beavers and their dams or bees and their honeycombs the ability to make and use tools was once considered a defining characteristic of the genus homo however the discovery of tool construction among chimpanzees and related primates has discarded the notion of the use of technology as unique to humans for example researchers have observed wild chimpanzees utilising tools for foraging some of the tools used include leaf sponges termite fishing probes pestles and levers west african chimpanzees also use stone hammers and anvils for cracking nuts as do capuchin monkeys of boa vista brazil future technology main article emerging technologies theories of technology often attempt to predict the future of technology based on the high technology and science of the time as with all predictions of the future however technologys is uncertain futurist ray kurzweil predicts that the future of technology will be mainly consist of an overlapping gnr revolution of genetics nanotechnology and robotics with robotics being the most important of the three see

the use and knowledge of techniques and processes for producing goods and services for other uses see technology disambiguation a steam turbine with the case opened such turbines produce most of the electricity that people use electricity consumption and living standards are highly correlated electrification is believed to be the most important engineering achievement of the th century technology science of craft from greek τέχνη techne art skill cunning of hand and λογία logia is the collection of techniques skills methods and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives such as scientific investigation technology can be the knowledge of techniques processes and the like or it can be embedded in machines which can be operated without detailed knowledge of their workings the simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools the prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later neolithic revolution increased the available sources of food and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment developments in historic times including the printing press the telephone and the internet have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale the steady progress of military technology has brought weapons of everincreasing destructive power from clubs to nuclear weapons technology has many effects it has helped develop more advanced economies including todays global economy and has allowed the rise of a leisure class many technological processes produce unwanted byproducts known as pollution and deplete natural resources to the detriment of earths environment innovations have always influenced the values of a society and raised new questions of the ethics of technology examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity and the challenges of bioethics philosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it neoluddism anarchoprimitivism and similar reactionary movements criticise the pervasiveness of technology arguing that it harms the environment and alienates people proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and technoprogressivism view continued

definition and usage the spread of paper and printing to the west as in this printing press helped scientists and politicians communicate their ideas easily leading to the age of enlightenment an example of technology as cultural force the use of the term technology has changed significantly over the last  years before the th century the term was uncommon in english and usually referred to the description or study of the useful arts the term was often connected to technical education as in the massachusetts institute of technology chartered in  the term technology rose to prominence in the th century in connection with the second industrial revolution the terms meanings changed in the early th century when american social scientists beginning with thorstein veblen translated ideas from the german concept of technik into technology in german and other european languages a distinction exists between technik and technologie that is absent in english which usually translates both terms as technology by the s technology referred not only to the study of the industrial arts but to the industrial arts themselves in  the american sociologist read bain wrote that technology includes all tools machines utensils weapons instruments housing clothing communicating and transporting devices and the skills by which we produce and use them bains definition remains common among scholars today especially social scientists scientists and engineers usually prefer to define technology as applied science rather than as the things that people make and use more recently scholars have borrowed from european philosophers of technique to extend the meaning of technology to various forms of instrumental reason as in foucaults work on technologies of the self techniques de soi dictionaries and scholars have offered a variety of definitions the merriamwebster learners dictionary offers a definition of the term the use of science in industry engineering etc to invent useful things or to solve problems and a machine piece of equipment method etc that is created by technology ursula franklin in her  real world of technology lecture gave another definition of the concept it is practice the way we do things around here the term is often used to imply a specific field of technology or to refer to high technology or just consumer electronics rather than technology as a whole bernard stiegler in technics and time  defines technology in two ways as the pursuit of life by means other than life and as organized inorganic matter technology can be most broadly defined as the entities both material and immaterial created by the application of mental and physical effort in order to achieve some value in this usage technology refers to tools and machines that may be used to solve realworld problems it is a farreaching term that may include simple tools such as a crowbar or wooden spoon or more complex machines such as a space station or particle accelerator tools and machines need not be material virtual technology such as computer software and business methods fall under this definition of technology w brian arthur defines technology in a similarly broad way as a means to fulfill a human purpose the word technology can also be used to refer to a collection of techniques in this context it is the current state of humanitys knowledge of how to combine resources to produce desired products to solve problems fulfill needs or satisfy wants it includes technical methods skills processes techniques tools and raw materials when combined with another term such as medical technology or space technology it refers to the state of the respective fields knowledge and tools stateoftheart technology refers to the high technology available to humanity in any field the invention of integrated circuits and the microprocessor here an intel  chip from  led to the modern computer revolution technology can be viewed as an activity that forms or changes culture additionally technology is the application of math science and the arts for the benefit of life as it is known a modern example is the rise of communication technology which has lessened barriers to human interaction and as a result has helped spawn new subcultures the rise of cyberculture has at its basis the development of the internet and the computer not all technology enhances culture in a creative way technology can also help facilitate political oppression and war via tools such as guns as a cultural activity technology predates both science and engineering each of which formalize some aspects of technological endeavor science engineering and technology antoine lavoisier conducting an experiment with combustion generated by amplified sun light the distinction between science engineering and technology is not always clear science is systematic knowledge of the physical or material world gained through observation and experimentation technologies are not usually exclusively products of science because they have to satisfy requirements such as utility usability and safety engineering is the goaloriented process of designing and making tools and systems to exploit natural phenomena for practical human means often but not always using results and techniques from science the development of technology may draw upon many fields of knowledge including scientific engineering mathematical linguistic and historical knowledge to achieve some practical result technology is often a consequence of science and engineering although technology as a human activity precedes the two fields for example science might study the flow of electrons in electrical conductors by using alreadyexisting tools and knowledge this newfound knowledge may then be used by engineers to create new tools and machines such as semiconductors computers and other forms of advanced technology in this sense scientists and engineers may both be considered technologists the three fields are often considered as one for the purposes of research and reference the exact relations between science and technology in particular have been debated by scientists historians and policymakers in the late th century in part because the debate can inform the funding of basic and applied science in the immediate wake of world war ii for example it was widely considered in the united states that technology was simply applied science and that to fund basic science was to reap technological results in due time an articulation of this philosophy could be found explicitly in vannevar bushs treatise on postwar science policy science – the endless frontier new products new industries and more jobs require continuous additions to knowledge of the laws of nature  this essential new knowledge can be obtained only through basic scientific research in the lates however this view came under direct attack leading towards initiatives to fund science for specific tasks initiatives resisted by the scientific community the issue remains contentious though most analysts resist the model that technology simply is a result of scientific research history main articles history of technology timeline of historic inventions and timeline of electrical and electronic engineering paleolithic  ma –  ka a primitive chopper further information outline of prehistoric technology the use of tools by early humans was partly a process of discovery and of evolution early humans evolved from a species of foraging hominids which were already bipedal with a brain mass approximately one third of modern humans tool use remained relatively unchanged for most of early human history approximately  years ago the use of tools and complex set of behaviors emerged believed by many archaeologists to be connected to the emergence of fully modern language stone tools hand axes from the acheulian period a clovis point made via pressure flaking hominids started using primitive stone tools millions of years ago the earliest stone tools were little more than a fractured rock but approximately  years ago pressure flaking provided a way to make much finer work fire main article control of fire by early humans the discovery and utilization of fire a simple energy source with many profound uses was a turning point in the technological evolution of humankind the exact date of its discovery is not known evidence of burnt animal bones at the cradle of humankind suggests that the domestication of fire occurred before  ma scholarly consensus indicates that homo erectus had controlled fire by between  and  ka fire fueled with wood and charcoal allowed early humans to cook their food to increase its digestibility improving its nutrient value and broadening the number of foods that could be eaten clothing and shelter other technological advances made during the paleolithic era were clothing and shelter the adoption of both technologies cannot be dated exactly but they were a key to humanitys progress as the paleolithic era progressed dwellings became more sophisticated and more elaborate as early as  ka humans were constructing temporary wood huts clothing adapted from the fur and hides of hunted animals helped humanity expand into colder regions humans began to migrate out of africa by  ka and into other continents such as eurasia neolithic through classical antiquity  ka –  ce an array of neolithic artifacts including bracelets axe heads chisels and polishing tools humans technological ascent began in earnest in what is known as the neolithic period new stone age the invention of polished stone axes was a major advance that allowed forest clearance on a large scale to create farms this use of polished stone axes increased greatly in the neolithic but were originally used in the preceding mesolithic in some areas such as ireland agriculture fed larger populations and the transition to sedentism allowed simultaneously raising more children as infants no longer needed to be carried as nomadic ones must additionally children could contribute labor to the raising of crops more readily than they could to the huntergatherer economy with this increase in population and availability of labor came an increase in labor specialization what triggered the progression from early neolithic villages to the first cities such as uruk and the first civilizations such as sumer is not specifically known however the emergence of increasingly hierarchical social structures and specialized labor of trade and war amongst adjacent cultures and the need for collective action to overcome environmental challenges such as irrigation are all thought to have played a role metal tools continuing improvements led to the furnace and bellows and provided the ability to smelt and forge native metals naturally occurring in relatively pure form gold copper silver and lead were such early metals the advantages of copper tools over stone bone and wooden tools were quickly apparent to early humans and native copper was probably used from near the beginning of neolithic times about  ka native copper does not naturally occur in large amounts but copper ores are quite common and some of them produce metal easily when burned in wood or charcoal fires eventually the working of metals led to the discovery of alloys such as bronze and brass about  bce the first uses of iron alloys such as steel dates to around  bce energy and transport the wheel was invented circa  bce main article history of transport meanwhile humans were learning to harness other forms of energy the earliest known use of wind power is the sailboat the earliest record of a ship under sail is that of a nile boat that dates back to the th millennium bce from prehistoric times egyptians probably used the power of the annual flooding of the nile to irrigate their lands gradually learning to regulate much of it through purposely built irrigation channels and catch basins similarly the early peoples of mesopotamia the sumerians learned to use the tigris and euphrates rivers for much the same purposes however more extensive use of wind and water and even human power required another invention according to archaeologists the wheel was invented around  bce probably independently and nearly simultaneously in mesopotamia in presentday iraq the northern caucasus maykop culture and central europe estimates on when this may have occurred range from  to  bce with most experts putting it closer to  bce the oldest artifacts with drawings that depict wheeled carts date from about  bce however the wheel may have been in use for millennia before these drawings were made there is also evidence from the same period for the use of the potters wheel more recently the oldestknown wooden wheel in the world was found in the ljubljana marshes of slovenia the invention of the wheel revolutionized trade and war it did not take long to discover that wheeled wagons could be used to carry heavy loads fast rotary potters wheels enabled early mass production of pottery but it was the use of the wheel as a transformer of energy through water wheels windmills and even treadmills that revolutionized the application of nonhuman power sources medieval and modern history  ce – present main articles medieval technology renaissance technology industrial revolution second industrial revolution information technology and productivity improving technologies economic history innovations continued through the middle ages with innovations such as silk the horse collar and horseshoes in the first few hundred years after the fall of the roman empire medieval technology saw the use of simple machines such as the lever the screw and the pulley being combined to form more complicated tools such as the wheelbarrow windmills and clocks the renaissance brought forth many of these innovations including the printing press which facilitated the greater communication of knowledge and technology became increasingly associated with science beginning a cycle of mutual advancement the advancements in technology in this era allowed a more steady supply of food followed by the wider availability of consumer goods the automobile revolutionized personal transportation starting in the united kingdom in the th century the industrial revolution was a period of great technological discovery particularly in the areas of agriculture manufacturing mining metallurgy and transport driven by the discovery of steam power technology took another step in a second industrial revolution with the harnessing of electricity to create such innovations as the electric motor light bulb and countless others scientific advancement and the discovery of new concepts later allowed for powered flight and advancements in medicine chemistry physics and engineering the rise in technology has led to skyscrapers and broad urban areas whose inhabitants rely on motors to transport them and their food supply communication was also greatly improved with the invention of the telegraph telephone radio and television the late th and early th centuries saw a revolution in transportation with the invention of the airplane and automobile f and f flying over kuwaiti oil fires during the gulf war in  the th century brought a host of innovations in physics the discovery of nuclear fission has led to both nuclear weapons and nuclear power computers were also invented and later miniaturized utilizing transistors and integrated circuits information technology subsequently led to the creation of the internet which ushered in the current information age humans have also been able to explore space with satellites later used for telecommunication and in manned missions going all the way to the moon in medicine this era brought innovations such as openheart surgery and later stem cell therapy along with new medications and treatments complex manufacturing and construction techniques and organizations are needed to make and maintain these new technologies and entire industries have arisen to support and develop succeeding generations of increasingly more complex tools modern technology increasingly relies on training and education – their designers builders maintainers and users often require sophisticated general and specific training moreover these technologies have become so complex that entire fields have been created to support them including engineering medicine and computer science and other fields have been made more complex such as construction transportation and architecture philosophy technicism generally technicism is the belief in the utility of technology for improving human societies taken to an extreme technicism reflects a fundamental attitude which seeks to control reality to resolve all problems with the use of scientifictechnological methods and tools in other words human beings will someday be able to master all problems and possibly even control the future using technology some such as stephen v monsma connect these ideas to the abdication of religion as a higher moral authority optimism see also extropianism optimistic assumptions are made by proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and singularitarianism which view technological development as generally having beneficial effects for the society and the human condition in these ideologies technological development is morally good transhumanists generally believe that the point of technology is to overcome barriers and that what we commonly refer to as the human condition is just another barrier to be surpassed singularitarians believe in some sort of accelerating change that the rate of technological progress accelerates as we obtain more technology and that this will culminate in a singularity after artificial general intelligence is invented in which progress is nearly infinite hence the term estimates for the date of this singularity vary but prominent futurist ray kurzweil estimates the singularity will occur in  kurzweil is also known for his history of the universe in six epochs  the physicalchemical epoch  the life epoch  the humanbrain epoch  the technology epoch  the artificial intelligence epoch and  the universal colonization epoch going from one epoch to the next is a singularity in its own right and a period of speeding up precedes it each epoch takes a shorter time which means the whole history of the universe is one giant singularity event some critics see these ideologies as examples of scientism and technoutopianism and fear the notion of human enhancement and technological singularity which they support some have described karl marx as a technooptimist skepticism and critics see also luddite neoluddism anarchoprimitivism and bioconservatism luddites smashing a power loom in  on the somewhat skeptical side are certain philosophers like herbert marcuse and john zerzan who believe that technological societies are inherently flawed they suggest that the inevitable result of such a society is to become evermore technological at the cost of freedom and psychological health many such as the luddites and prominent philosopher martin heidegger hold serious although not entirely deterministic reservations about technology see the question concerning technology according to heidegger scholars hubert dreyfus and charles spinosa heidegger does not oppose technology he hopes to reveal the essence of technology in a way that in no way confines us to a stultified compulsion to push on blindly with technology or what comes to the same thing to rebel helplessly against it indeed he promises that when we once open ourselves expressly to the essence of technology we find ourselves unexpectedly taken into a freeing claim what this entails is a more complex relationship to technology than either technooptimists or technopessimists tend to allow some of the most poignant criticisms of technology are found in what are now considered to be dystopian literary classics such as aldous huxleys brave new world anthony burgesss a clockwork orange and george orwells nineteen eightyfour in goethes faust faust selling his soul to the devil in return for power over the physical world is also often interpreted as a metaphor for the adoption of industrial technology more recently modern works of science fiction such as those by philip k dick and william gibson and films such as blade runner and ghost in the shell project highly ambivalent or cautionary attitudes toward technologys impact on human society and identity the late cultural critic neil postman distinguished toolusing societies from technological societies and from what he called technopolies societies that are dominated by the ideology of technological and scientific progress to the exclusion or harm of other cultural practices values and worldviews darin barney has written about technologys impact on practices of citizenship and democratic culture suggesting that technology can be construed as  an object of political debate  a means or medium of discussion and  a setting for democratic deliberation and citizenship as a setting for democratic culture barney suggests that technology tends to make ethical questions including the question of what a good life consists in nearly impossible because they already give an answer to the question a good life is one that includes the use of more and more technology nikolas kompridis has also written about the dangers of new technology such as genetic engineering nanotechnology synthetic biology and robotics he warns that these technologies introduce unprecedented new challenges to human beings including the possibility of the permanent alteration of our biological nature these concerns are shared by other philosophers scientists and public intellectuals who have written about similar issues eg francis fukuyama jürgen habermas william joy and michael sandel another prominent critic of technology is hubert dreyfus who has published books such as on the internet and what computers still cant do a more infamous antitechnological treatise is industrial society and its future written by the unabomber ted kaczynski and printed in several major newspapers and later books as part of an effort to end his bombing campaign of the technoindustrial infrastructure appropriate technology see also technocriticism and technorealism the notion of appropriate technology was developed in the th century by thinkers such as e f schumacher and jacques ellul to describe situations where it was not desirable to use very new technologies or those that required access to some centralized infrastructure or parts or skills imported from elsewhere the ecovillage movement emerged in part due to this concern optimism and skepticism in the st century this section mainly focuses on american concerns even if it can reasonably be generalized to other western countries the inadequate quantity and quality of american jobs is one of the most fundamental economic challenges we face  whats the linkage between technology and this fundamental problem — bernstein jared it’s not a skills gap that’s holding wages down it’s the weak economy among other things in the american prospect october  in his article jared bernstein a senior fellow at the center on budget and policy priorities questions the widespread idea that automation and more broadly technological advances have mainly contributed to this growing labor market problem his thesis appears to be a third way between optimism and skepticism essentially he stands for a neutral approach of the linkage between technology and american issues concerning unemployment and declining wages he uses two main arguments to defend his point first because of recent technological advances an increasing number of workers are losing their jobs yet scientific evidence fails to clearly demonstrate that technology has displaced so many workers that it has created more problems than it has solved indeed automation threatens repetitive jobs but higherend jobs are still necessary because they complement technology and manual jobs that requires flexibility judgment and common sense remain hard to replace with machines second studies have not shown clear links between recent technology advances and the wage trends of the last decades therefore according to bernstein instead of focusing on technology and its hypothetical influences on current american increasing unemployment and declining wages one needs to worry more about bad policy that fails to offset the imbalances in demand trade income and opportunity complex technological systems thomas p hughes stated that because technology has been considered as a key way to solve problems we need to be aware of its complex and varied characters to use it more efficiently what is the difference between a wheel or a compass and cooking machines such as an oven or a gas stove can we consider all of them only a part of them or none of them as technologies technology is often considered too narrowly according to hughes technology is a creative process involving human ingenuity this definitions emphasis on creativity avoids unbounded definitions that may mistakenly include cooking “technologies but it also highlights the prominent role of humans and therefore their responsibilities for the use of complex technological systems yet because technology is everywhere and has dramatically changed landscapes and societies hughes argues that engineers scientists and managers have often believed that they can use technology to shape the world as they want they have often supposed that technology is easily controllable and this assumption has to be thoroughly questioned for instance evgeny morozov particularly challenges two concepts “internetcentrism” and “solutionism internetcentrism refers to the idea that our society is convinced that the internet is one of the most stable and coherent forces solutionism is the ideology that every social issue can be solved thanks to technology and especially thanks to the internet in fact technology intrinsically contains uncertainties and limitations according to alexis madrigals review of morozovs theory to ignore it will lead to “unexpected consequences that could eventually cause more damage than the problems they seek to address benjamin r cohen and gwen ottinger also discussed the multivalent effects of technology therefore recognition of the limitations of technology and more broadly scientific knowledge is needed – especially in cases dealing with environmental justice and health issues ottinger continues this reasoning and argues that the ongoing recognition of the limitations of scientific knowledge goes hand in hand with scientists and engineers’ new comprehension of their role such an approach of technology and science require technical professionals to conceive of their roles in the process differently they have to consider themselves as collaborators in research and problem solving rather than simply providers of information and technical solutions competitiveness technology is properly defined as any application of science to accomplish a function the science can be leading edge or well established and the function can have high visibility or be significantly more mundane but it is all technology and its exploitation is the foundation of all competitive advantage technologybased planning is what was used to build the us industrial giants before wwii eg dow dupont gm and it is what was used to transform the us into a superpower it was not economicbased planning other animal species see also tool use by animals structures built by animals and ecosystem engineer this adult gorilla uses a branch as a walking stick to gauge the waters depth an example of technology usage by nonhuman primates the use of basic technology is also a feature of other animal species apart from humans these include primates such as chimpanzees some dolphin communities and crows considering a more generic perspective of technology as ethology of active environmental conditioning and control we can also refer to animal examples such as beavers and their dams or bees and their honeycombs the ability to make and use tools was once considered a defining characteristic of the genus homo however the discovery of tool construction among chimpanzees and related primates has discarded the notion of the use of technology as unique to humans for example researchers have observed wild chimpanzees utilising tools for foraging some of the tools used include leaf sponges termite fishing probes pestles and levers west african chimpanzees also use stone hammers and anvils for cracking nuts as do capuchin monkeys of boa vista brazil future technology main article emerging technologies theories of technology often attempt to predict the future of technology based on the high technology and science of the time as with all predictions of the future however technologys is uncertain futurist ray

the use and knowledge of techniques and processes for producing goods and services for other uses see technology disambiguation a steam turbine with the case opened such turbines produce most of the electricity that people use electricity consumption and living standards are highly correlated electrification is believed to be the most important engineering achievement of the th century technology science of craft from greek τέχνη techne art skill cunning of hand and λογία logia is the collection of techniques skills methods and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives such as scientific investigation technology can be the knowledge of techniques processes and the like or it can be embedded in machines which can be operated without detailed knowledge of their workings the simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools the prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later neolithic revolution increased the available sources of food and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment developments in historic times including the printing press the telephone and the internet have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale the steady progress of military technology has brought weapons of everincreasing destructive power from clubs to nuclear weapons technology has many effects it has helped develop more advanced economies including todays global economy and has allowed the rise of a leisure class many technological processes produce unwanted byproducts known as pollution and deplete natural resources to the detriment of earths environment innovations have always influenced the values of a society and raised new questions of the ethics of technology examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity and the challenges of bioethics philosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it neoluddism anarchoprimitivism and similar reactionary movements criticise the pervasiveness of technology arguing that it harms the environment and alienates people proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and technoprogressivism view continued

definition and usage the spread of paper and printing to the west as in this printing press helped scientists and politicians communicate their ideas easily leading to the age of enlightenment an example of technology as cultural force the use of the term technology has changed significantly over the last  years before the th century the term was uncommon in english and usually referred to the description or study of the useful arts the term was often connected to technical education as in the massachusetts institute of technology chartered in  the term technology rose to prominence in the th century in connection with the second industrial revolution the terms meanings changed in the early th century when american social scientists beginning with thorstein veblen translated ideas from the german concept of technik into technology in german and other european languages a distinction exists between technik and technologie that is absent in english which usually translates both terms as technology by the s technology referred not only to the study of the industrial arts but to the industrial arts themselves in  the american sociologist read bain wrote that technology includes all tools machines utensils weapons instruments housing clothing communicating and transporting devices and the skills by which we produce and use them bains definition remains common among scholars today especially social scientists scientists and engineers usually prefer to define technology as applied science rather than as the things that people make and use more recently scholars have borrowed from european philosophers of technique to extend the meaning of technology to various forms of instrumental reason as in foucaults work on technologies of the self techniques de soi dictionaries and scholars have offered a variety of definitions the merriamwebster learners dictionary offers a definition of the term the use of science in industry engineering etc to invent useful things or to solve problems and a machine piece of equipment method etc that is created by technology ursula franklin in her  real world of technology lecture gave another definition of the concept it is practice the way we do things around here the term is often used to imply a specific field of technology or to refer to high technology or just consumer electronics rather than technology as a whole bernard stiegler in technics and time  defines technology in two ways as the pursuit of life by means other than life and as organized inorganic matter technology can be most broadly defined as the entities both material and immaterial created by the application of mental and physical effort in order to achieve some value in this usage technology refers to tools and machines that may be used to solve realworld problems it is a farreaching term that may include simple tools such as a crowbar or wooden spoon or more complex machines such as a space station or particle accelerator tools and machines need not be material virtual technology such as computer software and business methods fall under this definition of technology w brian arthur defines technology in a similarly broad way as a means to fulfill a human purpose the word technology can also be used to refer to a collection of techniques in this context it is the current state of humanitys knowledge of how to combine resources to produce desired products to solve problems fulfill needs or satisfy wants it includes technical methods skills processes techniques tools and raw materials when combined with another term such as medical technology or space technology it refers to the state of the respective fields knowledge and tools stateoftheart technology refers to the high technology available to humanity in any field the invention of integrated circuits and the microprocessor here an intel  chip from  led to the modern computer revolution technology can be viewed as an activity that forms or changes culture additionally technology is the application of math science and the arts for the benefit of life as it is known a modern example is the rise of communication technology which has lessened barriers to human interaction and as a result has helped spawn new subcultures the rise of cyberculture has at its basis the development of the internet and the computer not all technology enhances culture in a creative way technology can also help facilitate political oppression and war via tools such as guns as a cultural activity technology predates both science and engineering each of which formalize some aspects of technological endeavor science engineering and technology antoine lavoisier conducting an experiment with combustion generated by amplified sun light the distinction between science engineering and technology is not always clear science is systematic knowledge of the physical or material world gained through observation and experimentation technologies are not usually exclusively products of science because they have to satisfy requirements such as utility usability and safety engineering is the goaloriented process of designing and making tools and systems to exploit natural phenomena for practical human means often but not always using results and techniques from science the development of technology may draw upon many fields of knowledge including scientific engineering mathematical linguistic and historical knowledge to achieve some practical result technology is often a consequence of science and engineering although technology as a human activity precedes the two fields for example science might study the flow of electrons in electrical conductors by using alreadyexisting tools and knowledge this newfound knowledge may then be used by engineers to create new tools and machines such as semiconductors computers and other forms of advanced technology in this sense scientists and engineers may both be considered technologists the three fields are often considered as one for the purposes of research and reference the exact relations between science and technology in particular have been debated by scientists historians and policymakers in the late th century in part because the debate can inform the funding of basic and applied science in the immediate wake of world war ii for example it was widely considered in the united states that technology was simply applied science and that to fund basic science was to reap technological results in due time an articulation of this philosophy could be found explicitly in vannevar bushs treatise on postwar science policy science – the endless frontier new products new industries and more jobs require continuous additions to knowledge of the laws of nature  this essential new knowledge can be obtained only through basic scientific research in the lates however this view came under direct attack leading towards initiatives to fund science for specific tasks initiatives resisted by the scientific community the issue remains contentious though most analysts resist the model that technology simply is a result of scientific research history main articles history of technology timeline of historic inventions and timeline of electrical and electronic engineering paleolithic  ma –  ka a primitive chopper further information outline of prehistoric technology the use of tools by early humans was partly a process of discovery and of evolution early humans evolved from a species of foraging hominids which were already bipedal with a brain mass approximately one third of modern humans tool use remained relatively unchanged for most of early human history approximately  years ago the use of tools and complex set of behaviors emerged believed by many archaeologists to be connected to the emergence of fully modern language stone tools hand axes from the acheulian period a clovis point made via pressure flaking hominids started using primitive stone tools millions of years ago the earliest stone tools were little more than a fractured rock but approximately  years ago pressure flaking provided a way to make much finer work fire main article control of fire by early humans the discovery and utilization of fire a simple energy source with many profound uses was a turning point in the technological evolution of humankind the exact date of its discovery is not known evidence of burnt animal bones at the cradle of humankind suggests that the domestication of fire occurred before  ma scholarly consensus indicates that homo erectus had controlled fire by between  and  ka fire fueled with wood and charcoal allowed early humans to cook their food to increase its digestibility improving its nutrient value and broadening the number of foods that could be eaten clothing and shelter other technological advances made during the paleolithic era were clothing and shelter the adoption of both technologies cannot be dated exactly but they were a key to humanitys progress as the paleolithic era progressed dwellings became more sophisticated and more elaborate as early as  ka humans were constructing temporary wood huts clothing adapted from the fur and hides of hunted animals helped humanity expand into colder regions humans began to migrate out of africa by  ka and into other continents such as eurasia neolithic through classical antiquity  ka –  ce an array of neolithic artifacts including bracelets axe heads chisels and polishing tools humans technological ascent began in earnest in what is known as the neolithic period new stone age the invention of polished stone axes was a major advance that allowed forest clearance on a large scale to create farms this use of polished stone axes increased greatly in the neolithic but were originally used in the preceding mesolithic in some areas such as ireland agriculture fed larger populations and the transition to sedentism allowed simultaneously raising more children as infants no longer needed to be carried as nomadic ones must additionally children could contribute labor to the raising of crops more readily than they could to the huntergatherer economy with this increase in population and availability of labor came an increase in labor specialization what triggered the progression from early neolithic villages to the first cities such as uruk and the first civilizations such as sumer is not specifically known however the emergence of increasingly hierarchical social structures and specialized labor of trade and war amongst adjacent cultures and the need for collective action to overcome environmental challenges such as irrigation are all thought to have played a role metal tools continuing improvements led to the furnace and bellows and provided the ability to smelt and forge native metals naturally occurring in relatively pure form gold copper silver and lead were such early metals the advantages of copper tools over stone bone and wooden tools were quickly apparent to early humans and native copper was probably used from near the beginning of neolithic times about  ka native copper does not naturally occur in large amounts but copper ores are quite common and some of them produce metal easily when burned in wood or charcoal fires eventually the working of metals led to the discovery of alloys such as bronze and brass about  bce the first uses of iron alloys such as steel dates to around  bce energy and transport the wheel was invented circa  bce main article history of transport meanwhile humans were learning to harness other forms of energy the earliest known use of wind power is the sailboat the earliest record of a ship under sail is that of a nile boat that dates back to the th millennium bce from prehistoric times egyptians probably used the power of the annual flooding of the nile to irrigate their lands gradually learning to regulate much of it through purposely built irrigation channels and catch basins similarly the early peoples of mesopotamia the sumerians learned to use the tigris and euphrates rivers for much the same purposes however more extensive use of wind and water and even human power required another invention according to archaeologists the wheel was invented around  bce probably independently and nearly simultaneously in mesopotamia in presentday iraq the northern caucasus maykop culture and central europe estimates on when this may have occurred range from  to  bce with most experts putting it closer to  bce the oldest artifacts with drawings that depict wheeled carts date from about  bce however the wheel may have been in use for millennia before these drawings were made there is also evidence from the same period for the use of the potters wheel more recently the oldestknown wooden wheel in the world was found in the ljubljana marshes of slovenia the invention of the wheel revolutionized trade and war it did not take long to discover that wheeled wagons could be used to carry heavy loads fast rotary potters wheels enabled early mass production of pottery but it was the use of the wheel as a transformer of energy through water wheels windmills and even treadmills that revolutionized the application of nonhuman power sources medieval and modern history  ce – present main articles medieval technology renaissance technology industrial revolution second industrial revolution information technology and productivity improving technologies economic history innovations continued through the middle ages with innovations such as silk the horse collar and horseshoes in the first few hundred years after the fall of the roman empire medieval technology saw the use of simple machines such as the lever the screw and the pulley being combined to form more complicated tools such as the wheelbarrow windmills and clocks the renaissance brought forth many of these innovations including the printing press which facilitated the greater communication of knowledge and technology became increasingly associated with science beginning a cycle of mutual advancement the advancements in technology in this era allowed a more steady supply of food followed by the wider availability of consumer goods the automobile revolutionized personal transportation starting in the united kingdom in the th century the industrial revolution was a period of great technological discovery particularly in the areas of agriculture manufacturing mining metallurgy and transport driven by the discovery of steam power technology took another step in a second industrial revolution with the harnessing of electricity to create such innovations as the electric motor light bulb and countless others scientific advancement and the discovery of new concepts later allowed for powered flight and advancements in medicine chemistry physics and engineering the rise in technology has led to skyscrapers and broad urban areas whose inhabitants rely on motors to transport them and their food supply communication was also greatly improved with the invention of the telegraph telephone radio and television the late th and early th centuries saw a revolution in transportation with the invention of the airplane and automobile f and f flying over kuwaiti oil fires during the gulf war in  the th century brought a host of innovations in physics the discovery of nuclear fission has led to both nuclear weapons and nuclear power computers were also invented and later miniaturized utilizing transistors and integrated circuits information technology subsequently led to the creation of the internet which ushered in the current information age humans have also been able to explore space with satellites later used for telecommunication and in manned missions going all the way to the moon in medicine this era brought innovations such as openheart surgery and later stem cell therapy along with new medications and treatments complex manufacturing and construction techniques and organizations are needed to make and maintain these new technologies and entire industries have arisen to support and develop succeeding generations of increasingly more complex tools modern technology increasingly relies on training and education – their designers builders maintainers and users often require sophisticated general and specific training moreover these technologies have become so complex that entire fields have been created to support them including engineering medicine and computer science and other fields have been made more complex such as construction transportation and architecture philosophy technicism generally technicism is the belief in the utility of technology for improving human societies taken to an extreme technicism reflects a fundamental attitude which seeks to control reality to resolve all problems with the use of scientifictechnological methods and tools in other words human beings will someday be able to master all problems and possibly even control the future using technology some such as stephen v monsma connect these ideas to the abdication of religion as a higher moral authority optimism see also extropianism optimistic assumptions are made by proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and singularitarianism which view technological development as generally having beneficial effects for the society and the human condition in these ideologies technological development is morally good transhumanists generally believe that the point of technology is to overcome barriers and that what we commonly refer to as the human condition is just another barrier to be surpassed singularitarians believe in some sort of accelerating change that the rate of technological progress accelerates as we obtain more technology and that this will culminate in a singularity after artificial general intelligence is invented in which progress is nearly infinite hence the term estimates for the date of this singularity vary but prominent futurist ray kurzweil estimates the singularity will occur in  kurzweil is also known for his history of the universe in six epochs  the physicalchemical epoch  the life epoch  the humanbrain epoch  the technology epoch  the artificial intelligence epoch and  the universal colonization epoch going from one epoch to the next is a singularity in its own right and a period of speeding up precedes it each epoch takes a shorter time which means the whole history of the universe is one giant singularity event some critics see these ideologies as examples of scientism and technoutopianism and fear the notion of human enhancement and technological singularity which they support some have described karl marx as a technooptimist skepticism and critics see also luddite neoluddism anarchoprimitivism and bioconservatism luddites smashing a power loom in  on the somewhat skeptical side are certain philosophers like herbert marcuse and john zerzan who believe that technological societies are inherently flawed they suggest that the inevitable result of such a society is to become evermore technological at the cost of freedom and psychological health many such as the luddites and prominent philosopher martin heidegger hold serious although not entirely deterministic reservations about technology see the question concerning technology according to heidegger scholars hubert dreyfus and charles spinosa heidegger does not oppose technology he hopes to reveal the essence of technology in a way that in no way confines us to a stultified compulsion to push on blindly with technology or what comes to the same thing to rebel helplessly against it indeed he promises that when we once open ourselves expressly to the essence of technology we find ourselves unexpectedly taken into a freeing claim what this entails is a more complex relationship to technology than either technooptimists or technopessimists tend to allow some of the most poignant criticisms of technology are found in what are now considered to be dystopian literary classics such as aldous huxleys brave new world anthony burgesss a clockwork orange and george orwells nineteen eightyfour in goethes faust faust selling his soul to the devil in return for power over the physical world is also often interpreted as a metaphor for the adoption of industrial technology more recently modern works of science fiction such as those by philip k dick and william gibson and films such as blade runner and ghost in the shell project highly ambivalent or cautionary attitudes toward technologys impact on human society and identity the late cultural critic neil postman distinguished toolusing societies from technological societies and from what he called technopolies societies that are dominated by the ideology of technological and scientific progress to the exclusion or harm of other cultural practices values and worldviews darin barney has written about technologys impact on practices of citizenship and democratic culture suggesting that technology can be construed as  an object of political debate  a means or medium of discussion and  a setting for democratic deliberation and citizenship as a setting for democratic culture barney suggests that technology tends to make ethical questions including the question of what a good life consists in nearly impossible because they already give an answer to the question a good life is one that includes the use of more and more technology nikolas kompridis has also written about the dangers of new technology such as genetic engineering nanotechnology synthetic biology and robotics he warns that these technologies introduce unprecedented new challenges to human beings including the possibility of the permanent alteration of our biological nature these concerns are shared by other philosophers scientists and public intellectuals who have written about similar issues eg francis fukuyama jürgen habermas william joy and michael sandel another prominent critic of technology is hubert dreyfus who has published books such as on the internet and what computers still cant do a more infamous antitechnological treatise is industrial society and its future written by the unabomber ted kaczynski and printed in several major newspapers and later books as part of an effort to end his bombing campaign of the technoindustrial infrastructure appropriate technology see also technocriticism and technorealism the notion of appropriate technology was developed in the th century by thinkers such as e f schumacher and jacques ellul to describe situations where it was not desirable to use very new technologies or those that required access to some centralized infrastructure or parts or skills imported from elsewhere the ecovillage movement emerged in part due to this concern optimism and skepticism in the st century this section mainly focuses on american concerns even if it can reasonably be generalized to other western countries the inadequate quantity and quality of american jobs is one of the most fundamental economic challenges we face  whats the linkage between technology and this fundamental problem — bernstein jared it’s not a skills gap that’s holding wages down it’s the weak economy among other things in the american prospect october  in his article jared bernstein a senior fellow at the center on budget and policy priorities questions the widespread idea that automation and more broadly technological advances have mainly contributed to this growing labor market problem his thesis appears to be a third way between optimism and skepticism essentially he stands for a neutral approach of the linkage between technology and american issues concerning unemployment and declining wages he uses two main arguments to defend his point first because of recent technological advances an increasing number of workers are losing their jobs yet scientific evidence fails to clearly demonstrate that technology has displaced so many workers that it has created more problems than it has solved indeed automation threatens repetitive jobs but higherend jobs are still necessary because they complement technology and manual jobs that requires flexibility judgment and common sense remain hard to replace with machines second studies have not shown clear links between recent technology advances and the wage trends of the last decades therefore according to bernstein instead of focusing on technology and its hypothetical influences on current american increasing unemployment and declining wages one needs to worry more about bad policy that fails to offset the imbalances in demand trade income and opportunity complex technological systems thomas p hughes stated that because technology has been considered as a key way to solve problems we need to be aware of its complex and varied characters to use it more efficiently what is the difference between a wheel or a compass and cooking machines such as an oven or a gas stove can we consider all of them only a part of them or none of them as technologies technology is often considered too narrowly according to hughes technology is a creative process involving human ingenuity this definitions emphasis on creativity avoids unbounded definitions that may mistakenly include cooking “technologies but it also highlights the prominent role of humans and therefore their responsibilities for the use of complex technological systems yet because technology is everywhere and has dramatically changed landscapes and societies hughes argues that engineers scientists and managers have often believed that they can use technology to shape the world as they want they have often supposed that technology is easily controllable and this assumption has to be thoroughly questioned for instance evgeny morozov particularly challenges two concepts “internetcentrism” and “solutionism internetcentrism refers to the idea that our society is convinced that the internet is one of the most stable and coherent forces solutionism is the ideology that every social issue can be solved thanks to technology and especially thanks to the internet in fact technology intrinsically contains uncertainties and limitations according to alexis madrigals review of morozovs theory to ignore it will lead to “unexpected consequences that could eventually cause more damage than the problems they seek to address benjamin r cohen and gwen ottinger also discussed the multivalent effects of technology therefore recognition of the limitations of technology and more broadly scientific knowledge is needed – especially in cases dealing with environmental justice and health issues ottinger continues this reasoning and argues that the ongoing recognition of the limitations of scientific knowledge goes hand in hand with scientists and engineers’ new comprehension of their role such an approach of technology and science require technical professionals to conceive of their roles in the process differently they have to consider themselves as collaborators in research and problem solving rather than simply providers of information and technical solutions competitiveness technology is properly defined as any application of science to accomplish a function the science can be leading edge or well established and the function can have high visibility or be significantly more mundane but it is all technology and its exploitation is the foundation of all competitive advantage technologybased planning is what was used to build the us industrial giants before wwii eg dow dupont gm and it is what was used to transform the us into a superpower it was not economicbased planning other animal species see also tool use by animals structures built by animals and ecosystem engineer this adult gorilla uses a branch as a walking stick to gauge the waters depth an example of technology usage by nonhuman primates the use of basic technology is also a feature of other animal species apart from humans these include primates such as chimpanzees some dolphin communities and crows considering a more generic perspective of technology as ethology of active environmental conditioning and control we can also refer to animal examples such as beavers and their dams or bees and their honeycombs the ability to make and use tools was once considered a defining characteristic of the genus homo however the discovery of tool construction among chimpanzees and related primates has discarded the notion of the use of technology as unique to humans for example researchers have observed wild chimpanzees utilising tools for foraging some of the tools used include leaf sponges termite fishing probes pestles and levers west african chimpanzees also use stone hammers and anvils for cracking nuts as do capuchin monkeys of boa vista brazil future technology main article emerging technologies theories of technology often attempt to predict the future of technology based on the high technology and science of the time as with all predictions of the future however technologys is uncertain futurist ray kurzweil predicts that the future of technology will be mainly consist of an overlapping gnr revolution of genetics nanotechnology and robotics with robotics being the most important of the three see

the use and knowledge of techniques and processes for producing goods and services for other uses see technology disambiguation a steam turbine with the case opened such turbines produce most of the electricity that people use electricity consumption and living standards are highly correlated electrification is believed to be the most important engineering achievement of the th century technology science of craft from greek τέχνη techne art skill cunning of hand and λογία logia is the collection of techniques skills methods and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives such as scientific investigation technology can be the knowledge of techniques processes and the like or it can be embedded in machines which can be operated without detailed knowledge of their workings the simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools the prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later neolithic revolution increased the available sources of food and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment developments in historic times including the printing press the telephone and the internet have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale the steady progress of military technology has brought weapons of everincreasing destructive power from clubs to nuclear weapons technology has many effects it has helped develop more advanced economies including todays global economy and has allowed the rise of a leisure class many technological processes produce unwanted byproducts known as pollution and deplete natural resources to the detriment of earths environment innovations have always influenced the values of a society and raised new questions of the ethics of technology examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity and the challenges of bioethics philosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it neoluddism anarchoprimitivism and similar reactionary movements criticise the pervasiveness of technology arguing that it harms the environment and alienates people proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and technoprogressivism view continued

definition and usage the spread of paper and printing to the west as in this printing press helped scientists and politicians communicate their ideas easily leading to the age of enlightenment an example of technology as cultural force the use of the term technology has changed significantly over the last  years before the th century the term was uncommon in english and usually referred to the description or study of the useful arts the term was often connected to technical education as in the massachusetts institute of technology chartered in  the term technology rose to prominence in the th century in connection with the second industrial revolution the terms meanings changed in the early th century when american social scientists beginning with thorstein veblen translated ideas from the german concept of technik into technology in german and other european languages a distinction exists between technik and technologie that is absent in english which usually translates both terms as technology by the s technology referred not only to the study of the industrial arts but to the industrial arts themselves in  the american sociologist read bain wrote that technology includes all tools machines utensils weapons instruments housing clothing communicating and transporting devices and the skills by which we produce and use them bains definition remains common among scholars today especially social scientists scientists and engineers usually prefer to define technology as applied science rather than as the things that people make and use more recently scholars have borrowed from european philosophers of technique to extend the meaning of technology to various forms of instrumental reason as in foucaults work on technologies of the self techniques de soi dictionaries and scholars have offered a variety of definitions the merriamwebster learners dictionary offers a definition of the term the use of science in industry engineering etc to invent useful things or to solve problems and a machine piece of equipment method etc that is created by technology ursula franklin in her  real world of technology lecture gave another definition of the concept it is practice the way we do things around here the term is often used to imply a specific field of technology or to refer to high technology or just consumer electronics rather than technology as a whole bernard stiegler in technics and time  defines technology in two ways as the pursuit of life by means other than life and as organized inorganic matter technology can be most broadly defined as the entities both material and immaterial created by the application of mental and physical effort in order to achieve some value in this usage technology refers to tools and machines that may be used to solve realworld problems it is a farreaching term that may include simple tools such as a crowbar or wooden spoon or more complex machines such as a space station or particle accelerator tools and machines need not be material virtual technology such as computer software and business methods fall under this definition of technology w brian arthur defines technology in a similarly broad way as a means to fulfill a human purpose the word technology can also be used to refer to a collection of techniques in this context it is the current state of humanitys knowledge of how to combine resources to produce desired products to solve problems fulfill needs or satisfy wants it includes technical methods skills processes techniques tools and raw materials when combined with another term such as medical technology or space technology it refers to the state of the respective fields knowledge and tools stateoftheart technology refers to the high technology available to humanity in any field the invention of integrated circuits and the microprocessor here an intel  chip from  led to the modern computer revolution technology can be viewed as an activity that forms or changes culture additionally technology is the application of math science and the arts for the benefit of life as it is known a modern example is the rise of communication technology which has lessened barriers to human interaction and as a result has helped spawn new subcultures the rise of cyberculture has at its basis the development of the internet and the computer not all technology enhances culture in a creative way technology can also help facilitate political oppression and war via tools such as guns as a cultural activity technology predates both science and engineering each of which formalize some aspects of technological endeavor science engineering and technology antoine lavoisier conducting an experiment with combustion generated by amplified sun light the distinction between science engineering and technology is not always clear science is systematic knowledge of the physical or material world gained through observation and experimentation technologies are not usually exclusively products of science because they have to satisfy requirements such as utility usability and safety engineering is the goaloriented process of designing and making tools and systems to exploit natural phenomena for practical human means often but not always using results and techniques from science the development of technology may draw upon many fields of knowledge including scientific engineering mathematical linguistic and historical knowledge to achieve some practical result technology is often a consequence of science and engineering although technology as a human activity precedes the two fields for example science might study the flow of electrons in electrical conductors by using alreadyexisting tools and knowledge this newfound knowledge may then be used by engineers to create new tools and machines such as semiconductors computers and other forms of advanced technology in this sense scientists and engineers may both be considered technologists the three fields are often considered as one for the purposes of research and reference the exact relations between science and technology in particular have been debated by scientists historians and policymakers in the late th century in part because the debate can inform the funding of basic and applied science in the immediate wake of world war ii for example it was widely considered in the united states that technology was simply applied science and that to fund basic science was to reap technological results in due time an articulation of this philosophy could be found explicitly in vannevar bushs treatise on postwar science policy science – the endless frontier new products new industries and more jobs require continuous additions to knowledge of the laws of nature  this essential new knowledge can be obtained only through basic scientific research in the lates however this view came under direct attack leading towards initiatives to fund science for specific tasks initiatives resisted by the scientific community the issue remains contentious though most analysts resist the model that technology simply is a result of scientific research history main articles history of technology timeline of historic inventions and timeline of electrical and electronic engineering paleolithic  ma –  ka a primitive chopper further information outline of prehistoric technology the use of tools by early humans was partly a process of discovery and of evolution early humans evolved from a species of foraging hominids which were already bipedal with a brain mass approximately one third of modern humans tool use remained relatively unchanged for most of early human history approximately  years ago the use of tools and complex set of behaviors emerged believed by many archaeologists to be connected to the emergence of fully modern language stone tools hand axes from the acheulian period a clovis point made via pressure flaking hominids started using primitive stone tools millions of years ago the earliest stone tools were little more than a fractured rock but approximately  years ago pressure flaking provided a way to make much finer work fire main article control of fire by early humans the discovery and utilization of fire a simple energy source with many profound uses was a turning point in the technological evolution of humankind the exact date of its discovery is not known evidence of burnt animal bones at the cradle of humankind suggests that the domestication of fire occurred before  ma scholarly consensus indicates that homo erectus had controlled fire by between  and  ka fire fueled with wood and charcoal allowed early humans to cook their food to increase its digestibility improving its nutrient value and broadening the number of foods that could be eaten clothing and shelter other technological advances made during the paleolithic era were clothing and shelter the adoption of both technologies cannot be dated exactly but they were a key to humanitys progress as the paleolithic era progressed dwellings became more sophisticated and more elaborate as early as  ka humans were constructing temporary wood huts clothing adapted from the fur and hides of hunted animals helped humanity expand into colder regions humans began to migrate out of africa by  ka and into other continents such as eurasia neolithic through classical antiquity  ka –  ce an array of neolithic artifacts including bracelets axe heads chisels and polishing tools humans technological ascent began in earnest in what is known as the neolithic period new stone age the invention of polished stone axes was a major advance that allowed forest clearance on a large scale to create farms this use of polished stone axes increased greatly in the neolithic but were originally used in the preceding mesolithic in some areas such as ireland agriculture fed larger populations and the transition to sedentism allowed simultaneously raising more children as infants no longer needed to be carried as nomadic ones must additionally children could contribute labor to the raising of crops more readily than they could to the huntergatherer economy with this increase in population and availability of labor came an increase in labor specialization what triggered the progression from early neolithic villages to the first cities such as uruk and the first civilizations such as sumer is not specifically known however the emergence of increasingly hierarchical social structures and specialized labor of trade and war amongst adjacent cultures and the need for collective action to overcome environmental challenges such as irrigation are all thought to have played a role metal tools continuing improvements led to the furnace and bellows and provided the ability to smelt and forge native metals naturally occurring in relatively pure form gold copper silver and lead were such early metals the advantages of copper tools over stone bone and wooden tools were quickly apparent to early humans and native copper was probably used from near the beginning of neolithic times about  ka native copper does not naturally occur in large amounts but copper ores are quite common and some of them produce metal easily when burned in wood or charcoal fires eventually the working of metals led to the discovery of alloys such as bronze and brass about  bce the first uses of iron alloys such as steel dates to around  bce energy and transport the wheel was invented circa  bce main article history of transport meanwhile humans were learning to harness other forms of energy the earliest known use of wind power is the sailboat the earliest record of a ship under sail is that of a nile boat that dates back to the th millennium bce from prehistoric times egyptians probably used the power of the annual flooding of the nile to irrigate their lands gradually learning to regulate much of it through purposely built irrigation channels and catch basins similarly the early peoples of mesopotamia the sumerians learned to use the tigris and euphrates rivers for much the same purposes however more extensive use of wind and water and even human power required another invention according to archaeologists the wheel was invented around  bce probably independently and nearly simultaneously in mesopotamia in presentday iraq the northern caucasus maykop culture and central europe estimates on when this may have occurred range from  to  bce with most experts putting it closer to  bce the oldest artifacts with drawings that depict wheeled carts date from about  bce however the wheel may have been in use for millennia before these drawings were made there is also evidence from the same period for the use of the potters wheel more recently the oldestknown wooden wheel in the world was found in the ljubljana marshes of slovenia the invention of the wheel revolutionized trade and war it did not take long to discover that wheeled wagons could be used to carry heavy loads fast rotary potters wheels enabled early mass production of pottery but it was the use of the wheel as a transformer of energy through water wheels windmills and even treadmills that revolutionized the application of nonhuman power sources medieval and modern history  ce – present main articles medieval technology renaissance technology industrial revolution second industrial revolution information technology and productivity improving technologies economic history innovations continued through the middle ages with innovations such as silk the horse collar and horseshoes in the first few hundred years after the fall of the roman empire medieval technology saw the use of simple machines such as the lever the screw and the pulley being combined to form more complicated tools such as the wheelbarrow windmills and clocks the renaissance brought forth many of these innovations including the printing press which facilitated the greater communication of knowledge and technology became increasingly associated with science beginning a cycle of mutual advancement the advancements in technology in this era allowed a more steady supply of food followed by the wider availability of consumer goods the automobile revolutionized personal transportation starting in the united kingdom in the th century the industrial revolution was a period of great technological discovery particularly in the areas of agriculture manufacturing mining metallurgy and transport driven by the discovery of steam power technology took another step in a second industrial revolution with the harnessing of electricity to create such innovations as the electric motor light bulb and countless others scientific advancement and the discovery of new concepts later allowed for powered flight and advancements in medicine chemistry physics and engineering the rise in technology has led to skyscrapers and broad urban areas whose inhabitants rely on motors to transport them and their food supply communication was also greatly improved with the invention of the telegraph telephone radio and television the late th and early th centuries saw a revolution in transportation with the invention of the airplane and automobile f and f flying over kuwaiti oil fires during the gulf war in  the th century brought a host of innovations in physics the discovery of nuclear fission has led to both nuclear weapons and nuclear power computers were also invented and later miniaturized utilizing transistors and integrated circuits information technology subsequently led to the creation of the internet which ushered in the current information age humans have also been able to explore space with satellites later used for telecommunication and in manned missions going all the way to the moon in medicine this era brought innovations such as openheart surgery and later stem cell therapy along with new medications and treatments complex manufacturing and construction techniques and organizations are needed to make and maintain these new technologies and entire industries have arisen to support and develop succeeding generations of increasingly more complex tools modern technology increasingly relies on training and education – their designers builders maintainers and users often require sophisticated general and specific training moreover these technologies have become so complex that entire fields have been created to support them including engineering medicine and computer science and other fields have been made more complex such as construction transportation and architecture philosophy technicism generally technicism is the belief in the utility of technology for improving human societies taken to an extreme technicism reflects a fundamental attitude which seeks to control reality to resolve all problems with the use of scientifictechnological methods and tools in other words human beings will someday be able to master all problems and possibly even control the future using technology some such as stephen v monsma connect these ideas to the abdication of religion as a higher moral authority optimism see also extropianism optimistic assumptions are made by proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and singularitarianism which view technological development as generally having beneficial effects for the society and the human condition in these ideologies technological development is morally good transhumanists generally believe that the point of technology is to overcome barriers and that what we commonly refer to as the human condition is just another barrier to be surpassed singularitarians believe in some sort of accelerating change that the rate of technological progress accelerates as we obtain more technology and that this will culminate in a singularity after artificial general intelligence is invented in which progress is nearly infinite hence the term estimates for the date of this singularity vary but prominent futurist ray kurzweil estimates the singularity will occur in  kurzweil is also known for his history of the universe in six epochs  the physicalchemical epoch  the life epoch  the humanbrain epoch  the technology epoch  the artificial intelligence epoch and  the universal colonization epoch going from one epoch to the next is a singularity in its own right and a period of speeding up precedes it each epoch takes a shorter time which means the whole history of the universe is one giant singularity event some critics see these ideologies as examples of scientism and technoutopianism and fear the notion of human enhancement and technological singularity which they support some have described karl marx as a technooptimist skepticism and critics see also luddite neoluddism anarchoprimitivism and bioconservatism luddites smashing a power loom in  on the somewhat skeptical side are certain philosophers like herbert marcuse and john zerzan who believe that technological societies are inherently flawed they suggest that the inevitable result of such a society is to become evermore technological at the cost of freedom and psychological health many such as the luddites and prominent philosopher martin heidegger hold serious although not entirely deterministic reservations about technology see the question concerning technology according to heidegger scholars hubert dreyfus and charles spinosa heidegger does not oppose technology he hopes to reveal the essence of technology in a way that in no way confines us to a stultified compulsion to push on blindly with technology or what comes to the same thing to rebel helplessly against it indeed he promises that when we once open ourselves expressly to the essence of technology we find ourselves unexpectedly taken into a freeing claim what this entails is a more complex relationship to technology than either technooptimists or technopessimists tend to allow some of the most poignant criticisms of technology are found in what are now considered to be dystopian literary classics such as aldous huxleys brave new world anthony burgesss a clockwork orange and george orwells nineteen eightyfour in goethes faust faust selling his soul to the devil in return for power over the physical world is also often interpreted as a metaphor for the adoption of industrial technology more recently modern works of science fiction such as those by philip k dick and william gibson and films such as blade runner and ghost in the shell project highly ambivalent or cautionary attitudes toward technologys impact on human society and identity the late cultural critic neil postman distinguished toolusing societies from technological societies and from what he called technopolies societies that are dominated by the ideology of technological and scientific progress to the exclusion or harm of other cultural practices values and worldviews darin barney has written about technologys impact on practices of citizenship and democratic culture suggesting that technology can be construed as  an object of political debate  a means or medium of discussion and  a setting for democratic deliberation and citizenship as a setting for democratic culture barney suggests that technology tends to make ethical questions including the question of what a good life consists in nearly impossible because they already give an answer to the question a good life is one that includes the use of more and more technology nikolas kompridis has also written about the dangers of new technology such as genetic engineering nanotechnology synthetic biology and robotics he warns that these technologies introduce unprecedented new challenges to human beings including the possibility of the permanent alteration of our biological nature these concerns are shared by other philosophers scientists and public intellectuals who have written about similar issues eg francis fukuyama jürgen habermas william joy and michael sandel another prominent critic of technology is hubert dreyfus who has published books such as on the internet and what computers still cant do a more infamous antitechnological treatise is industrial society and its future written by the unabomber ted kaczynski and printed in several major newspapers and later books as part of an effort to end his bombing campaign of the technoindustrial infrastructure appropriate technology see also technocriticism and technorealism the notion of appropriate technology was developed in the th century by thinkers such as e f schumacher and jacques ellul to describe situations where it was not desirable to use very new technologies or those that required access to some centralized infrastructure or parts or skills imported from elsewhere the ecovillage movement emerged in part due to this concern optimism and skepticism in the st century this section mainly focuses on american concerns even if it can reasonably be generalized to other western countries the inadequate quantity and quality of american jobs is one of the most fundamental economic challenges we face  whats the linkage between technology and this fundamental problem — bernstein jared it’s not a skills gap that’s holding wages down it’s the weak economy among other things in the american prospect october  in his article jared bernstein a senior fellow at the center on budget and policy priorities questions the widespread idea that automation and more broadly technological advances have mainly contributed to this growing labor market problem his thesis appears to be a third way between optimism and skepticism essentially he stands for a neutral approach of the linkage between technology and american issues concerning unemployment and declining wages he uses two main arguments to defend his point first because of recent technological advances an increasing number of workers are losing their jobs yet scientific evidence fails to clearly demonstrate that technology has displaced so many workers that it has created more problems than it has solved indeed automation threatens repetitive jobs but higherend jobs are still necessary because they complement technology and manual jobs that requires flexibility judgment and common sense remain hard to replace with machines second studies have not shown clear links between recent technology advances and the wage trends of the last decades therefore according to bernstein instead of focusing on technology and its hypothetical influences on current american increasing unemployment and declining wages one needs to worry more about bad policy that fails to offset the imbalances in demand trade income and opportunity complex technological systems thomas p hughes stated that because technology has been considered as a key way to solve problems we need to be aware of its complex and varied characters to use it more efficiently what is the difference between a wheel or a compass and cooking machines such as an oven or a gas stove can we consider all of them only a part of them or none of them as technologies technology is often considered too narrowly according to hughes technology is a creative process involving human ingenuity this definitions emphasis on creativity avoids unbounded definitions that may mistakenly include cooking “technologies but it also highlights the prominent role of humans and therefore their responsibilities for the use of complex technological systems yet because technology is everywhere and has dramatically changed landscapes and societies hughes argues that engineers scientists and managers have often believed that they can use technology to shape the world as they want they have often supposed that technology is easily controllable and this assumption has to be thoroughly questioned for instance evgeny morozov particularly challenges two concepts “internetcentrism” and “solutionism internetcentrism refers to the idea that our society is convinced that the internet is one of the most stable and coherent forces solutionism is the ideology that every social issue can be solved thanks to technology and especially thanks to the internet in fact technology intrinsically contains uncertainties and limitations according to alexis madrigals review of morozovs theory to ignore it will lead to “unexpected consequences that could eventually cause more damage than the problems they seek to address benjamin r cohen and gwen ottinger also discussed the multivalent effects of technology therefore recognition of the limitations of technology and more broadly scientific knowledge is needed – especially in cases dealing with environmental justice and health issues ottinger continues this reasoning and argues that the ongoing recognition of the limitations of scientific knowledge goes hand in hand with scientists and engineers’ new comprehension of their role such an approach of technology and science require technical professionals to conceive of their roles in the process differently they have to consider themselves as collaborators in research and problem solving rather than simply providers of information and technical solutions competitiveness technology is properly defined as any application of science to accomplish a function the science can be leading edge or well established and the function can have high visibility or be significantly more mundane but it is all technology and its exploitation is the foundation of all competitive advantage technologybased planning is what was used to build the us industrial giants before wwii eg dow dupont gm and it is what was used to transform the us into a superpower it was not economicbased planning other animal species see also tool use by animals structures built by animals and ecosystem engineer this adult gorilla uses a branch as a walking stick to gauge the waters depth an example of technology usage by nonhuman primates the use of basic technology is also a feature of other animal species apart from humans these include primates such as chimpanzees some dolphin communities and crows considering a more generic perspective of technology as ethology of active environmental conditioning and control we can also refer to animal examples such as beavers and their dams or bees and their honeycombs the ability to make and use tools was once considered a defining characteristic of the genus homo however the discovery of tool construction among chimpanzees and related primates has discarded the notion of the use of technology as unique to humans for example researchers have observed wild chimpanzees utilising tools for foraging some of the tools used include leaf sponges termite fishing probes pestles and levers west african chimpanzees also use stone hammers and anvils for cracking nuts as do capuchin monkeys of boa vista brazil future technology main article emerging technologies theories of technology often attempt to predict the future of technology based on the high technology and science of the time as with all predictions of the future however technologys is uncertain futurist ray kurzweil predicts that the future of technology will be mainly consist of an overlapping gnr revolution of genetics nanotechnology and robotics with robotics being the most important of the three see
