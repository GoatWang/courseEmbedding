take a slice of the market after all for some suggestions on where to spend your money read top tech for your bucktutorial budgeting basics microsoft zune vs apple ipodthe apple ipod changed how we think about music the ipod is a line of portable media players created and marketed by apple that was launched in  and has seen numerous reinventions since the initial models unbelievably this was only  years ago but since then the ipod has been the must have gadget unsurprisingly microsoft wanted a piece of this market and thus launched the zune in  – its take on a portable media device microsoft was entering an area utterly dominated by apple and although the zune was deemed a good product overall it did not hold a candle to the established and fashionable ipod at the time of its launch shawny chen a research analyst for current analysis said that in order to become a serious contender against apple microsoft would have to make further adjustments to the zune especially considering the number of unfavorable reviews the device had already received current analysis was right and the zune never managed to take hold of the market zunes market share decreased to  in the first half of  according to the npd group finally just last month microsoft announced that it is pulling the plug on the zune and is encouraging users to transition to windows phone with the zune gone consumers still have many options for music players yet ipods reign continues android vs iphonewhen apple launched its first iphone in the summer of  google answered back with its mobile os android within two years and there started a long war between the two giants over the global smartphone market steve jobs famously claimed that googles android platform was a wholesale ripoff of the iphone and he was willing to go thermo –nuclear war on them over the matter ever since there have been endless debates and discussions about whether android has taken the market share from apple of course the debate is flawed because you cannot compare android to an iphone one is an operating system and one is a hardware device currently there are six major manufacturers dell htc kyocera lg motorola and samsung making about  smartphones and growing using the android operating system in addition due to the open source nature of androids source code many other smaller manufacturers are using it on their device as well by comparing all android operating systems with the iphone research company canalys estimated that in the second quarter of  android had a  share of worldwide smartphone shipments

which boasted twice the storage capacity of amazons newly announced kindle fire tablet and also had a memory card slot for expandability barnes  noble have had some success taking on the ebook market

mac operating system compared to microsofts windows did windows copy macs os x with their windows  product microsoft rebutted the suggestion that it based the look and feel of windows  on the apple mac os last year a microsoft manager slipped and said that what his company had tried to do with windows  was create a mac look and feel in terms of graphics microsoft quickly retracted this comment if microsoft has tried to copy os x then reviews suggest that windows hasnt fully succeeded windows  has not addressed the security issues the interface is not as intuitive as macs os x boots up much faster and the list goes on windows computers still have much to offer one of the big things they offer is choice consumers are given the opportunity to spend their hardearned dollars on a machine
