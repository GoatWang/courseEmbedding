the community faculty  staff centennial campaign for ucla university news gift of  million serves as capstone of ucla school of laws  million campaign lauri gavel  august   ucla school of law has received a transformative  million gift — the largest single gift in the schools history — enabling the law school to meet and exceed its ambitious  million fundraising goal well ahead of its original fiveyear schedule the campaign for ucla school of law was publicly launched in  to increase private resources for student scholarships to attract and retain faculty and to support centers and institutes that inform law and public policy the  million gift from  public service alumnus of the year lowell milken  a leading philanthropist and pioneer in education reform establishes the lowell milken institute for business law and policy the institutes creation is the culmination of a threeyear process of exploration initiated by ucla law leadership with milken to develop initiatives in business and law that will serve students faculty and the greater community through innovative research handson skills training and realworld problemsolving ucla school of law dean rachel f moran noted that the lowell milken institute will draw on the schools existing strengths in business law and policy including its premier faculty and outstanding students as well as its long tradition of interdisciplinary collaborations in line with the goals of the campaign for ucla law lowells generosity will enable us to initiate a range of curricular innovations further critical research and provide financial support for students who will become our nations future leaders in business law and policy moran said an expanded curriculum and enhanced training in realworld transactional skills will aid not only students but the broader legal and business communities she added the gift serves as the capstone of the law schools recordbreaking campaign which in addition to the lowell milken institute for business law and policy led to the creation of the david j epstein program in public interest law and policy the emmett center on climate change and the environment the williams institute on sexual orientation law and public policy which had previously been a program the michael t masin scholars fund and the stewart and lynda resnick endowed fund in support of public interest law the campaign also funded the schools a barry cappello courtroom the bruce h spector conference room and the bernard a and lenore s greenberg endowed law review fellow fund according to moran private philanthropy throughout the campaign more than doubled the number of endowed chairs at the law school including four chairs endowed by longtime supporters ralph  and shirley shapiro and ucla school of law had the highest rate of growth in alumni giving of any top  law school as participation rates soared to more than  percent key to this success was the law firm challenge which broke new records every year under the leadership of its founding chair james d c barrall  as well as the recently created reunion challenge as our record growth in giving demonstrates our alumni have rallied together in unprecedented numbers under the leadership of campaign chairman ken ziffren  and a team of dedicated volunteer leaders moran said theyve demonstrated their commitment to ucla school of laws longstanding traditions of excellence innovation access and service this critical campaign and the transformative gift from lowell milken show that our students alumni and friends share the vision and values that define us as a great public law school and their ongoing support will help us to overcome the often dour predictions prompted by the state and national budget crisis private philanthropy is vital to preserving the longstanding tradition of serving the community and the greater good a commitment integral to the mission of both the law school and the ucla campus  this generous gift will deepen ucla laws already strong impact on the vibrant los angeles legal and business communities and help prepare students with the training they need to meet the challenges of todays global and entrepreneurial economy said ucla chancellor gene block through groundbreaking research as well as symposia and conferences the lowell milken institute will facilitate the kind of sustained dialogue with policymakers and practitioners that is uclas hallmark as a public university alumni and philanthropists increasingly are recognizing this imperative at a time when our states great universities are under significant financial pressure and constraints it is incumbent upon those of us who benefited greatly from our educational experiences within the uc system to help support the outstanding work of these universities said milken who graduated phi beta kappa and summa cum laude from the university of california berkeley where he received the school of business administrations most outstanding student award at ucla school of law he earned his degree with the distinction of order of the coif and ucla law review as chairman and cofounder of the milken family foundation lowell milkens dedication to education reform has been informed by more than three decades of education research policy and practice as well as firsthand visits to thousands of classrooms milken created the milken educator awards in  the nations most prominent teacherrecognition program in  he founded tap™ the system for teacher and student advancement a proven comprehensive school reform now active in  states to attract develop motivate and retain the best talent for the american teaching profession he also was instrumental in the establishment of high tech los angeles a public charter high school that engages students through selfdirected learning collaborative projects and realworld internships an international businessman milken is cofounder of knowledge universe the worlds largest early childhood education company headquartered in singapore knowledge universe operates worldwide with more than  employees milken is also chairman of londonbased heron international a
