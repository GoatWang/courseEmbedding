the s avowed that leblanc controlled a block of rural votes in excess of  enough to swing an election william j bill dodd a friend and sometimes rival of leblancs said that leblanc once addressed a

also fared poorly but he still received more votes than leblanc leblanc used his state senate seat to pass legislation to assist teachers farmers and veterans he also developed the louisiana old age pension originally  a month for people over the age of sixtyfive at one point he was outbidding the longs on how much the state could afford to pay the aged in the  campaign—the election was in january  but most of the voter appeals were made in the fall of —then state representative dodd who himself was running for lieutenant governor on the earl long slate and leblanc who was running for a
