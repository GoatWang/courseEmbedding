journal biographysuzanne vranica vranicawsj suzannevranicawsjcom oct    pm et  comments as media consumption habits change marketers are finding it increasingly challenging to figure out where to put their money – and in particular how much money to spend on traditional media like tv versus online options daryl simm chief executive officer of omnicom group’s media operations is squarely at the center of those discussions his company oversees roughly  billion in advertising spending around the globe and advises advertisers such as pepsico visa mcdonald’s and apple his firm has been advising clients to move  to  of their tv dollars to online video while that could be somewhat alarming for tv networks mr simm said that cable and broadcast networkowners are getting a “significant” portion of that money back since their programming still makes up a large share of the premium online video market mr simm spoke with the wall street journal about why ad dollars are shifting the new pressures advertising holding companies are facing and why the tv ad market isn’t as strong as some suspect it should be here are edited excerpts from the interview wsj are marketers’ beginning to fund digital ad spending with their tv budgets mr simm those budgets come from somewhere they don’t just invent themselves  they don’t come from the abyss they come from the media pot online video ad spending is growing at a considerably faster pace than overall media budgets have been growing  the way we look at it is we have got the tv partnerships that offer full episodes online we have the hulu type places that also offer full episodes of network tv shows and then we have partnerships with the premium video providers of the world such as aol yahoo and youtube so tv money is traveling to all of those other alternatives wsj how much is moving mr simm it varies by client if you are chasing gamers obviously you are moving a disproportionate piece of your budget if you are a conventional packaged goods company you are not quite at the average yet we are counseling our clients to move between  to  of tv dollar to online video depending on the target audience wsj what does that means for tv networks mr simm a significant portion of the dollars are actually going back to tv owners for their online properties we look at delivering against segments of an audience so if you are trying to increase your reach against light tv users the answer is to move a significant part of the video budget to online video we council the client depending on what businesses they are in wsj what has to happen for more money to shift to online video mr simm there is a need for even more premium and relevant content i do think we have hit the apex and we are moving into an environment where there is more talent—actors directors producers and brands–wanting to enter the online video space that holds a lot of promise for online video the amount of quality online video is still an issue wsj the tv ad market remains somewhat lackluster why mr simm i think you are seeing in general a lower degree of urgency among advertisers they want to retain flexibly and if we look at the world today there are more and more options for advertisers there is a lower level of urgency than there once was when advertisers used to say “i need to place these dollars right now because it ad inventory won’t be there later” that is not the case today since there are so many more places to go now  i attribute it more to that than a broad scale reduction in demand wsj what are marketers most concerned with nowadays mr simm i think that we’ve seen a surge in the desire to measure the effects of advertising the desire for more measurement and accountability is getting higher and higher accountability is an interesting subject as marketers try to balance the desire for immediate sales or transactions versus brand building and association what does it mean for a brand to be associated with a particular piece of content and what does that mean for the consideration of that brand by consumers wsj some marketers are becoming disenchanted with the way agency trading desks work and some have moved that function inhouse is this a real threat to ad firms mr simm i got into this business at a big advertiser that did its media inhouse  as the world got more complex and the business requires more resources it just wasn’t a core competency of ours we just didn’t have enough relationships enough partners or enough feet on the ground to get the optimal results that agencies could so when you look at programmatic now i kind of see it as a reflection of that you can learn what programmatic is and the effects of programmatic but if you look at the scale of your organization and the spending you have in the marketplace and the investment in technology that is required in order to support programmatic buying it doesn’t seem like part of the core business for most marketers it’s no more core than having inhouse trucking resources to distribute your product you can’t optimize that   share this advertising aol facebook omnicom group online video yahoo youtube previous gwyneth paltrow
