additional funds necessary to cover such costs to such “victorious” party for purposes hereof the “victorious” party shall be the partnership if the holdback percentage ultimately determined by the arbitrator is closer to the percentage determined in the second holdback vote than it is to the prevailing holdback percentage for the subject partner’s partner category otherwise the subject partner shall be the “victorious” party the party that is not the “victorious” party shall be the “losing” party d in the event of a decrease in a subject partner’s holdback percentage  pursuant to a holdback
