features  functionality    customer support    value for money likelihood to recommend not likely extremely likely pros easy to upload catalog and edit classes report feature works well cons customers cant register for multiple classes overall overall the software works well the catalog upload is easy customers would like to be able to register for multiple classes at one timenot individually we have had a couple of instances where there were glitches in the software that coursestorm was working on that caused registrations to fall through the crack we would have appreciated coursestorm informing its customers that they are working on a problem with the software it was only because we were experiencing a problem that we called customer support to find out that they had known about it already and were working on it great software mar   debbie squezello stratford continuing education  overall    ease of use    features  functionality    customer support    value for money comments course storm has made registering for our enrichment courses easy for both the office and our students there are very little cash deposits to make class lists are a breeze and i love the send an email feature great system would love a few improvements  mar   devon oneal kukis owner cupcakes and lace arts and crafts  employees used the software for  months  overall    ease of use    features  functionality    customer support    value for money likelihood to recommend not likely extremely likely pros ease of use for customer cons items listed on my form in the first page of survey overall we recently switched over to course storm i think about  months ago i love how easyfast it is for parents to sign up their daughter for class i also love how it saved their information making them save time for future class sign ups a few things i would love to see on course storm  the ability to have a customer type in their email twice this would avoid typos of the wrong email address which happens a lot  the ability to have plenty of customized registration forms and not have to use the initial form then add on sometimes certain classes will require a completely different registration form but your system requires the basic form then having to add on i would just like to make different registration forms and name them for classes we do adult classes too and its really hard to use that the way you guys have the forms set up  ability to receive the funds way before a week after the class for small businesses that require purchasing and prepping supplies way ahead of time this is hard to receive the money a week after the class  for promo codescan we please have the option to make a promo code for a certain class otherwise a customer could use the promo code for any and as many as they desire as they like even though we may want a promo code only to be used for a certain class  the ability to add sibling discount codes separate from the promo codes maybe label it as sibling discount code  ability to close a class prior to the day of the class sometimes we need to close class way ahead of day to allow prepping etc would like to be able to set a closing date without having to go in and remember to do so manually for each class recommendations to other buyers see first page we love coursestorm feb   morgan davis community learning coordinator salina public library libraries  employees used the software for  years  overall    ease of use    features  functionality    customer support    value for money likelihood to recommend not likely extremely likely pros we love the coursestorm staff they are not only helpful but friendly and always get back to us so quickly even when we have suggestions for features or software updates they take them seriously and let us know when they have been implemented cons there are some features we would still love to have like a shopping cart but it just doesnt stack up against the wonderful things we love about it overall i chose coursestorm for our lifelong learning program because it has all the features i want and is very affordable we take creditdebit card payments both inhouse and online as well as cash and check payments for class enrollment we can easily process all types of payment in one place and we only pay a percentage of the card payments this makes the software very affordable because the online enrollment process is so much easier and userfriendly for our students we have seen a drastic increase not only in total enrollments but in online enrollments which makes tracking rosters much easier for our staff students can also add themselves to waiting lists of full courses easily so we have a very intuitive process for handling cancellations and enrolling new students refunds are very simple too overall we find the software to be very simple to use both on the staff side and the public side the ease of the enrollment process gives our students a positive experience and encourages them to sign themselves and their friends up for multiple classes if weve ever had an issue or question coursestorm staff has been absolutely wonderful in assisting us quickly we could not be happier
