effectively meet reliability needs restoring payments to local government and preserving jobs top governor cuomo announces dunkirk power plant to share wysiwyggovernor andrew m cuomo today announced a  million agreement has been reached to repower and expand the dunkirk power plant from coal to a  megawatt mw natural gas facility under this agreement the facility which will be in service by fall  will improve the reliability of the electric system and bring lower electric supply costs to consumers the agreement assures the operation of the plant for  years todays announcement is another example of government working for the people governor cuomo said this agreement will result in a larger cleaner power plant at dunkirk that will meet reliability needs reduce costs for consumers create jobs and stabilize the local property tax base thanks to the dunkirk community which brought the information and facts to the table and worked with the state and local governments and the psc staff who directed nrg and national grid to develop a more costeffective project we have arrived at a winwin solution  under this agreement nrg and national grid will agree that three coal units at the facility with a capacity of  mw will be repowered with natural gas currently only one  mw unit is operating on coal the repowering provides an environmental benefit by switching to cleanerburning natural gas and provides critical local system reliability benefits for national grid customers the project will also help relieve transmission bottlenecks in the region and will reduce electricity supply costs to consumers the project also will provide an opportunity to convert the plant to an advanced combined cycle facility if future market conditions warrant the repowering plan will create approximately  construction jobs preserve permanent jobs at the site and restore tax payments to local governments to their previous level of approximately  million annually the plan will approximately double the number of permanent jobs in the proposal endorsed by local labor groups and maintain the existing  jobs at least through mid the terms of the deal must be submitted to the public service commission for final approval senator george maziarz chairman of the senate energy and telecommunications committee said making prudent investments in modernizing our electric generating fleet in new york state is vitally important as we look to protect jobs and local tax bases while strengthening grid reliability and reducing emissions this investment to convert the dunkirk coal plant to natural gas will not only have a positive impact on the local economy but will also serve as a model approach to these issues across our region and our state moving forward i congratulate senator young on her strong advocacy for this project and thank governor cuomo for his leadership in ensuring that the dunkirk repowering plan can move forward senator catharine young said there are tears of joy in dunkirk today the governors announcement that the nrg coal plant will be repowered into a clean natural gas plant is the fantastic news the community has been anxiously awaiting its our christmas miracle nrg is the largest taxpayer in chautauqua county closure of the plant would decimate the tax base and devastate the community repowering the plant is our salvation it stabilizes the tax base saves and grows jobs preserves reliable electricity and gives us cleaner air to breathe we are grateful to governor cuomo for his bipartisan leadership he brought all of the stakeholders together to work out a positive solution our people came together with one voice like never before to advocate for our community we sincerely thank governor cuomo for listening to us dunkirk has been saved and we have a bright future assemblyman andy goodell said governor cuomos support of the nrg project is incredibly important for the city of dunkirk and the county of chautauqua this is the single most important economic development project for our county and governor cuomos commitment moving this project forward will ensure the continued employment at the nrg plant and a longterm stable tax base for the city of dunkirk i look forward to working with governor cuomo on other key economic development projects for this area dunkirk mayor aj dolce said governor cuomo has rescued dunkirk from the brink financial disaster with the announcement that the nrg plant will be allowed to make its multimillion dollar conversion to natural gas i am tremendously excited that  percent of dunkirks budget has been saved thanks to the concerted effort of the community and the leadership of governor cuomo our residents schools businesses and our local workforce will all benefit from this decision todd tranum president and ceo of the chautauqua county chamber of commerce said it took a team effort to save the nrg plant and today that effort is being celebrated with an important victory for the community this project will be the single largest economic development opportunity in chautauqua county in a long time governor cuomos leadership has preserved the tax base given us jobs and allowed the plant to continue to provide electric power generation that is needed throughout new york state david wilkinson business manager for ibew local  said this project will both preserve existing jobs and create new jobs during the construction phase i am proud to be a part of the support group that worked toward this common goal regardless of political or personal differences governor cuomo has brought an important economic victory to the entire community as the local energy provider in western new york for more than a century national grids role is to reliably deliver electricity to our customers at a reasonable cost our goal from the beginning of this process was a balanced outcome and this agreement allows us to deliver electricity to this region at a much much lower cost than earlier electric generation proposals we look forward to continuing to support the local dunkirk community by providing safe reliable power and responsibly managing power costs said ken daly president of national grid new york we are proud of the high performance of our dunkirk employees during this uncertain period and are extremely happy to continue to be part of the

associates issued a study commissioned by the clean air task force a nonprofit research and advocacy organization quantifying the deaths and other health effects attributable to fine particle pollution from coalfired power plants fine particle pollution consists of a complex mixture of soot heavy metals sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides among these particles the most dangerous are those less than  microns in diameter which are so tiny that they can evade the lungs natural defenses enter the bloodstream and be transported to vital organs impacts are especially severe among the elderly children and those with respiratory disease the study found that over  deaths and tens of thousands of cases of chronic bronchitis acute bronchitis asthma congestive heart failure acute myocardial
