investor  with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible  we believe its much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor  be it your banker a friend or a tv pundit  flashratings does not provide advice our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts credible research and opinions the only advice flashratings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions  flashratings favors covering analysts with proven track
