person commenting michael hause  months that scares me he has only sold stock since day can this be a ploy to up according to susquehanna financial lllp analyst sam poser greenberg’s decision to purchase the stock — which he bought via the greenberg family trust — is especially telling since the ceo hasn’t made such a buy in a long time “for context ceo greenberg has not purchased skechers’ stock in at least the last  years” poser wrote in a note today “we believe that insider buying by ceo greenberg is reflective of the strength of the new product offering and the company’s optimism about fy prospects” skechers which has had its share of ups and downs in its year history had been on a hot streak for much of  as it capitalized on casual athletic trends and became a

of the state of nevada susan mardian and leonard mardian appellants vs michael and wendy greenberg family trust respondent no  sep  k  ag cl by clerk appeal from a district court judgment in a deficiency action eighth judicial district court clark county gloria sturman judge reversed hutchison  steffen llc and michael k wall cami m perkins and tanya s gaylord las vegas for appellants fredrickson mazeika  grant and tomas v mazeika and matthew d peterdy las vegas for respondent before the court en banc opinion by the court cherry j this is an appeal from a district court judgment in a real property deficiency action appellants susan and leonard mardian the supreme court of nevada  a pp cc mardians guaranteed a promissory note executed in favor of respondents michael and wendy greenberg family trust greenberg which was secured by land in arizona the documents for the transaction were executed in nevada and contained a nevada choiceoflaw provision after default on the promissory note greenberg filed a complaint in nevada and then initiated a foreclosure sale in arizona nine months later greenberg sought a deficiency judgment on the guaranty through its initially filed complaint the district court found that because the foreclosure was in arizona but the proceedings took place in nevada neither nevadas nor arizonas time limit for seeking a deficiency judgment applied and the deficiency action could proceed we conclude that the district court erred when it found that neither the nevada nor the arizona limitations period applied because of the choiceoflaw provision in the promissory note the contract is governed by nevada law we also conclude that the district court erred when it denied appellants motion to dismiss the complaint as timebarred because the greenbergs did not apply for a judgment within the limitations period under nrs  facts and procedural history in september  joshua tree llc executed a promissory note in the amount of  in favor of respondent michael and wendy greenberg family trust greenberg the note was secured by a deed of trust encumbering  acres of undeveloped real property located in arizona and also by personal guaranties each for the full amount of the note from appellants susan mardian and leonard mardian both guaranties stated that they were governed by nevada law and waived the oneaction rule found in nrs  supreme court of nevada  a e  the parties agree that joshua tree defaulted on the loan and the guaranties were not upheld in march  greenberg filed a complaint against the mardians for breach of contract breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and unjust enrichment greenberg then initiated foreclosure proceedings a month later greenberg purchased the property at auction for  the property was then relisted for sale at  the price was subsequently reduced and at the time this appeal was filed the property had not yet sold in december  the mardians moved the district court to dismiss the underlying complaint for the entire amount due under the promissory note or alternatively for summary judgment because a deficiency application for the balance due on the loan was timebarred greenberg opposed the motion at a hearing the district court determined that it would not apply the limitations period in nrs  because the property was located in arizona and sold pursuant to arizona law not nevada law therefore the district court indicated neither arizonas nor nevadas limitations period applied the court later entered an order denying the mardians motion the mardians again moved for summary judgment in january  which greenberg opposed at the hearing on that motion a different district court judge stated that the problem i have here is that we do have law of the case and we dont know why the prior judge ruled the way that she ruled but its her ruling the district court then entered an order denying summary judgment concluding that the motion for summary judgment was based on the same issues as the mardians previously denied motion supreme court of nevada   a  following a bench trial the district court found that the mardians owed  under the promissory note and that the fair market value of the property at the time of its sale was  thus the court determined that adding interest to the default amount while reducing it by the fair market value of the property resulted in a deficiency totaling  judgment was entered in greenbergs favor for that amount the mardians appealed discussion standard of review the mardians argue that the statute of limitations applies regardless of whether the foreclosure was conducted pursuant to nrs  or pursuant to foreign law greenberg argues that nrs  encompasses only judicial foreclosures under nrs  or nonjudicial foreclosures under nrs  greenberg asserts that because the property was in arizona it could not utilize the nrs  foreclosure process or the nrs chapter  trustees sale process and instead needed to initiate separate proceedings in arizona although a district courts order denying summary judgment is not independently appealable where a party properly raises the issue on appeal from the final judgment this court will review the decision de novo cromer v wilson  nev    pd    summary judgment is proper only if when considering the evidence in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law wood v safeway  nev    pd    supreme court of nevada  ia gv  issues of law including statutory interpretation are also reviewed de novo cromer  nev at   pd at  when a statutes language is unambiguous this court does not resort to the rules of construction and will give that language its plain meaning id this court has a duty to construe statutes as a whole so that all provisions are considered together and to the extent practicable reconciled and harmonized id at   pd at  generally statutes should not be interpreted to render  language meaningless or superfluous in re parental rights as to smmd  nev adv op   pd    internal quotations omitted moreover wle presume that a statute does not modify common law unless such intent is explicitly stated branch banking v windhaven  tollway llc  nev adv op   pd    choiceoflaw provision while the arguments made by the parties focus on nevada law the issue of whether the arizona law should have been applied must also be addressed in this regard greenberg avers that it would not have been appropriate for the district court to apply the arizona limitation period for foreclosures to the personal action commenced in nevada because the guaranties specify that they are governed by nevada law we agree and conclude that because of the choiceoflaw provision nevada law—particularly nevadas limitations period see nrs —applies in this case see key bank of alaska v donnels  nev    pd    concluding that where there was no evidence or argument   regarding bad faith or evasion of nevada law the provision designating alaska law in the promissory note was valid having supreme court of nevada  a e  concluded that nevadas deficiency statutes apply we turn to the parties arguments concerning the deficiency application application of nrs w in this case the mardians are the guarantors of joshua trees promissory note which was held by greenberg and which was secured by the arizona real property although greenberg sued the mardians on their guaranties we have previously held that nevadas deficiency judgment statutes are applicable to actions on guaranty contracts when the underlying note is secured by real property first interstate bank of nev v shields  nev    pd    thus in order to proceed against the mardians on their guaranties greenberg was required to comply with nevadas deficiency statutes we first consider the parties contentions regarding whether nrs  permits deficiency judgments in nevada when the property foreclosed upon was in another state nrs  provides except as otherwise provided in subsection  upon application of the judgment creditor or the beneficiary of the deed of trust within  months after the date of the foreclosure sale or the trustees sale held pursuant to nrs  respectively and after the required hearing the court shall award a deficiency judgment to the judgment creditor or the beneficiary of the deed of trust    the  legislature amended nrs  and related statutes sb  th leg nev  effective oct   this appeal is governed by the preamendment version of nrs  see nrs   and all references herein to nrs  are to the preamendment version supreme court of nevada  a e  nrs  emphasis added nrs  is an antideficiency statute that derogates from the common law and this court construes such provisions narrowly in favor of deficiency judgments branch banking  nev adv op   pd at  internal quotations omitted in branch banking we considered whether nrs  precludes a deficiency judgment when the beneficiary nonjudicially forecloses upon property located in another state and the foreclosure is conducted pursuant to that states laws instead of nrs  id at  in that case a note with a nevada choiceoflaw provision was secured by real property in texas id after default the lender sold the property at a texas nonjudicial foreclosure sale and then sought a deficiency judgment in nevada id we concluded that nrs  does not   preclude  deficiency judgments arising from nonjudicial foreclosure sales held in another state id at  in this case it is unclear whether greenberg proceeded via a judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure sale against the arizona property however the distinction is irrelevant we held in branch banking that a lender who had proceeded via nonjudicial foreclosure in another state could seek a deficiency judgment in nevada under nrs  id we also held in branch banking that the foreclosure sale described in nrs  is a judicial foreclosure and we further held that as in the nonjudicial context nrs  does not contain limiting language precluding deficiency judgments arising from judicial foreclosure sales held in another state id nrs     does not indicate that it precludes deficiency judgments arising from nonjudicial foreclosure sales held in another state accordingly nrs  is not a bar to supreme court of nevada  a e  greenberg seeking a deficiency judgment from the mardians solely because greenberg foreclosed on real property in arizona next we turn to the mardians contention that nrs  required greenberg to file an application for a deficiency judgment within  months after the date of the foreclosure sale we have previously addressed the sixmonth limitation period and what is required of an application for a deficiency judgment in walters v eighth judicial district court  nev adv op   pd   and lavi v eighth judicial district court  nev adv op   pd   in walters we considered the requisite form of a deficiency judgment application under nrs  and held that the motion for summary judgment constituted such an application because it was made in writing set forth in particularity the grounds for the application and set forth the relief sought in accordance with nrcp b  walters  nev adv op   pd at  because the lender filed its motion for summary judgment within six months of the foreclosure we concluded that the lender was not timebarred from seeking a deficiency judgment id nrcp b states that fain application to the court for an order shall be by motion which unless made during a hearing or trial shall be made in writing shall state with particularity the grounds therefore and shall set forth the relief or order sought the requirement of writing is fulfilled if the motion is stated in a written notice of the hearing of the motion supreme court of nevada  a  in lavi a lender filed suit against the guarantor after the borrower defaulted on the loan  nev adv op   pd at  almost one year after the foreclosure sale the lender filed a motion for summary judgment to recover the deficiency id at  the guarantor responded by filing a countermotion for summary judgment arguing that nrs  precluded the lender from any recovery because the lender did not apply for a deficiency judgment within six months of the foreclosure sale id the district court concluded that the lender was not barred from seeking a deficiency judgment because the lender sufficiently notified the guarantor of its intent to pursue a judgment id on appeal we concluded that when the guarantor waived the oneaction rule the lender was allowed to bring an action against the guarantor prior to completing the foreclosure on the secured property but that waiver did not terminate the procedural requirements for asserting that separate action within six months of the foreclosure sale id here the promissory note is governed by nevada law despite the location of the collateral property so greenberg was required to make its application pursuant to nrs  we conclude that it failed to comply with nrs  because it did not apply for a deficiency judgment within six months of the foreclosure sale therefore the district court erred when it denied the mardians motion for summary supreme court of nevada  th   judgment and we reverse both the district courts judgment in favor of greenberg and the district courts order denying the mardians motion for summary judgment  we concur  cj hardesty j —cackasmar parra guirre j j gibbons  we have considered respondents other arguments and conclude that they lack merit furthermore we conclude that the parties remaining arguments are moot and decline to consider them personhood nev v bristol  nev    pd    indicating that this court will generally not consider moot issues supreme
