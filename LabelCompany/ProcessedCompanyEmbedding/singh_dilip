management efforts at argonne’s center for transportation research he and his group investigate innovative technologies for improving the cooling in heavyduty truck engines and power electronics used in hybrid electric vehicles  using multifunctional nanoparticles he is working on the development of heat transfer fluids with enhanced thermophysical properties for concentrated solar power csp power plant cooling and power electronics applications  in addition he is involved in the development of highefficiency thermal energy storage systems for csp and vehicle systems singh is a coinventor of the lowtemperature phosphate ceramics technology ceramicretetm and has worked extensively in the development of phosphate ceramics for structural nuclear materials storage and waste disposal applications the technology has been licensed by argonne to several companies for use in commercial and government sector applications early in his career singh’s work focused on the mechanical behavior and reliability of structural ceramics and composite materials he has conducted fundamental and applied research on hightemperature plastic deformation as a joining technique for ceramics he has applied the plastic deformation process to fabricate ceramic gas oxygen and nox electrochemical sensors that can operate at high temperatures 00°c applications for these sensors are in the
