committee which is comprised of three independent nonemployee directors has formulated a compensation philosophy that is designed to enable us to attract retain and reward capable employees who can contribute to the success of casmed principally through a combination of  base salaries  annual incentive opportunities and  longerterm incentive opportunities for senior management we believe that implementation of a system of compensation that emphasizes performancebased compensation provides a strong alignment to stockholders’ interests five key principles serve as the guiding framework for compensation decisions for all executive officers of casmed • to attract and retain the most highly qualified management and employee team ​ • to pay competitively compared to similar companies in our industry ​ • to encourage superior employee performance by aligning rewards with stockholder interests ​ • to motivate senior executives to achieve casmed’s annual and longterm business goals by providing equitybased incentive opportunities and ​ • to strive for fairness in administration by emphasizing performancerelated contributions as the basis for pay decisions ​ to implement these policies we have designed the framework for a fourpart executive compensation program consisting of base salary annual incentives longterm incentive opportunities for senior management and other employment benefits base salary we will seek to maintain levels of compensation that are competitive with similar companies in our industry base salary represents the fixed component of the executive compensation program casmed’s philosophy regarding base salaries is to maintain salaries for the aggregate officer group at or near the competitive industry average periodic increases in base salary will relate to individual contributions evaluated against established objectives length of service and the industry’s annual competitive pay practice movement we believe that base salary for  for our chief executive officer and for the other executive officers was generally at the competitive industry average ​  ​ annual incentive program  during january  the compensation committee approved the  management annual incentive program which included various targets including sales cash used in operations and personal goals total bonus payments of   would be payable to the management team including the named executive officers upon achieving  of the targets payable in either cash or vested common stock the program provided for reduced payouts at certain achievement levels below  as well as increased payouts for performance above target actual amounts paid to management for  included  shares of our common stock valued at  per share based upon the nasdaq official closing price on march   and approximately  which is being paid in cash in  during february  the compensation committee approved the  management annual incentive program which includes various targets including sales adjusted cash flow from operations and personal goals total bonus payments of approximately  would be payable to the management team including the named executive officers upon achieving  of the targets payable in either cash or vested common stock the program provides for reduced payouts at certain achievement levels below  as well as increased payouts for performance above target up to a capitated level the compensation committee also assesses whether to pay discretionary bonuses to our employees including senior executives either in cash or stock based upon performance payment of the performance bonuses is at the sole discretion of the compensation committee and is not based on specific metrics although the compensation committee bases its decisions on numerous factors including overall corporate and personal performance no discretionary cash bonus payments were made to the named executive officers for  or  longterm incentives  we believe that longterm incentives should provide senior executives with an opportunity to increase their ownership and potentially gain financially from casmed stock price increases by this approach the best interests of stockholders and senior executives will be closely aligned therefore senior executives are eligible to receive restricted stock and stock options which give them the right to purchase shares of common stock at a specified price in the future these grants will vest based upon the passage of time the achievement of performance metrics or both we believe that the use of restricted stock and stock options as the basis for longterm incentive compensation meets our defined compensation strategy and business needs by achieving increased value for stockholders and retaining key employees other benefits our philosophy is to provide competitive health and welfare benefits to executives and employees but to maintain a conservative posture relative to executive benefits we do provide life insurance and supplemental disability insurance to certain of our senior executive officers ​  ​ compensation disclosure tables summary compensation table the following table table i shows all compensation paid or
