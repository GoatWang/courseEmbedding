copies of the first role and  copies of the second role one of the participants playing the second role would partner with another participant playing that same role and the two would negotiate as a

dollar world tax cut december   singapore  acting us trade representative charlene barshefsky says that the landmark agreement to eliminate tariffs on hundreds of global information technology products is equivalent to a global tax cut totaling thousands of millions of dollars the information technology agreement ita concluded at the first ministerial meeting of the world trade organization that concluded in singapore december  will go into effect once countries representing  percent of world trade in the products covered under the accord sign the pact currently  countries representing  percent of global trade in information technology products have committed to the ita barshefsky said there is absolutely no question that implementation will begin in  she said in a press conference here december  following the ministerial conference barshefsky also expressed satisfaction that ministers gave the goahead to the wto to begin studies of transparency in government procurement investment and competition policies barshefsky said that good progress had been made at the wto meeting on advancing negotiations in basic telecommunications services and on reaffirming uruguay round commitments to move forward with negotiations on agricultural sector liberalization in  she also commented on the mention of labor issues in the wto declaration and the importance of collaboration between the wto and the international labor organization in assuring continued public support for trade agreements negotiations following is an unofficial transcript of the barshefsky briefing begin transcript let me say that i have been looking forward to this press conference because this is the first time i have sat down in five days let me first introduce the people who are up here my deputy jeff lane our chief ita negotiators dorothy dwoskin and andy stoler andy also is our number two in our geneva office there are many other people whose names i would like to go through matt rohde and barbara chattin clayton parker margaret sullivan and i apologize but any one of a number of people who have been working just day and night to bring the ita to fruition but of all i particularly want to single out dorothy dwoskin for her tireless absolutely tireless efforts let me also begin by thanking the singapore government and in particular minister yeo who with very deft handling was able to bring to conclusion a ministerial declaration that dealt with many subjects formally of contention among the ministerial participants whether on agriculture or textiles competition policy labor standards investment all these issues presented complexity and his very able skillful handling of these matters is what helped bring the ministerial declaration to conclusion also directorgeneral ruggiero who helped put everything together the ministerial declaration as well as his assistance with respect to the ita i would also before i begin thank all of the countries who worked so hard with the united states to reach what really is a landmark agreement with respect to information technology just a short while ago president clinton phoned and he expressed has delight with the outcome of the ministerial and also his personal gratitude to the many countries that participated in particular he wanted me to express his gratitude to the apec nations which contributed as you know the president was very forceful at the apec meetings in manila with respect to the need for apec leaders to endorse and work toward conclusion of an ita by the singapore ministerial that goal having been achieved the president wanted me particularly to thank his apec colleagues for this achievement the information technology agreement which was achieved will eliminate to zero tariffs on hundreds of global information technology products whether semiconductors or telecommunications equipment computers computer equipment software a huge gamut of products product coverage at present represents five hundred billion dollars one half trillion dollars in global trade that is based on  figures so the half trillion figure is quite understated relative to what we knew was a significant important in trade in these products in  the movement to zero by the year  in all of these products really constitutes a global tax cut it means that the creation of the information superhighway will he encouraged and promoted not taxed it means that countries which produce and export these products will gain not only from tariff productions which are very significant but also with respect to what we know happens when tariffs are reduced we know from  years of gatt experience you reduce tariffs trade increases exponentially and that is exactly what will happen here so we have not only the savings from a global tax cut which for us industries based on last years figures would have totalled over up a billion dollars but you have in addition the spur of a very rapidly increased trade volumes and trade values in these products countries that participate in the agreement will eliminate tariffs on it products by the year  on a maximum range of product coverage in a very few limited cases and this is spelled out with quite particularity in limited cases it may take a few more years beyond the year  to get to zero tariffs and of course the united states position in geneva for months and months has been absolutely that flexibility needs to be built into the agreement on it products because of course we are dealing with economies that are both very developed but also much less developed but the exception from zero by the year  are explicitly limited let me talk a minute about the schedule that is set out in the documents that you will review if i can find my schedule if youll bear with me for one moment it was right here ok this is all spelled out in the documents that you will see  december  is our ministerial declaration it specifies the countries that have already and the document is about  pages long that have already committed to the ita let me read you the list of countries it is  countries representing  percent of global trade in it products those countries are australia canada chinese taipei the european communities  that is the ec fifteen hong kong iceland indonesia japan korea norway singapore switzerland turkey and the united states apart from these  countries three additional countries have told us and have issued letters of intent today which you will see that they intend fully to participate in what is going to be a short geneva process and i will take you through the schedule and to participate in the ita that will bring total global product coverage im sorry total trade volume coverage to  percent our threshold for automatic implementation of the agreement is  percent or approximately  percent of global trade coverage with the  percent commitments today and what will be an additional nine percent within the next week or two there is no question this agreement is a full go ahead there is absolutely no question that implementation will begin in  let me then go through the chronology for you as to what happens now  december is today thats the ministerial declaration copies of which will be available when the copy machines can churn them out  january  so at the end of january technical discussions in geneva must be completed the technical discussions revolve around the staging out of the tariffs between now and the year  the agreement specifies that tariffs will be cut one quarter one quarter one quarter one quarter the first tranche beginning july  and ending in january  but the agreement also specifies that all of that may be accelerated for countries which wish to do so and the agreement specifies that there is some alternative form of staging provided you get to zero in  thats acceptable as well ive had extensive discussions with the european union over the last three days and will have further discussions in geneva it would be our hope that at a minimum we and the european union would accelerate our tariff cuts we would not wait to the year  to go to zero but those discussions will happen in geneva then on march   this is the deadline for submitting all of the staging cuts which have been agreed so all the technical details are then formally submitted in document form on april   that is the deadline for all the countries to review everything that has been submitted and to determine whether two criteria have been met for the automatic implementation of the ita beginning in july criterion number one do we have approximately  percent of global trade in it products covered were already there we know that is going to be a yes number two are all countries satisfied with the staging commitments that have been made that is the way the tariffs will be cut to get to zero i have absolute confidence the answer to that will be yes as well then july   is the deadline for tariff bindings one of the important points of this agreement is all the tariff cuts will be bound they cannot be raised again this is very significant particularly in the developing world where many tariffs are not bound firmly but can float within a range these tariffs are all bound july   is the deadline for tariff binding and the first tariff cut january   deadline for second tariff cut january   the deadline for the third january   deadline for the final cut thats zero in the limited circumstance in which additional time is needed on specified products that will have already been spelled out in the schedules and agreed to as part of the two criterion that have to be satisfied and then those cuts will proceed however it has been agreed they will be staged all this has been spelled out and is agreed to already formally by  percent of world trade in these products with the other nine percent coming on board before we begin our process in geneva in several weeks now let me say simply that in the united states about  million jobs are hinged to high technology products and in the last four years alone even though the us faces very substantial tariff barriers around the world to these products us exports in these products has increased  percent imagine the rate of increase when tariffs are at zero let me give you a few examples in countries like korea thailand and the philippines tariffs are as much as six times those in the united states on a variety of products in semiconductors in europe for example some tariffs are as high an  percent us is at zero so the benefits of the agreement certainly for the united states will be substantial but the benefits for asia for europe and other countries will be equally substantial as a final point let me say that the ita agreement delivers on the focus of the president with respect first to the importance of the multilateral system as an ongoing vehicle for trade liberalization second the importance of asia to the united states economy and third the importance of market access as a means to foster our own domestic economic prosperity as well as a means to foster global growth i would repeat again that but for the presidents accomplishments at the manila leaders meeting with respect to the ita commitment by the asian nations there would have been no possible way to have this agreement emerge here at singapore now let me spend just one moment on the singapore declaration which is the first declaration of course thats come out of the meeting it is the other document that you will see today with regard to the issues in that declaration the united states is very pleased we think a very good balance has been achieved in the document and the aims that we sat out to accomplish by and large i think we have achieved on procurement transparency in government procurement there is agreed that there will be a study which will explicitly lead to an agreement on transparency in government procurement this was a principal united states objective because access to government procurement markets worldwide is terribly limited and we know many of those markets are characterized by substantial bribery and corruption the greater the transparency the greater the due process in government purchasing the better chance the united states and other countries have to compete on a level playing field second with respect to labor rights since the eisenhower administration the united states has sought a framework from which we can pursue our labor objective in the context of global trade we are talking about core labor standards as you know as enunciated by the ilo and by the un this is an area where the interests the underlying interests of developed and developing economies are the same and this was very clear from the discussions that were held as you may know the core labor standards issue dominated three days of discussions among the ministers the interesting thing was that for all the parties present the commitment to observing core labor standards the commitment to increasing prosperity and social welfare is unquestioned and viewed by the developing world an well as the developed world as an unquestioned series of principles so that has never been in doubt for the united states the debate has never been about protectionism on the one hand or barriers on the other it has been to achieve an enunciated consensus on the critical importance of worker welfare and the critical importance of striving to maximize worker welfare as we do trade agreements as you see from the ministerial declaration or you will we have achieved explicit reference to core labor standards and commitments to core labor standards in the  years of gatt we were never able to do that and in addition the document notes that there will continue to be an existing collaboration between the wto secretariat and the ilo secretariat which coordinate already on many issues the declaration also makes plain principles with which the united states absolutely agrees that labor standards should not be used for protectionist purposes and that genuine comparative advantage of lower wage countries should not be undermined id make one additional note that in the chairmans summing up statement additional comments were made with respective to the subject pertaining to the wto agenda and likewise in the heads of delegation plenary which was held immediately before the closing session the chairman made clear upon reading the same statement that his statement was his own there was no consensus on his statement that the legal consensus and binding consensus is that which appears in the ministerial declaration we think that this is very important and needs to be noted in basic telecommunications very good progress was made this week in advancing the negotiations on basic telecom reed hundt the chairman of our federal communications commission and i cohosted a meeting on monday december  with a number of delegations interested in the global talks on telecommunications services liberalization we expected perhaps  or  delegations we had  delegations virtually all of which represented ministerial level there was an increasing amount of interest in these talks some countries indicated their offers would improve we encourage that we hope the ita agreement will lead toward improvement in those telecom offers after all the it agreement are the cars and the trucks on the road but the telecom agreement is the road so we hope the ita agreement will lead to better offers in the telecom area certainly as you all know as we have said repeatedly the united states must see  must see improved offers from a variety of nations if the talks are successfully conclude on february  on the subject of agriculture one of the key issues was to look at the implementation of uruguay round commitments for the united states this is particularly important with respect to agriculture the ministerial declaration says that the reform process will continue that we will remain true to the timeframes set out in marrakesh which means negotiations begin in  which means the preparatory work will be completed by  for those negotiations this is very good news for us agriculture but let me say us agriculture faces serious impediments around the world import barriers state trading enterprises export subsidies unjustifiable and nonscientific sanitary and phytosanitary regulations hamper us exports the outcome of the ministerial gives us an opportunity to attack these problems headon but these problems most be resolved let me say that with respect to agriculture there was a very large us agriculture delegation that came here at considerable sacrifice and we are very grateful for the work that they did on investment the us goal had been a modest work program which would not interfere with completion of investment negotiations ongoing now in the oecd that aim has been accomplished with respect to competition policy we have ensured that work on competition will not threaten our laws which protect principles of fair pricing and fair competition the work plan is expected to focus on the problems of cartels and other private anticompetitive behavior which can impede foreign market access all in all i apologize for the length of this explanation but all in all the united states is very pleased with the outcome of the first ministerial conference as well as with the outcome of the ita negotiations we look forward to continuing a leadership role in the wto and we look forward particularly working in geneva toward the implementation of the ita agreement july of  with that let me please invite questions question it has been a long stated goal of the clinton administration that trade agreements have to be a twoway street how does that philosophy jell with the ita and its application to china are you extending these deals to china on an mfn basis without china making commitments or how do you expect to handle that issue answer first let me say that as in any tariff negotiation you want a critical mass of those countries who are the major producers and exporters so that you avoid free riders this is why we set a very high threshold on the kickin for the ita we have already achieved it but the threshold will be approximately  percent of global trade covered this is of course as you know an agreement within the wto and we will certainly look at the question of its application to china as we proceed q there is no decision yet on china a we will look at that as we proceed q there was so much agreement and unanimity in observing core labor standards and the ilo convention why were three days spent on just negotiating words to be put into the declaration a i think thats a very good question because as you know the question is what is the proper role of the wto as a trade institution with respect to the issue of core standards or more broadly worker welfare this is a complex debate for some countries the link is obvious and apparent for other countries a linkage is to be avoided between wto or trade agreements on the one hand and worker issues on the other that is the ideological debate and the text attempts to reconcile the ideological debate by putting forward principles with which we can all agree no one wants to use labor standards for protectionist purposes and if there is a genuine comparative advantage in the developing world no one wishes to put into question that genuine comparative advantage but by the same token it is acknowledged well the ilo and wto do work together that is the fact it is current reality and the importance of the declaration is the explicit indication of the continuing collaboration that will occur in the future but the ideological debate is as i have described as a practical matter as a practical political matter the issue is really not very far apart the wto is committed to trade liberalization through trade agreements negotiation if working people whether in the united states or the european union or in indonesia or brazil or argentina or mexico or russia if working people believe trade agreements threaten their jobs if working people believe trade agreements lead to workers dislocation there will be an erosion in the constituency for trade agreement and trade liberalization and the foundation and existence of the wto itself will be threatened as a practical matter if working people dont believe these agreements are in their interests politicians who are elected by working people wont be able to negotiate them and that threatens the free trading system we therefore must as a practical matter ideology aside recognize that issues of worker welfare and worker rights are absolutely a part of the trade agreements debate whether ideologically one is happy about that or not q just a technical clarification on ita you may have misspoken or i may have misheard you before you said three additional countries have today told usthat will bring the total coverage to  percent your press release says six other countries bring it from  to  percent what other countries a i do apologize three are asian countries three are not i apologize it is six we are correct in our release and i misspoke we have the  countries that are listed that is the  percent six additional countries  three asian three nonasian  have already provided their intent to actively participate in geneva and to join in the ita for these countries by and large the problem had to do with not enough time to really go through the product coverage scope they just needed more time that will then increase the coverage to above the trigger threshold q above  percent a yes q above  percent a whatever the number was in the release q the number would be just over  a i thought the number was  i thought that was the secretariat number but let me ask dorothy dwoskin q what dorothy is saying is it is safest to say just above  because the data are preliminary but as the secretariat worked out the data their initial projection was  percent in any event we will be above the threshold whether it is just above  or  percent we will be above the threshold a let me make one comment on the product coverage you will receive a page product coverage document that has been agreed this is the summary the page single space document is the summary of the product coverage were we to go through the products the subproducts and the subsubproducts youd be looking at a massive massive massive document so this was the summary which we thought would be the easiest and in terms of copying the cheapest thing we could provide q if i am not mistaken i think you said that the study with regard to competition should not threaten our roles you said do you include in those roles say legislation on antidumping a oh no question theres no question that from the point of view of the united states and indeed also the european union the antidumping laws are not on the table no question about that q is that the understanding at this ministerial meeting is undertaking this study on competition and investments a the study on competition is intended to focus on competition policy antitrust  in other words anticompetitive practices that would impede market access private anticompetitive practices largely q oh yes its to my surprise but i just wanted to have confirmation q given your remarks about the importance of asian countries in securing a deal on the ita would the us be sympathetic to looking at an asian candidate as a successor to renato ruggiero a i dont want to respond to that renato ruggiero hasis it two years left on his term  so come ask me in  q as part of this collaboration between the ilo and the wto would you see the wto as promoting endorsing enforcing core labor standards secondly sir leon brittan has been talking about this millennium round that he wants to launch by the year  after this meeting in singapore are you convinced that such an intersectoral round is necessary you know a global comprehensive world trade round a with respect to your first question plainly labor standards are set in the ilo there is no desire on the part of any wto member including the united states to set or define labor standards in the wto so theres no question about that with respect to the notion of a global round there really has been virtually no discussion one of the goals of the united states  and perhaps an overarching goal of the united states in this ministerial meeting  was to establish the principle that the wto was in many ways fundamentally different from the gatt system one that the wto would be a forum in which members trade concerns could be discussed  whether it is this core labor standards issue or agriculture or competition policy any one of a number of issues that principle has been established this is a forum in which ideas and discussion even of controversial issues can take place number two of principal importance to the united states was to establish the fact that major trade liberalization could occur through the wto without having to call for a global round without having to wait for a global round because if we had to wait for a global round for the next bit of liberalization the world would be waiting perhaps until well after the turn of the century and then if the uruguay round in a guide they would wait another eight years after that we wanted to establish the notion that we could proceed a pace with market opening with trade growth on an absolutely routine basis the ita establishes that principle both of those goals were very important to the united states and to many other countries here and i think the wto will be strengthened for those goals having been achieved thank you very very much end transcript return to vinnies home page return to trade page charlene barshefsky news  the new york
