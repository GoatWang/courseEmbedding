application the complete application is available for a fee from the public reference branch of the sec  fifth street nw washington dc  tel   applicants representations  the trust is a delaware business trust registered as an openend diversified management investment company the trust currently is composed of one series third avenue value portfolio additional portfolios may be added in the future  the adviser is registered under the investment advisers act of  and will be the investment manager for the trust  the trust intends to offer its shares to separate accounts of both affiliated and unaffiliated insurance companies “participating insurance companies” supporting variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts  the trust also intends to offer one or more portfolios of its shares directly to qualified pension and retirement plans “eligible plans” or “plans” start printed page outside the separate account context the funds shares sold to eligible plans which are subject to the employee retirement income security act of  “erisa” as amended may be held by the trustees of the eligible plans  the participating insurance companies will establish their own separate accounts and design their own contracts each participating insurance company will have the legal obligation of satisfying all requirements applicable to such insurance company under the federal securities laws each participating insurance company will enter into a fund participation agreement with the funds in which the participating insurance company invests the role of the funds so far as the federal securities laws are applicable will be to offer their shares to separate accounts of participating insurance companies and to eligible plans and to fulfill any conditions that the commission may impose upon granting the order requested in the application applicants legal analysis  in connection with the funding of scheduled premium variable life insurance contracts issued through a separate account registered under the  act as a unit investment trust rule eb under the  act provides partial exemptions from sections a a a and b of the  act the exemptions granted by rule eb are available however only where the management investment company underlying the separate account “underlying fund” offers its shares “exclusively to variable life insurance separate accounts of the life insurer or of any affiliated life insurance company” emphasis supplied therefore the relief granted by rule eb is not available with respect to a scheduled premium variable life insurance separate account that owns shares of an underlying fund that also offers its shares to a variable annuity or a flexible premium variable life insurance separate account of the same company or of any affiliated life insurance company the use of a common management investment company as the underlying investment medium for both variable annuity and variable life insurance separate accounts of the same insurance company or of any affiliated life insurance company is referred to herein as “mixed funding” in addition the relief granted by rule eb is not available if shares of the underlying management investment company are offered to variable annuity or variable life insurance separate accounts of unaffiliated life insurance companies the use of a common management investment company as the underlying investment medium for separate accounts of unaffiliated life insurance companies is referred to herein as “shared funding”  in connection with the funding of flexible premium variable life insurance contracts issued through a separate account registered under the  act as unit investment trust rule etb provides partial exemptions from sections a a a and b of the  act these exemptions however are available only where the separate accounts underlying fund offers its shares “exclusively to separate accounts of the life insurer or of any affiliated life insurance company offering either scheduled premium variable life insurance contracts or flexible premium variable life insurance contracts or both or which also offer their shares to variable annuity separate accounts of the life insurer or of an affiliated life insurance company” emphasis supplied therefore rule et permits mixed funding with respect to a flexible premium variable life insurance however rule et does not permit shared funding because the relief granted by rule etb is not available with respect to a flexible premium variable life insurance separate account that owns shares of a management investment company that also offers its shares to separate accounts including flexible premium variable life insurance separate accounts of unaffiliated life insurance companies  applicants state that the relief granted by rules eb and etb is not affected by the purchase of shares of the funds by an eligible plan however because the relief under rules eb and etb is available only where shares of the underlying fund are offered exclusively to separate accounts exemptive relief is necessary if shares of the funds are also to be sold to eligible plans  applicants state that section h of the internal revenue code of  as amended the “code” imposes certain diversification standards on the assets underlying variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance contracts issued by insurance company separate accounts and held in the portfolios of management investment companies the code provides that such contracts will not be treated as annuity contracts or life insurance contracts for any period or any subsequent period for which the investments are not in accordance with regulations issued by the treasury department adequately diversified on march   the treasury department issued regulations treas reg the “regulations” which established specific diversification requirements for investment portfolios underlying variable annuity and variable life contracts the regulations generally provide that in order to meet these diversification requirements all of the beneficial interests in the underlying investment companies however the regulations also contain an exception to this requirement that allows shares of an investment company to be held by a qualified pension or retirement plan without adversely affecting the ability of shares in the same investment company to also be held by the separate accounts of insurance companies in connection with their variable annuity and variable life contracts treas reg fiii  applicants also note that the promulgation of rules eb and etb preceded the issuance of the regulations which made is possible for shares of an investment company to be held by an eligible plan without adversely affecting the ability of shares in the same investment company to also be held by the separate accounts of insurance companies in connection with their contracts thus the sale of shares of the same investment company to separate accounts and eligible plans could not have been envisioned at the time of the adoption of rules eb and etb given the thencurrent tax law  in general section a of the  act disqualifies any person convicted of certain offenses and any company affiliated with that person from serving in various capacities with respect to an underlying registered management investment company more specifically section a provides that it is unlawful for any company to serve as investment adviser to or principal underwriter for any registered openend investment company if an affiliated person of that company is subject to a disqualification enumerated in sections a of  of the  act rules ebi and ii and etbi and ii provide exemptions from section a under certain circumstances subject to the limitations of mixed and shared funding these exemptions limit the application of the eligibility restrictions to affiliated individuals or companies that directly participate in the management of the underlying fund  applicants state that the partial relief granted in rules eb and etb from the requirements of start printed page section  of the  act limits in effect the mount of monitoring of an insurers personnel that would otherwise be necessary to ensure compliance with section  to that which is appropriate in light of the policy and purposes of section  applicants state that those rules recognize that it is unnecessary to apply section a to the thousands of individuals who may be involved in a large insurance company but would have no connection with the investment company funding the separate accounts those individuals who participate in the management or administration of the funds will remain the same regardless of which separate accounts or insurance companies use the funds applicants maintain that applying the requirements of section a because of investment by other insurers separate accounts would not serve any regulatory purpose therefore applicants submit that it is unnecessary to apply section a to individuals in various unaffiliated insurance companies or affiliated companies or participating insurance companies that may utilize a fund as a funding medium for variable contracts additionally applicants state that for the same reasons as set forth above with respect to investments by separate accounts there is no regulatory purpose to be served in extending the monitoring requirements because of investment in the funds by plans  applicants state the rules ebiii and etbiii under the  act provide exemptions from the passthrough voting requirement with respect to several significant matters assuming the limitations on mixed and shared funding are observed more specifically rules ebbiiia and etbiiia provide that the insurance company may disregard the footing instructions of its contract owners with respect to the investment of an underlying fund or any contract between a fund and its investment adviser when required to do so by an insurance regulatory authority and subject to the provisions of paragraphs bi and biia of the rules in addition rules ebiiib and etbiiia provide that the insurance company may disregard voting instruction of contract owners in favor of any change in such companys investment policies principal underwriter or any investment adviser subject to the other provisions of paragraphs bii and biib and c of the rules  with respect to eligible plans which are not registered as investment companies under the  act there is no requirement to pass through voting rights to plan participants indeed to the contrary applicable law expressly reserves voting rights associated with plan assets to certain specified persons applicants state that shares of the funds sold to eligible plans will be held by the trustees of such plans as required by section a of erisa section a also provides that the trustees must have exclusive authority and discretion to manage and control eligible plans with two exceptions a when the eligible plan expressly provides that the trustees are subject to the direction of a named fiduciary who is not a trustee in which case the trustees are subject to proper directions made in accordance with the terms of the eligible plan and not contrary to erisa and b when the authority to manage acquire or dispose of assets of the eligible plan is delegated to one or more investment managers pursuant to section c of erisa unless one of the above two exceptions stated in section a applies plan trustees have the exclusive authority and responsibility for voting proxies  where a named fiduciary appoints an investment manager the investment manager has the responsibility to vote the shares held unless the right to vote such shares is reserved to the trustees or the named fiduciary the eligible plans may have their trustees or other fiduciaries exercise voting rights attributable to investment securities held by the eligible plans in their discretion some of the eligible plans however may provide for the trustees an investment adviser or advisers or another named fiduciary to exercise voting rights in accordance with instructions from plan participants  where an eligible plan does not provide participants with the right to give voting instructions applicants submit that there is no potential for material irreconcilable conflicts of interest between or among contract holders and plan participants with respect to voting of the respective funds shares accordingly applicants note that unlike the case with insurance company separate accounts the issue of the resolution of material irreconcilable conflicts with respect to voting is not present with respect to such eligible plans since the eligible plans are not entitled to passthrough voting privileges  even if an eligible plan were to hold a controlling interest in a fund applicants argue that such control would not disadvantage other investors in such fund to any greater extent than is the case when any institutional shareholder holds a majority of the voting securities of any openend management investment company in this regard applicants submit that investment in the fund by a plan will not create any of the voting complications occasioned by mixed funding or shared funding unlike mixed or shared funding plan investor voting rights cannot be frustrated by veto rights of insurers or state regulators  where an eligible plan provides plan participants with the right to give voting instructions applicants see no reason to believe the participants in eligible plans generally or those in a particular plan either as a single group or in combination with participants in other eligible plans would vote in a manner that would disadvantage contract holders the purchase of shares of the funds by eligible plans that provide voting rights does not present any complications not otherwise occasioned by mixed or shared funding  applicants assert that no increased conflicts of interest would be presented by the granting of the requested relief shared funding does not present any issues that do not already exist where a single insurance company is licensed to do business in several states when different participating insurance companies are domiciled in different states it is possible that the state insurance regulatory body in a state in which one participating insurance company is domiciled could require action that is inconsistent with the requirements of insurance regulators of other states in which other participating insurance companies are domiciled applicants submit that the possibility also exists when a single insurer and its affiliates offer their insurance products in several states as in currently permitted  applicants state that affiliations do not reduce the potential for differences in state regulatory requirements in any event applicants submit that the conditions set forth in the application and included in this notice are designed to safeguard against any adverse effects that differences among state regulatory requirements may produce for instance if a particular state insurance regulators decision conflicts with the majority of other state regulators the affected insurer may be required to withdraw its separate accounts investment in the relevant funds  applicants further assert that affiliation does not eliminate the potential for divergent judgments as to when a participating insurance company could disregard contract holder voting instructions the potential start printed page for disagreement is limited by the requirements in rules e and t that an insurance companys disregard of voting instructions be reasonable and based on specific good faith determinations however if the participating insurance companys decision to disregard contract holder voting instructions represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote approving a particular change such participating insurance company may be required at the election of the relevant fund to withdraw its separate accounts investment in that fund and no charge or penalty would be imposed upon contract holders as a result of such withdrawal  applicants submit that no reason exists why investment policies of the fund with mixed funding would or should be materially different from what they would or should be if the funds or series thereof funded only variable annuity contracts or only variable life insurance contracts rather than contracts and eligible plans applicants represent that the funds will not be managed to favor or disfavor any particular insurer or type of contract  applicants state that they do not see any greater potential for material irreconcilable conflicts arising between the interests of plan participants under the eligible plans and holders of contracts issued by separate accounts of participating insurance companies from possible future changes in the federal tax laws than that which already exist between variable annuity contract holders and variable life insurance contract holders  applicants note that while there are differences in the manner in which distributions are taxed for variable annuity contracts variable life insurance contracts and eligible plans the tax consequences do not raise any conflicts of interest when distributions are to be made and the eligible plan or variable annuity or variable life insurance separate accounts cannot net purchase payments to make the distributions the separate account or eligible plan will redeem shares of the funds at their net asset value the eligible plan will make distributions in accordance with the terms of the plan the life insurance company will make distributions in accordance with the terms of the variable contract  with respect to voting rights applicants state that it is possible to provide an equitable means of giving voting rights to contract holders and to eligible plans applicants represent that the fund will inform each shareholder including each separate account and eligible plan of information necessary for the shareholder meeting including their respective share of ownership in the fund a participating insurance company will then solicit voting instructions in accordance with the “passthrough” voting requirements of rules e and et  applicants submit that there are no conflicts between the contract holders of the separate accounts and the participants under eligible plans with respect to state insurance commissioners veto powers over investment objectives state insurance commissioners have been given the veto power to prevent among other things insurance companies indiscriminately redeeming their separate accounts out of one fund and investing in another generally timeconsuming complex transactions must be undertaken to accomplish such redemptions and transfers conversely the eligible plans can quickly redeem shares from a fund and reinvest in another funding vehicle without the same regulatory impediments or as is the case with most plans even hold cash pending suitable investment therefore applicants conclude that even if there should arise issues where the interests of contract holders and the interests of eligible plans and plan participants conflict the issues can be almost immediately resolved because eligible plans can on their own redeem the shares out of the funds  applicants assert that many insurance companies have been hindered in entering the market for offering variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts these factors include the costs of organizing and operating a funding medium the lack of expertise with respect to investment management principally with respect to stock and money market investments and the lack of name recognition by the public as investment experts in particular some smaller life insurance companies may not find it economically feasible or within their investment or administrative expertise to enter the contract business on their own applicants submit that the use of the funds as common investment media for contracts would lower these barriers  applicants assert that participating insurance companies would benefit not only from the investment and administrative expertise of the adviser and its affiliates but also from the cost efficiencies and investment flexibility afforded by a large pool of funds therefore making the funds available for mixed and shared funding will encourage more insurance companies to offer contracts and accordingly should result in increased competition with respect to both contract design and pricing which can be expected to result in more product variation and lower charges applicants state that contract holders would benefit because mixed and shared funding eliminates a significant portion of the costs of establishing and administering separate funds applicants also assert that the sale of shares of the funds to eligible plans should result in an increased amount of assets available for investment by such funds this may benefit contract holders by promoting economies of scale by permitting greater safety of investments through greater diversification and by making the addition of new portfolios to the funds more feasible applicants conditions applicants have consented to the following conditions  a majority of the trustees or board of directors each a “board” of the trust and each fund will consist of persons who are not “interested persons” thereof as defined by section a of the  act and the rules thereunder and as modified by any applicable orders of the commission except that if this condition is not met by reason of the death disqualification or bona fide resignation of any trustee or director then the operation of this condition shall be suspended a for a period of  days if the vacancy or vacancies may be filled by the board b for a period of  days if a vote of shareholders is required to fill the vacancy or vacancies or c for such longer period as the commission may prescribe by order upon application  the boards will monitor their respective funds for the existence of any material irreconcilable conflict between and among the interests of the contract holders of all separate accounts and of plan participants and eligible plans investing in the funds and determine what action if any should be taken in response to any such conflicts a material irreconcilable conflict may arise for a variety of reasons including a any action by any state insurance regulatory authority b a change in applicable federal or state insurance tax or securities laws or regulations or a public ruling private letter ruling noaction or interpretive letter or any similar action by insurance tax or securities regulatory authorities c an administrative or judicial decision in any relevant proceeding d the manner in which the investments of the funds are being managed e a difference in voting instructions given by variable start printed page annuity and variable life insurance contract holders and trustees of the plans f a decision by a participating insurance company to disregard the voting instructions of plan participants

any other investment adviser of a fund participating insurance companies and participating plans will be responsible for assisting the appropriate board in carrying out its responsibilities under these conditions by providing the board with all information reasonably necessary for the board to consider any issues raised this includes but is not limited to an obligation by a participating insurance company to inform the board whenever it has determined to disregard contract holder voting instructions and if passthrough voting is applicable an obligation by a participating plan to inform the board whenever it has determined to disregard plan participant voting instructions the responsibility to report such conflicts and information and to assist the boards will be contractual obligations of all participating insurance companies and participating plans investing in the funds under their agreements governing participation in the funds and such agreements shall provide that these responsibilities will be carried out with a view only to the interests of the contract holders and if applicable plan participants  if a majority of the board of a fund or a majority of its disinterested trustees or directors determine that a material irreconcilable conflict exists the relevant participating insurance companies at their expense and to the extent reasonably practicable as determined by a majority of the disinterested trustees or directors will be required to take whatever steps are necessary to remedy or eliminate the material irreconcilable conflict such steps could include a withdrawing the assets allocable to some or all of the separate accounts from the fund and reinvesting such assets in a different investment medium which may include another series of the trust or another fund b in the case of participating insurance companies submitting the questions of whether such segregation should be implemented to a vote of all affected contract holders and as appropriate segregating the assets of any appropriate group ie variable annuity or variable life insurance contract holders of one or more participating insurance companies that votes in favor of such segregation or offering to the affected contract holders the option of making such a change and establishing a new registered management investment company or managed separate account if a material irreconcilable conflict arises because of a decision by a participating insurance company to disregard contract holders voting instructions and that decision represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote the participating insurance company may be required at the election of the fund to withdraw its separate accounts investment in such fund with no change or penalty imposed as a result of such withdrawal if a material irreconcilable conflict arises because of a participating plans decision to disregard plan participant voting instructions if applicable and that decision represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote the participating plan may be required at the election of the fund to withdraw its investment in such fund with no charge or penalty imposed as a result of such withdrawal to the extent permitted by applicable law the responsibility of taking remedial action in the event of a board determination of a material irreconcilable conflict and bearing the cost of such remedial action will be contractual obligation of all participating insurance companies and participating plans under the agreements governing participation in the funds and these responsibilities will be carried out with a view only to the interests of contract holders and plan participants as applicable for purposes of this condition  a majority of the disinterested members of the applicable board will determine whether or not any proposed action adequately remedies any material irreconcilable conflict but in no event will a fund or the adviser or any other investment adviser of the funds be required to establish a new funding medium for any contract no participating insurance company will be required by this condition  to establish a new funding medium for any contract if a majority of contract holders materially and adversely affected by the irreconcilable material conflict vote to decline this offer no participating plan shall be required by this condition  to establish a new funding medium for such plan if a a majority of plan participants materially and adversely affected by the irreconcilable material conflict vote to decline such offer or b pursuant to governing plan documents and applicable law the participating plan makes such decision with a plan participant plan  the adviser all participating insurance companies with respect to a fund and participating plans with respect to a fund will be promptly informed in writing of any determination by the board of such fund that a material irreconcilable conflict exists and its implications  participating insurance companies will be required to provide passthrough voting privileges to all contract holders so long as the commission interprets the  act to require passthrough voting privileges for contract holders accordingly the participating insurance companies will vote shares of a fund held in their separate accounts in a manner consistent with voting instructions timely received from contract holders participating insurance companies shall be responsible for assuring that each of their separate accounts calculates voting privileges in a
