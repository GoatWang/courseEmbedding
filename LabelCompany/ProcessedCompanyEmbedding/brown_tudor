inside tudor store locator my selection “we’re devoted to the classic but reject the status quo”born from the will to go beyond the standards tudor’s watchmaking philosophy draws its inspiration from its heritage while incorporating stateoftheart technology exclusive innovations and pioneering creativitycreated by the founder of rolex hans wilsdorf the tudor watch company was born with a mission to explore new territories offering “a watch that his agents could sell at a more modest price than his rolex watches and yet could attain its standards of dependability”the tudor of today has not drifted away from the original vision while strictly adhering to the fundamentals of excellence the design of a tudor watch reinterprets a rich history to create something truly unique – a bold fusion of the original and the contemporary in an unrivalled propositiona tudor watch is born to dare“we keep the best of the past the best watchmaking practices the best designs”“and push the boundaries of what’s new”tudor’s reinvention of the classics has kept their watches distinctive for more than half a century never afraid to redefine the rules tudor’s new watches are strongly connected to the past while incorporating stcentury technology they also never shy away from pushing the boundaries of what’s new experimenting with unusual materials combinations and inspirationsconsider when tudor decided to revisit their diver’s watch history they drew inspiration from the past while embracing modernity the tudor black bay has direct antecedents in some of the most iconic tudor watches the  oyster prince submariner reference  contributed its oversized crown and general lines while the ‘snowflake’ tudor submariner worn by the french navy in the s offered up its unique angular hands classic designs contemporised for a new centurythe black bay bronze incorporates a goldentoned marinegrade aluminium bronze case specifically chosen for its proven durability in marine environments that this alloy develops a unique patina overtime while paying tribute to tudor’s longstanding relationship with the french navy is a bonusbut design is nothing without performance indeed the black

zone it is designed to perform in all and every condition from a refined evening out to the most extreme environments imaginableover the years tudor watches have been put at test on a daily basis strapped on the wrist of the most daring individuals on land racing through rough alpine roads on ice accompanying the british north greeland expedition in the air issued to the para rescue teams of the us air force and underwater with the frogmen of the french navy they never deceived them constantly delivering robust and reliable timekeepingtoday from pure purposebuilt tool watches to timeless

waterproofness and robustness beyond industry standardsa tudor watch is born to go above and beyond“for those who are up for anything those who face their fears those who reinventthemselves every day”the wearers of a tudor today are not so very different to those of the past they are people with unconventional attitudes people with ambition people who are willing to pursue their passions – no

decor but that doesn’t mean you can’t have both find pieces that fit the style of your space but also offer versatility for all situations for example if you are short on space look for a dining table with an insert so you can keep it small but expand it when you have more guests simple dining chairs can easily be dressed up with chair cushions or covers so something less trendy and more classic will last you for years small bistro tables and bar tables are great for casual meals as well as doing homework or small crafts take your time while shopping for furniture for your kitchen or dining

born to dare manifesto  tudor watches home watches inside tudor store locator my selection “we’re devoted to the classic but reject the status quo”born from the will to go beyond the standards tudor’s watchmaking philosophy draws its inspiration from its heritage while incorporating stateoftheart technology exclusive innovations and pioneering creativitycreated by the founder of rolex hans wilsdorf the tudor watch company was born with a mission to explore new territories offering “a watch that his agents could sell at a more modest price than his rolex watches and yet could attain its standards of dependability”the tudor of today has not drifted away from the original vision while strictly adhering to the fundamentals of excellence the design of a tudor watch reinterprets a rich history to create something truly unique – a bold fusion of the original and the contemporary in an unrivalled propositiona tudor watch is born to dare“we keep the best of the past the best watchmaking practices the best designs”“and push the boundaries of what’s new”tudor’s reinvention of the classics has kept their watches distinctive for more than half a century never afraid to redefine the rules tudor’s new watches are strongly connected to the past while incorporating stcentury technology they also never shy away from pushing the boundaries of what’s new experimenting with unusual materials combinations and inspirationsconsider when tudor decided to revisit their diver’s watch history they drew inspiration from the past while embracing modernity the tudor black bay has direct antecedents in some of the most iconic tudor watches the  oyster prince submariner reference  contributed its oversized crown and general lines while the ‘snowflake’ tudor submariner worn by the french navy in the s offered up its unique angular hands classic designs contemporised for a new centurythe black bay bronze incorporates a goldentoned marinegrade aluminium bronze case specifically chosen for its proven durability in marine environments that this alloy develops a unique patina overtime while paying tribute to tudor’s longstanding relationship with the french navy is a bonusbut design is nothing without performance indeed the black bay incorporates a supremely robust manufacture calibre that took the tudor rd team  years to develop boasting a generous hour power reserve exceptional ergonomics and independentlycertified precision it sets higher standards tudor standardsa tudor watch is born to raise standards“born for a purpose fieldtested to the extreme”a tudor watch is built for those who dare to step out of their comfort zone it is designed to perform in all and every condition from a refined evening out to the most extreme environments imaginableover the years tudor watches have been put at test on a daily basis strapped on the wrist of the most daring individuals on land racing through rough alpine roads on ice accompanying the british north greeland expedition in the air issued to the para rescue teams of the us air force and underwater with the frogmen of the french navy they never deceived them constantly delivering robust and reliable timekeepingtoday from pure purposebuilt tool watches to timeless elegant dress watches the tudor collection perpetuates that spirit of supreme dependability having every single watch undergo a strict and demanding testing protocol guaranteeing precision waterproofness and robustness beyond industry standardsa tudor watch is born to go above and beyond“for those who are up for anything those who face their fears those who reinventthemselves every day”the wearers of a tudor today are not so very different to those of the past they are people with unconventional attitudes people with ambition people who are willing to pursue their passions – no matter where they take them like tudor they believe in learning from and building on past experiences to inform how they think and behave todaytudor wearers seek to find experiences that expand their world view they appreciate exceptional craftsmanship and sense they are as interested in how something is made as they are in what it is intended to do they insist on owning the best tools for the job and pride themselves on being in the knowthose who wear a tudor share a thirst for discovery a spirit of adventure and the will to go further they are
