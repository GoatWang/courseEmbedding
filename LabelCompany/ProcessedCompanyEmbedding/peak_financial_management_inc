core beliefs allocate carefully – it is widely accepted that how money is distributed to different asset classes such as bonds stocks emerging markets alternatives etc is a prime determinant of portfolio performance we never use a blackbox formula for the allocation decision but set allocations based on the specific needs of each client diversify liberally – history proves that any investment can move in any direction at any time with no warning we utilize mutual funds and exchange traded funds containing dozens to thousands of securities to reduce exposure to any single company geography or industry we do not pick individual stocks and bonds maintain objectivity – as a feeonly advisor we sell no financial products and receive no compensation of any kind from any product
