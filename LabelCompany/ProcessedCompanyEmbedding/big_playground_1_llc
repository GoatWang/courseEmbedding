httpwwwimaginationplaygroundcom creators of the breakthrough big blue blocks play space concept that encourages childdirected unstructured free play announced today the introduction of its new connectors set into the imagination playground family of products connectors is a kit of parts suitable for use in a classroom setting and a variety of indoor and outdoor sites that provide children the opportunity to engage in openended free play a key differentiating feature of connectors is the incorporation of over  new shapes allowing for movable parts and more stable joints enabling children to engage in advanced forms of construction activity such as the building of simple machines insects costumes and vehicles david krishock president and ceo of imagination playground said “with the big blue blocks we introduced all the creative block stacking connecting and channeling imaginable now with connectors we’re seeing kids clamp couple link and create joints and junctions i can’t think of a more powerful way to fuel children’s ingenuity and their drive to dream and invent” imagination playground’s connectors are an appropriate engaging and effective stem tool for learning through exploring mechanical connections and structures observational studies on children playing with connectors showed that this new building set appeals not only to early childhood audiences but even more so to children ages  and up children playing with connectors were observed to imagine and engineer robots cars insects animals characters wearables and numerous other creations demonstrating innovation beyond the act of simple construction the movable parts and portability of their designs also added to the complexity of the dramatic and symbolic play activity that ensued after building the connectors set supports both openended exploration and directed learning additional benefits provided include improved focus and persistence increased agility experimentation and creative confidence along with the development of fine motor skills the connectors set consists of  different shapes and can be used by itself or in conjunction with the imagination playground medium
