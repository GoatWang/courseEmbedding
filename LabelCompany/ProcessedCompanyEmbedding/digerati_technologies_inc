deferred tax assets for which it does not consider realization of such assets to be more likely than not   since january   the company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the authoritative guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board on income taxes which addresses how an entity should recognize measure and present in the financial statements uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in a tax return pursuant to this guidance the company recognizes a tax benefit only if it is “more likely than not” that a particular tax position will be sustained upon examination or audit to the extent the “more likely than not” standard has been satisfied the benefit associated with a tax position is measured as the largest amount that is greater than  likely of being realized upon settlement we had  in accrued liabilities as of april   and july   respectively for the purpose of settling a potential tax obligation   cash and cash equivalents   the company considers all bank deposits and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents   oil and gas properties   the company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas properties and accordingly exploration costs other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells are charged to expense as incurred the costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether the wells have discovered proved commercial reserves if proved commercial reserves are not discovered such drilling costs are expensed other exploration costs including geological and geophysical costs and delay rentals on unproved leaseholds are charged to exploration expense as incurred the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of oil and gas are capitalized costs to operate and maintain field equipment are expensed as incurred direct costs of acquiring developed or undeveloped leasehold acreage including lease bonuses brokerage and other fees are capitalized a gain or loss is recognized when a property is sold or an entire field ceases to

raises substantial doubt about digerati’s ability to continue as a going concern the current working capital deficit of  includes  in accrued liabilities accounted for as an uncertain tax position   management plans to continue as a going concern   management believes that current available resources will not be sufficient to fund the company’s operations over the next  months the company’s ability to continue to meet its obligations and to achieve its business objectives is dependent upon among other things raising additional capital issuing stockbased compensation to certain members of the executive management team in lieu of cash or generating sufficient revenue in excess of costs at such time as the company requires additional funding the company will seek to secure such additional funding from various possible sources including equity or debt financing sales of assets or collaborative arrangements if the company raises additional capital through the issuance of equity securities or securities convertible into equity stockholders will experience dilution and such securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of common stock or convertible senior notes if the company raises additional funds by issuing debt the company may be subject to limitations on its operations through debt covenants or other restrictions if the company obtains additional funds through arrangements with collaborators or strategic partners the company may be required to relinquish its rights to certain technologies there can be no assurance that the company will be able to raise additional funds or raise them on acceptable terms if the company is unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms it may be unable to execute its business plan the company could be required to curtail its operations and the company may not be able to pay off its obligations if and when they come due   the company will continue to work with various bestefforts funding sources to secure additional debt and equity financings however digerati cannot offer any assurance that it will be successful in executing the aforementioned plans to continue as
