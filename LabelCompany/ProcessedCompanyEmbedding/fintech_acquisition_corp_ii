option in full will be placed in a trust account held at jpmorgan chase bank na located in the united states with continental stock transfer  trust company acting as trustee  these expenses are estimates only our actual expenditures for some or all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein for example we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination if we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry subject to industry specific regulation we may incur additional expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel in addition our staffing needs may vary and as a result we may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence we do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses which fluctuations to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific category of expenses would not be available for our expenses we are also entitled to pay our franchise and income taxes up to  of working capital expenses and up to  of dissolution expenses from interest earned on the trust account  to the extent that we need working

i the consummation of our initial business combination ii the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to consummate a business combination within  months from the completion of this offering excluding any exercise of the underwriters’ overallotment option subject to applicable law iii the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem  of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within  months from the completion of this offering excluding any exercise of the underwriters’ overallotment option or iv otherwise upon our liquidation or if our board of directors resolves to liquidate the trust account and ceases to pursue the consummation of a business combination prior to the expiration of the  month period our board of directors may determine to liquidate the trust account prior to such expiration if it determines in its business judgment that it is improbable within the remaining time to identify an attractive business combination or satisfy regulatory and other business and legal requirements to consummate a business combination the net proceeds held in the trust account excluding any deferred underwriting commissions may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete a business combination if we pay for our initial business combination using stock or debt securities or if we do not use all of the funds released from the trust account for payment of the purchase price in connection with our business combination we may use the remaining cash released from the trust account for general corporate purposes including for maintenance or expansion of the operations of acquired businesses the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating the initial business combination to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital we believe that the net proceeds from this offering and the private placement held out of trust interest income on the amount in the trust account that may be released to fund working capital requirements and amounts which our sponsor has committed to lend to us for working capital prior to our initial business combination will be sufficient to pay our costs and expenses prior to our initial business combination this belief is based on the fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in connection with an indication of interest we intend to undertake indepth due diligence depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective acquisition only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination however if our estimate of the costs of undertaking indepth due diligence and negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so we may be required to raise additional capital the amount availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable in this event we could seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from members of our management team but such members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to or invest in us our sponsor fintech investor holdings ii llc has committed to loan us up to an aggregate of  to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering  of which has been loaned as of the date of this prospectus these loans are noninterest bearing unsecured and due at the earlier of june   or the completion of this offering in addition in order to fund transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination our sponsor has committed to loan us funds as may be required up to a maximum of  which will be repaid only upon the consummation of an initial business combination if we do not consummate an initial business combination we may use a portion of any working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts however no proceeds from the trust account may be used for such repayment other than up to  of interest income earned thereon if such funds are insufficient to repay the loan amounts the unpaid amounts would be forgiven any part or all of such loans may be converted into additional warrants at  per onehalf of one warrant warrants to purchase a maximum of  whole shares if the full  is loaned and that amount is converted into warrants of the postbusiness combination entity at the option of our sponsor the warrants would be identical to the placement warrants issued to our sponsor if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules our initial holders directors officers or their respective affiliates may purchase shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions either prior to or following the consummation of our initial business combination although as of the date of this prospectus apart from the purchase of the placement units they have no commitments plans or intentions to engage in such transactions if they do effect such purchases we anticipate that they would approach a limited number of large holders of our securities that have voted against the business combination or sought redemption of their shares or that have indicated an intention to do so and engage in direct negotiations for the purchase of such holders’ positions all holders approached in this manner would be institutional or sophisticated holders there is no limit on the number of shares they may acquire our initial holders directors officers advisors or their affiliates will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or during a restricted period under regulation m under the exchange act or in transactions that would violate section a or rule b under the exchange act although they do not currently anticipate paying any premium purchase price for such public shares there is no limit on the price they may pay they may also enter into transactions to provide such holders with incentives to acquire shares or vote their shares in favor of an initial business combination we will notify stockholders of such material purchases or arrangements that would affect the vote on an initial business combination if any by press release filing a form k or by means of a supplement to our proxy statement no funds in the trust account may be used to effect purchases of shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than  upon consummation of our initial business combination moreover the redemption threshold may be further limited by the terms and conditions of our initial business combination if the amount of redemptions plus any cash required by our initial business combination would cause our net tangible assets to fall below  we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or the business combination and instead may search for an alternate business combination a public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earlier to occur of i the consummation of our initial business combination ii the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to consummate a business combination within  months from the completion of this offering excluding any exercise of the underwriters’ overallotment option subject to applicable law iii the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem  of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within  months from the completion of this offering excluding any exercise of the underwriters’ overallotment option or iv otherwise upon our liquidation or in the event our board of directors resolves to liquidate the trust account and ceases to pursue the consummation of a business combination prior to the expiration of the  month period our board of directors may determine to liquidate the trust account prior to such expiration if it determines in its business judgment that it is improbable within the remaining time that we will be able to identify an attractive acquisition target or satisfy regulatory and other business and legal requirements to consummate a business combination in no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account the initial holders and cantor fitzgerald have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and placement shares i in connection with the consummation of a business combination ii in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem  of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within  months from the completion of this offering excluding any exercise of the underwriters’ overallotment option and iii if we fail to consummate a business combination within the  month period or if we liquidate prior to the expiration of the  month period the initial holders have also agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to public shares in connection with the consummation of a business combination or a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem  of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within the  month period however if the initial holders or any of our officers directors or affiliates acquires public shares they will be entitled to redemption rights with respect to such public shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination or liquidate within the required time period in addition cantor fitzgerald will have the same redemption rights as a public stockholder with respect to any public shares it acquires cantor fitzgerald has informed us that it has no current commitments plans or intentions to acquire any public shares for its own account however if cantor fitzgerald does acquire public shares it will do so in the ordinary course of its business cantor fitzgerald will not make any such purchases when it is in possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller during a restricted period under regulation m under the exchange act in transactions that would violate section a or rule b under the exchange act or if prohibited by applicable state securities laws or brokerdealer regulations in identifying evaluating and selecting a target business for a business combination we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours including other blank check companies private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates moreover many of these competitors possess greater financial technical human and other resources than us our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources this inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business furthermore our obligation to pay cash to our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for an initial business combination in addition the number of our outstanding warrants and the future dilution they potentially represent may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination company description we are a blank check company formed in may  that will seek to effect a merger capital stock exchange asset acquisition stock purchase reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or assets which we refer to throughout this prospectus as our initial business combination to date our efforts have been limited to organizational activities and activities relating to this offering we have not identified any acquisition target and we have not nor has anyone on our behalf initiated any discussions directly or indirectly with respect to identifying any acquisition target we have generated no revenues to date and we do not expect that we will generate operating revenues at the earliest until we consummate our initial business combination we currently intend to concentrate our efforts in identifying businesses providing technological services to the financial services industry with particular emphasis on businesses that provide data processing storage and transmission services data bases and payment processing services we are not however required to complete our initial business combination with a financial technology business and as a result we may pursue a business combination outside of that industry we will seek to acquire established businesses that we believe are fundamentally sound but potentially in need of financial operational strategic or managerial redirection to maximize value we do not intend to acquire startup companies companies with speculative business plans or companies that are excessively leveraged  we anticipate structuring our initial business combination to acquire  of the equity interest or assets of the target business or businesses however we may structure our initial business combination to acquire less than  of the equity interest or assets of the target business but only if we or any entity that is a successor to us in a business combination acquire a majority of the outstanding voting securities or assets of the target we believe that if we own a majority of the target’s outstanding voting securities we will not be required to register as an investment company under the investment company act of  as amended or the investment company act since the securities of a majority owned subsidiary that is not itself deemed an investment company are not deemed to be “investment securities” as defined in the investment company act and since we expect that  or more of the value of our total assets excluding government securities and cash will be represented by the securities of our target business which we expect will be an operating business even if we own a majority interest in the target our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post business combination company depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction nasdaq rules require that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least  of the balance in the trust account less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination the fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community such as discounted cash flow valuation or value of comparable businesses if our board is not independently able to determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of
