santa bárbara mission archivelibrary helping to tell the stories of the southwest skip to content homeabout ← a birthday celebration merry christmas and happy holidays → deakin conservation project mission nuestra señora de la soledad in the spotlight posted on december   by miorozco painting in regenerated frame photo by virginia and robert guess cannot be reproduced without permission by virginia and robert guess edwin deakin  developed his artistic talents in depicting landscape and architecture scenes before he set out to paint the twentyone missions of alta california he completed three series in the late s two in oil and one in watercolor in each painting deakin documented the structures remaining at the mission by the end of the nineteenth century and captured the landscape to reflect the mood of the time in  one of the two series in oil was donated to the franciscan friars of the province of saint barbara with the proviso the paintings remain on view at old mission santa barbara and that the set never be broken in  dr monica orozco director of santa bárbara mission archivelibrary initiated a conservation fund to preserve these paintings on display at the archivelibrary by seeking donors to sponsor a painting of their choice we chose to sponsor deakin’s painting of mission nuestra señora de la soledad as he portrayed it in its ruined and abandoned state this window into the past reminded us of the hardships of early mission life and of those who participated in the colonization of alta california mission soledad endured numerous disasters the original church built at the perimeter of a quadrangle was damaged three times by flooding of the salinas river before being abandoned in  religious services were transferred to a small chapel at the opposite end of the quadrangle that was utilized until  when the mission was finally closed in his painting deakin captured the ruins of this chapel and the adjacent convento he most likely depended on earlier images and other artists’ renditions using the remaining adobe walls of the mission chapel as inspiration for his work with sponsorship came the opportunity to observe the conservation process as well as to view the verso or back of the painting where deakin added information to personalize his work fortunately the painting had no cracking on the painted surface and required only meticulous cleaning to reveal the original colors at fine art conservation lab httpwwwfineartconservationlabcom in santa barbara owned by scott m haskins a team of expert conservators used uptodate technology and materials to stabilize the painting conservation involved cleaning the surface of grey matter mainly the soot and grime collected over the years and the old varnish yellowed through aging after careful cleaning the conservators applied new varnish using a product that will not yellow over time once stabilized the painting was returned to its original frame that had been strengthened and the paint regenerated the removal of dust layers and addition of a protective coating restored luster to the wooden frame conservation is expected to last for generations given the proper conditions of controlled lighting and minimal exposure to atmospheric pollutants that mission santa bárbara archivelibrary provides this slideshow requires javascript on the verso of nuestra señora de la soledad deakin signed his name the date the mission was established “october  ” and those franciscan friars present at the founding ”lasuen” fray fermín francisco de lasuén presidente of the alta california missions from  to  “sitjar” fray buenaventura sitjar who was assigned to nearby mission san antonio de padua at the time and “garcia” fray diego garcía who directed mission soledad until  the latter franciscan friar is not to be confused with the first bishop of the california missions bishop francisco garcía diego y moreno  in addition deakin included on the verso what is purported to be a deakin “coat of arms” above his signature little is known about this heraldic symbol other than some art historians suggest that deakin born in england in  had a penchant for english aristocracy and invented his own “coat of arms” or “family crest” that he often drew on the back of many of his paintings this slideshow requires javascript today mission nuestra señora de la soledad appears quite different from his painting in  restoration of the chapel was completed under the auspices of the native daughters of the golden west using only one front corner of the adobe wall seen in deakin’s painting the attached convento reconstructed in  now serves as a museum only a few foundation stones and floor tiles remain at the site of the original church although nuestra señora de la soledad is one of the more remote and least visited of the california missions it represents the difficulties the franciscan friars faced in establishing mission communities and then their rapid

engagement member of the executive team no marketing function  staff  direct reports twitter triscasb related  tips for achieving cmocio alignment enabling the right business structure for digital transformation brand post digital foundations essential for optimal customer engagement the proposed deregulation of australia’s university sector allowing public universities to potentially set their own fees for undergraduates was one of the biggest stories for australian media over the past year it’s also been an impetus for change right across these institutions and not least for their marketing functionsfaced with the demands of the next generation of digital natives for omnichannel learning and experiences as well as the need to sharpen up their approach to student acquisition retention and advocacy marketers in the university sector have had a renewed emphasis on keeping their brands fresh and relevantwhile the bill has not been passed by the australian senate any deregulatory moves will increase the commercial dependence on brand and reduce the reliance upon australian tertiary admittance rank atar scores as the key quantifier of value deakin university’s executive director of marketing trisca scottbranagan saysempowered and longterm thinking “as the university endeavours to meet the needs of connected students marketing’s role to reach understand engage and form relationships has propelled marketing from a servicesbased cost centre into a revenue generating strategic advisor” she says“as the internal voice of the customer marketing is the ‘customer evangelist’ – initiating enabling and driving marketoriented decisions beyond the scope of traditional marketing responsibilities”as a result deakin’s marketing team is focused on maximising roi through realtime dynamic relevant and personalised communication scottbranagan says“digital and data analysis are key enablers for achieving a more onetoone as opposed to onetomany relationship with students” she saystop marketing attributesscottbranagan sees the role of the cmo as empowering people to reach their full potential“it’s about being empathetic towards the customers you serve and curiosity about the markets you operate in” she says “the cmo must also be an authentic story teller who enables collaboration towards a common cause has persistency and adaptability in the face of change and disruption and a commitment to performance“marketing’s success will be a direct correlation of the cmo’s ability to communicate with clarity rationalise and lead across all levels”innovation marketers also play a major role in innovation for scottbranagan innovation is not always about doing something completely new“it’s a mindset  one that is open to looking at things differently enabling both small and big stepchanges with a willingness to fail fast and fail forward” she saysfrom the cmo submissionbusiness contribution and innovation for much of the past year the market had been waiting to discover whether the deregulation bill would pass and what it will dictate decisions at deakin university therefore had to be made strategies and models built operations adjusted and marketing communication scenarios ready to go by march in her cmo submission scottbranagan detailed her work as part of deakin’s ‘pricing task force’ a select group of executives that used scenario planning to develop alternate pricing models her role throughout the process included brand audience and marketing advice and leadership to ensure that whatever changes were made these
