story archive subscribe to this blog select feed service rss feed projections are very realistic how realistic are the projections for an increase in nuclear power plants in the coming decades and what can the us learn from the experience europe has had with nuclear power in sum very realistic our experience in the uk has shown that if you are seriously committed to a lowcarbon reliable and diverse energy mix with the strictest modern safety measures then you must consider nuclear energy nuclear power should be part of an energy mix that can meet the twin challenges of energy security and climate change for this reason we have backed an expansion of nuclear power which has broad based political support based on a white paper in  weve put into motion the policy and investment wheels to reinvigorate the uks nuclear energy industry we created the office of nuclear development dedicated to working with business to remove bureaucratic barriers and enabling investment in the uk from the earliest possible date with no cap on the amount of new build further by pricing carbon appropriately through our emissions trading scheme we can expect investment from the industry to ramp up over the next decade already we have seen significant investment interest from a number of british and international companies our first new nuclear power station is set to be operational by  we recognize that waste decommissioning and nonproliferation are serious issues for any country investing in a nuclear energy future we will approve new power stations only if industry proposals can demonstrate they have effective arrangements for managing the waste they produce and funds to pay for the decommissioning the uk experience offers useful pointers for other countries a number of our european partners are also looking at boosting their nuclear energy programs but ultimately every country has to design its own energy policy that balances considerations like energy independence a greater reliance on clean energy and what is best for its economy by nigel sheinwald    october    am et save  share                  previous not for avoiding dangerous climate change  next nuclear only a partial answer comments please report offensive comments below i recall seeing christie on pbs  former head of epa saying cheney came down and demanded she turn over her research maps showing serious temperature rise and flooding in the south recently i began wondering why bush sought to liquidate the housing sector in  i think cheney and bush knew flooding would bring a crisis to us insurance sector and pop the housing sector anyway figured they might as well get something for it  all the while denying it i also say  global warming is debatable but all this flooding  is not  of greenlands ice cap gone  not debatable i saw the insurance sector on cspan two years ago with those very maps  stating coastal properties are costing them too much and they have to raise their premiums i find it peculiar countrywide had a high percentage of coastal mortgage policies i now question when bush in  when he came out of the blue saying forget the down payment forget the fine print just turn on fox where were running our countrywide and ditech ads   and go git your home and remember if youre not with us yer a terrorist i recall those days very well now it makes sense why bush would all of a sudden care about the african american communities when bush projected cra pushed mortgages should expand to  billion by  and they have bush created inflation in housing which was followed by deflation in the meantime  goldman and crew made out like bandits processing those phony loans remember comptroller of currency dugan says countrywide didnt go to the banks banks would have laughed a zero down payment bush arranged mortgage product out the door they went to wall street all the while denying melting ice flodding and now look  look at the south  the impact from flooding is going to crush the us insurance sector  years ago they had near  billion extra in reserves to handle claims  with all this flooding  that will be gone sooner than you can say  aig really deserved the money it got to insure goldman this was one clever fleecing  bush and family actually found a way to sell the land in america  keep the rewards for initial loans and last i checked  bush is no where to be found in any press dont forget  september th no  not   when bush sought to control fannie and freddie and take the whole ball of wax httpdirectorblueblogspotcomfanniemaenewyorktimesridestohtml the closed door energy policy meetings by cheney for enron txu exxon exelon etc those were to assure final profits could be made remember if mean ole global warming is real  oil is a useless product and we cant have that can we coal is a useless product possibly with liabilities to the coal industry cant have that either therefore global warming isnt real augh weve all been robbed and kicked in the stomach by this former alleged administration and where was the runoff election in the us  we just had a private council of  people decide bush must have won is this real  is it  posted by organiclime  november    am report offensive comment bottom line the usa establishment is heavily invested into oil and coal and high prices in both are very good for them carter was a agent of standard oil and coal and solar and wind power is no competition posted by williamblake  october    am report offensive comment i doubt britain had to deal with as many crazy nut jobs as we do in the us why couldn’t harry reid ralph nader amory lovin and ed markey come from britain and promote their antinuclear diatribe their the answer is the british electorate won’t put up with these types of antinuclear fear mongers in britain they base their discussions on science not fear in fact they look at fear mongers as people who are bit mentally unstable they look at giving creditability to a fear monger as the same they would to following a crazy over a cliff if lovins and markey raised the same type of antinuclear rhetoric in britain as they do here they would loose all creditability and be seen as the true nut jobs that they are i am not saying that britain does not have to deal with their own nimby not in my back yard factor but our us nimby’s have significantly more influence our us judicial system will give standing to any nimby regardless of how ludicrous their argument is even our own media be it cnn fox the washington post or glenn beck has a significant economic advantage to give a voice to any nimby who asks to be in the spot light it is preposterous stupid and inane to give credence to anyone that does not have sound science to back up their arguments but this does not stop our media from giving a stage and thus creditability to crazies like nader lovins and the other antinuclear fear mongers what ever happened to the scientific editors is it not the scientific editor’s role to fight the temptation of giving a voice to these fear mongers the sad fact is it is more important to have readers viewers and listeners than it is to preserve ones own media integrity today’s scientific editors are seen as more of a hindrance to the bottom line than that of a liability i guess the quick buck wins over the public good once again let’s build  new nuke plants now and save the planet jfarmer posted by jfarmer  october    pm report offensive comment the comments to this entry are closed   rss feed
