moving from the talking and planning stage to the start of actual construction while the project has not moved as quickly as many had hoped greenup county judgeexecutive bobby carpenter is right when he says the waiting “will be well worth it when we do get them here”note carpenter’s use of the word “when” instead of “if” plans for south shore coke plant have advanced so far it would be a major surprise — and an even bigger disappointment — if it is not builtin the latest step aimed at turning the proposed plant into a reality suncoke energy south shore llc of lisle ill is seeking approval for construction of a megawatt plant in conjunction with the proposed coke plant to be built on about  acres along the ohio river near south shore the company proposes building an electrical generation plant powered by efficient use of compounds left behind in the cokemaking process approval of its construction would be a crucial step forward to greenup county’s economic development said ashland alliance president tim gibbs “it’s an important project” said gibbs in response to the announcement wednesday that the kentucky state board on electric generation and transmission siting has received an application requesting a construction certificate for the electric generating plant and an associated electric transmission line in northern greenup county“it’s a significant investment in greenup and there will be some jobs involved as well” gibbs said adding the proposed coke plant and power generation system offer significant advancements from traditional cokemaking processes “it’s so much more efficient it’s more of a closedloop system than we’ve seen in the past”people in this region do not have to look far to get a good idea of what the new coke plant will be like it will be modeled after the existing suncoke energy plant in haverhill ohio and that plant cannot be compared to the old ak steel coke plant in ashland coke and the old coke plant in new boston ohio those two plants fouled the air for generations and were tolerated only because they provided goodpaying industrial jobsa modern shopping center that includes walmart now stands on the site of the old new boston plant but it took years of cleanup to prepare that land for new development meanwhile the ak coke plant has been demolished and the property mostly cleared but environmental problems still must be eliminated before new construction can take place on the more than  acres on the sitewhen you hear of construction of a new coke plant on the shores of the ohio river don’t think of the old coke plants in new boston and ashland the suncoke energy plant in south shore will not be a duplicate of the haverhill plant instead it will include improvements added since the completion of that plant hundreds of motorists drive past the haverhill plant just off us  without even noticing it that certainly was not the case of the old plants in new boston and ashland one sniff of the air and you knew where you werecarpenter said suncoke energy “is just a numberone type of company” with a proven environmental record the county judge added the suncoke project has been in the works for several years and will bring “good highpaying jobs” to the regionsuncoke energy south shore llc a subsidiary of suncoke energy inc will produce coke used in steelmaking coke production involves heating coal to drive off volatile compounds leaving behind a material that is pure carbon the proposed suncoke plant would capture and burn the volatile compounds to produce steam which would drive a turbine to generate electricityconnection to the electric grid would be via a kilovolt transmission line to an american electric power co substation about a mile away in new boston the electricity would be sold on the open wholesale market the deadline to file requests for intervention a formal evidentiary hearing or a local public hearing in the suncoke energy case is nov  more information about the public participation process is available on the siting board websitealthough we may be proven wrong we can’t imagine the proposed plant being controversial in many ways it will simply help replace the ancient coke plants in ashland and new boston with a much much cleaner and more efficient way to convert coal into coke that’s a good thing advertisers photos from the vault click here to see photos

proposed  fee in boyd county the boyd county  center needs help with funding the center had relied on landline charges but since residents are dropping landlines and switching to cell phones only the center is facing a budget shortfall at first the fiscal court planned to attach a  per parcel fee but some residents who own multiple parcels of property felt the fee was unfair and spoke out against it the county appointed a committee to try to find alternative ways to fund the center in the new year you voted im in favor i dont like it there must be a better option i dont like it but we need the
