doing crossfit for about  years now growing up i played every sport you can imagine but eventually put all of my focus into playing football i played football in college for a few years and rugby for all four years  before graduating college i thought about going overseas to play rugby once i graduated but after sustaining a few injuries i thought it would be best to stop i continued to stay fit by running and working out at  hour fitness but it was starting to get bored of it rather quickly i needed to find something that would allow me to train toward being competitive in some sort of way i spoke to an old friend i played rugby with and he told me that i should try crossfit july of 2 i began my crossfit journey at a local box called crossfit pandemic i remember before doing the wod which was grace i thought to myself but it’s only 5lbs well those 5lbs kicked my butt and that was when i knew that i wanted to compete in crossfit after the  crossfit open i was very fortunate to compete for the first time at the  southern california crossfit regionals on a team it was a very humbling experience and hope that i can compete as an individual at regionals and make it to the crossfit
