volatility that occurred in late summer and early fall to reap the rewards over the course of the year investments in diversified portfolios of us and european large company common stocks and good quality bonds generally did well investments in small company common stocks emerging market stocks and bonds and low quality bonds generally experienced lower or negative returns the backdrop of decent growth in corporate profits and the general economy low inflation accommodating monetary policy and interest rates moving to low levels ultimately gave investors the confidence to bid up the values of good quality investments in  prices of many financial assets now stand at the high end of historical valuation levels in order for these levels to be maintained and move higher over the shortterm the favorable conditions mentioned earlier probably need to persist from a longterm perspective we have found that investments in portfolios of securities similar to those owned by the funds covered in this report tend to achieve returns that are competitive with alternative investments which possess similar risks the following table presents total return information for the state farm

market fund     inception date january    inception date january   as we present this first annual report covering the funds to you i cannot resist imparting a bit of philosophy which is deeply seeded in our investment activities at state farm uncertainty always exists in all aspects of life including investments in financial markets investors can cope with the uncertainties of financial markets by viewing their investments in the suitable funds as longterm investments and regularly making periodic investments in the funds shares funds should be selected to match an investors longterm investment objectives and tolerances for risk we encourage investors to be patient and to be prepared to ride out market fluctuations large and small which will inevitably occur in our opinion the primary challenge for any investor is development of a longterm investment program which makes one comfortable regardless of what shortterm direction markets take this longterm approach is particularly appropriate since the variable products involve fees and charges which are described in the prospectus i have included a discussion on the us economy us equity market us bond market and international economies and markets on pages  and  s kurt r moser  the state farm variable deferred annuity product total returns reflect all contractlevel and underlying fund fees and expenses including the imposition of the maximum surrender charge of  where indicated the fees and expenses are based on an assumed average account size of  the total return period begins on the fund inception date as noted and ends on december   these total returns apply only to the state farm life insurance company product and not to the state farm life and accident assurance company product the state farm life and accident assurance company does not yet have sufficient performance history to calculate total returns the state farm variable universal life product total returns reflect all contractlevel and underlying fund fees and expenses except for surrender charges and the cost of insurance if the cost of insurance were reflected the performance quoted would be significantly lower than shown please refer to the hypothetical illustrations in the state farm variable universal life prospectus to see how the cost of insurance can impact performance we encourage you to obtain a personalized illustration of historical performance that reflects the cost of insurance the fees and expenses reflected in this calculation are based on an assumed average account size of  the total return period begins on the product effective registration date of february   and ends december   these total returns apply only to the state farm life insurance company product and not to the state farm life and

offset weakness on the manufacturing side where weak export demand and intense overseas competition have been taking their toll our country is in its eighth consecutive year of generally good economic times consumers continue to be willing to spend money for goods and services as they are encouraged by high levels of employment and growth in personal income low levels of inflation and interest rates have combined with good investment returns to further bolster consumer confidence growth in us real gross domestic product for  was  for the fourth quarter of  growth of the real gross domestic product was a surprisingly strong  the recent report on fourth quarter economic activity even showed some improvement in two of the economys weak spots manufacturing and exports however one probably should not be too eager to proclaim these weak sectors as being healthy again it is fairly apparent that approximately  of the world economy is either stagnant or in recession concentrated primarily

trended downward significantly interestingly the magnitude of interest rate declines was much less for bonds with lower credit ratings in fact contrary to the general falling trend in interest rates yields have actually risen on bonds carrying ratings below investment grade these movements display investors preferences for higher quality assets during times when financial markets across the globe

international capital flows international economies and markets virtually all international economies are currently exhibiting economic conditions which are much weaker than we are experiencing in the
