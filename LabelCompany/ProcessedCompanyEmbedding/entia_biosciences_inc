of deerfield beach florida the exclusive worldwide rights to manufacture and distribute its proprietary groh ® beauty care product line  the license also has a companion agreement that provides for entia to manufacture and supply its proprietary ergod ® product for use in groh beauty corps manufacture of the various products within the groh product line  together the license and its companion manufacturing agreement provide entia with an upfront license fee ongoing royalties based on sales of products containing the ergod compound and sales revenue from supply of ergod to groh beauty corp  we are very pleased to be working with groh beauty corp a new business unit of a proven successful developer and marketer of beauty and cosmetic products stated carl j johnson president and chief executive of entia  we are confident that they will generate significant success with the groh brand and look forward to the additional resources that this license will provide to us  this is an alternative but superior approach for entia to the beauty care market and will better contribute to building value for our shareholders than the companys previous efforts in this area  entias  entry into the beauty care market did not achieve the success for which the then management had hoped  entias new management has determined that beauty care is not an appropriate area of strategic focus for the company planning instead upon developing and profitably marketing clinicallyproven health care products that are based upon the companys novel and proprietary ergod technology in the nutritional supplement andor medical food categories  the company is taking aggressive yet carefully planned steps toward that end  dr marvin hausman chief science  technology officer indicated that entia plans to introduce its first healthcare product before mid  the product will likely be introduced as a kidney health supplement  kidney health is a growing concern in the us and around the world  the companys research studies among individuals with compromised kidney function have been quite encouraging if not downright exciting noted hausman  we are anxiously looking forward to the market rollout

and technology officer dr marvin hausman has reported greaterthanexpected initial enrollment in entia’s chronic kidney disease study  this milestone was achieved during his recent kickoff visit to the study’s test sites in columbia south america and on the caribbean island of bonaire  the initial enrollees represent more than  of the quantity of study participants ultimately anticipated to enroll this significant number of patients is actively participating in the stabilization phase of the study chronic kidney disease takes a significant toll on the health of more than  million individuals in the us alone  progression of the disease leads to dialysis and eventually the need for a kidney transplant  the cost to the us healthcare system was reported as  billion in  by the national institutes of health and has been growing at a compound rate of  annually the product being tested is a specific proprietary blend of entia’s patented ergod® technology  entia biosciences is the first company to develop produce and market consumer products with allnatural formulas for the amino acid ergothioneine and enhanced vitamin d   this novel medical food is a supplement to a patient’s existing prescribed regimen of care and is intended to improve iron levels increase production of red blood cells and increase kidney filtration rates  if the study proves successful entia’s ergod product formulation for chronic kidney disease will provide patients with the first allnatural organic medical food product designed to improve the health and wellbeing of the patient enhance the dietary management of the disease and potentially slow its progression dr hausman has been consulting with dr hector rodriguez nephrologist at cedarssinai medical center in los angeles  in an earlier pilot study of the beneficial effects of the ergod formulation dr rodriguez commented “the results of this study provide a basis for the application of ergod medical food to potentially modify the course of chronic kidney disease and the nearly inexorable loss of kidney function that dictates the need for dialysis or transplantation” the application of ergod is not limited to chronic kidney disease entia believes that ergod’s ability to improve iron homeostasis has the potential to mitigate many other conditions related to iron dysfunction  entia plans to address several disease markets all
