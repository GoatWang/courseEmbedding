it requires flow state focus and intuitive movement while giving me an opportunity to be outside travel to spectacular locations and be part of a unique and welcoming community slacklining also connects to my life as a phd student in experimental physics at the university of washington in addition to walking lines i love to understand and explain the physics of line motion and rigging forces i started slacklining in  but at that time i was focused on being an internationally competitive mountain unicyclist slacklining stayed in the background of my life until  when i walked my first
