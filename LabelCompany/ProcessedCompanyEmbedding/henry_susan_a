acsf faculty fellow other cornell affiliations biofuels research laboratory brl  research research overview the research in susan henry’s laboratory focuses on regulation of membrane lipid metabolism in yeast and its coordination with membrane trafficking and signal transduction jesch et al  gaspar et al  gaspar et al  nunez et al  gaspar et al  villa et al  we have shown that signals arising from lipid metabolism in the endoplasmic reticulum er and plasma membrane influence major transcriptional networks in the cell gaspar et al a jesch et al  jesch et al  loewen et al jesch et al  this metabolism influences and is influenced by several major signal transduction pathways including the unfolded protein response pathway chang et al  chang et al  and the proteinkinase pkc pathway sreenivas et al  nunez et al  jesch et al and the glucose response pathway shirra et al  our work has focused on the relationship of transcriptional and metabolic responses to the phospholipid precursor inositol the transcription patterns of over  genes are altered within two hours equivalent to about one doubling time following introduction of inositol statistical analysis identified at least six distinct expression responses jesch et al   including repression of phospholipid biosynthetic genes regulated by opip as well as genes regulated by the upr pathway and transient induction of lipid remodeling genes regulated by mgap these three categories of genes are known to respond to signals arising in the er and the kinetics of the changes in their transcript abundance were rapid occurring within the first  to  minutes following introduction of inositol analysis of changes in lipid metabolism over the same time frame revealed rapid consumption of phosphatidic acid pa which was shown to interact with opip and to be required for its retention in the er loewen et al  consumption of pa results in translocation of opip to the nucleus and repression of phospholipid biosynthetic genes including ino cells defective in protein kinase c pkc signaling proved to be unable to adapt to growth in the absence of inositol wild type cells shifted to inositolfree medium activate pkc signaling via the mpkp protein kinase and the rlmp transcription factor upregulating a number of rlmp target genes cells defective in pkc signaling are unable to mount this transcription response to inositol deficiency and also exhibit major changes in lipid metabolism nunez et al  interruption of inositol sphingolipid synthesis was shown to trigger pkc signaling jesch et al  cells defective in endoplasmic reticulum er to golgi trafficking such as the temperature sensitive sec mutant were shown to exhibit major changes in lipid metabolism upon shift to their restrictive temperature specifically these cells exhibited a rapid decrease in synthesis of phosphatidylinositol pi while pi synthesis in wild type cells increased at higher temperatures simultaneously sec cells increased synthesis of triacylglycerols tag and other neutral lipids and accumulated lipid droplets upon shift to the restrictive temperature sec cells in which structural genes for the major tag synthases were deleted exhibited decreases in their restrictive temperatures indicating that synthesis of tag under conditions in which er to golgi trafficking is impaired is physiologically relevant gaspar et al
