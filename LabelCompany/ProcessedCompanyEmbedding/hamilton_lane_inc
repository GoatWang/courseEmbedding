valuation the company will use some of the proceeds to buy membership units in hamilton lane advisors hla from existing owners and the remaining net proceeds to purchase newly issued membership units in hla so that it can pay down debt we intend to use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering to purchase membership units in hamilton lane advisors llc from certain of its existing owners and the remaining net proceeds to purchase newly issued membership units in hamilton lane advisors llc we expect hamilton lane advisors llc to use these proceeds to repay indebtedness and for general corporate purposes in connection with the reorganization transactions taking place contemporaneously with the closing of this offering certain existing owners of hamilton lane advisors llc will exchange their membership interests for shares of our class a common stock to be held directly and will cease to be members of hamilton lane advisors llc the company will also issue class b shares to certain members of hla which will have ten shares voting power for each share issued effective retaining control of the public entity commentary the desirability of hamilton lanes ipo will hinge on valuation which we dont know about yet the company has a consistent track record of growing revenues each year for the past five years and its profit is growing although less consistently than top line revenues the private investments industry has undergone a significant growth period as the number of publiclyheld companies shrinks however going forward if the current federal administration and congress work to reduce regulation on publiclyheld companies that trend could stabilize or even reverse as companies find going public easier to do in that scenario the effect on hamilton lanes business would be hard to gauge as more ipos may mean better portfolio performance as exits become more numerous but fewer investment opportunities in private companies in any event the company is a potentially attractive public entity given its relatively consistently growing financial performance i write about technology ipos ma followons and secondaries if you want to receive future articles
