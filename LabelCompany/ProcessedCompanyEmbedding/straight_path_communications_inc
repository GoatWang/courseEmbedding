spectrum inventory a this is like saying g is unnecessary due to the existence of g which has not been the conclusion of leaders of the industry and regulators the world over not just of straight path the reason is simple mobile data traffic is growing at a rapidly accelerating rate cisco anticipates that some  billion mobileconnected devices will be online globally by  furthermore cisco anticipates that smartphones will represent threequarters of mobile data traffic by  and threequarters of that mobile traffic will be video driven that means more capacity will be required the sheer number of mobile devices and the resulting traffic they demand require new solutions and more spectrum that is why oems original equipment manufacturers and mnos mobile network operators are working together to set the standards for g this is also why the itu the united nations’ specialized agency for information and communication technologies embarked on a program in  to develop the international mobile telecommunication imt system for  and beyond by “setting the stage for ‘g’ research activities that are emerging around the world” q does g really need mmwaves a g does need mmwave to say the contrary is to contradict the industry consensus for instance at the september gpp ran workshop on g the joint proposal from att intel qualcomm samsung sprint verizon and others supported phase one of the standards to focus on bands at least up  ghz in its ex partes filing as recently as october   – ctia – the wireless association—which represents the interests of among others att sprint tmobile and verizon – stated that “spectrum above  ghz will help complement existing and future mobile broadband services and increase the capacity and capabilities of wireless providers to provide advanced services to the public” ctia went further and said that “spectrum bands above  ghz may yield extensive amounts of contiguous spectrum blocks gigahertz rather than megahertz available in lower spectrum bands potentially allowing the provision of extensive throughput and capacity improvements as compared to other spectrum bands available for mobile services” in resonance with straight path’s thinking ctia continued “the g standards will require increased capacity and data throughput to allow new services to be delivered to consumers including ultra hd video streaming these throughput and capacity increases will require large block sizes and cuttingedge antenna technologies” q with so many other high bandwidth frequencies why is straight path’s spectrum any more valuable than other bands a the fcc is well aware of the other potential frequencies but has focused its nprm pages  upon only four bands of those four bands only two are being proposed to be exclusively licensed those two bands are  ghz and  ghz to quote from ctia’s recent submission again “ctia reiterated its support for an exclusive use licensing framework as much as practicable creating an environment with certainty and predictability through exclusiveuse licensing is critical to promoting investment and fostering innovation in the spectrum above  ghz” operators have a preference for exclusive licenses from the two bands being proposed for exclusive licenses we own over  of the active spectrum and about  of the total including whitespaces what’s more the power limits for unlicensed spectrum governed by part  – as is being proposed for  to  ghz see paragraph  – is substantially more restrictive than the power limits proposed for  ghz and  ghz also important to note is that the componentry for bands above  ghz hasn’t yet achieved the level of power and efficiency required for wide area mobile broadband technology regarding the myth that tens of gigahertz of spectrum will become available as a result of wrc world radiocommunication conference chairman wheeler has explicitly stated “studying all of the spectrum above  ghz would be unfocused and would be resourceintensive while identifying too few bands for study risks the possibility that none becomes viable accordingly we need to identify enough bands likely to yield a successful outcome” the expectation is not to open all proposed bands for mobile services but rather to have a wide enough variety to allow for overlap or global harmonization q what is straight path’s outlook on the fcc’s objective of enabling large blocks of spectrum a straight path has played a critical role in framing the conversation around the fcc’s stated objective of enabling large contiguous blocks of spectrum we believe that flexible use rights rather than overlay rights will give  ghz licensees including straight path the opportunity to engage in mobile operations provided any technical issues are resolved there is strong industry support for flexible use rights for incumbents see paragraph  with footnote  which we believe is a common sense solution that benefits not only incumbents but also the fcc our success in the noi proceeding that led to the substance of the nprm exhibits the outsized impact that we are having in the regulatory framework similarly the joint proposal supporting phase  of the gpp g standards to focus on bands at least up  ghz shows that our advocacy is being felt by industry leaders finally our technology development positions us to engage the industry as both a partner and a resource q what is the timeline for g deployment a we believe the industry can begin rolling out g in mmwaves by  g has always been presented as part of our longterm strategy we continue to take the appropriate steps through both regulatory and industry channels – and the development of new technologies – to ensure that when the market is ready there will be few hurdles to deploying solutions in our spectrum bands q as g the most incomeproducing use for our spectrum is years away will straight path have enough cash to survive until then a we have sufficient capital to meet our needs given our very lean structure we had over  million in cash and cash equivalents at the close of our most recent quarterly reporting that number has actually gone up since our spinoff in  our revenue on the spectrum side is growing as we introduce new radio technology to the us market and our ip division is expected to deliver additional meaningful revenue if the result of the appeal more info here goes in our favor as expected q doesn’t mmwave have a fundamental problem serving indoor locations from outdoor cell sites a mobile operators have historically relied on outsidein deployment for indoor coverage however this approach has inherent deficiency even at traditional cellular frequencies as indoor broadband demand increases mobile operators have responded by adding more indoor base stations in addition mobile operators have also added indoor wifi access points these deployments will continue to persist and expand their indoor presence in a g network using mmwaves we believe the bulk of the value of mobile broadband lies in its ability to provide broadband connectivity for users while on the move – when they don’t have an alternative to access this is where mmwave g truly differentiates itself enabling wide area gbps mobility to the masses at a price people can afford – a unique value proposition that can take the mobile broadband experience to the next level however we do expect mmwave g systems to achieve meaningful indoor coverage with cell density on par with g systems the penetration loss of traditional cellular frequencies and mmwave frequencies depends on the building structure material and the frequency for example the penetration loss through concrete walls is significant for all frequencies including traditional cellular frequencies while the penetration loss through clean glass is only a few dbs even for mmwave frequencies combined with the ability to find the optimal path to transmit and receive it’s possible for outdoor mmwave g base stations to reach deep inside buildings for instance samsung demonstrated that at  ghz “surprisingly amicable indoor coverage results were obtained with only the totally obstructed farthest side of the building resulting in lost connections” note that this result was obtained with a single outdoor base station  meters away from the mobile station inside a sizeable office building  meters long and  meters wide with heavily tinted glass besides until an mmwave g network is completely deployed eg during the initial rollout operators can always fall back to the previous generations of networks for coverage and gradually grow the footprint of g q is it true that mmwave g requires much higher cell density than g a no the statement that mmwave g requires much higher cell density – as high as x denser than g systems – is incorrect a recent report by a shortseller attempted to support this incorrect statement by taking a number that should be applied to an urban area like manhattan and extrapolating it to the whole  million square kilometers of the us the reality is that population density and cell site density vary drastically across geographic areas new york city has a population density of more than  people per square kilometer while almost half of the us land area has less than  people per square kilometer furthermore the study shown in nokia’s comment to the fcc noi – where the  radio nodes per square kilometer cell density is simulated – uses  ghz not  ghz or  ghz it appears that the shortseller’s report selectively chose data and then misapplied it q what’s unique about straight path’s spectrum a one of the key reasons why  ghz and  ghz are so crucial to mmwave g is that the circuit devices in these bands have much better performance in terms of output power efficiency and noise figure than their counterparts in  ghz and eband  –  ghz and  –  ghz this allows mmwave g cells to achieve the  meter –  kilometer range for wide area gbps mobility in fact part of the high cell density requirement in nokia’s  ghz study can be attributed to the limited power and range of the radio nodes assumed in the simulation in addition there is a fundamental difference between licensed and unlicensed spectrum see section f beginning paragraph  and thus the supposition that the unlicensed spectrum in  –  ghz and  –  ghz are of similar value to mobile broadband as the  ghz and  ghz bands is nonsensical the shortseller’s report also failed to recognize the regulatory challenges in enabling mobile services in these bands the report incorrectly asserts that gigahertz after gigahertz of mmwave spectrum can be readily made available for exclusive licensed mobile use in the near future q what’s your view of the broader societal impact of g adoption a the mobile communications industry through its innovations in the past three decades has created enormous value for society employed millions of people and made our lives better straight path may be in the right place at the right time and stands to gain if mmwave g succeeds in  ghz andor  ghz we believe what we are doing is not only important to straight path but also crucial to the deployment of g and is a future key component of the mobile communications industry as we stated in our g vision white paper we believe g is a critical piece in forming the broadband infrastructure for society we are proud of our work in pushing the technology envelope and making spectrum available for g and we won’t stop until we succeed media  straight path
