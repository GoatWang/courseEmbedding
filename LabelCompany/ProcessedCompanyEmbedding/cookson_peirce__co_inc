cooksonpeirce client login toggle navigation philosophy methodology we didn’t adopt a stock selection methodology we invented one yes there are other investment managers out there but none of them utilize the proprietary methodology we created and have been refining and enhancing for almost a half century when bob peirce began his career with a major investment firm back in  he devised a system of selecting stocks where the winners proved to be more productive than those selected through conventional means he took that knowledge with him when he partnered with jane and don cookson to form cooksonpeirce in  cooksonpeirce is an allcap equity management firm with a focus on stock selection through quantitative analysis we operate on a relative strength model continually in search of profit devoid of emotion with a clear sell discipline our process is mathematicallybased and replicable as any credible sciencebased methodology must be we believe that understanding the numbers is the key to successful investing so we make it our mission to know them well and to prove our commitment to our strategy we invest all of our personal assets alongside our client’s assets reading tea leaves is not a sound investment strategy there’s one fundamental problem inherent in any speculative investment strategy no one can predict the future and to some degree every valueinvesting process involves some subjective speculation at cooksonpeirce we operate on a uniquelydefined quantifiable system where the numbers drive the buysell triggers we act on what is—not what might be every week each stock is analyzed and ranked and when the sell threshold is met we move the position quickly and decisively it is this “disciplined sell” philosophy devoid of speculation and emotion that separates us from other investment managers everything we need to know about a stock is reflected in its current price the earnings the losses the acquisitions the mergers the personnel changes the new product announcements and even the improprieties and rumors they’re all in there in fact everything known about any aspect of a company is reflected in its current stock price we focus on the numbers and we sell the underperformersthis ongoing process strengthens the portfolio and is the reason behind our success no one can know everything there is to know about thousands of stocks but we can track every step of their movement our investors love winners as much as we love numbers at cooksonpeirce we get to know our investors as intimately as we know the numbers their scope is as diverse as the market understanding their goals and needs enables us to tailor a strategy to suit their risk tolerance and help them achieve their objectives we place a high priority on preservation
