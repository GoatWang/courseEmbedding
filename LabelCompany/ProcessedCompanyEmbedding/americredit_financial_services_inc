the unfortunate luck of falling behind on a medical bill which was turned over the americredit for collections when i recieved the voice mail which was extremely professional also i thought “oh greati heave to deal with a mean collections officer” but when i called and spoke with clint he put me at ease right away through his very calm and professional demeanor he and i talked and he offered up several payment options that were very accomidating to the situation a lot of businesses that are in the customer service industry should take note as to how your customer service represenatatives
