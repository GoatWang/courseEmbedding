states of america plaintiff v va partners i llc et al defendants case no cv wha plaintiffs response to public comment response of the united states to public comment on the proposed final judgment pursuant to the antitrust procedures and penalties act “appa”  usc § bh the united states hereby files the single public comment received concerning the proposed final judgment in this case and responds to this comment after careful consideration of the comment the united states continues to believe that the proposed final judgment provides an effective and appropriate remedy for the antitrust violations alleged in the complaint the united states will move the court for entry of the proposed final judgment after the public comment and this response have been published in the federal register pursuant to  usc § d i procedural history on april   the united states filed a civil antitrust complaint against va partners i llc “va partners i” valueact capital master fund lp “master fund” and valueact coinvest international lp “coinvest fund” collectively “valueact” or “defendants” to remedy violations of section a of the clayton act  usc § a commonly known as the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of  the “hsr act” following the filing of the complaint the parties engaged in settlement discussions that culminated in a consensual resolution of this matter on july   the united states filed a proposed final judgment a stipulation and proposed order and a competitive impact statement “cis” that explains how the proposed final judgment is designed to apply an appropriate penalty for and adequately restrain defendants hsr act violations ecf no   as required by the appa start printed page the united states published the proposed final judgment and cis in the federal register on july   see  fed reg  july   in addition the united states ensured that a summary of the terms of the proposed final judgment and the cis together with directions for the submission of written comments were published in the washington post and the san francisco chronicle on seven different days during the period of july   to july   see  usc § c the day waiting period for public comments ended on september   one comment was received and is described below and attached as exhibit  ii the complaint and proposed settlement the complaint alleges that valueact violated the hsr act by failing to comply with the acts premerger notification and reporting requirements in connection with its acquisition of voting securities of halliburton co “halliburton” and baker hughes inc “baker hughes” in  and  the hsr act states that “no person shall acquire directly or indirectly any voting securities of any person” exceeding certain thresholds until that person has filed preacquisition notification and report forms with the antitrust division of the department of justice “doj” and the federal trade commission “ftc” collectively the “agencies” and the postfiling waiting period has expired  usc § a a key purpose of the notification and waiting period is to protect consumers and competition from potentially anticompetitive transactions by providing the agencies an opportunity to conduct an antitrust review of proposed acquisitions of voting securities exceeding certain thresholds before they are consummated as alleged in the complaint and described further in the cis valueact made substantial purchases of stock in two direct competitors with the intent to participate in those companies business decisions without first complying with the notification and waiting period requirements of the hsr act through these purchases valueact simultaneously became one of the largest shareholders of both halliburton and baker hughes valueact established these positions as halliburton and baker hughes—the second and thirdlargest providers of oilfield services in the world—were being investigated for agreeing to a merger that threatened to substantially lessen competition in over twenty product markets in the united states the united states filed a lawsuit to challenge the merger on april   and halliburton and baker hughes abandoned the transaction a few weeks later valueacts failure to comply with the hsr act risked the governments ability to protect competition because it prevented the united states from reviewing in advance valueacts stock acquisitions which were made with the intent of participating in the companies business decisions and intervening with the management of each firm as necessary to increase the probability of the halliburtonbaker hughes merger being completed the complaint alleges that defendants could not excuse their failure to file the necessary notification and reporting forms by relying on the hsr acts limited exemption for acquisitions made “solely for the purposes of investment” the “investmentonly exemption” section ac of the hsr act exempts “acquisitions solely for the purpose of investment of voting securities if as a result of such acquisition the securities acquired or held do not exceed  per centum of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer” as explained in the regulations implementing the hsr act voting securities are held “solely for the purpose of investment” if the acquirer has “no intention of participating in the formulation determination or direction of the basic business decisions of the issuer”  cfr § i “hsr rule i” as alleged in the complaint valueact did not qualify for the investmentonly exemption because it intended from the time it purchased stock in these companies to participate in the business decisions of both companies specifically valueact intended to use its position as a major shareholder of both halliburton and baker hughes to obtain access to management to learn information about the companies and the merger in private conversations with senior executives to influence the decisions of these senior executives in a manner that increased the likelihood that halliburton and baker hughes would be able to complete their anticompetitive merger and ultimately to influence other business decisions regardless of whether the merger was consummated the totality of the evidence as described further in the complaint demonstrates that valueact was not entitled to claim the investmentonly exemption the proposed final judgment provides for injunctive relief and the payment of civil penalties which are designed to prevent future violations of the hsr act specifically the proposed final judgment prohibits defendants from relying on the investmentonly exemption if they intend to take or their investment strategy identifies circumstances in which they may take any of several specifically enumerated actions that reflect active participation in the company in which they are investing the prohibited conduct provisions are aimed at deterring future hsr violations of the sort alleged in the complaint while this provision does not represent a comprehensive list of all conduct that would disqualify an acquirer of voting securities from relying on the investmentonly exemption it is aimed at deterring conduct that poses the greatest threat to competition the proposed final judgment also provides for compliance access and inspection procedures to promote defendants compliance with the proposed final judgment and to enable the united states to monitor such compliance finally the proposed final judgment imposes an  million civil penalty for defendants hsr act violation this penalty reflects the gravity of the conduct at issue and will adequately deter valueact and other companies from future hsr act violations iii standard of judicial review the appa requires that proposed consent judgments in antitrust cases brought by the united states be subject to a sixty  day comment period after which the court shall determine whether entry of the proposed final judgment is “in the public interest”  usc § e in making this public interest determination the court is required to consider a the competitive impact of such judgment including termination of alleged violations provisions for enforcement and modification duration of relief sought anticipated effects of alternative remedies actually considered whether its terms are ambiguous and any other competitive considerations bearing upon the adequacy of such judgment that the court deems necessary to a determination of whether the consent judgment is in the public interest and b the impact of entry of such judgment upon competition in the relevant market or markets upon the public generally and individuals alleging specific injury from the violations set forth in the complaint including consideration of the public benefit if any to be derived from a determination of the issues at trial  usc § ea  bstart printed page  the public interest inquiry is necessarily a limited one as the united states is entitled to deference in crafting its antitrust settlements especially with respect to the scope of its complaint and the adequacy of its remedy see generally united states v microsoft corp  fd   dc cir  holding that government is entitled to “broad discretion to settle with the defendant within the reaches of the public interest” united states v sbc commcns inc  f supp d   ddc  assessing public interest standard under the tunney act united states v us airways group inc  f supp d   ddc  noting that the courts “inquiry is limited” because the government has “broad discretion” to determine the adequacy of the relief secured through a settlement united states v inbev nvsa no  jr  trade cas cch ¶   us dist lexis  at  ddc aug   noting that the courts review of a consent judgment is limited and only inquires “into whether the governments determination that the proposed remedies will cure the antitrust violations alleged in the complaint was reasonable and whether the mechanism to enforce the final judgment are clear and manageable” under the appa a court considers among other things the relationship between the remedy secured and the specific allegations set forth in the governments complaint whether the decree is sufficiently clear whether enforcement mechanisms are sufficient and whether the decree may positively harm third parties see microsoft  fd at  with respect to the adequacy of the relief secured by the decree a court may not “engage in an unrestricted evaluation of what relief would best serve the public” united states v bns inc  fd   th cir  quoting united states v bechtel corp  fd   th cir  see also microsoft  fd at  united states v alcoa inc  f supp d   ddc  inbev  us dist lexis  at  courts have held that the balancing of competing social and political interests affected by a proposed antitrust consent decree must be left in the first instance to the discretion of the attorney general the courts role in protecting the public interest is one of insuring that the government has not breached its duty to the public in consenting to the decree the court is required to determine not whether a particular decree is the one that will best serve society but whether the settlement is “within the reaches of the public interest” more elaborate requirements might undermine the effectiveness of antitrust enforcement by consent decree bechtel  fd at  emphasis added citations omitted courts “may not require that the remedies perfectly match the alleged violations” sbc commcns  f supp d at  rather the ultimate question is whether “the remedies obtained in the decree are so inconsonant with the allegations charged as to fall outside of the reaches of the public interest” microsoft  fd at  accordingly the united states “need only provide a factual basis for concluding that the settlements are reasonably adequate remedies for the alleged harms” sbc commcns  f supp d at  see also united states v apple inc  f supp d   sdny  and a “proposed decree must be approved even if it falls short of the remedy the court would impose on its own as long as it falls within the range of acceptability or is within the reaches of the public interest” united states v am tel  tel co  f supp   ddc  citations and internal quotations omitted see also united states v alcan aluminum ltd  f supp   wd ky  approving the consent decree even though the court would have imposed a greater remedy in its  amendments to the appa congress made clear its intent to preserve the practical benefits of utilizing consent decrees in antitrust enforcement by adding the unambiguous instruction that “nothing in this section shall be construed to require the court to conduct an evidentiary hearing or to require the court to permit anyone to intervene”  usc § e the procedure for the public interest determination is left to the discretion of the court with the recognition that the courts “scope of review remains sharply proscribed by precedent and the nature of tunney act proceedings” sbc commcns  f supp d at  see also united states v enova corp  f supp d   ddc  “the tunney act expressly allows the court to make its public interest determination based on the basis of the competitive impact statement and response to public comments alone” us airways  f supp d at  same iv summary of public comment and response of the united states during the day comment period the united states received one comment from phillip goldstein manager of activist hedge fund bulldog investors mr goldstein does not argue that the relief set forth in the proposed final judgment is inadequate to address the allegations in the complaint nor does he assert that the terms of the decree should be altered in any particular way instead mr goldstein claims that it “appears” that valueact settled this matter because the ftc increased the civil penalties for hsr violations and took the position that such increases could apply retroactively mr goldstein also claims that hsr rule i—the ftcs  rule explaining the meaning of the “investment only” exemption—“irrationally” draws a distinction between passive and active investors and thus should be revised mr goldstein further claims that hsr rule i is unconstitutional because it violates the first amendment in light of these arguments mr goldstein urges the united states to seek a stay of this enforcement action until this rule is revised as explained below none of mr goldsteins arguments warrant delaying entry of the proposed final judgment first as fully detailed in the cis the united states settled this case because it determined that the injunction and  million penalty imposed on valueact was in the public interest because this relief adequately addresses and reflects the gravity of valueacts wrongful conduct and will strongly deter valueact and other companies from violating the hsr act none of mr goldsteins arguments provide a basis for questioning let alone overruling the united states broad discretion in reaching this determination second mr goldsteins passing reference to valueacts supposed “coerced capitulation” in agreeing to settle this action misses the mark because the sole purpose of the tunney act review process is to determine why the agencies—rather than a defendant—decided to settle a civil antitrust enforcement action and whether doing so was in the public interest bechtel  fd at  “the courts role in the tunney act review process is one of insuring that the government has not breached its duty to the public in start printed page consenting to the decree    and to determine    whether the settlement is within the reaches of the public interest” inbev  us dist lexis  at  noting that the relevant inquiry during the tunney act review process is “whether the governments determination that the proposed remedies will cure the antitrust violations alleged in the complaint was reasonable” in any event mr goldsteins assertion that valueact was purportedly forced to settle because the ftc increased the potential fines during the pendency of this action ignores the fact that the  million fine that valueact agreed to pay was within the fine amount that the united states sought when it filed this action and that this amount was based on the penalties in effect prior to publication of the ftcs interim final rule on june   see cmplt ¶   request for relief third mr goldsteins lengthy argument that the distinction drawn in hsr rule i between passive and active investors is “irrational” and should be revised is similarly outside the scope of this proceeding as noted above the courts inquiry in a tunney act proceeding is limited to “whether the governments determination that the proposed remedies will cure the antitrust violations alleged in the complaint was reasonable and whether the mechanisms to enforce the final judgment are clear and manageable” inbev  us dist lexis  at  mr goldsteins assertions that hsr rule i—a rule that has been in effect for nearly thirty years—is “irrational” and should be revised are wholly irrelevant to the sole question before the court whether the proposed final judgment adequately addresses the harms alleged in the complaint in other words mr goldsteins assertions are plainly outside the scope of the limited review that congress established under the tunney act to the extent mr goldstein wishes to dispute the appropriateness of hsr rule i and how it is applied he can direct his suggestions to the ftc or could have commented when the rule was originally passed   he cannot however use his general opposition to hsr rule i as a basis to reject or delay entry of the proposed final judgment finally mr goldsteins suggestion that this court should reject the proposed final judgment because hsr rule i is “unconstitutional” has no merit to the extent that this assertion—which has no bearing on whether the proposed final judgment adequately addresses the antitrust violations alleged in the complaint—is properly before the court hsr rule i is content neutral and does not violate the first amendment even if the rule implicated first amendment interests it would readily withstand review see cableamerica corp v ftc  f supp   nd ala  dismissing claim that the ftcs enforcement of the hsr acts reporting requirements violated the plaintiffs first amendment rights for all of these reasons mr goldsteins public comment provides no basis to deny or delay entry of the proposed final judgment v conclusion after reviewing the public comment the united states continues to believe that the proposed final judgment as drafted provides an effective and appropriate remedy for the antitrust violations alleged in the complaint and is therefore in the public interest the united states will move this court to enter the proposed final judgment after the comment and this response are published in the federal register date october   respectfully submitted skathleen s oneill kathleen s

kathleen s oneill chief antitrust division us department of justice  fifth street nw suite  washington dc  july   united states of america v va partners i llc et al case no cv wha dear ms oneill the announced settlement of the referenced matter appears to be a product of coerced capitulation rather than of the parties relative assessments of the merits it appears that valueact in response to the ftcs postlitigation decision to dramatically increase the penalties for violations of the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act the “hsr act” and to apply them retroactively made a rational decision to settle as a result the settlement avoids judicial scrutiny of and perpetuates by virtue of its in terrorem effect a rule that as explained below should never have been adopted for those reasons the settlement is not in the public interest first the enforcement action that the settlement resolves is based on a dubious premise ie that the statutory phrase “solely for the purposes of investment” in connection with reporting and waiting period requirements of hsr act means “solely for the purposes of passive investment” emphasis added while the ftc has long held that position to my knowledge the rule adopting it has never been subjected to judicial review to determine whether the ftcs addition of the word “passive” which is absent in the statute is reasonable as explained below it is not only unreasonable it is irrational rule i which was apparently adopted without public comment in  states “voting securities are held or acquired solely for the purpose of investment if the person holding or acquiring such voting securities has no intention of participating in the formulation determination or direction of the basic business decisions of the issuer” however in the context the hsr act the purpose of which is to permit the ftc to analyze potential anticompetitive effects of business combinations before they occur any distinction between an acquisition of stock by a passive investor and an investor that seeks to influence management in contrast to an acquisition by a competitor or a significant customer supplier or service provider   is irrational as the facts in this case illustrate according to the dojs competitive impact statement “cis” start printed page  valueact intended from the time it made these stock purchases to use its position as a major shareholder of both halliburton and baker hughes to obtain access to management to learn information about the companies and the merger in private conversations with senior executives to influence those executives to improve the chances that the halliburtonbaker hughes merger would be completed and ultimately influence other business decisions regardless of whether the merger was consummated valueact executives met frequently with the top executives of the companies both in person and by teleconference and sent numerous emails to these the top executives on a variety of business issues during these meetings valueact identified specific business areas for improvement valueact also made presentations to each companys senior executives including presentations on post merger integration the totality of the evidence described in the complaint makes clear that valueact could not claim the limited hsr exemption for passive investment in other words valueact did what a companys legal counsel or an investment bank might do ie provide advice to management to increase the chances that a merger would be successfully completed the only difference being that rather than being paid for its advice valueact hoped to profit through an increase in the value of its investment if the merger succeeded yet attorneys and consultants are not required to make a filing with the ftc or pay a fee of  or more before they can speak with management there is no good reason to discriminate against any stockholder let alone a stockholder that owns less than  of a companys stock that seeks only to profit from its investment by requiring it to cease trading for a period of time or to pay a large fee before it can exercise its right to communicate with management nor as explained below could a law or regulation do so without violating the first amendment there has been no allegation that valueact has ever contemplated merging with any company in which it owned stock including halliburton or baker hughes nor was valueact a competitor or a significant supplier service provider or customer of either company the ftc and the doj do not seem to understand that active and passive investors have the same exact objective ie to see the value of their investment increase when a firm like valueact seeks to influence management of a company that is merely a means to achieve that objective—not a separate objective indeed dojs competitive impact statement “cis” in conclusory and circular fashion alleges only one actual risk of harm caused by valueact “valueacts failure to file the necessary notifications prevented the department from timely reviewing valueacts stock acquisitions which risked harming competition given that they resulted in valueacts becoming one of the largest shareholders in two direct competitors that were pursuing an anticompetitive merger” but the cis is silent about precisely how valueacts failure to file caused or could cause any real harm to competition or impaired the ftc or doj from determining whether to challenge the merger between halliburton and baker hughes if the ftc and doj cannot cite an example of harm that resulted from the acquisition of stock by an activist investor that suggests that rule i is irrational—and regulators should not be perpetuating irrational regulations in short for  years the ftc has wrongly interpreted the hsrs “investment only” exemption and it should stop treating activist investors like bogeymen notably the sec which has extensive experience in regulating investors and investments has adopted proxy rules that properly reflect the difference between actions intended for investment and noninvestment purposes thus sec rule abix excludes certain solicitations from the technical requirements of the proxy rules provided they are not made by or on behalf of “any person who because of a substantial interest in the subject matter of the solicitation is likely to receive a benefit from a successful solicitation that would not be shared pro rata by all other holders of the same class of securities   ” similarly sec rule ai allows a company to exclude a shareholder proposal from its proxy statement “if the proposal relates to the redress of a personal claim or grievance against the company or any other person or if it is designed to result in a benefit to you or to further a personal interest which is not shared by the other shareholders at large” the ftc should apply the same distinguishing principle to revise rule i to read as follows “voting securities are held or acquired solely for the purpose of investment if the person holding or acquiring such voting securities has no intention of receiving a benefit that will not be shared pro rata by all other holders of the same securities” unlike the current rule such a rule is consistent with and faithful to the purpose of the hsr act additionally rule i violates the first amendment because it requires a stockholder to pay a sizeable fee and to temporarily refrain from additional stock purchases in order to exercise his or her right to communicate with management about the company worse it is contentbased  and thus presumptively unconstitutional to conclude the doj should seek a stay of its enforcement action until rule i is revised to conform to the intent of the hsr act even though valueact has agreed to the proposed settlement it would be morally wrong for an agency that is supposed use reason and pursue justice to finalize a settlement of an enforcement action start printed page which is based upon and perpetuates a regulation that is unconstitutional irrational and inconsistent with the hsr act very truly yours s phillip goldstein end preamble footnotes   the  amendments substituted “shall” for “may” when setting forth the relevant factors for courts to consider and amended the list of factors to focus on competitive considerations and to address

citation   contrary to mr goldsteins comment the original revised hsr rules including  cfr § i were subject to public comment prior to being adopted see  fed reg    aug   back to citation   in a statement issued to news media valueact explained why it settled valueact capital fundamentally disagrees with dojs interpretation of the facts in connection with our investments in halliburton and baker hughes however due to the sudden and unanticipated  percent increase in the potential penalties associated with alleged hart scott rodino violations effective august  we felt we had no choice but to resolve this case as quickly as possible we are pleased to have come to a resolution to this litigation that will not impact our business or strategy going forward back to citation  for example a large acquisition of fedex stock by amazon would clearly raise concerns about a possible effect on competition in the package delivery business the same acquisition by valueact regardless of whether it was a passive or active investor would raise no similar concern back to citation   in the film terms of endearment after emmas funeral garrett her neighbor played by jack nicholson supportively

an investor are not mutually exclusive things as the ftc would have it back to citation   according to the dojs announcement of the settlement “valueact acquired substantial stakes in halliburton and baker hughes in the midst of our antitrust review of the companies proposed merger and used its position to try to influence the outcome of that process and certain other business decisions” said principal deputy assistant attorney general renata hesse head of the justice departments antitrust division “valueact was not entitled to avoid the hsr requirements by claiming to be a passive investor while at the same time injecting itself in this manner the hsr notification requirements are the backbone of the governments merger review process and crucial to our ability to prevent anticompetitive mergers and acquisitions” ok but wheres the beef as matt levine of bloomberg pointed out “hesses last sentence about the hsr notification being crucial to our ability to prevent anticompetitive mergers and acquisitions might be true in general but it has nothing to do with this case the justice department could—and did—prevent the baker hughes halliburton merger without ever giving any thought to valueact” httpwwwbloombergcom​view​articles​​sometimesitshardforownerstotalktocompanies back to citation   see statement of the federal trade commission in the matter of third
