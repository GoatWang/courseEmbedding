fixed income arbitrage  wikipedia fixed income arbitrage from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search fixedincome arbitrage is an investment strategy generally associated with hedge funds which consists of the discovery and exploitation of inefficiencies in the pricing of bonds ie instruments from either public or private issuers yielding a contractually fixed stream of income most arbitrageurs who employ this strategy trade globally in pursuit of their goal of both steady returns and low volatility the arbitrageurs can focus upon interest rate swaps us nonus government bond arbitrage us treasury securities forward yield curves andor mortgagebacked securities the practice of fixedincome arbitrage in general has been compared to picking up nickels in front of a steamroller however despite this notion some research has shown that consistent excess returns may be earned with this approach and as more hedge fund capital is allocated towards these strategies

ˌɑːbᵻtrˈɑːʒ is the practice of taking advantage of a price difference between two or more markets striking a combination of matching deals that capitalize upon the imbalance the profit being the difference between the market prices when used by academics an arbitrage is a imagined hypothetical thought experiment transaction that involves no negative cash flow at any probabilistic or temporal state and a positive cash flow in at least one state in simple terms it is the possibility of a riskfree profit after transaction costs for instance an arbitrage is present when there is the opportunity to instantaneously buy low and sell high in principle and in academic use an arbitrage is riskfree in common use as in statistical arbitrage it may refer to expected profit though losses may occur and in practice there are always risks in arbitrage some minor such as fluctuation of prices decreasing profit margins some major such as devaluation of a currency or derivative in academic use an arbitrage involves taking advantage of differences in price of a single asset or identical cashflows in common use it is also used to refer to differences between similar assets relative value or convergence trades as in merger arbitrage people who engage in arbitrage are called arbitrageurs ˌɑːrbᵻtrɑːˈʒɜːr—such as a bank or brokerage firm the term is mainly applied to trading in financial

see also  types of financial arbitrage  related concepts  notes  references  external links etymologyedit arbitrage is a french word and denotes a decision by an arbitrator or arbitration tribunal in modern french arbitre usually means referee or umpire in the sense used here it is first defined in  by mathieu de la porte in his treatise la science des négociants et teneurs de livres as a consideration of different exchange rates to recognize the most profitable places of issuance and settlement for a bill of exchange larbitrage est une combinaison que l’on fait de plusieurs changes pour connoitre connaître in modern spelling quelle place est plus avantageuse pour tirer et remettre arbitragefreeedit if the market prices do not allow for profitable arbitrage the prices are said to constitute an arbitrage equilibrium or arbitragefree market an arbitrage equilibrium is a precondition for a general economic equilibrium the no arbitrage assumption is used in quantitative finance to calculate a unique risk neutral price for derivatives arbitragefree pricing approach for bondsedit this refers to the method of valuing a couponbearing financial instrument by discounting its future cash flows by multiple discount rates by doing so a more accurate price can be obtained than if the price is calculated with a presentvalue pricing approach arbitragefree pricing is used for bond valuation and to detect arbitrage opportunities for investors for the purpose of valuing the price of a bond its cash flows can each be thought of as packets of incremental cash flows with a large packet upon maturity being the principal since the cash flows are dispersed throughout future periods they must be discounted back to the present in the presentvalue approach the cash flows are discounted with one discount rate to find the price of the bond in arbitragefree pricing multiple discount rates are used the presentvalue approach assumes that the yield of the bond will stay the same until maturity this is a simplified model because interest rates may fluctuate in the future which in turn affects the yield on the bond the discount rate may be different for each of the cash flows for this reason each cash flow can be considered a zerocoupon instrument that pays one payment upon maturity the discount rates used should be the rates of multiple zerocoupon bonds with maturity dates the same as each cash flow and similar risk as the instrument being valued by using multiple discount rates the arbitragefree price is the sum of the discounted cash flows arbitragefree price refers to the price at which no price arbitrage is possible the ideas of using multiple discount rates obtained from zerocoupon bonds and discount a similar bonds cash flow to find its price is derived from the yield curve the yield curve is a curve of the yields of the same bond with different maturities this curve can be used to view trends in market expectations of how interest rates will move in the future in arbitragefree pricing of a bond a yield curve of similar zerocoupon bonds with different maturities is created if the curve were to be created with treasury securities of different maturities they would be stripped of their coupon payments through bootstrapping this is to transform the bonds into zerocoupon bonds the yield of these zerocoupon bonds would then be plotted on a diagram with time on the xaxis and yield on the yaxis since the yield curve displays market expectations on how yields and interest rates may move the arbitragefree pricing approach is more realistic than using only one discount rate investors can use this approach to value bonds and find mismatches in prices resulting in an arbitrage opportunity if a bond valued with the arbitragefree pricing approach turns out to be priced higher in the market an investor could have such an opportunity investor goes short the bond at price at time t investor goes long the zerocoupon bonds making up the related yield curve and strip and sell any coupon payments at t as tt the price spread between the prices will decrease at maturity the prices will converge and be equal investor exits both the long and short position realizing a profit if the outcome from the valuation were the reversed case the opposite positions would be taken in the bonds this arbitrage opportunity comes from the assumption that the prices of bonds with the same properties will converge upon maturity this can be explained through market efficiency which states that arbitrage opportunities will eventually be discovered and corrected accordingly the prices of the bonds in t move closer together to finally become the same at tt conditions for arbitrageedit arbitrage is possible when one of three conditions is met the same asset does not trade at the same price on all markets the law of one price two assets with identical cash flows do not trade at the same price an asset with a known price in the future does not today trade at its future price discounted at the riskfree interest rate or the asset has significant costs of storage as such for example this condition holds for grain but not for securities arbitrage is not simply the act of buying a product in one market and selling it in another for a higher price at some later time the transactions must occur simultaneously to avoid exposure to market risk or the risk that prices may change on one market before both transactions are complete in practical terms this is generally possible only with securities and financial products that can be traded electronically and even then when each leg of the trade is executed the prices in the market may have moved missing one of the legs of the trade and subsequently having to trade it soon after at a worse price is called execution risk or more specifically leg risknote  in the simplest example any good sold in one market should sell for the same price in another traders may for example find that the price of wheat is lower in agricultural regions than in cities purchase the good and transport it to another region to sell at a higher price this type of price arbitrage is the most common but this simple example ignores the cost of transport storage risk and other factors true arbitrage requires that there be no market risk involved where securities are traded on more than one exchange arbitrage occurs by simultaneously buying in one and selling on the other see rational pricing particularly arbitrage mechanics for further discussion mathematically it is defined as follows p  v t ≥      and  p  v t ≠      denotes the portfolio value at time t examplesedit this section possibly contains original research please improve it by verifying the claims made and adding inline citations statements consisting only of original research should be removed january  learn how and when to remove this template message suppose that an exchange rate after taking out the fees for making the exchange in london is £  ¥ and the exchange rate in tokyo is ¥  £ converting ¥ to £ in tokyo and converting that £ into ¥ in london for a profit of ¥ would be arbitrage in reality this arbitrage is so simple that it almost never occurs but more complicated foreign exchange arbitrages such as the spotforward arbitrage see interest rate parity are much more common one example of arbitrage involves the new york stock exchange and the security futures exchange onechicago ocx when the price of a stock on the nyse and its corresponding futures contract on ocx are out of sync one can buy the less expensive one and sell it on the more expensive market because the differences between the prices are likely to be small and not to last very long this can be done profitably only with computers examining a large number of prices and automatically exercising a trade when the prices are far enough out of balance the activity of other arbitrageurs can make this risky those with the fastest computers ie lowest latency to respond to the market and the most expertise take advantage of series of small differences that would not be profitable if taken individually economists use the term global labor arbitrage to refer to the tendency of manufacturing jobs to flow towards whichever country has the lowest wages per unit output at present and has reached the minimum requisite level of political and economic development to support industrialization at present many such jobs appear to be flowing towards china though some that require command of english are going to india and the philippines in popular terms this is referred to as offshoring note that offshoring is not synonymous with outsourcing which means to subcontract from an outside supplier or source such as when a business outsources its payroll or cleaning unlike offshoring outsourcing always involves subcontracting jobs to a different company and that company can be in the same country even the same building as the outsourcing company sports arbitrage  – numerous internet bookmakers offer odds on the outcome of the same event any given bookmaker will weight their odds so that no one customer can cover all outcomes at a profit against their books however in order to remain competitive they must keep margins usually quite low different bookmakers may offer different odds on the same outcome of a given event by taking the best odds offered by each bookmaker a customer can under some circumstances cover all possible outcomes of the event and lock a small riskfree profit known as a dutch book this profit will typically be between  and  but can be much higher one problem with sports arbitrage is that bookmakers sometimes make mistakes and this can lead to an invocation of the palpable error rule which most bookmakers invoke when they have made a mistake by offering or posting incorrect odds as bookmakers become more proficient the odds of making an arb usually last for less than an hour and typically only a few minutes furthermore huge bets on one side of the market also alert the bookies to correct the market exchangetraded fund arbitrage – exchange traded funds allow authorized participants to exchange back and forth between shares in underlying securities held by the fund and shares in the fund itself rather than allowing the buying and selling of shares in the etf directly with the fund sponsor etf trade in the open market with prices set by market demand an etf may trade at a premium or discount to the value of the underlying assets when a significant enough premium appears an arbitrageur will buy the underlying securities convert them to shares in the etf and sell them in the open market when a discount appears an arbitrageur will do the reverse in this way the arbitrageur makes a lowrisk profit while keeping etf prices in line with their underlying value some types of hedge funds make use of a modified form of arbitrage to profit rather than exploiting price differences between identical assets they will purchase and sell securities assets and derivatives with similar characteristics and hedge any significant differences between the two assets any difference between the hedged positions represents any remaining risk such as basis risk plus profit the belief is that there remains some difference which even after hedging most risk represents pure profit for example a fund may see that there is a substantial difference between us dollar debt and local currency debt of another country and enter into a series of matching trades including currency swaps to arbitrage the difference while simultaneously entering into credit default swaps to protect against country risk and other types of specific risk price convergenceedit arbitrage has the effect of causing prices in different markets to converge as a result of arbitrage the currency exchange rates the price of commodities and the price of securities in different markets tend to converge the speed at which they do so is a measure of market efficiency arbitrage tends to reduce price discrimination by encouraging people to buy an item where the price is low and resell it where the price is high as long as the buyers are not prohibited from reselling and the transaction costs of buying holding and reselling are small relative to the difference in prices in the different markets arbitrage moves different currencies toward purchasing power parity as an example assume that a car purchased in the united states is cheaper than the same car in canada canadians would buy their cars across the border to exploit the arbitrage condition at the same time americans would buy us cars transport them across the border then sell them in canada canadians would have to buy american dollars to buy the cars and americans would have to sell the canadian dollars they received in exchange both actions would increase demand for us dollars and supply of canadian dollars as a result there would be an appreciation of the us currency this would make us cars more expensive and canadian cars less so until their prices were similar on a larger scale international arbitrage opportunities in commodities goods securities and currencies tend to change exchange rates until the purchasing power is equal in reality most assets exhibit some difference between countries these transaction costs taxes and other costs provide an impediment to this kind of arbitrage similarly arbitrage affects the difference in interest rates paid on government bonds issued by the various countries given the expected depreciation in the currencies relative to each other see interest rate parity risksedit arbitrage transactions in modern securities markets involve fairly low daytoday risks but can face extremely high risk in rare situations particularly financial crises and can lead to bankruptcy formally arbitrage transactions have negative skew – prices can get a small amount closer but often no closer than  while they can get very far apart the daytoday risks are generally small because the transactions involve small differences in price so an execution failure will generally cause a small loss unless the trade is very big or the price moves rapidly the rare case risks are extremely high because these small price differences are converted to large profits via leverage borrowed money and in the rare event of a large price move this may yield a large loss the main daytoday risk is that part of the transaction fails – execution risk the main rare risks are counterparty risk and liquidity risk – that a counterparty to a large transaction or many transactions fails to pay or that one is required to post margin and does not have the money to do so in the academic literature the idea that seemingly very low risk arbitrage trades might not be fully exploited because of these risk factors and other considerations is often referred to as limits to arbitrage execution riskedit generally it is impossible to close two or three transactions at the same instant therefore there is the possibility that when one part of the deal is closed a quick shift in prices makes it impossible to close the other at a profitable price however this is not necessarily the case many exchanges and interdealer brokers allow multi legged trades eg basis block trades on liffe competition in the marketplace can also create risks during arbitrage transactions as an example if one was trying to profit from a price discrepancy between ibm on the nyse and ibm on the london stock exchange they may purchase a large number of shares on the nyse and find that they cannot simultaneously sell on the lse this leaves the arbitrageur in an unhedged risk position in the s risk arbitrage was common in this form of speculation one trades a security that is clearly undervalued or overvalued when it is seen that the wrong valuation is about to be corrected by events the standard example is the stock of a company undervalued in the stock market which is about to be the object of a takeover bid the price of the takeover will more truly reflect the value of the company giving a large profit to those who bought at the current price—if the merger goes through as predicted traditionally arbitrage transactions in the securities markets involve high speed high volume and low risk at some moment a price difference exists and the problem is to execute two or three balancing transactions while the difference persists that is before the other arbitrageurs act when the transaction involves a delay of weeks or months as above it may entail considerable risk if borrowed money is used to magnify the reward through leverage one way of reducing the risk is through the illegal use of inside information and in fact risk arbitrage with regard to leveraged buyouts was associated with some of the famous financial scandals of the s such as those involving michael milken and ivan boesky mismatchedit for more details on this topic see convergence trade another risk occurs if the items being bought and sold are not identical and the arbitrage is conducted under the assumption that the prices of the items are correlated or predictable this is more narrowly referred to as a convergence trade in the extreme case this is merger arbitrage described below in comparison to the classical quick arbitrage transaction such an operation can produce disastrous losses counterparty riskedit as arbitrages generally involve future movements of cash they are subject to counterparty risk if a counterparty fails to fulfill their side of a transaction this is a serious problem if one has either a single trade or many related trades with a single counterparty whose failure thus poses a threat or in the event of a financial crisis when many counterparties fail this hazard is serious because of the large quantities one must trade in order to make a profit on small price differences for example if one purchases many risky bonds then hedges them with cdses profiting from the difference between the bond spread and the cds premium in a financial crisis the bonds may default and the cds writerseller may itself fail due to the stress of the crisis causing the arbitrageur to face steep losses liquidity riskedit “ markets can remain irrational far longer than you or i can remain solvent ” — john maynard keynes arbitrage trades are necessarily synthetic leveraged trades as they involve a short position if the assets used are not identical so a price divergence makes the trade temporarily lose money or the margin treatment is not identical and the trader is accordingly required to post margin faces a margin call the trader may run out of capital if they run out of cash and cannot borrow more and be forced to sell these assets at a loss even though the trades may be expected to ultimately make money in effect arbitrage traders synthesize a put option on their ability to finance themselves prices may diverge during a financial crisis often termed a flight to quality these are precisely the times when it is hardest for leveraged investors to raise capital due to overall capital constraints and thus they will lack capital precisely when they need it most types of arbitrageedit spatial arbitrageedit also known as geographical arbitrage this is the simplest form of arbitrage in spatial arbitrage an arbitrageur looks for price differences between geographically separate markets for example there may be a bond dealer in virginia offering a bond at  and a dealer in washington bidding  for the same bond for whatever reason the two dealers have not spotted the difference in the prices but the arbitrageur does the arbitrageur immediately buys the bond from the virginia dealer and sells it to the washington dealer merger arbitrageedit also called risk arbitrage merger arbitrage generally consists of buyingholding the stock of a company that is the target of a takeover while shorting the stock of the acquiring company usually the market price of the target company is less than the price offered by the acquiring company the spread between these two prices depends mainly on the probability and the timing of the takeover being completed as well as the prevailing level of interest rates the bet in a merger arbitrage is that such a spread will eventually be zero if and when the takeover is completed the risk is that the deal breaks and the spread massively widens municipal bond arbitrageedit also called municipal bond relative value arbitrage municipal arbitrage or just muni arb this hedge fund strategy involves one of two approaches it should be noted that the term arbitrage is also used in the context of the income tax regulations governing the investment of proceeds of municipal bonds these regulations aimed at the issuers or beneficiaries of taxexempt municipal bonds are different and instead attempt to remove the issuers ability to arbitrage between the low taxexempt rate and a taxable investment rate generally managers seek relative value opportunities by being both long and short municipal bonds with a durationneutral book the relative value trades may be between different issuers different bonds issued by the same entity or capital structure trades referencing the same asset in the case of revenue bonds managers aim to capture the inefficiencies arising from the heavy participation of noneconomic investors ie high income buy and hold investors seeking taxexempt income as well as the crossover buying arising from corporations or individuals changing income tax situations ie insurers switching their munis for corporates after a large loss as they can capture a higher aftertax yield by offsetting the taxable corporate income with underwriting losses there are additional inefficiencies arising from the highly fragmented nature of the municipal bond market which has two million outstanding issues and  issuers in contrast to the treasury market which has  issues and a single issuer second managers construct leveraged portfolios of aaa or aarated taxexempt municipal bonds with the duration risk hedged by shorting the appropriate ratio of taxable corporate bonds these corporate equivalents are typically interest rate swaps referencing libor or sifma  the arbitrage manifests itself in the form of a relatively cheap longer maturity municipal bond which is a municipal bond that yields significantly more than  of a corresponding taxable corporate bond the steeper slope of the municipal yield curve allows participants to collect more aftertax income from the municipal bond portfolio than is spent on the interest rate swap the carry is greater than the hedge expense positive taxfree carry from muni arb can reach into the double digits the bet in this municipal bond arbitrage is that over a longer period of time two similar instruments—municipal bonds and interest rate swaps—will correlate with each other they are both very high quality credits have the same maturity and are denominated in the same currency credit risk and duration risk are largely eliminated in this strategy however basis risk arises from use of an imperfect hedge which results in significant but rangebound principal volatility the end goal is to limit this principal volatility eliminating its relevance over time as the high consistent taxfree cash flow accumulates since the inefficiency is related to government tax policy and hence is structural in nature it has not been arbitraged away note however that many municipal bonds are callable and that this imposes substantial additional risks to the strategy convertible bond arbitrageedit a convertible bond is a bond that an investor can return to the issuing company in exchange for a predetermined number of shares in the company a convertible bond can be thought of as a corporate bond with a stock call option attached to it the price of a convertible bond is sensitive to three major factors interest rate when rates move higher the bond part of a convertible bond tends to move lower but the call option part of a convertible bond moves higher and the aggregate tends to move lower stock price when the price of the stock the bond is convertible into moves higher the price of the bond tends to rise credit spread if the creditworthiness of the issuer deteriorates eg rating downgrade and its credit spread widens the bond price tends to move lower but in many cases the call option part of the convertible bond moves higher since credit spread correlates with volatility given the complexity of the calculations involved and the convoluted structure that a convertible bond can have an arbitrageur often relies on sophisticated quantitative models in order to identify bonds that are trading cheap versus their theoretical value convertible arbitrage consists of buying a convertible bond and hedging two of the three factors in order to gain exposure to the third factor at a very attractive price for instance an arbitrageur would first buy a convertible bond then sell fixed income securities or interest rate futures to hedge the interest rate exposure and buy some credit protection to hedge the risk of credit deterioration eventually what hed be left with is something similar to a call option on the underlying stock acquired at a very low price he could then make money either selling some of the more expensive options that are openly traded in the market or delta hedging his exposure to the underlying shares depository receiptsedit a depositary receipt is a security that is offered as a tracking stock on another foreign market for instance a chinese company wishing to raise more money may issue a depository receipt on the new york stock exchange as the amount of capital on the local exchanges is limited these securities known as adrs american depositary receipt or gdrs global depository receipt depending on where they are issued are typically considered foreign and therefore trade at a lower value when first released many adrs are exchangeable into the original security known as fungibility and actually have the same value in this case there is a spread between the perceived value and real value which can be extracted other adrs that are not exchangeable often have much larger spreads since the adr is trading at a value lower than what it is worth one can purchase the adr and expect to make money as its value converges on the original however there is a chance that the original stock will fall in value too so by shorting it one can hedge that risk crossborder arbitrageedit crossborder arbitrage exploits different prices of the same stock in different countries example apple is trading on nasdaq at us the stock is also traded on the german electronic exchange xetra if  euro costs us a crossborder trader could enter a buy order on the xetra at € per apple share and a sell order at € per share some brokers in germany do not offer access to the us exchanges hence if a german retail investor wants to buy apple stock he needs to buy it on the xetra the crossborder trader would sell the apple shares on xetra to the investor and buy the shares in the same second on nasdaq afterwards the crossborder trader would need to transfer the shares bought on nasdaq to the german xetra exchange where he is obliged to deliver the stock in most cases the quotation on the local exchanges is done electronically by highfrequency traders taking into consideration the home price of the stock and the exchange rate this kind of highfrequency trading benefits the public as it reduces the cost to the german investor and enables him to buy us shares duallisted companiesedit a duallisted company dlc structure involves two companies incorporated in different countries contractually agreeing to operate their businesses as if they were a single enterprise while retaining their separate legal identity and existing stock exchange listings in integrated and efficient financial markets stock prices of the twin pair should move in lockstep in practice dlc share prices exhibit large deviations from theoretical parity arbitrage positions in dlcs can be set up by obtaining a long position in the relatively underpriced part of the dlc and a short position in the relatively overpriced part such arbitrage strategies start paying off as soon as the relative prices of the two dlc stocks converge toward theoretical parity however since there is no identifiable date at which dlc prices will converge arbitrage positions sometimes have to be kept open for considerable periods of time in the meantime the price gap might widen in these situations arbitrageurs may receive margin calls after which they would most likely be forced to liquidate part of the position at a highly unfavorable moment and suffer a loss arbitrage in dlcs may be profitable but is also very risky a good illustration of the risk of dlc arbitrage is the position in royal dutch shell—which had a dlc structure until —by the hedge fund longterm capital management ltcm see also the discussion below lowenstein   describes that ltcm established an arbitrage position in royal dutch shell in the summer of  when royal dutch traded at an  to  percent premium in total  billion was invested half of which long in shell and the other half short in royal dutch lowenstein p  in the autumn of  large defaults on russian debt created significant losses for the hedge fund and ltcm had to unwind several positions lowenstein reports that the premium of royal dutch had increased to about  percent and ltcm had to close the position and incur a loss according to lowenstein p  ltcm lost  million in equity pairs trading and more than half of this loss is accounted for by the royal dutch shell trade private to public equitiesedit the market prices for privately held companies are typically viewed from a return on investment perspective such as  whilst publicly held and or exchange listed companies trade on a price to earnings ratio pe such as a pe of  which equates to a  roi thus if a publicly traded company specialises in the acquisition of privately held companies from a pershare perspective there is a gain with every acquisition that falls within these guidelines eg berkshire hathaway and halydean corporation private to public equities arbitrage is a term which can arguably be applied to investment banking in general private markets to public markets differences may also help explain the overnight windfall gains enjoyed by principals of companies that just did an initial public offering ipo regulatory arbitrageedit for more details on this topic see jurisdictional arbitrage regulatory arbitrage is where a regulated institution takes advantage of the difference between its real or economic risk and the regulatory position for example if a bank operating under the basel i accord has to hold  capital against default risk but the real risk of default is lower it is profitable to securitise the loan removing the low risk loan from its portfolio on the other hand if the real risk is higher than the regulatory risk then it is profitable to make that loan and hold on to it provided it is priced appropriately regulatory arbitrage can result in parts of entire businesses being unregulated as a result of the arbitrage this process can increase the overall riskiness of institutions under a risk insensitive regulatory regime as described by alan greenspan in his october  speech on the role of capital in optimal banking supervision and regulation the term regulatory arbitrage was used for the first time in  when it was applied by scott v simpson a partner at law firm skadden arps to refer to a new defence tactic in hostile mergers and acquisitions where differing takeover regimes in deals involving multijurisdictions are exploited to the advantage of a target company under threat in economics regulatory arbitrage sometimes tax arbitrage may be used to refer to situations when a company can choose a nominal place of business with a regulatory legal or tax regime with lower costs for example an insurance company may choose to locate in bermuda due to preferential tax rates and policies for insurance companies this can occur particularly where the business transaction has no obvious physical location in the case of many financial products it may be unclear where the transaction occurs regulatory arbitrage can include restructuring a bank by outsourcing services such as it the outsourcing company takes over the installations buying out the banks assets and charges a periodic service fee back to the bank this frees up cashflow usable for new lending by the bank the bank will have higher it costs but counts on the multiplier effect of money creation and the interest rate spread to make it a profitable exercise example suppose the bank sells its it installations for  million usd with a reserve ratio of  the bank can create  million usd in additional loans there is a time lag and the bank has to expect to recover the loaned money back into its books the bank can often lend and securitize the loan to the it services company to cover the acquisition cost of the it installations this can be at preferential rates as the sole client using the it installation is the bank if the bank can generate  interest margin on the  million of new loans the bank will increase interest revenues by  million the it services company is free to leverage their balance sheet as aggressively as they and their banker agree to this is the reason behind the trend towards outsourcing in the financial sector without this money creation benefit it is actually more expensive to outsource the it operations as the outsourcing adds a layer of management and increases overhead according to pbs frontlines  fourpart documentary money power and wall street regulatory arbitrage along with asymmetric bank lobbying in washington and abroad allowed investment banks in the pre and post period to continue to skirt laws and engage in the risky proprietary trading of opaque derivatives swaps and other creditbased instruments invented to circumvent legal restrictions at the expense of clients government and publics due to the affordable care act’s expansion of medicaid coverage one form of regulatory arbitrage can now be found when businesses engage in “medicaid migration” a maneuver by which qualifying employees who would typically be enrolled in company health plans elect to enroll in medicaid instead these programs that have similar characteristics as insurance products to the employee but have radically different cost structures resulting in significant expense reductions for employers telecom arbitrageedit main article international telecommunications routes telecom arbitrage companies allow phone users to make international calls for free through certain access numbers such services are offered in the united kingdom the telecommunication arbitrage companies get paid an interconnect charge by the uk mobile networks and then buy international routes at a lower cost the calls are seen as free by the uk contract mobile phone customers since they are using up their allocated monthly minutes rather than paying for additional calls such services were previously offered in the united states by companies such as futurephonecom these services would operate in rural telephone exchanges primarily in small towns in the state of iowa in these areas the local telephone carriers are allowed to charge a high termination fee to the callers carrier in order to fund the cost of providing service to the small and sparsely populated areas that they serve however futurephone as well as other similar services ceased operations upon legal challenges from att and other service providers statistical arbitrageedit main article statistical arbitrage statistical arbitrage is an imbalance in expected nominal values a casino has a statistical arbitrage in every game of chance that it offers—referred to as the house advantage house edge vigorish or house vigorish the fall of longterm capital managementedit main article longterm capital management longterm capital management ltcm lost  billion us dollars in fixed income arbitrage in september  ltcm had attempted to make money on the price difference between different bonds for example it would sell us treasury securities and buy italian bond futures the concept was that because italian bond futures had a less liquid market in the short term italian bond futures would have a higher return than us bonds but in the long term the prices would converge because the difference was small a large amount of money had to be borrowed to make the buying and selling profitable the downfall in this system began on august   when russia defaulted on its ruble debt and domestic dollar debt because the markets were already nervous due to the  asian financial crisis investors began selling nonus treasury debt and buying us treasuries which were considered a safe investment as a result the price on us treasuries began to increase and the return began decreasing because there were many buyers and the return yield on other bonds began to increase because there were many sellers ie the price of those bonds fell this caused the difference between the prices of us treasuries and other bonds to increase rather than to decrease as ltcm was expecting eventually this caused ltcm to fold and their creditors had to arrange a bailout more controversially officials of the federal reserve assisted in the negotiations that led to this bailout on the grounds that so many companies and deals were intertwined with ltcm that if ltcm actually failed they would as well causing a collapse in confidence in the economic system thus ltcm failed as a fixed income arbitrage fund although it is unclear what sort of profit was realized by the banks that bailed ltcm out see alsoedit types of financial arbitrageedit arbitrage betting covered interest arbitrage fixed income arbitrage political arbitrage remarketing arbitrage
