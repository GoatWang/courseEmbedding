gue research analyst dividend investing oil  gas master limited partnershipsenergy  income advisoramid the recent influx of mlps that own nontraditional assets or pay a variable distribution summit midstream partners lp nyse smlp which went public on sept   is a bit of a throwback a midstream operator that owns gathering and processing assets and pays a regular quarterly distribution the fledgling publicly traded partnership traces its lineage back to fall  when members of the management team and privateequity outfit energy capital partners formed summit midstream partners llc to build a portfolio of midstream energy assets in north america in the third quarter of  this group sold a  percent interest in the concern to ge energy financial services summit midstream partners lp owns two operating entities dfw midstream services llc and grand river gathering llc dfw midstream services the mlps privately owned antecedent acquired the dfw midstream systema network of smalldiameter gathering pipelines that connect wellhead production to larger pipelines and processing systemsin the barnett shale from chesapeake energy corp nyse chk and a subsidiary of energy future holdings corp in subsequent years summit midstream partners llc expanded the gathering network to its current capacity of  million cubic feet of natural gas per day management expects nameplate throughput to expand to  million cubic feet per day when additional compressors and looping pipelines come onstream in the first quarter of  this operation has little direct exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices thanks to longterm gathering agreements that also include remaining minimum volume commitments with an average of  million cubic feet per day remaining an acreage dedication of about  acres with anchor customer chesapeake energy guarantees that any wells the operators sinks in the area of mutual interest will be connected to summit midstream partners lps dfw gathering system volumes transported on these pipelines increased  percent from the first half of  to  million cubic feet per day earlier in  chesapeake energy and other operators had restricted production from existing wells in response to the ultradepressed naturalgas prices that followed the noshow winter of  much of this upside stemmed from some operators removing curtailments on their existing wells to take advantage of the recovery in the price of natural gas atlas resource partners lp nyse arp for example stepped up workover operations on acreage acquired from carrizo oil  gas nsdq crzo earlier this year nevertheless summit midstream partners lp estimates that roughly  percent of the  wells connected to the dfw system were either shutin or significantly curtailed at the end of the third quarter a further recovery in the price of natural gas would likely prompt operators to ramp up output from these wells management has also highlighted plans to connect four pad sites operated by the privately held beacon exploration  production in the coming year a move that should bolster throughput and help to offset natural well declines however drilling activity will likely remain constrained summit midstream partners lps gathering pipelines are concentrated in the southeast portion of tarrant countythe heart of the gasproducing barnett shale the newly listed mlps investor relations team has touted this area as the core of the core of the barnett noting that the dfw system services two of the plays most prolific wells based on their peak production rates but upstream operators have scaled back drilling activity in the portions of the barnett shale that primarily produce natural gas preferring the superior economics offered by liquidsrich basins such as the bakken shale the eagle ford shale and the permian basin see breaking down the us onshore rig count accordingly the active rig count in tarrant county has tumbled from  at the beginning of the year to about eight in the second week of december source baker hughes in a conference call to discuss thirdquarter results summit midstream partners lps ceo steven newby told analysts that the firm expects operators to run one rig in the mlps service area in the coming year and emphasized that any upside would come from producers restoring output from socalled wafflersexisting wells that have been curtailed or shut in over the  months ended sept   management expects the dfw midstream system to account for  percent of the mlps revenue grand river gathering llc in october  summit midstream partners lps predecessor acquired  miles of gathering pipelines now called the grand river system in western colorados piceance basin from encana corp nyse eca for usd million grand river comprises three distinct systemsmamm creek orchard and south parachuteeach of which connect to thirdparty pipelines that transport output to enterprise products partners lps nyse epd processing plant in meeker colo in connection with this deal the mlp inked longterm gathering agreements with anchor customer encana on each of these three systems and assumed six contracts with five other producers the majority of the volumes transported on this gathering network come from the mesaverde a shallow formation that yields natural gas and significant quantities of ngls in the third quarter of  the grand river system averaged throughput of  million cubic feet per day down  percent from the first half of  much of this drop in production stemmed from temporary issues that affected about  million cubic feet per day of production in the mamm creek area throughput on the orchard system will also continue its gradual decline unless encana and other producers step up drilling in the drygas portions of the mancos and niobrara shalean unlikely prospect in the current pricing environment management highlighted a recent joint venture between encana and steelmaker nucor corp nyse nue as a potential growth driver for volumes in the piceance basin distribution outlook with an asset base thats focused on two outoffavor basins summit midstream partners lp lacks significant opportunities for organic growth that being said we dont expect the mlp to have any challenges delivering its minimum quarterly distribution of  per unit excluding onetime charges the firm would have covered this payout by about  times in the most recent quarter the terms of the partnership agreement also provide a degree of protection to unitholders in the mlps first few years of operations summit midstream partners llc own a  percent general partner interest in the mlp as well as common units representing a  percent stake in the limited partner lp and subordinated units that amount to a  percent interest in the lp these subordinated units are only entitled to receive a distribution after each common unit has received the minimum quarterly payout and any arrearage from prior quarters the subordinated units will convert to common stock once the mlp disburses at least the minimum quarterly distribution to each lp unitholder and makes the required payment to its general partner for twelve consecutive threemonth periods alternatively this conversion can occur if the mlp pays out  percent of its minimum annual distribution equivalent to  per unit over a period of four consecutive quarters not only does this structure increase the likelihood that summit midstream partners lp will be able to meet its minimum distribution to unitholders at this early stage in its life span but the arrangement also incentivizes the sponsors to grow the mlps distributable cash flow about a month after summit midstream partners lps initial public offering the mlps parent closed the usd million acquisition of etc canyon pipeline llc from energy transfer partners lp nyse etp this deal involved  miles of gathering pipelines and two gasprocessing facilities that serve producers in the piceance basin in colorado and uinta basin in utah in addition to the feebased gathering agreements that the parent assumed as part of the acquisition the firm inked two longterm deals to provide midstream services to wpx energy nyse wpx and black hills corps nyse bkh exploration and production subsidiary as part of these deals the parent company will build additional gathering capacity to connect wpx energys new production in the rifle colo area and construct a processing plant and related infrastructure to support black hills planned development of the liquidsrich niobrara and mancos formations asked about potential dropdown transactions involving these newly acquired assets summit midstream partners lps ceo indicated that such a move wouldnt take place until the parent completed certain capacity expansions and midstream projectsa hitch that would push any deal back to the end of  although were less than enamored with summit midstream partners lps current asset base eventual dropdown transactions from the mlps sponsors should drive distribution growth capital partners has indicated that summit midstream partners lp will be its primary platform for growth in the midstream space the outfit also has about  million in liquidity on its credit facility that could be plowed into an acquisition with an indicated yield of about  percent units of summit midstream partners lp offer a sufficient current return to compensate for an existing asset base that offers scant opportunity for growth prospective investors should understand that an investment in this fledgling mlp represents a bet that management will pursue an attractive slate of growth projects disclosure i am long etp epd i wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions i am not receiving compensation for
