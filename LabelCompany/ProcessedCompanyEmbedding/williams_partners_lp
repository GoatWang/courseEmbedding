partners lp if you like a steady income stream only one of these partnerships is a good choice for you reuben gregg brewer tmfreubengbrewer jun   at am enterprise products partners lp nyseepd and williams partners lp nysewpz are both benefiting from increasing demand for midstream assets like natural gas pipelines and investors can expect a nice income stream from each with both offering unitholders distribution yields of around  but theres a big difference between the two partnerships that income investors shouldnt ignore a bright future at williams partners recent analyst day management spoke at length about the future for example at this point in time the partnerships business is largely feebased that means demand for the companys midstream assets is more important than the price of whats being pushed through them   image source getty images and then theres the increasing demand for natural gas which is a key focus for williams between  and  the compound annual growth rate of gas demand was  a year however from  to  its projected to be  lng exports industrial demand and utilities switching to natural gas are expected to be key drivers with williams assets positioned to benefit     williams is also expanding its footprint with billions of dollars worth of projects lined up to increase throughput for example the partnership has  billion worth of projects being worked on along the east coast and gulf coast so it can better serve the northeasts increasing appetite for natural gas     the big spend on the east coast image source williams partners lp theres only one problem williams pretty much hit the reset button over the last year in  it sold assets to refocus its business and in early  it cut its distribution by  there really is a lot to like about the future and the distribution cut was likely the right thing to do for the partnership to help ensure it can achieve its goals however if income consistency is important to you williams isnt the right name for your portfolio until it proves its on the right path to distribution sustainability     steady as she goes which is why most investors would be better served by enterprise products partners this partnership is among the largest midstream players in the united states it has assets ranging from pipelines to storage to processing to ships like williams its focus is on feebased businesses and growth is important at enterprise too at this point it has around  billion worth of expansion projects in the works through  williams is a smaller partnership with a market cap of around  billion compared to enterprises  billion that means growth will be easier to achieve at williams but slow and steady isnt a bad thing if youre looking for consistent income     enterprise is building too image source enterprise products partners lp enterprise is by the way amazingly consistent despite oil falling from over  a barrel in mid to a nadir of  a barrel enterprise kept chugging along for example its gross margin didnt drop like a rock it trended sideways at a little over  billion plus the distribution kept growing in fact there was never any question about the partnerships ability to support its distribution which obviously cant be said of williams     enterprise has an incredible distribution record for example its streak of paying annual dividends is up to  years that puts this  yielder in rare company among names like ibm  years and united technologies  years in just five more years it will qualify for the dividend aristocrats list in contrast williams has to demonstrate its distribution commitment from the ground up     twenty years however isnt the only streak enterprise has going it has also increased its distribution for  consecutive quarters so not only are unitholders getting pay raises each year  theyre getting them each quarter the rate of distribution growth is around  handily beating the historical rate of inflation around  and providing a cornerstone investment for a diversified income portfolio ill take that over williams business and distribution reset any day     investor takeaway if you are willing to look past williams reset there are solid reasons to like the partnership but if you want a steady stream of income it hasnt provided that and you cant just assume it will in the future enterprise on the other hand has rewarded unitholders with increasing distributions for  years with nothing to suggest that trend is going to change incomefocused investors should drop williams and pick up enterprise reuben brewer owns shares

products partners lp nyse epd and williams partners lp nyse wpz are both benefiting from increasing demand for midstream assets like natural gas pipelines and investors can expect a nice income stream from each with both offering unitholders distribution yields of around  but theres a big difference between the two partnerships that income investors shouldnt ignorea bright futureat williams partners recent analyst day management spoke at length about the future for example at this point in time the partnerships business is largely feebased that means demand for the companys midstream assets is more important than the price of whats being pushed through them   image source getty imagesand then theres the increasing demand for natural gas which is a key focus for williams between  and  the compound annual growth rate of gas demand was  a year however from  to  its projected to be  lng exports industrial demand and utilities switching to natural gas are expected to be key drivers with williams assets positioned to benefit    williams is also expanding its footprint with billions of dollars worth of projects lined up to increase throughput for example the partnership has  billion worth of projects being worked on along the east coast and gulf coast so it can better serve the northeasts increasing appetite for natural gas    the big spend on the east coast image source williams partners lptheres only one problem williams pretty much hit the reset button over the last year in  it sold assets to refocus its business and in early  it cut its distribution by  there really is a lot to like about the future and the distribution cut was likely the right thing to do for the partnership to help ensure it can achieve its goals however if income consistency is important to you williams isnt the right name for your portfolio until it proves its on the right path to distribution sustainability     steady as she goeswhich is why most investors would be better served by enterprise products partners this partnership is among the largest midstream players in the united states it has assets ranging from pipelines to storage to processing to ships like williams its focus is on feebased businessesand growth is important at enterprise too at this point it has around  billion worth of expansion projects in the works through  williams is a smaller partnership with a market cap of around  billion compared to enterprises  billion that means growth will be easier to achieve at williams but slow and steady isnt a bad thing if youre looking for consistent income    enterprise is building too image source enterprise products partners lp enterprise is by the way amazingly consistent despite oil falling from over  a barrel in mid to a nadir of  a barrel enterprise kept chugging along for example its gross margin didnt drop like a rock it trended sideways at a little over  billion plus the distribution kept growing in fact there was never any question about the partnerships ability to support its distribution which obviously cant be said of williams    enterprise has an incredible distribution record for example its streak of paying annual dividends is up to  years that puts this  yielder in rare company among names like ibm  years and united technologies  years in just five more years it will qualify for the dividend aristocrats list in contrast williams has to demonstrate its distribution commitment from the ground up     twenty years however isnt the only streak enterprise has going it has also increased its distribution for  consecutive quarters so not only are unitholders getting pay raises each year  theyre getting them each quarter the rate of distribution growth is around  handily beating the historical rate of inflation around  and providing a cornerstone investment for a diversified income portfolio ill take that over williams business and distribution reset any day    investor takeaway if you are willing to look past williams reset there are solid reasons to like the partnership but if you want a steady stream of income it hasnt provided that and you cant just assume it will in the future enterprise on the other hand has rewarded unitholders with increasing distributions for  years with nothing to suggest that trend is going to change incomefocused investors should drop williams and pick up
