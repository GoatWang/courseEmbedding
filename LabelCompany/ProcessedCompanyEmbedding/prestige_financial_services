families grow and preserve their money with results based strategies for todays markets my name is marc j cormier president and owner of “prestige financial services inc” ive been in the financial services industry since february  and i became mutual fund licensed in sept  i started my career with metropolitain life over the next eight years through a variety of sales and changes i was with the mutual group then clarica which was then sold to sunlife financial in mid it became apparent that in order to better serve my clients it would be better to work independently that’s when “prestige financial services inc” was created i affiliated myself with various life insurance companies and what is now “equity associates inc” this enables me to offer a variety of insurance and investment products to help my clients meet their goals and objectives why choose me what difference can you expect by working with an independent advisor most of us acknowledge that turbulence exists throughout the financial markets  your financial objectives may call for greater security but who is watching your back  financial complacency can be insidious and the cost of oversight may be high  have you covered all the bases what size nest egg will you need to retire  what rate of return is necessary to maintain your desired lifestyle  what investment strategy has the best opportunity available to provide you with a comfortable retirement what distributions will you take  what taxes will you pay what might happen to changes in your health or increases in the cost of living meanwhile what should you be doing now  the most common questions i am asked by my clients are how they can reach their financial goals and what will be required to do so  are you willing to take responsibility for the outcome  if so how can you improve the advantage to an advisory relationship is the expertise available from years of professional experience  service is an important ingredient to those results along with a commitment to your financial progress and wellbeing as a client of mine you become beneficiary to a powerful alliance between “prestige financial services inc” and various financial tools providers  through our strategic relationships i am able to access a comprehensive menu of wealth management solutions offered through mutual fund companies guaranteed products providers  top rated insurance carriers and group benefits for small businesses as your consultant my role is to provide you with quality advice and support i also offer advice in terms of “tax planning” “estate planning” “corporate structure” “employee benefits” and more  to complement my knowledge and experience i may also work closely with your cpa or attorney in consideration of your plan my firm serves those who pursue their financial objectives and a lifestyle dictated by their own terms  are you ready for the challenge  prestige financial reviews and complaints  pissed consumer write a review login google
