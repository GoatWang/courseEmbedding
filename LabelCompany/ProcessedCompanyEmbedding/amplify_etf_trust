amplifyaceshares sb global tactical index trust the product is essentially a unit investment trust uit that will convert to an etf once it hits a certain threshold for assets under management and reaches its oneyear anniversary the “aces” in aceshares stands for “amplify convertible equity securities” a structure whose development was spearheaded by amplify’s christian magoon according to the recently filed form s sec approval of the structure is still pending the current version of the filing notes that the uit will convert to an etf when it is one year old or when it crosses an asyetunspecified aum amount barring a conversion the uit is scheduled to terminate at the year mark the filing indicates that elkhorn will serve as the uit’s sponsor while amplify investments will be the supervisor and evaluator of the uit and eventually the advisor of the etf the concept is designed to make it easier for firms to incubate etfs uits are considerably less costly to operate meaning there would be less of an initial investment required of issuers and that seed money—something increasingly hard for issuers to raise for their products—would be less of a necessity further firms would find it easier to allow their products to continue to trade with minimal assets making it more likely they would be able to make it over that crucial threeyear trading history threshold so many
