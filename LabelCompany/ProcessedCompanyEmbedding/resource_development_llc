outreach program about product development resource in torrance california industrial   about product development resource collaboration expertiseexperience results located in torrance california product development resource provides product development services to inventors entrepreneurs small manufacturers industrial designers industry professionals and importers pdrʼs clients are typically visionary inventors who identify market opportunities for a new product and are seeking a firm that has the capabilities to develop their concept into a workable design the product development process begins by working with the inventor to refine the concept and making the first prototype model further design refinements and prototypes may be needed until the concept is workable pdr provides many services to inventors depending on their needs and capabilities some of these services may involve detailing the concept for optimum manufacturing cost producing prototypes for functional verification and visual evaluation selecting materials best for function and manufacturing researching availability of parts for low entry cost and determining the cost to go into production with the new product pdr also provides engineering services to develop complex mechanical parts for consumer commercial and medical products     facilityin torrance matt tarnayfounder product reviewpdr with client prototype fabrication  cad product review  our capabilities  invention services we know and have all the capabilities that are required to take a invention concept through to the patent and manufacturing processes  engineering services from reverse engineering proof of concept through final engineering documentation we have the product engineering expertise to design your product  cad dd services we have full cad services to meet product development and manufacturing needs founder matt tarnay founded product development resource in  and is the principal designer an inventor himself tarnay has over  utility patents he has an excellent understanding of the product development process having worked with sales and marketing professionals and the manufacturing sector of many industries in launching hundreds product models into the retail sector matt performs his own designs on solidworks d cad software he limits his project load to assure that he can dedicate the time to work directly with his clients during the development process bs mechanical engineering university of southern california ms mechanical engineering university of michigan over  years experience in new product development and market launch employed as vice president of engineering and design engineering at numerous consumer product firms including ford black  decker price pfister virco and brown jordan inventor roadmap and nondisclosure agreement industrial   inventor roadmap key steps in developing a “concept” to a “marketable product”  build a working prototype and test it to verify your idea does what you claim a product development firm or prototype shop can assist in the prototype and testing if successful move to the next step or try a different approach  obtain a patent search to make sure that your idea does not infringe a current patent if a similar patent is found check the claims for specific design elements you may be able to make minor changes and not infringe the patent suggest that this be done through a qualified patent attorney if your design is clear move to the next step  you may now elect to complete a disclosure document form andor file for a provisional patent application with the united states patent and trademark office uspto these documents provide evidence of the date of conception of the invention and establishes an early filing date in a subsequent nonprovisional patent application this process is relatively inexpensive and can be completed by the inventor it is important to understand the limitations of these inventions aids by going to the uspto web site and reading the exact nature of these two documents you may also elect to proceed with a nonprovisional patent application through a qualified attorney  verify that your prototype can be made commercially at a reasonable cost this may require some redesign to make it feasible to manufacture the parts at an economical cost suggest you use a qualified designer or product developer to create drawings that can be used for vendors to quote  determine the cost to produce your design including packaging assembly and tooling again a qualified product developer will be able to contact manufacturers and vendors that can provide cost  calculate the profitability of your product based on the cost and the selling price the selling price can be estimated from products that are sold in the same distribution channels as yours and are similar in size and complexity if there is little or no profit then you may elect to redesign to reduce cost or abandon the project if the product is profitable move to the next step  seek patent protection on your idea if it is patentable step would have determined this use a qualified patent attorney note some product developers can recommend patent attorneys and help with the technical aspects of the invention  build a final prototype of your product that represents as close as possible the final production design this may include a separate visual model along with a working prototype for complex assemblies a product development firm generally has prototype capabilities and can be contracted to build these models the drawings created prior to this step will be valuable to the prototype builder  prepare a presentation package of your product offering for the purpose of convincing potential licensees andor investors that you have a great idea that can be manufactured and sold for a profit the package should include at minimum final prototypes or good quality photos of prototypes product drawings packaging concepts profit analysis distribution channels forecast of quantities and investment needed to start production again a product development firm can assist in this process however the inventor should provide sales and marketing information based on some practical research of the industry via web site retail visits etc  contact potential licensees the inventor is in the best position to identify companies that make and distribute products within the field of invention ie sporting goods medical products etc either mail or present in person your product offering the inventor should feel confident in presenting the product if all the above steps were followed with diligence the presentation package has all the information needed for a potential licensee or investor to make an informed decision on your product make certain that confidentiality agreements are signed before disclosing any proprietary information  negotiate either a royalty or purchase agreementterms and conditions are all negotiable a business partner or attorney may be helpful in this process  if you decide to proceed to market the product yourself along with investors then the journey continuesthis will require a much greater effort and funding but may result in significantly more profit for the inventor and investors some product development firms with experience in manufacturing and the launching of new products can assist in working with vendors on tooling providing offshore sourcing manufacturing planning web site development packaging etc“there is no end to a journey that never begins”   contact
