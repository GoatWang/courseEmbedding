statessupportersas residents and small business owners of lakeview and lincoln park we are expressing our extreme opposition to the medical cannabis dispensary permit for  n halsted street this petition is in no way attempting to deny or discredit marijuana as a medical use our objection is the location of the facility within an established residential community it is our strong belief that the applicant medmar is a nonconforming use and does not meet the required criteria for a special use permit at its proposed location listed below are a few key points to help articulate our collective communitys stance on this issue  the applicant medmar inc will have an adverse impact on the general welfare of the neighborhood or community  the applicant medmar inc is not designed to promote pedestrian safety and comfort  the use will increase crime in the neighborhood in which it is located  the use will cause substantial injury to the value of other property in the neighborhood in which it is to be located  written notice was not provided to all property owners of the subject property and to all property owners within  feet of the property lines of the subject property
