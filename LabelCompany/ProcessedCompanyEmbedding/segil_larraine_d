that sugar fat and yummy stuff — sigh – today is back to watching what i put in my mouth day – and here is a truly fabulous low calorie carrot salad one of the best things about it is that  you have to do a lot of chewing – so it takes longer to eat and so one gets fuller sooner and the cucumber soup is refreshing and cool and also low calorie  cucumber soup ingredients  small persian cucumbers or two large english ones cleaned chopped but not peeled  cup of chopped sweet onion  i used red onion my favorite  chopped garlic clove  cup of vegetable or chicken stock  depends on whether you want it vegetarian or not  cup of fage  fat yogurt  cup of non fat sour cream dill plus thin slices of cucumber for garnish  directions blend first four ingredients in a blender then add the yogurt and cream and blend again – add more stock for desired consistency – cool in the fridge for a few hours and serve it is that easy carrot salad ingredients  large carrots peeled and cleaned and then grated  tbsp of yellow raisins  cup of non fat sour cream  cup of balsalmic vinegar  small packet of stevia or splenda or  tbsp of sugar  if you do not mind the calories and prefer rather than using the chemicals in the artificial sweetener directions mix the carrots and raisins mix the cream vinegar and sugar separately – then mix all together cool in the fridge and serve yum posted in blog recipes

good but tasted bad plus adorable pics of our twins posted on june   by grandma  i tried a really fun looking recipe from cooking light and it was a disaster so i am sharing it with you the good news was that same weekend our grandson twins had a hip hop concert  – so adorable – lots of running around the stage – but they are darling so we hollered and yelled and they were happy and so were we   so here is the recipe – i failed at it – what about youwwwcookinglightcomrecipescobbpizza what happened to me is the following  pizza crust got too hard  all the pieces kept falling off as we tried to eat it  finally we gave up and eat the toppings and threw away the pizza part not worth the calories  i am sure i was the problem as cooking light are normally fabulous sigh and oh well onward we go i

staff in urban farming beekeeping and more posted on june   by grandma every year we endow a young adult to become a segil urban farm fellow at the shalom institute children’s camp in malibu my husband clive trains them with his deep knowledge of farming in an urban environment  although you can see from the picture below that the camp is in the middle of a bucolic scene protected by federal and state parks in the mountains of malibu – but don’t forget –  it is surrounded by a city of  million people clive is an expert beekeeper too and the institute has many offspring of our animals  goats and chickens as well as beehives my husband and our farm manager max have rescued thousands of children from far and wide including many inner city kids who have no idea that eggs do not come from the supermarket but are laid by chickens attend this camp for weeks or weekends depending on the program the camp also  has a special program called shemesh for special needs children and adults all moves the heart and soul and we are so proud to be involved albeit in a small way when reading a variety of texts especially the talmud the  books of moses  the torah and the bible both old and new testaments  it is found that acts of goodness are the active representation of a covenant among people a social contract this is not about simply getting a request in the mail for funds and writing a check or bringing a can of soup to a box at your church or synagogue it is not even about showing up once a year at the homeless shelter or soup kitchen or writing letters to congress to effect social policies those are truly important relevant acts but they fail to engage people in relationships of understanding it is when we become engaged with real people and communities on the other end of our giving of time and resources that we realize the covenantal aspect of doing good the segil urban farm fellowship along with our larraine segil scholars are our ways of creating joy for others as well as receiving joy at the same time in a few months there will be a small ceremony at the camp for the new farm fellow and i will post a picture then with her name and background stay
