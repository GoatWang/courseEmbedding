but the branddefining sir isaac newton caricature of their early years didn’t push a vibe as the cool kid on the block either fact was however it served as a great example of irony because the makers of the original big bertha driver of the early s – the single product that all but changed the golf industry forever – were about as cool as it could get still the image of ely callaway jr’s brainchild had remained mostly unchanged from an image standpoint since  even amid continued growth as a key industry trendsetter into the new century  that was until new svp of marketing harry arnett arrived in  a shift in strategy a shift in perception arnett’s arrival came with no shortage of ideas to change the public’s perception of callaway big ideas the company’s new strategy – to unofficially paraphrase – was going all in on using callaway’s powerful voice to generate appealing content that taps into the passion golfers have for the game this was combined with a focus on attracting a younger more diverse audience that reshaped how people saw callaway product to understand that – to unofficially paraphrase again – “these aren’t your grandpa’s callaways” it worked armed with some incredible product to back up the new shift in marketing callaway became the no  selling iron in  and continues growing in a stagnant golf market as the world’s largest maker of golf clubs all or nothing it’s likely arnett and the top minds at callaway knew that if they were going to dive into uncharted waters for an oem they’d have to have to go all in for their marketingforward approach to work considering unprecedented ideas like callaway live callaway talks and other video multimedia series as well as outinleftfield ideas like the links at petco park where callaway turned an mlb stadium into a hole golf course is safe to say they’ve wholeheartedly done so our behindthescenes look at callaway headquarters golftec’s dave pauley and i recently received an exclusive behindthescenes tour at callaway golf headquarters in carlsbad calif but not just any tour – we were escorted by callaway media correspondent and freelance tv reporter amanda balionis who served

athome equipment for the fitness enthusiast although going to the gym a few times a week is a terrific way to get in shape and stay healthy it can sometimes be difficult to make it to the gym runners and bikers can get their exercise in and around their neighborhood but sometimes the weather doesnt cooperate thats why having your own equipment makes it possible for you to exercise anytime day or night without worry about getting too hot or too cold when buying exercise equipment there are some things to know before making these bigticket purchases treadmills one of the main considerations regarding a treadmill is how much space it takes up a typical treadmill is about  feet long and  feet wide for those with limited space a treadmill that folds up is ideal and some can fold up so thin that they fit under a bed when not in use another consider is stride length some treadmills have a long deck area that is dedicated to running while some have design cues that limit the running space treadmills should have a high degree of adjustability to be the most useful to you this includes speeds that should range between  and  to  miles per hour and incline grades of around  to  percent some upgrades to look for on treadmills includes a dock for ipods or mp players bluetooth and wifi connectivity and usb ports elliptical trainers for a complete workout consider an elliptical trainer similar to a treadmill an elliptical trainer takes up a decent amount of space ellipticals usually run about  feet long but can be  feet long and between  and  feet wide because of the stepping action that is part of using an elliptical you should know that elliptical trainers have stepup heights of between  and  inches above the floor having adjustable cushioned handgrips is a nice addition making sure the user is comfortable and allowing users of different heights to use it for multitaskers you want to look for certain hightech features for the equipment to have such as usb ports web access bluetooth connectivity and the ability to link to a mobile device the elliptical trainer should offer several programs to keep your workout interesting such as hill climbing longdistance climbs and one that targets a specific heart rate exercise bikes comfort is probably the most important consideration when choosing an exercise or stationary bicycle the saddle should be padded and designed in a manner of your choosing some users like a wide saddle and some like a long narrow saddle adjustable handlebars are features that also add to a users comfort weight capacity is another consideration as some lightweight bikes only hold up to  pounds while some can hold users of  pounds or more these bikes can be either beltdriven or chaindriven models and should be quiet when operating like elliptical machines and treadmills stationary bikes have builtin programs that allow users to vary their workouts and keep them from becoming tedious you also want to look for bikes that have heartrate monitors computer screens that display your statistics as you ride and adjustable tension levels rowing machines rowing machines come in four different styles air hydraulic magnetic and water all simulate the rowing action of a canoe or kayak in the water air rowing machines use flywheels similar to elliptical machines to create resistance hydraulic machines use cylinders filled with oil to create resistance magnets provide the resistance in magnetic rowing machines and water pressure provides the resistance in water rowing machines the seat should be comfortable and can either be a saddle or have a back connected to it some rowing machines are fixed while some are foldable which is a consideration for those with limited space one thing to note is that fixed machines tend to be more durable for frequent home use than folding rowers home gyms home gyms make it possible for users to perform many different weight resistance exercises all with one machine in a small space some home gyms use free weights purchased separately to provide resistance while others come with the weights attached to the gym an adjustable bench that detaches is useful for doing several different exercises either seated or lying down some gyms that come preloaded with weights have the ability to add more making them useful to people looking to increase their strength levels there should be a number of accessories as well such as a pulldown bar lat bar dumbbell and leg liftshow moreelectrode comp dcproddal envproda profprod ver shaabecbaddedacefc cid outdoor sports  walmartcomskip

yourself to the max with outdoor sports equipmentthe outdoors lend themselves to an impressive list of ways to enjoy your natural surroundings whether youre camping and fishing or competing in winter sports some outdoor sports like climbing only require a few items for you to grab before you begin partaking in them while others such as fishing or snow skiing require some supplies for success whatever your outdoor passion is you can find the item you need to enjoy yourself to the fullest save money at the same time by taking advantage of our every day low pricescampingto have a successful camping trip there are certain pieces of equipment that are musthave items and these include tents sleeping bags cooking equipment lights coolers and emergency preparedness items youll want to pick up depending on how many people are camping you can choose tents that sleep one to two people or ones that sleep seven or more people many of these tents only have an entrance and space to sleep on the ground while some of the larger tents have enough room for you to stand up inside and even use cots instead of sleeping on the ground sleeping bags keep you warm on cold nights especially if theres no fire and youre sleeping on the ground many have extra padding for comfort and zip up completely to keep you pestfree as you sleepfor overnight trips or longer you definitely want to have a cooler or two for cold beverages and to keep fish fresh if fishing was on your agenda whether youre eating what you brought or what you caught some staples for camping cooking equipment include a portable gas or charcoal grill cookware like castiron skillets or dutch ovens and utensils like tongs and spatulas youll also want things to eat on and with and you can buy camping dish packs or paper and plastic items that are biodegradable and easy to pack home with you the most important emergency preparedness items you can have on hand include a flashlight or lantern first aid kit and some basic tools including a knife or multitoolfishingif youre using live or cut bait all you really need to go fishing is a rod and reel some fishing line some hooks and some weights and bobbers otherwise you can get even more detailed and load up a tackle box with artificial baits lures spoons and attractants to bring in those fish rods vary in lengths shorter rods are better for boat and pier fishing and long poles are better suited for surf fishing you can choose from spincast reels which are basic reels for beginners spinning reels which are common for most kinds of fishing and baitcasting reels which are more advanced reels that work for bigger game fish if youre doing your fishing on a party boat or other offshore vehicle and youre trolling for fish a trolling reel is your best optionfishing line is differentiated by type and the weight of fish it can hold monofilament line is the most common fishing line its made of nylon and has a single strand braided fishing line is similar to monofilament line only it has two lines that are braided together to create more strength less common fishing lines include fluorocarbon which is virtually invisible underwater wire fishing line which anglers use to catch mackerel tuna and other fish with strong teeth and fly fishing line which is exclusively used for fly fishing and very lightweight a basic bait or circle hook which is a more curved version of a bait hook will catch most fish but there are others that work with certain types of fish if youre fishing on the top of the water you want to use bobbers to keep the bait near the top weights work when you want to do bottom fishing for species like halibutother outdoor sportscamping and fishing are two of the most popular outdoor activities but theyre nowhere near exhaustive when it comes to all the fun you can have with outside sportswinter sports the two most popular winter sports are skiing and snowboarding most of the things you need to do both are the same such as the clothing and accessories like goggles jackets and hats many people prefer snowboarding to skiing because you can do more tricks and the initial costs to get into the sport are much less than skiing another popular winter sport is ice skating especially in locations with ponds and lakes that freeze over or have indoor skating rinks all you really need is a pair of goodfitting ice skates and the motivation to get back up again as youre learningclimbing and mountaineering if you like climbing and arent tackling steep rock wall faces the basic equipment you need includes paracord or rope carabiners both locking and nonlocking a harness hand protection like gloves boots and a helmet paracord is rated by weight so if you have three people climbing on the same rope or two heavier people you want to have paracord thats rated for  pounds or higher the carabiners allow you to move up and down the rope as you climb without getting snagged the harness is a safety device that can keep you from falling if
