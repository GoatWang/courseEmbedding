nasdaq rprx is a usbased development stage biopharmaceutical company headquartered in the woodlands texas founded in  as zonagen it is focused on the development of oral small molecule drugs to address major unmet medical needs in male and female health joseph s podolski is the ceo of this company historyedit the company was organized on august   as zonagen to try to develop birth control methods based on modification of the zona pellucida—a part of the oocyte the company bought the rights to the research of bonnie s dunbar researcher and professor at the baylor college of medicine and attempted to create a contraceptive vaccine zonagen inc was formed in  by dunbar baylor and a group of investors that included ross perot and lloyd bentsen iii son of a former treasury secretary the company hoped to market dunbars invention as a nonsurgical method of sterilizing dogs and cats in the meantime zonagen would help dunbar continue the pursuit of her lifes work the worlds first contraceptive vaccine for humans her research which had been progressing well ground to a complete halt according to brian wallstin of the houston press newspaper in his article “biological disaster” the company went public in  with claims that a contraceptive vaccine was imminent bonnie dunbar ended relations with the company and sued them zonagen would not develop any commercial product from research relating to the zona pellucida—despite naming itself after it its next project was to create an adjuvant these products modify the effects of the active ingredient in a drug without having any direct effects of their own however zonagens attempt immumax was merely an attempt to patent and cash in off a widely researched generic product a structural element in the exoskeleton of crustaceans the compound chitosan was indeed capable of causing some desirable effects within the immune system but it also caused permanent scarring at injection point which made it useless for the sort of medicinal purposes zonagen hoped to use it for after abandoning immumax zonagen moved on to its third drug vasomax a disintegrating oral formulation of phentolamine realizing that pfizers viagra was going to be a hit product zonagen hoped to ride its coattails with an erectile dysfunction drug of its own however unlike pfizer zonagen repeated its experience from immumax it got a fortyyearold generic drug phentolamine dressed it up as something new and acted as if it was a genuine viagra competitor while phentolamine was never proven to create erections by itself zonagen claimed that its formulation simply phentolamine administered orally instead of in pill form would work despite a failed phase ii trial in  for vasomax the company proceeded to phase iii trials anyway once scheringplough pulled out of its partnership with zonagen for vasomax zonagen abandoned its new drug application for vasomax the company was left with little more than a corporate shell and a bunch of lawsuits joseph s podolski served as chief executive officer and as a director since  he joined zonagen in  as vice president of operations previously podolski spent twelve years in various engineering product development and manufacturing positions at gd searle a subsidiary of monsanto company before joining monsanto podolski held positions in manufacturing engineering quality control and development of fine chemicals antibiotics pharmaceuticals and hospital products with abbott laboratories dearborn chemical company and baxter pharmaceuticals joseph s podolski the man who led zonagen through two decades decided it was time for a name change in  zonagen changed its name to repros therapeutics started to develop other pharmaceutical products for the reproductive system and began work on its fourth lead drug proellex proellex is a very similar drug to asoprisnil asoprisnil was developed by germanybased schering ag to treat endometriosis development was discontinued because the drug was causing thickening of the endometrium repros claimed that its time on the drugoff the drug approach will make a big difference in safety versus asoprisnil currently products under clinical trial are proellex and androxal none have been approved by the food and drug administration as of mid androxal consists of an isomer of clomifene which is already being used as a generic

podolski salesman of the century rprx in nearly  years as a pubic company repros fka zonagen has been run by one man joseph podolski who has failed to deliver quarter after quarter and year after year how did rprx fka zona get here and how could it survive so long once upon a time in  an outfit named reich  co most famous for touting its offerings on am radio ads in the early s took public a company called zonagen zona reich did offerings for hemagen hmgn now c concord camera lens now delisted protein polymer tech ppti now at  of a penny polar molecular pomh also delisted liuski intl lski surprise delisted and well one gets the idea chris byron wrote a great piece on reich for ny magazine check it out here zonagen went public with dreams of a contraceptive vaccine and in  zona acquired the rights to a preclinical oral impotency treatment zona named it vasomax zona was also working on a third product an immune booster called immumax immumax turned out to be nothing more than chitosan ground up shrimp shells you can go to any health food shop and buy as much as you would like today it is often marketed as a fat blocking pill in  zona became a dan dorfman favorite and the stock began to zoom in  on the back of what appeared to the untrained eye to be positive phase ii trial results and a marketing deal for vasomax with schering plough zona reached a high of  split adjusted and managed to raise mm in a secondary offering but that was the high point for zona in late  the story began to unravel and the stock began a quick fall it was revealed that the incessantly hyped vasomax pills were nothing but an old generic drug called phentolamine and milk sugar by mid the bottom really fell out when pfizer‘s viagra was approved by the fda after a june  urology conference the shares fell even more a closer look at the study results showed they were not actually very impressive from a june   bloomberg news article “two clinical trials of vasomax found that about  percent of men with mild to moderate erectile dysfunction responded to a  milligram dose of the drug and  percent responded when the dose was twice was strong also the vasomax data looked only at patients with mild to moderate impotence a subset that is hard for doctors to identify said steve lisi an analyst at mehta partners who attended the presentation in addition  percent of the men in the vasomax trial taking placebo also reported success fairly close to the benefits seen among those on the drug lisi said” during late  zona also decided to test phentolamine in women calling the new pill vasofem the news only got worse for reproszonagen on may   when the fda gave the company a smackdown “the woodlands texas may  bloomberg — zonagen inc said it expects us regulators will not approve its first product — an impotence pill that would compete with pfizer inc’s viagra the surprise disclosure is likely to send shares of the unprofitable biotech company tumbling zonagen and marketing partner scheringplough corp said they expect the food and drug administration to issue a socalled “nonapprovable” letter for vasomax that’s after the two companies declined an agency request that they defend the drug next month before a panel that would evaluate its safety and effectiveness in august  things got even uglier as the fda put a clinical hold on all studies using phentolamine due to toxicity concerns washington aug  bloomberg — zonagen inc says the us food and drug administration has barred the company from further human trials of zonagen’s experimental impotence drug vasomax because of safety concerns zonagen released the news before us markets opened shares in the moneylosing texas dropped   to   in early trading  the socalled clinical hold affects zonagen’s experimental drugs for male and female sexual dysfunction nb for even more detail on the zona story of the mid to late s read manuel asensio’s book sold short your author cannot recommend it more highly it is a great read in april  the clinical hold on phentolamine was finally lifted but in may  the fda demanded additional new studies from zona to consider vasomaxfem the woodlands texas may  bloomberg — zonagen inc shares fell  percent after us regulators said they won’t consider approving the biotechnology company’s first product an impotence drug without further testing on animals zonagen fell  to   and have fallen almost  percent since march  the us food and drug administration’s demand for more studies on the drug was reported late yesterday citing safety concerns the fda asked zonagen to carry out a second twoyear study on animals of the experimental drug that scheringplough corp intends to market as vasomax the agency said zonagen could continue testing vasomax in people though it limited the treatment time and dosage in human testing this will not be the last time zona investors see such news from the fda in august  zona began phase i work on progenta a drug that would become known as proellex a compound with its own dubious safety profile in  zona admitted its contraceptive vaccine which was the hyped product at the ipo was a failure in animal studies and killed the program the woodlands texas sept  bloomberg — zonagen inc said it halted research on an experimental contraceptive vaccine ending an agreement the biotechnology company had with american home products corp on the product animal studies failed to show the vaccine works across all animal types the company said in a release distributed on businesswire no jobs will be cut the company said company officials were not available for comment zonagen shares have fallen  percent in the last year the shares which closed at  yesterday once traded as high as  zonagen also has faced delays and problems with studies of its impotence drug vasomax which  scheringplough corp had intended to market vasomax was once considered a potential rival to pfizer inc’s viagra in  the clowns at zonagen finally gave up on vasomax withdrawing the application for approval in the uk and deciding not to do the additional animal studies demanded by the fda by  after a failed merger a failed herpes treatment and another attempt to sell phentolamine under the name bimexes  the company’s pipeline was reduced to progenta as a treatment for both endometreosis and uterine fibroids and androxal androxal a male fertility treatment is actually a chemical called enclomifene enclomifene is a serm selective estrogen receptor modulator that is just a single isomer version of a generic drug clomifene better known as clomid much like vasomax zonarprx‘s androxal is just a hyped drug that in reality already exists in a cheaper generic form in  zonagen was touted by gene marcial in his inside wall street column reminiscent of dan dorfman  years earlier the company also changed its name to repros therapeutics in may of that year unfortunately for repros in  the fda told the company that the endpoints originally proposed for their phase iii trials of androxal were not appropriate so it was back to the drawing board for rprx and their androxal studies readers of asensio’s book will recall this is not the first time that podolski has had to change trial endpoints to satisfy the regulators in what must have been a strange episode of deja vu for long suffering rprx shareholders  brought about interesting phase ii results for proellex and a huge drop in the price of rprx shares in a july   press release rprx disclosed safety problems with the mg dose of the drug furthermore repros has decided to discontinue the use of the higher  mg dose in its ongoing studies in women with chronic symptomatic uterine fibroids and anemia associated with this condition due to an observed dosedependent increase in liver enzymes in a low percentage of women in august of  rprx filed a q with a now classic disclaimer “we may need to seek protection under the provisions of the us bankruptcy code and in that event it is unlikely that stockholders would receive any value for their shares” for a complete discussion of the risks associated with our inability to raise additional capital on a timely basis’’ the  company also stated that “our ability to continue as a going concern requires that we raise additional funds immediately without which we will need  to cease our business operations and begin bankruptcy or liquidation proceedings” of course podolski is nothing if not resilient and somehow he found people to fund him while in january of  rprx traded as high as  in september  rprx raised a massive mm at an embarrassing c a share the woodlands texas — september   repros therapeutics nasdaqrprx today announced that repros has entered into a definitive agreement with a single institutional investor to sell  million shares of its common stock at  per share for gross proceeds of approximately  million but just a few days later the fda delivered another blow to repros much like with vasomax the fda put a clinical hold on proellex due to safety concerns but rprx managed to keep on selling stock in early october  they raised cash again the woodlands texas — october   repros therapeutics nasdaqgmrprx today announced that repros has entered into a definitive agreement with  institutional investors to sell  million shares of its common stock at  per share for gross proceeds of approximately  million the offering is expected to close on or about october   subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions in early  rprx initiated an atthemarket continuous offering of stock through ladenburg through which they raised mm in june  the fda agreed to lift the clinical hold on proellex and allow rprx to test lower doses for safety will they be safe will they be effective but what the fda gives it can also take away and in november  the fda further crushed rprx‘s dreams of andoxal approval under a special protocol assessment agreement spa nov  bloomberg — repros therapeutics down as much as  as fda does not agree with company’s proposal for moving into phase iii trials under an spa for androxal in the treatment of secondary hypogonadism in men what is truly amazing about zonarprx is that since inception it has managed to raise and burn over mm with nothing to show for it two things are clear podolski might not have a
