receipt of a written request to us at smart server inc  worden st san diego ca  description of business overview business development summary smart server inc is a development stage company incorporated in the state of nevada in october of  we were formed to engage in the business of designing and developing a computer application software for mobile phones smart phones and tablet computers such as those based on appler and androidr platforms which provides customers at participating restaurants bars and clubs the ability to pay their bill with their smartphone  without even having to ask for the check we have designed a website which will be a primary source of information for the general public of the nature of our business additionally we have begun our initial writing design and programming of our mobile payment solution app during our initial month of formation we concentrated our energies on analyzing the viability of our business plan and establishing our business model including researching the items needed to secure a trademark filing a trademark application and developing relationships with mobile app retailers our president mr lane has no experience in developing mobile applications and websites we are using the services of a website and mobile app developer to design our logo and website and develop our mobile application we do not presently have a marketready product and we currently do not have any customers as such we have generated no revenues we are attempting to build smart server into a successful designer of a mobile payment solution app for smart phones and other mobile devices in order to generate revenues during the next twelve months we must  maintain our website  we believe that the internet is a great marketing tool not only for providing information on our company but also for providing current information on our upcoming app as well as industry related information regarding new technology and device updates we recently launched our updated website which is not yet fully operational but we have initiated the process of developing a more advanced site where we can provide a more detailed section regarding proprietary app designs and features we have paid approximately  towards the development of our website and application  develop and implement a product development timeline  smart server will require the implementation of a detailed timeline to ensure the company produce a marketable mobile application these keys areas will need to be addressed to assist in the assurance of the companys success · efficient design and programing writing · extensive beta testing through friends and family network or eventually through current users · timely and useful downloadable updates · marketable launch through third party retailer or through the companys website  develop and implement a marketing plan smart servers planned revenue streams will require an extensive list of contacts to allow for the marketing of our mobile apps awareness of the revenue potential smart server will be able to deliver through its website and app will be delivered through the implementation of a number of marketing initiatives including search engine optimization website completion hosted video demonstrations third party service contacts tradeshow attendance as well as blogging and other forms of social media which are driven by technology and mobile flexibility these efforts and the resulting awareness will be key drivers behind the success of our revenue producing operations industry background and trends apps are designed to help a user perform specific tasks and are generally downloaded by users from an app store directly onto their smartphone or tablet apps are becoming increasingly popular according to international dare corporation idc in december  worldwide mobile application downloads are forecast to reach  billion downloads in  an approximate  increase from an estimated  billion downloads in  while the foregoing industry predictions are based on publicly available third party industry reports there are wide ranging variations in the predictions regarding the size of the future mobile applications market and undue reliance should not be placed on these statistics business of issuer smart server inc has created a business plan built upon designing and selling mobile apps for smart phones and other mobile platforms such as tablets smart server is striving to design and develop applications which will not only improve the efficiency of the restaurant dining experience as is the case with our initial app smart server which provides a platform where consumers and restaurant patrons can pay their tabs directly from their smart phones when using a credit or debit card on may   the company completed its initial public offering through the sale of  shares of common stock resulting in gross proceeds of  on july   we received notice from our market maker that we were assigned the symbol svtz to initiate trading on the overthecounter pink sheets our product smart server is a payment program for windows mac ios android and windows mobile operating systems this application is database driven using an online cloud database for active live syncing for the users data and accounts our application allows consumers to eliminate the inconvenience of having to wait for their server to drop off the tab when dining and instead pay your tab directly from your smart phone with our proprietary technology point of sale also called pos or checkout is the place where a retail transaction is completed it is the point at which a customer makes a payment to the merchant in exchange for goods or services smart server upon full development of our smartphone application will integrate with all major hospitality pos systems including but not limited to harbourtouch ncr posguys accupos micros focus restaurant management software and futurepos our cloud based mobile payment solution will not require any additional hardware and our pos integration system will allow information to flow securely and automatically through the system additionally you wont have to change or modify your existing merchant processor or interrupt your normal work flow some of the benefits that users will receive from our smart server application include · saves time  have you ever waited patiently for a server to return your debit or credit card and it was not returned in a timely manner whats the point in waiting for your check when you can close out your tab at any time from your smartphone this can be frustrating when you are in a hurry to pay your bill or you have places to be with smart server you can avoid this entirely by simply paying your bill from your smartphone or tablet at participating restaurants · reviews  as evident by the popularity of yelp reviews are written by people using yelp to share their everyday local business experiences giving voice to consumers and bringing word of mouth online the information these reviews provide is valuable for consumers and businesses alike with that being said we believe an important part of having repeat customers in the restaurant and bar industry is knowing what your customers think about the level of customer service and the overall experience to that end we intend to provide reviews from smart server users upon implementation users will be able to review and rate participating restaurants and bars through our app we believe our reviews will provide valuable feedback to our users as well as offering an incentive to attract new participating establishments · promotions  we intend to work with participating restaurants and establishments to offer customers who use smart server exclusive rewards promotions and special offers when implemented these discounts will be available directly from your from and automatically redeemable on your bill · bill splitting  another feature we plan on adding to our app is a function where smart server users can split a bill whenever there are two or more individuals paying the bill this feature avoids the necessity of having the server split the bill into two separate checks which can be make paying your bill even more complicated and thus time consuming when implemented we believe this feature will make our app even more convenient because it will save your time · tipping  yet another feature we intend to make available on our app is the ability to tip your server when paying your bill currently we are researching the viability of adding a mandatory tipping feature to our app unless the user writes a negative review stating why they decided not to include a tip whether it was for poor service or the food was unpleasant · lost debitcredit card  have you ever handed your credit card to a server to pay your bill and accidentally left your card with smart server you wont have to worry about this because you never have to pull your card out of your walletpurse this reduces the likelihood of losing your card your card being stolen or being forced to come back to pick up your card upon realizing that you left it market and revenue generation in order to generate revenues during the next twelve months we must  develop and implement a marketing plan  smart servers planned revenue streams will require establishing a web presence and improved visibility within the public and private sectors initially we intend to generate advertising revenue primarily from display audio and video advertising on our website we anticipate that such advertising will be included on our website soon after we have a fully operational website which we anticipate will be by the second quarter of  we also intend to build revenue based upon profits realized through our sales through advertising apps a major key factor in the companys success will be the building of third party relationships within the restaurant industry and mobile technology industry  develop and implement a comprehensive consumer information website  for the foreseeable future the companys website wwwsmartserverbiz will be a primary asset and a potential key source of revenue generation as well as company information currently management is formulating its plan on how best to employ its resources to expand and improve the site we are working to add to the functionality of the site including listing participating merchants where customers can use smart server as a mobile payment method real time testimonials and reviews from actual customers feedback from participating merchants on how smart server actually impacts their businesses by tracking order history and preferences of users additionally we need to optimize the site for search engine rank as well as renew the look and feel of the site to coincide with our objectives for the smart server we are also analyzing the viability of adding feature where users are given personalized offers and rewards for being loyal patrons and using smart server while they frequent participating merchants thus far we have not yet recognized revenues from the website nor is there any indication that we ever will recognize direct revenues from our website we do not presently have a fully operational website or a marketready product nor do we have any customers thus have generated no revenues our operations to date have been devoted primarily to startup and development activities which include the following · formation of the company · development of company logo · development of our business plan · filing a trademark application for our logo · launching of our preliminary website and · begin the design and development of our initial mobile application smart server inc was established in october of  currently we have temporary offices at  worden st san diego ca  our sole officer director and founding stockholder created the business as a result of his experience in the restaurant industry and realized the opportunity for the smart server concept competition there are many companies who compete directly with our products a number of companies who market and a similar concept have recently emerged including uber tabbedout cover dash iwaitlesscom most of these companies have significantly greater financial and other resources than us and have been developing their products longer than we have been developing ours additionally there are not significant barriers to entry in our industry and new companies may be created that will compete with us and other more established companies who do not now directly compete with us may choose to enter our markets and compete with us in the future intellectual property and proprietary rights proprietary rights are important to our success and our competitive position to protect our proprietary rights we rely on copyright service marks and trade secret laws confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions we currently have one pending trademark registration we cannot assure you that any of our proprietary rights with respect to our products or services will be viable or of value in the future since the validity enforceability and type of protection of proprietary rights in internetrelated industries are uncertain and still evolving despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult and while we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software products exists software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states and effective copyright trademark and trade secret protection may not be available in those jurisdictions our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate to protect us from the infringement or misappropriation of such rights by others in recent years there has been significant litigation in the united states involving patents and other intellectual property rights particularly in the software and internetrelated industries we could become subject to intellectual property infringement claims as the number of our competitors grows and our products and services overlap with competitive offerings these claims even if not meritorious could be expensive to defend and could divert managements attention from operating our company if we become liable to third parties for infringing their intellectual property rights we could be required to pay a substantial award of damages and to develop noninfringing technology obtain a license or cease selling the products that contain the infringing intellectual property we may be unable to develop noninfringing technology or obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms if at all government regulation our activities are not currently subject to any particular regulations by governmental agencies other than those routinely imposed on corporate businesses however we cannot predict the impact of future regulations on either us or advertisers that may advertise with our apps employees we are a development stage company and currently have only one parttime employee matthew lane who is also our sole officer and director mr lane has spent approximately  years employed in the restaurant and bar industry and has amassed a database of contacts through his experience in the restaurant industry which will be incorporated into our marketing strategy it is mr lane who is providing us his experience and knowledge for development of our business plan initially mr lane will coordinate all of our business operations including working with our app designer and program writing we have executed a total of six promissory notes with e venture resources inc for a total of  as of may   the terms of the promissory note provide for an interest rate of  per annum with all accrued balances due and payable by  months from the execution of the promissory note we plan to use consultants attorneys accountants as necessary and do not plan to engage any additional fulltime employees in the near future we believe the use of nonsalaried personnel allows us to expend our capital resources as a variable cost as opposed to a fixed cost of operations in other words if we have insufficient revenues or cash available we are in a better position to only utilize those services required to generate revenues as opposed to having salaried employees we do not intend to hire any additional employees within the next  months at such time as the company would deem it appropriate to hire additional staff a portion of any employee compensation would likely include the right to acquire our stock which would dilute the ownership interest of holders of existing shares of our common stock consultant on november   we entered into a consulting agreement with techit marketing group inc techit wherein techit agreed to assist the company with designing and developing the companys website and mobile application the term of the agreement commenced on november   and will continue for  months we agreed to pay techit an initial payment of  paid on november   and future fees will be based on an hourly basis and as new services are performed and fees are earned · design smart server logo · website theme and initial setup · domain purchase  registration  yrs wwwsmartserverbiz · virtual private server rental  year · mobile app setup  deployment · apple individual developers subscription annual fee · wordpress plugin subscriptions going concern the companys financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business the company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern as of may   the company had an accumulated deficit of  the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable if the company is unable to obtain adequate capital it could be forced to cease operations the company is currently contemplating an offering of its equity or debt securities to finance continuing operations there are no agreements or arrangements currently in place or under negotiation to obtain such financing and there are no assurances that the company will be successful and without sufficient financing it would be unlikely for the company to continue as a going concern the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations results of operations results of operations for the six month ended may   operating expenses during the six month ended may   were  of which was professional fees associated with legal and accounting expenses and the remaining  was related to general and administrative costs in comparison operating expenses from inception october   to november   were  of which  was in professional fees  was for executive compensation  in research and development and the remaining  was related to general and administrative costs the increase in professional fees is due to increased legal work and accounting fees liquidity and capital resources as of may   the company has a total of in available cash if we were to not receive any additional funds we could not continue in business for the next  months with our currently available capital however we will not be able to fully implement our improved website or complete the development of our app which will negatively impact the receipt of any significant revenues cash increased primarily due to the receipt of funds from this offering to offset our near term cash equivalents and additional debt financing since inception we have financed our cash flow requirements through debt financing as we expand our activities we may and most likely will continue to experience net negative cash flows from operations pending receipt sales from our mobile app in addition we have promissory notes with e venture resources inc for a total of  the terms of the promissory notes provide for an interest rate of  per annum with all accrued balances due and payable within  months of the date of the promissory note in the future we anticipate obtaining additional financing to fund operations through common stock offerings to the extent available or to obtain additional financing to the extent necessary to augment our working capital even though we intend to begin generating revenues we can make no assurances and therefore we may incur operating losses in the next twelve months our limited operating history makes predictions of future operating results difficult to ascertain our prospects must be considered in light of the risks expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stage of development particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets such risks for us include but are not limited to an evolving business model advancement of technology and the management of growth to address these risks we must among other things continue our development of relevant applications stay abreast of mobile app trends as well as implement and successfully execute our business and marketing strategy there can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing such risks and the failure to do so can have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and results of operations the following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated six

server incsmart server was formed to engage in the business of designing and developing computer application software for smart phones and tablet computers mobile payment application to provide customers at participating restaurants bars and clubs the ability to pay their bill with their smartphone without having to ask for the check smart server ceased its software development activities in  and having no operations and no or nominal assets met the definition of a shell company under the securities exchange act of  as amended and the rules and regulations thereunder in july  berrard

marine and auto segments and is easily expandable for additional products in the future for additional information see item  business background and overview and item  of part ii note  subsequent events critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the united states gaap requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes the securities and exchange commission the sec has defined a companys critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and results of operations and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below we also have other key accounting policies which involve the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results for additional information see item  of part ii financial statements note  description of business and accounting policies although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information presently available actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions  purchase accounting for business combinations the company will account for acquisitions by allocating the fair value of the consideration transferred to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the date of the acquisition and any remaining difference will be recorded as goodwill adjustments may be made to the preliminary purchase price allocation when facts and circumstances that existed on the date of the acquisition surface during the allocation period subsequent to the preliminary purchase price allocation not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition contingent consideration will be recorded at fair value based on the facts and circumstances on the date of the acquisition and any subsequent changes in the fair value are recorded through earnings each reporting period transactions that occur in conjunction with or subsequent to the closing date of the acquisition will be evaluated and accounted for based on the facts and substance of the transactions goodwillgoodwill will not be amortized but rather tested for impairment at least annually the company will test goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each year goodwill will also be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount impairment testing for goodwill will be done at the reporting unit level a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment also known as a component a component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component the company has concluded that currently it has one reporting unit determining fair value includes the use of significant estimates and assumptions management will utilize an income approach specifically the discounted cash flow technique as a means for estimating fair value this discounted cash flow analysis requires various assumptions including those about future cash flows transactional and customer growth rates and discount rates expected cash flows will be based on historical customer growth and the growth in transactions including attrition future strategic initiatives and continued longterm growth of the business the discount rates used for the analysis will reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk and size risk premiums these estimates can be affected by factors such as customer and transaction growth pricing and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict other intangible assets identifiable intangible assets may include customer relationships noncompete agreements trademarks trade names and internet domain names the estimated fair value of these intangible assets at the time of acquisition will be based upon various valuation techniques including replacement cost and discounted future cash flow projections customer relationships will be amortized on a straightline basis over the expected average life of the acquired accounts which will be based upon several factors including historical longevity of customers and contracts acquired and historical retention rates noncompete agreements will be amortized on a straightline basis over the term of the agreement which will generally not exceed five years the company will review the recoverability of these assets if events or circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired and will periodically reevaluate the estimated remaining lives of these assets trademarks trade names and internet domain names are considered to be indefinite lived intangible assets unless specific evidence exists that a shorter life is more appropriate indefinite lived intangible assets will be tested at a minimum on an annual basis using an income approach or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired longlived assets fixed assets will be reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used will be measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if such assets or asset groups are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized will be measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets or asset groups exceeds the related fair values the company will also perform a periodic assessment of the useful lives assigned to the longlived assets technology and content technology costs for the rumbleon technology platform will be accounted for pursuant to asc  intangibles  goodwill and other and will consist principally of development activities including payroll and related expenses for employees and thirdparty contractors involved in application content production maintenance operation and platform development for new and existing products and services as well as other technology infrastructure expenses technology and content costs for design or maintenance of internaluse software and general website development will be expensed as incurred costs incurred to develop new website functionality as well as new software products for resale and significant upgrades to existing platforms or modules will be capitalized and amortized over seven years  beneficial conversion feature from time to time the company may issue convertible notes that may have conversion prices that create an embedded beneficial conversion feature pursuant to the guidelines established by the financial accounting standards boards fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  debt with conversion and other options the beneficial conversion feature bcf of a convertible security is normally characterized as the convertible portion or feature of certain securities that provide a rate of conversion that is below market value or inthemoney when issued the company records a bcf related to the issuance of a convertible security when issued and also records the estimated fair value of any conversion feature issued with those securities beneficial conversion features that are contingent upon the occurrence of a future event are recorded when the contingency is resolved the bcf of a convertible note is measured by allocating a portion of the notes proceeds to the conversion feature if applicable and as a reduction of the carrying amount of the convertible note equal to the intrinsic value of the conversion feature both of which are credited to additional paidincapital the company calculates the fair value of the conversion feature embedded in any convertible security using either a the black scholes valuation model or b a discount cash flow analysis tested for sensitivity to key level  inputs using the monte carlo simulation the value of the proceeds received from the convertible security are then allocated between the conversion features and the underlying security on a relative fair value basis the allocated fair value is recorded in the financial statements as a debt discount from the face amount of the security with a corresponding amount to additional paid in capital the debt discount is amortized to interest expense over the life of the note using the effective interest method revenue recognition we will recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied i there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement ii the product or service has been provided to the customer iii the amount of the product sale or fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable and iv the collection of our sales proceeds or fees are probable valuation allowance for accounts receivable we will estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts for accounts receivable by considering a number of factors including overall credit quality age of outstanding balances historical writeoff experience and specific account analysis that projects the ultimate collectability of the outstanding balances ultimately actual results could differ from these assumptions income taxes the company follows asc topic  income taxes for recording the provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based upon the difference between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted marginal tax rate applicable when the related asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled deferred income tax expenses or benefits are based on the changes in the asset or liability each period if available evidence suggests that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance is required to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized future changes in such valuation allowance are included in the provision for deferred income taxes in the period of change deferred income taxes may arise from temporary differences resulting from income and expense items reported for financial accounting and tax purposes in different periods deferred taxes are classified as current or noncurrent depending on the classification of assets and liabilities to which they relate deferred taxes arising from temporary differences that are not related to an asset or liability are classified as current or noncurrent depending on the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse the company applies a morelikelythannot recognition threshold for all tax uncertainties asc topic  only allows the recognition of those tax benefits that have a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities as of december   december   and november   the company reviewed its tax positions and determined there were no outstanding or retroactive tax positions with less than a  likelihood of being sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities therefore this standard has not had a material effect on the company  stock based compensation we will measure and recognize all stock based compensation at fair value at the date of grant and recognize compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating the share volatility the expected term the award will be outstanding and the amount of the awards that are expected to be forfeited we will utilize the blackscholes option pricing model or other industry accepted valuation model as necessary to determine the fair value newly issued accounting pronouncements no recently adopted or new accounting pronouncements have had or are expected to have a material effect on the companys net loss

of inventory held for sale however additional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us or at all volatility in the credit markets may also have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain debt financing  even though we expect to begin generating revenue we can make no assurances and therefore we may incur operating losses in the next twelve months our limited operating history makes predictions of future operating results difficult to ascertain our prospects must be considered in light of the risks expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stage of development particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets such risks for us include but are not limited to an evolving business model advancement of technology and the management of growth to address these risks we must among other things continue our development of relevant applications stay abreast of changes in the marketplace as well as

history and we cannot assure you the company will achieve or maintain profitability  the initial development and growth of our business over the first  months of operations and such growth may not be indicative of our future growth and if we continue to grow rapidly we may not be able to manage our growth effectively  we may require additional capital to pursue our business objectives and respond to business opportunities challenges or unforeseen circumstances if capital is not available on terms acceptable to us or at all we may not be able to develop and grow our business as anticipated and

affect the timeliness of such information and may impair our ability to attract or retain consumers and our dealers and to timely invoice all parties  if we suffer a significant interruption in our ability to gain access to thirdparty data our business and operating results will suffer  the success of our business relies heavily on our marketing and branding efforts especially with respect to the rumbleon website and our branded mobile applications and these efforts may not be successful  the failure to develop and maintain our brand could harm our ability to grow unique visitor traffic and to expand our dealer network  we will rely on internet search engines to drive traffic to our website and if we fail to appear prominently in the search results our traffic would decline and our business would be adversely affected  a significant disruption in service on our website or of our mobile applications could damage our reputation and result in a loss of consumers which could harm our business brand operating results and financial condition  if we are unable to provide a compelling recreation vehicle buying experience to our users the number of transactions between our users

be limited which could negatively impact our development growth revenue and financial performance  we will be relying on thirdparty financing providers to finance a significant portion of our

limited public market for our common stock and we do not know if one will develop that will provide you with adequate liquidity the trading price for our common stock may be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations  our principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and an even greater percentage of the companys voting power and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval  the pro forma financial statements were presented for illustrative purposes only and may not be an indication of our financial condition or results of operations following the nextgen acquisition  because our common stock is deemed a lowpriced penny stock an investment in our common stock should be considered high risk and subject to marketability restrictions  our internal controls may be inadequate which could cause our financial reporting to be unreliable and lead to misinformation being disseminated to the public  if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our stock our stock price and trading volume could decline  our annual and quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly or may fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts each of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate or decline  raising additional funds through debt or equity financing could be dilutive and may cause the market price of our common stock to decline  sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall  future sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase our common stock could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall  we do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to the value of our stock  we are an emerging growth company under the jobs act of  and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors  even if we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company we may still be subject to reduced reporting requirements so long as we are considered a smaller reporting company  we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties  our auditors report reflects the fact that the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to raise additional capital from the sale of common stock and ultimately the achievement of significant operating revenue if we are unable to continue as a going concern you will lose your investment  other risks and uncertainties detailed in this report as well as other statements regarding our future operations

in its entirety by reference to the registration rights agreement a copy of which is filed as exhibit  to this report and is incorporated into this report by reference nevada laws the nevada business corporation law contains a provision governing acquisition of controlling interest this law provides generally that any person or entity that acquires  or more of the outstanding voting shares of a publiclyheld nevada corporation in the secondary public or private market may be denied voting rights with respect to the acquired shares unless a majority of the disinterested stockholders of the corporation elects to restore such voting rights in whole or in part the control share acquisition act provides that a person or entity acquires control shares whenever it acquires shares that but for the operation of the control share acquisition act would bring its voting power within any of the following three ranges   to    to   more than  a control share acquisition is generally defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of either ownership or voting power associated with issued and outstanding control shares the stockholders or board of directors of a corporation may elect to exempt the

articles of incorporation and bylaws do exempt our common stock from the control share acquisition act transfer agent and registrar the transfer agent and registrar for our common stock is west coast stock transfer inc  n vulcan ave suite  encinitas ca  indemnification of directors and officers insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the securities act of  the act may be permitted to our directors officers and controlling persons pursuant to the foregoing provisions or otherwise we have been advised that in the opinion of the securities and exchange commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the act and is therefore unenforceable no director of the company will have personal liability to us or any of our stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director involving any act or omission of any such director since provisions have been made in our articles of incorporation limiting such liability the foregoing provisions shall not eliminate or limit the liability of a director for  any breach of the directors duty of loyalty to us or our stockholders  acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law  under applicable sections of the nevada revised statutes  the payment of dividends in violation of section  of the nevada revised statutes or  for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit the bylaws provide for indemnification of our directors officers and employees in most cases for any liability suffered by them or arising out of their activities as directors officers and employees if they were not engaged in willful misfeasance or malfeasance in the performance of his or her duties provided that in the event of a settlement the indemnification will apply only when the board of directors approves such settlement and reimbursement as being for our best interests the bylaws therefore limit the liability of directors to the maximum extent permitted by nevada law section  our officers and directors are accountable to us as fiduciaries which means they are required to exercise good faith and fairness in all dealings affecting the company in the event that a stockholder believes the officers andor directors have violated their fiduciary duties the stockholder may subject to applicable rules of civil procedure be able to bring a class action or derivative suit to enforce the stockholders rights including rights under certain federal and state securities laws and regulations to
