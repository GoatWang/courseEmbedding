instructions todays call will last  hour five minutes prior to the end of the call we will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference as a reminder todays call is being recorded at this time i would like to turn the conference over to lisa ewbank vice president of investor relations please go ahead lisa ewbank thank you ryan good afternoon everyone with us today are aart de geus chairman and coceo of synopsys and trac pham chief financial officer before we begin id like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call synopsys will discuss forecasts targets and other forwardlooking statements regarding the company and its financial results while these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect in addition to any risks that we highlight during the call important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent sec reports and todays earnings press release we will also refer to nongaap financial measures reconciliations to their most directly comparable gaap financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the k earnings press release and financial supplement that we released earlier today all of these items plus the most recent investor presentation are available on our website at synopsyscom in addition the prepared remarks will be posted on the site at the conclusion of the call with that ill turn the call over to aart de geus aart de geus good afternoon im happy to report that our second quarter results were strong we delivered revenue of  million and nongaap earnings per share of  both at the top of our target ranges we executed  million share buyback for a total of  million so far this year and were raising our revenue nongaap earnings per share and operating cash flow guidance for the year trac will discuss the financials in more detail the landscape around us is solid with what feels like a continuing stable outlook for  our  customer groups semiconductors systems companies and software developers continue to invest significantly this is driven by the dawning age of digital intelligence which is both exciting and evolving quickly everything around us is becoming smart connected but also complex mounting software content whether integrated on a chip or as an app creates huge functionality development and security challenges this in turn drives growth opportunities around machine learning automotive augmented and virtual reality networking infrastructure and the soaring need for more cloudbased computation and storage with the unique portfolio reaching from the roots of silicon all the way up to software combined with bestinclass global support synopsys continues to demonstrate that our vision strategy investments and execution are right on the money this is evidenced in all  product groups core eda revenue growth has outpaced competitors over the past years ip continues its double digit growth and our software quality and security group is scaling to critical mass with excellent revenue expansion let me provide some highlights from the quarter beginning with core eda synopsys is a missioncritical partner for the most advanced designs our eda and ip collaboration with tsmc illustrates this during q we announced full flow certification for tsmcs  and nanometer processes as well as broad ip cooperation for nanometer finfets customers today rely on synopsys for more than  of their finfet designs meanwhile were already partnering on early rd of nanometer and below our design platform is generating solid results and notable customer successes ic compiler ii our place and route solution is used on highly complex chips some as advanced as nanometer by companies such as xilinx nvidia st and broadcom ic validator our physical verification product has already performed final signoff of more than  finfet production tapeouts a significant accomplishment given the historical reliance on competitors meanwhile intensive rd across our digital platform is delivering new highimpact capabilities at a very rapid pace in custom our longtime leadership in simulation and our new custom compiler design solution are generating high interest custom compilers finfet optimizations and our close collaboration with umc for example enabled customers to use custom compiler in their new nanometer process at our march user group conference st mediatek and renesas shared their production successes with engineers from more than  companies in verification we continued to see excellent results and a strong outlook for the year our verification continuum platform is in high demand for  reasons first we have leadingedge verification technologies ranging from simulation to emulation to prototyping to static techniques to powerful well integrated debugging and second our coherent platform is solidly centered at the intersection of hardware and software the very intersection enabling smart everything and addressing the timetomarket urgency of this dynamic market we continue to see great progress ranging from excellent customer interest in our new superfast vcs simulator to platformwide adoption and proliferation over the last several quarters leading mobile graphics and processor companies have aligned with us through expanded multiyear strategy  strategic agreements including simulation verification ip debug formal emulation and prototyping technologies in q broad demand for zebu emulation continued with  new logos and expansion in top accounts for example spreadtrum standardized on zebu for its advanced mobile socs and wave computing adopted zebu for its machine learning products while lumpy from quarterto quarter we expect  to be another record year for hardware revenue driven by industry demand and the robustness of our solution on top of this virtual prototyping which enables early software development and architecture assessment resonated particularly well in the automotive market during the quarter we announced support for chips from silicon mobility inc a leading semiconductor provider for hybrid and electric vehicle control systems let me pause for a moment on automotive where over the past several years weve deployed a wide range of targeted solutions with touch points ranging from functional safety to autonomous driving to the nextgeneration of infotainment all the way to lighting simulation synopsys is growing into a crucial participant in the automotive ecosystem elements throughout our eda ip and software integrity portfolio are now certified for the most stringent level of automotive safety defined by the iso  standard in ip for example over the last  quarters we significantly extended our portfolio of certified ip more broadly in q we saw strong demand in ip with particular momentum in advanced technology and security we announced an expansive portfolio of ip for tsmcs  ffc process and taped out multiple  and nanometer ip test chips with advanced foundries were systematically building out our portfolio of security ip for mobile automotive iot and cloud computing markets in q for example we delivered a highperformance hardwaresecure module that protects sensitive information and data processing within socs the need for security is of course much broader than ip which brings me to our third customer base software developers across many industries the focus in our growing software integrity group is to provide products and services that help developers write highquality code that can withstand security vulnerabilities this as a key differentiator and new tam for synopsys and im happy to report that its scaling well both organically and via acquisitions our software signoff platform is making good progress and we have expanded our road map to reflect the acquisition of cigital were strong in the embedded space with growing transaction sizes and are gaining good traction in the automotive industry with our security solutions and wellrespected expertise with the acquisition of cigital in q were accelerating penetration in other key verticals such as the financial services industry our objective is to drive demand creation at early stages of security strategy development the cigital integration is already delivering examples of our first combined services and product agreements and crossselling opportunities finally synopsys was named a leader in gartners magic quadrant for application security testing the magic quadrant is an important indicator for customers who often use it to narrow their list of potential vendors weve already seen increased customer interest as a result in closing as we look to the second half of the year and beyond our priorities remain centered on generating long term shareholder value we do this by investing organically and through ma and eda ip and software integrity to realize our silicon to software vision we do this by executing with a clear intent to sustain technology leadership while simultaneously growing revenue and profitability throughout our business and we do this with a clear bottom line objective and many year track record of driving ongoing high singledigit eps growth and returning cash to shareholders let me now turn the call over to trac trac pham thanks aart good afternoon everyone in q we closed another outstanding quarter and continue to execute very well we met or exceeded all key financial targets delivered strong revenue and nongaap earnings growth completed a  million share buyback and generated significant cash flow our first half was very strong and as a result were raising our  outlook for revenue nongaap earnings and operating cash flow now to the numbers as i talk through the results and targets all comparisons will be yearoveryear unless i specify otherwise total revenue increased  to  million at the highend of our target range with particular strength in hardware and ip about  of revenue came from beginning of quarter backlog and  customer accounted for more than  of revenue the weighted average license duration was approximately  years and we expect the  average to be slightly less than  years total gaap costs and expenses were  million which included a  million accrual related to the ongoing evementor litigation total nongaap costs and expenses were  million within our target range nongaap operating margin was  for the quarter for the year we expect solid organic margin expansion over  moderated by the impact of the cigital and codiscope acquisitions gaap earnings per share were  and nongaap earnings per share were  at the high end of our target range operating cash flow was  million driven by strong collections and business levels were again raising our  cash flow target to a range of  million to  million we ended the quarter with cash cash equivalents and short term investments of  billion with  onshore and total debt of  million in q we returned  million to shareholders through our stock buyback program and we have  million remaining on our current authorization before moving onto guidance let me briefly update you on asc  the new revenue recognition rules that well implement in fiscal  were preparing for the rule change and are confident that our predictable model will remain substantially intact now to third quarter and fiscal  guidance for q the targets are revenue between  million and  million which reflects both strength and timing of hardware sales total gaap cost and expenses between  million and  million total nongaap costs and expenses between  million and  million other income between negative  million and  million a nongaap normalized tax rate of  outstanding shares between  million and  million gaap earnings of  to  per share and nongaap earnings of  to  per share for  were raising our revenue target to  billion to  billion a growth rate of  to  which reflects underlying strength in our business including record hardware sales other income between  million and  million a nongaap normalized tax rate of  outstanding shares between  million and  million gaap earnings of  to  per share were raising the midpoint of our nongaap earnings target range by  to  to  per share a growth rate of  to  capital expenditures of approximately  million and cash flow from operations of  million to  million as we look to the remainder of  we expect q to be the lowest revenue and eps quarter due to the timing of hardware shipments and seasonally higher operating expenses investors should expect continued variability in revenue due to the growth of our hardware products and their upfront revenue recognition excluding hardware our  timebased revenue model remains in effect finally were in the early stages of planning for next year and wed encourage investors to wait until weve provided guidance before updating estimates that said we believe the current  consensus nongaap eps estimates look reasonable this is consistent with our long term objective of driving high singledigit nongaap eps growth in summary q was a great quarter we delivered strong growth across the board were raising our  outlook for revenue nongaap earnings and cash flow and we continue to drive long term shareholder value by investing in the business both organically and through acquisitions and by returning capital through share buybacks with that ill turn it over to the operator for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question will come from the line of rich valera of needham  company richard valera i wanted to ask about the strength youre seeing in the core eda business aart youve been on record on numerous occasions saying you thought that was kind of a low singledigit growth business yet it looks like youre growing that close to double digits last couple of quarters i just wanted to get your sense of whats driving that with any more color than you gave in your prepared remarks and kind of how sustainable this well above kind of industry growth rate might be aart de geus well in general i think were in a phase of the industry around us and ourselves that tends to be strong and when we give you directions on growth rates of the different areas we always look at it from a perspective of a multiyear outlook because thats sort of the only fair way to do it all the more given that we have a multiyear agreement having said that theres no question that the push towards more advanced chips is actually continuing strong and i think the reason for that is relatively straightforward which is that the new opportunities in technologies and products are using any of the existing computation and mobility techniques but now amended by increased digital intelligence requirements will continue to be very strong after that enormous amounts of data generated by a happily growing set of sensors and you can see that the entire field is really poised to demand more computation and so it is natural therefore for people to come to our products and while there are some up and down from quarterto quarter they are driving the leading edge and they need the tools to support that so i think were fortunate to do well richard valera got it and then just more specifically for the quarter the service maintenance line was very strong im not sure if you could give any commentary on what that was and how we should think about that line for the balance of the year trac pham rich on  youre referring to the pl with the split richard valera correct trac pham on the services and product line that includes the cigital acquisition as well as strength in underlying ip right thats where the poc revenues flow through as well richard valera but was that  that was an unusually strong quarter should we think about that as a indiscernible  trac pham no ip tends to be pretty lumpy but were doing  if you look at the results from a product mix were doing well in ip but it does tend to be lumpy and then you add that to the cigital acquisition where weve got a full quarter of that now thats driving a quarteron quarter change richard valera got it so higher than historical levels but maybe not quite that high going forward that makes sense trac pham yes we keep it in  as we said publicly the  we expect ip to go grow in the doubledigit rate and it could be lumpy from quarterto quarter but our goal is to drive that growth sustainably in the double digits richard valera got it and then just with respect to hardware youve obviously had a great run of demand here in hardware and it looks like q probably not expecting any different but youre currently modeling it sounds like for q to maybe see a  take a breather in hardware is that something you really have visibility to or is that just out of an abundance of caution just trying to get a sense of how much visibility you actually have to that q sales hardware aart de geus it feels like repetitive in the last  or  earnings releases we must have used the word hardware is lumpy every time and that is an indication that the visibility is not complete meaning that some of these things come in and then the customer wants immediate fulfillment or delayed fulfillment so the timing can be somewhat arbitrary theres no question that we have done well in the hardware area and i think that correlate directly to what we said earlier which is growth in complexity of chips but also more and more chips and the affiliated software needing to be verified together and that is only a center of strength for synopsys trac pham rich you bring up a good point in terms of q the profile of q is impacted by the variability of hardware as youve seen in the results across geos across product mixes were doing well and going forward youll see more variability quarteron quarter so i think focus on the full year and just as you brought up the q profile is down but thats just mostly on hardware operator the next question is from tom diffely with d a davidson thomas diffely first i was curious what are the specific drivers of the hardware ip is it the core semi business the system players or perhaps new customers in asia aart de geus actually the first two groups because in order for emulation and other hardware isolation methods to be useful it is really in the proximity of the intersection of hardware and software which means its the highend chips that invariably drive a lot of software or it is the systems companies that integrate multiple chips around building apps or building entire product and so the distinction between semiconductor vendors and system vendors sometimes is a little blurred because they tend to increasingly do stuff for each other or demand from each other that that sits at this intersection so both of those i think sort of grow hand in hand thomas diffely okay and then on the ip side indiscernible the new customers are looking to fast track some designs now aart de geus yes actually sorry i forgot that part of your question ip is directly related to efficiency and productivity and with continuous complexity of chips and by the way continued complexity of the ip blocks delayed collection of these blocks just continues to grow and the efficiency with which people can put together large chips is directly a function of which blocks are available how easy is it to integrate them and how much do you trust the vendor because obviously youre highly relying on who provides you those blocks and so as companies design large chips or larger systems increasingly they put their engineers on those aspects that they cant purchase but where they can provide additional differentiation while outsourcing increasingly blocks that in the past they would have done themselves and i think that bodes very well for us thomas diffely okay so for both of those groups too have you begun to see any kind of a seasonality pattern with them or is purely just project based and can be fairly random through the year aart de geus i have not seen any seasonality i think it is very much project based and it has always a little bit the characteristic that the minute they figure out whats going to be in the project they would like to have the ip the next day which of course not possible because a lot of this gets developed as part of agreements and service development sets but the projects come and go the companies have no aligned time line for these projects and so i dont see any seasonality but one could have the configuration that for some reason there are some quarter there are more project finishing than others or deliveries that we could do so it could be somewhat lumpy but its not because of seasonality thomas diffely okay and then moving over to the core eda market are the tools the software tools now ready completely ready for the  and nanometer nodes or are there still challenges to be overcome aart de geus they are completely ready for the nanometer nanometer is not on the market and nanometer is still in deep development that will take a little while and even when i say for the nanometer  nanometer is really leading edge and what that means is that the foundries that provide the technology and that manufacture these chips will keep refining their technology on ongoing basis because they constantly are trying to tune the yields that they get because if you have a little higher yields meaning a higher percentage of chips that work on a wafer that has enormous economic impact and so were in constant interaction with foundries every time that they tune it a little bit we tune our tools and in some cases we also tune our ip a little further thomas diffely okay and in your answer they do include the ip and the nanometers being ready as well aart de geus yes we have a number of efforts in these advanced nodes and the word ready is not a black and white meaning that there are certain things that are already earlier there are certain things that are already with nanometers not quite there for test chips for example and so theres a very complex multiyear process to bring something to market but from my commentary you should read that were well exercised in trying to align as much as possible with the foundry train so that we arrive at the station at the same time thomas diffely okay and does your answer there either include or not include euv does it matter to you aart de geus it doesnt matter that much there are some very fundamental ip thats impacted by euv and as you may know euv is sort of now just slowly seeping into potentially some production manufacturing in the coming years and that is only for a few layers of the chip and there are many many layers so euv will be for the very refined ones initially and so were well on top of that but it does not mean a big effort nor a big issue thomas diffely okay and then finally trac you said that the accounting rule changes should have just not much impact on your model if you were to see the impact where would it be trac pham there are some portions of it in the ip business that could be affected and fortunately we have got time to work through how to structure those contracts and then theres a small portion on some elements of fsas related to the software contracts the fsas being the equivalent to gift cards that you buy certain amount and then draw down over time those things will be challenging as we work through the rules but fortunately we know what they are and theyre relatively small portion and weve got some time to address them operator our next question comes from the line of krish sankar with bank of america merrill lynch sreekrishnan sankar i had a few more easy questions for you aart number one on your ip business can you guys say how much of it is actually ratable versus upfront trac pham roughly  is ratable aart de geus yes just to clarify when we do ip people buy existing functionality but very often wanted to be delivered in a very specific form maybe with some alterations or with some tuning for their versions of technology and so this is why the ip is accompanied by a statement of work which can be viewed essentially as a service business but it is service business around an existing product and the reason you saw us hesitate is because we rarely think about it in those  categories but it is a good question it is sort of a balance between the  sreekrishnan sankar got it thats really helpful and then a couple of other ones obviously theres been a lot of chatter about activity in china on their own semiconductor investment front have you guy started seeing any purchases for eda tools from the indigenous chinese companies aart de geus yes we have seen those since like the middle s weve been in china for a long long time and they have been for now many many years many design companies many have not been successful and so i would say were at least already on the third or fourth generation of companies where a bunch have disappeared reconfigured and so on and now there is a significant segment of strong chinese companies that are  that have year after year become closer and closer to be at the state of the art and we would certainly say that there are a few companies that are designing with absolutely stateoftheart silicon technology and so they have been broad users of our tools china has been a growing market for us and we continue to see expansion of that market trac pham krish indiscernible doing well across our entire portfolio so weve been doing  selling eda in china for a long time as aart described it ip is a very good opportunity and weve seen growth there and then even with the software integrity business thats been emerging over the last few years as well sreekrishnan sankar okay all right let me  im going to try to ask the question a different way then if i look at historically for synopsys memory has been about  to  of your business and china has this huge plan to get into like memory with new d nand factories and from those customers have you actually started seeing any  are you guys having any conversation with this new d nand investment in china or have you guys started seeing any early pos or anything of that nature aart de geus definitely yes i mean memory development is development that requires pretty deep understanding of semiconductor physics and device construction and so with the number of companies we have now been working for a while on the development of those youre absolutely right that in the last recent period i would say maybe last  years there has been an increase in attention and effort and that is the direct response to the fact that most economies are seeing an enormous amount of data coming about that the big data will be analyzed and therefore the  be it in the cloud or be it the devices around it are all going to use massively more memory and that their strong desire to make that memory a lot faster so that you can do more processing and so in that sense while china may be new to this game the push in new memory technologies is quite interesting and that fits well the overall picture of a semiconductor business that is going to be an enabler to many other hightech capabilities sreekrishnan sankar got you got you and then the final question i had is if i look at your fiscal first half or the last  quarters your rd as a percent of your sale its kind of been running at the low end of your historical range im curious to know is that the new fundamental shift on how youre going to be more effective with your rd or are  quarters just not too big a data point to like extrapolate trac pham i wouldnt extrapolate off of  quarters i think what youre seeing in first half is mostly the acceleration of revenues we expect to maintain rd investments in the ish range and depending on how  what youre seeing this year is just the lumpiness of revenues and the quarterly profile will skew that but overall we expect to maintain the model in that  range operator and our next question will come from the line of sterling auty jpmorgan sterling auty im wondering with the acquisition of cigital on top of all the other elements that youve pieced together in some of the software assurance et cetera how much of your sales and marketing headcount is now focused outside the core kind of systems and semiconductor industries aart de geus good question i dont know the exact answer but i can venture that it is probably half to a little bit more as outside and the reason for that is that the marketing needed in our core semiconductor space is not that high because we have many very good connections and we can relatively easily access people that need security and quality tools for their software whereas in the rest of the space there are many different market segments and you mentioned cigital which is a really interesting acquisition because its not only that it brings to us a service business that allows us to engage at a higher level with customers that are looking at the strategy of their  of how to deal with quality and security it is that theyre also very strong in the financial market and so the way you communicate with financial market is very different than lets say the health market or the embedded software market and that is why some marketing effort has to be specialized on that from a sales point of view there it is much more a question of global access and how quickly can we grow this and be in a situation where we have highquality salespeople and that is an ongoing effort and going well were growing well but theres no end to that one yet sterling auty and then on the ip business you mentioned the strength that youre seeing there we look at the gross margins obviously the gross margins relative to expectations was probably heavily influenced on the mix but specifically to the ip how would you characterize the gross margin contribution at this point and the thoughts of where that could trend trac pham sure this is trac the margins on that are pretty healthy but directionally theyre slightly below the corporate average and thats about where wed expect to drive that sterling auty okay and then last question you mentioned  on a couple of areas but i didnt hear one of the attributes of  is the backlog disclosure any thoughts around the structure of how youre going to disclose the backlog and specifically i know it has to be done quarterly but there is the commentary that goes with it describing how you go from backlog into revenue is there any conclusions at this point in terms of how that would be  how those disclosures will come trac pham no were still assessing that but i would say that weve done a pretty good job disclosing backlog in the past and the metrics that we provided i think gives investors a pretty good sense of the health of the business going into any particular year we do aim for about  visibility of backlog scheduled revenue in backlog at the end of the year secondly we try to enter the quarter  each quarter with about  of backlog in hand so i think those  metrics combined with anything else we provide should give pretty good color on the health of the business operator next question comes from the line of jay vleeschhouwer with griffin securities jay vleeschhouwer trac let me start with you you raised the midpoint of your cash flow expectation for the year by  million is that pretty broadly based in terms of numbers of customers driving that or is it fairly narrowly based in terms of perhaps theres a small number of customers with a large amount of collections driving that number and then secondly for you before i turn to aart given the scaling that youre seeing now in hardware could you comment on the margin or mix trends visàvis hardware profitability trac pham okay let me start first with the broad  the cash flow whether its broad based it was yes definitely broad based and that would be consistent with the health of the business that were seeing in the first half as i mentioned when you look across the growth was pretty broad based across geographies and product mixes so that  the cash flow is consistent with that and then from a hardware perspective were definitely doing well with hardware revenues and the profitability on that certainly is improving and it is indiscernible profits jay vleeschhouwer is it improving as a percentage of the hardware revenue trac pham yes jay vleeschhouwer okay for aart a couple of things for you we often hear over the years from eda companies when new hardware is introduced particularly emulation of course detailed descriptions about the hardware specifications and most particularly about the design capacity that the hardware systems are capable of we dont typically hear that sort of discussion around the software tool capacity and this issue has come up for you and others over the years in terms of design size capacity that you could put through dc for example and the issues of that kind as you move now to nanometer and below could you talk about whether or not there are any capacity issues that you need to resolve for any role of your tools to adequately handle the design sizes that youre likely to see you mentioned new version of vcs so perhaps thats one example but anything you can address with regard to the capacity on the software side would be helpful and then lastly for you on the technology front are you beginning to see any kind of conjoined usage of your prototyping hardware with software integrity in other words is the software to bring out capability of hardware being used somehow with the software integrity business and then similarly is the prototyping business being used increasingly along with emulation as part of your verification continuum aart de geus okay well so for being at synopsys for  years i would say our capacity has always been less than the customer wanted and more than they thought they would get meaning that the state of the art is limited typically by a few things which is one is how fast can you run and two how much can you run at the same time and so it has been actually quite remarkable how over all this time period these numbers have continued to increase and im certainly on record of having argued many times that were the other half of moores law which is if they can manufacture it we will find a way to simulate it to design it and so on and that goes hand in hand but for the most stateoftheart situations one has always had the limit of what one can do the second comment i would have for that it is quite remarkable how over all these years over and over there have been redesigns of architecture of utilization of compute environments of utilization of multiple computers multiple cores multiple threads that have managed to keep your question in check so were always chasing the horizon in other words and this is true on the hardware side in emulation or prototyping it is certainly true for software for a long time and expect that to absolutely continue and we will stay at the leading edge of that secondly regarding the intersection of prototyping and software integrity i expect that were going to start seeing some of that in the nottoodistant future so far theres not been a lot of evidence of that but we have not really pushed on that front yet either the intersection between prototyping of emulation we have already seen quite a bit of that and by the way its intersection of prototyping emulation and simulation and in some cases even virtual prototyping and that is because the system people would like to simulate software on larger systems that have many components that may be defined at different levels of abstraction so all of this is being done i dont want to give the impression that this is routinely easy this is sophisticated stuff but were in a very strong position with this and the most advanced customers are very literate about this type of problems operator okay and our next question will come from the line of monika garg with pacific crest monika garg first just if i look at your guidance even if youve modeled the high end of revenue guidance since q you were guiding almost  million down qoverq historically your q is at least flattish to modestly up so what is leading to such high kind of revenue down qoverq or is it just youre being conservative trac pham no monika its really the hardware business as we mentioned it will vary from quarterto quarter the underlying  outside of hardware the business  all the other businesses are doing well so its not offsetting anything but hardware is driving the quarteron quarter comparison monika garg  million trac pham im sorry monika garg so the downside is about  million  the others are up aart de geus we have very strong hardware business monika garg okay and a similar point your operating margins if i have to model for the guidance its going to be like  again down like almost   basis points yearoveryear and qoverq hardware is down operating margin should be better right trac pham as we mentioned at the earlier comments expenses are seasonally up in q so weve got the offset of revenues coming down because of the hardware trend and the expenses going up in q monika garg all right then can you just remind us how big your software security business now and when do you expect it to be breakeven trac pham well as we mentioned last  in previous calls we were guiding to about  million last year which we met and a  the overall growth in that business is about  which is tracking too and then cigital when we acquired them was roughly half of the existing business and then the underlying business we mentioned that the acquisitions would be dilutive to earnings this year and would affect margins but on the classic software integrity business were on track to do breakeven at second half of the year monika garg all right then going forward what is the growth rate you expect in the software security business including the cigital acquisition trac pham were looking at the  range monika garg okay then aart we saw like over the weekend a big security breach could you maybe talk about how this could impact the security  software security business have you seen any aart de geus yes for starters were fortunate that our own processes around upgrading our firewalls of making sure that all of the patches have been applied to software have been effective so we have not had any issues with this very clearly every time there is a big story in this case massive number of stories the attention level around the notion of security goes up and were sitting in the space where the idea is to design security in the first place not to just fix all the things that went wrong in the past but make it essentially correct by construction and so from that perspective i think were in a very healthy situation if you amend that by the fact that gartner which tracks many many securityrelated companies such as ourselves are now putting us in the leading quadrant for the activities that we do obviously the attention that this is getting is positive for our business even if its negative for the world and so were seeing that with the acquisition of cigital with the commentary that trac just gave you on the existing business i feel that we can now state that this business has for lack of better term reached critical mass and what i mean with that is that a number of years ago we made the decision to move up from the silicon to the software we made a decision to bank beyond the hardware and software intersection and that moreover this new tam that touches many companies that in the past we have no business with looks very promising there were many execution challenges in getting there i think weve navigated well through those and im very encouraged with where were in the middle of  because we see this vision materializing and hopefully its not on the back of catastrophes around us but more on the premise that building correctly for the future is really where the software industry should go and that is where our contribution will be monika garg got it then the new administration has talked about making it easy for cash repatriation if that happens how could you think about the usage of cash trac pham monika were staying on top on whats developing as far as tax reform in the us if it does occur i mean obviously we  i think when you use cash the same way weve been using over the last several years over the last trailing    quarters weve bought back close to  million in stock weve acquired companies in the software integrity space and well continue to use the cash to drive growth in terms of acquisitions and then return cash when its appropriate via buybacks monika garg last one for me on ip growing double digit is double digit the right way to look at going forward and then youve been building adas ip for autos for some time are you seeing inflection in that aart de geus well for the first part of your question yes we think that it is in the low double digits so far the team has been executing particularly well and if you look at it from the complex chips our expectations are that we will continue to see good growth and healthy business there im sorry i couldnt acoustically hear your second part of the question monika garg youve been building the adas ip for autos for some time maybe are you seeing inflection in that aart de geus oh yes sure sorry yes automotive has been an interesting area because its having so much attention frankly by a whole number of people that may create a bit of a bubble there but at the same time theres a good reason its getting so much attention which is it is the showcase for what modern hardware software will be able to do to fundamentally transform a field that has been relatively slow in evolving it is now evolving very very rapidly and so we have invested quite a bit over the last few years not only to make sure that the tools are capable of dealing with this type of designs but our ip portfolio has grown significantly in the realm of having certified ip and certification of ip is for one key reason which is automotive demands a certain set of checks to make sure that what youre doing is actually safe and in the past safety has been actually developed quite well in automotive with this very very rapid increase of both hardware and software the complexity that comes with that is going to be a challenge for safety and the fact that we have a portfolio that is now massively certified i think bodes very well for our position there operator and our last question comes from the line of mitch steves with rbc capital markets mitchell steves two questions for you if i could first for aart just in terms of the core eda business thats continuing to grow at double digits now so i know you guys have talked to low to midsingle growth but what exactly has changed there i mean i know the cad business or the cad industry to be growing faster could you maybe highlight some changes that have happened over the past year or so aart de geus well one of the key pieces is that the intersection of hardware and software has been driving verification extremely hard and a subcategory to that is really emulation and prototyping we refer to that as hardware and that growth has just been exemplary because so many people would like to run software on hardware they dont have and so instead they use an emulator to sort of fake the hardware if you like and i expect that to continue because if you want to go to market you want to start the software development as soon as you possibly can and make sure that its going to work with the hardware that takes a long time to manufacture so that has really been one of the key variables in this game mitchell steves got it and then secondly for trac on the financial side im having a hard time getting to the kind of q eps because if i look historically typically from q to q your total expenses go up by  million or so but in order to get to the new midpoint that the full year guide implies if youre going to be  million plus or a  increase so i guess whats kind of in the financial model for q thats abnormal from the past trac pham well normally the  as you highlighted the expenses do ramp up from q to q what we would normally see this year is an increase in hiring thats per our plan you would see a rampup in variable comp as we accrue for where we think were going to end up the year and then historically the numbers i think  well we can model with you offline but your historical numbers in terms of growth might be a little aggressive and then the offset to that is how you model the q revenue to q profile but we can work with you afterwards operator okay and we have no further questions in queue and we do have  minutes remaining ill turn it back to the executive board aart de geus well thank you very much for attending this earnings release hopefully you took away that we had a very strong quarter that the outlook for the coming quarter is strong the overall year is looking extremely solid but most importantly i think the alignment around our silicon to software strategy appears to be working quite well and all the individual businesses have contributed strongly to our present success so with the intent to continue on that trajectory we thank you for your support and attention operator ladies and gentlemen that does conclude todays conference thank you for your participation and for using
