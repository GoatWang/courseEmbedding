student this is not an example of the work written by our professional essay writers agriculture cooperative societies an agricultural cooperative also known as a farmers coop is a cooperative where farmers pool their resources in certain areas of activity a broad typology of agricultural cooperatives distinguishes between agricultural service cooperatives which provide various services to their individually farming members and agricultural production cooperatives where production resources land machinery are pooled and members farm jointly agricultural production cooperatives are relatively rare in the world and known examples are limited to collective farms in former socialist countries and the kibbutzim in israel worker cooperatives provide an example of production cooperatives outside agriculture the default meaning of agricultural cooperative in english is usually an agricultural service cooperative which is the numerically dominant form in the world there are two primary types of agricultural service cooperatives supply cooperative and marketing cooperative supply cooperatives supply their members with inputs for agricultural production including seeds fertilizers fuel and machinery services marketing cooperatives are established by farmers to undertake transformation packaging distribution and marketing of farm products both crop and livestock farmers also widely rely on credit cooperatives as a source of financing for both working capital and investments why farmers form cooperatives cooperatives as a form of business organization are distinct from the more common investorowned firms iofs both are organized as corporations but iofs pursue profit maximization objectives whereas cooperatives strive to maximize the benefits they generate for their members which usually involves zeroprofit operation agricultural cooperatives are therefore created in situations where farmers cannot obtain essential services from iofs because the provision of these services is judged to be unprofitable by the iofs or when iofs provide the services at disadvantageous terms to the farmers ie the services are available but the profitmotivated prices are too high for the farmers the former situations are characterized in economic theory as market failure or missing services motive the latter drive the creation of cooperatives as a competitive yardstick or as a means of allowing farmers to build countervailing market power to oppose the iofs the concept of competitive yardstick implies that farmers faced with unsatisfactory performance by iofs may form a cooperative firm whose purpose is to force the iofs through competition to improve their service to farmers a practical motivation for the creation of agricultural cooperatives is sometimes described as overcoming the curse of smallness a cooperative being an association of a large number of small farmers acts as a large business entity in the market reaping the significant advantages of economies of scale that are not available to its members individually three typical examples are a machinery pool a marketing cooperative and a credit union a family farm may be too small to justify the purchase of a tractor or another piece of farm machinery for its own use a machinery pool is a cooperative that purchases the necessary equipment for the joint use of all its members as needed a small farm does not always have the means of transportation necessary for delivering its produce to the market or else the small volume of its production may put it in an unfavorable negotiating position with respect to intermediaries and wholesalers a cooperative will act as an integrator collecting the output of its small members and delivering it in large aggregated quantities downstream through the marketing channels a small farmer may be charged relatively high interest rates by commercial banks which are mindful of high transaction costs on small loans or may be refused credit altogether due to lack of collateral a farmers credit union will be able to raise loan funds at advantageous rates from commercial banks because of its large associative size and will then distribute loans to its members on the strength of mutual or peerpressure guarantees for repayment an integrated automation solution for primary agricultural cooperative societies pacs one of the major concerns in any developing economy is the efficacy of the rural financing systems that advances credit to its large population of rural poor such operations are plagued by small size of the loans inadequate risk profiling of loanee large volume of transactions nonstandardized operations and difficulty in monitoring credit disbursal and collection nelitos mfin brings the benefit of computerization into the

general ledger balance sheet statement of account statutory reporting agriculture cooperatives various development activities in agriculture small industry marketing and processing distribution and supplies are now carried on through cooperatives the cooperatives in the state have made an allround progress and their role in and contribution to agricultural progress has particularly been significant the schemes regarding the construction of godowns and the conversion of villages into model villages the cooperative movement was introduced into india by the government as the only method by which the farmers could overcome their burden of debt and keep them away from the clutches of the moneylenders the cooperative credit societies act  was passed by the government of india and rural credit societies were formed  through the appointment of registrars and through vigorous propaganda the government attempted to popularize the movement in the rural areas within a short period the government realized some of the shortcomings of the  act and therefore passed a more comprehensive act known as the cooperative societies act of  the primary agriculture credit societies the agricultural cooperative credit structure in the punjab state is broadly divided into two sectors one dealing with the shortterms and mediumterms finance and the other with the longterm credit in the state the shortterm and mediumterm credit structure is based on a threetier system ie the apex cooperative bank at the state level the central cocoperative bank at the districttehsil level and the primary agricultural credit societies at the village level the major objectives of the primary agricultural credit service societies are to supply agricultural credit to meet the requirements of funds for agricultural production the distribution of essential consumer commodities the provision of storage and marketing facilities owing to an increasing emphasis on the development of land and agriculture longterm cooperative credit has assumed great importance there is the punjab state land mortgage bank at the apex and the punjab mortgage bank at the districttehsil level at the operational level there exists a primary cooperative to extend credit to the farmer this unit epitomizes the vitality and service potential of the cooperative movement in india the organization of these societies dates back to  when the first cooperative societies act was passed these societies were started with the object of providing cheap credit to the agriculturists in order to free them from the clutches of the rapacious moneylenders the agricultural primary credit society is the foundationstone on which the whole cooperative edifice is built the first agricultural credit society in the firozpur district was registered on  october  at the village of khalchi kadim in the firozpur tehsil originally the movement was confined to the credit societies only and thus credit dominated till the partition  after the partition the cooperative movement began to spread to other field viz labour construction and farming agriculture noncredit societies while credit is and must remain for some time the chief concern of the cooperative movement relatively slow since  when the noncredit societies were brought officially under the aegis of the movement the world war ii  came as a god send boon with respect to the development of the cooperative movement prices of agricultural goods began to rise and touched new peaks the repayment of loans was accelerated and deposits began to pour in the number of societies also rose another interesting development in cooperative during the war wast the extension of the movement to noncredit activities viz agriculture cooperative marketing societies marketing has occupied a far smaller place in the cooperative picture in india than in many countries notably denmark and the usa but not other noncredit line of cooperation with the possible exception of the consolidation of land holdings and joint farming enterprises seems to hold greater possibilities of help to the agricultural population of india the development of cooperative marketing in india is closely bound up with the problem of creditthe claims of the moneylenders commonly inhibiting the cultivators freedom of action in disposing of his crop the full utilization of loans advanced depends upon the arrangements for the marketing of surplus produce for this purpose there the punjab state marketing federation at the state level wholesale societies at the district level and marketing societies at the market level these societies also provide other agricultural facilities and make arrangements for the supply of domestic items in the rural areas at the state level the punjab state cooperative supply and marketing federation markfed is playing an important role in building up an integrated structure for remunerative marketing and storing of agricultural produce it has played an important role in hastening the green revolution in the state by arranging ready supplies of essential farm inputs needed by the cultivators cooperative farming societies the royal commission on agriculture in  observed that it cooperation failed there would fail the hope of the indian agriculturist cooperative farming is a compromise between collective farming and the peasant proprietorship and gives all merits of largescale farming without abolishing private property it implies an organization of the farmers on the basis of common efforts for common interests under this system all landowners in a village form a cooperativesociety for tilling the land the land is pooled but each farmer retains the right of property the produce is distributed by each they are allowed to withdraw fromthe cooperative farm whenever they desire in india the exceedingly small size of holdings is perhaps the most serious defect in our agriculture if agriculture has to be improved the size of the holdings must be enlarged type of societies cooperative weavers society cooperative consumers societies cooperative housing societies cooperative womens societies cooperative milksocieties challenges before cooperatives the indiancooperative movement has earned distinction of being the largest in the worldthis is true in terms of membership and cooperative network which spread over almost all the villages in the country and the number of cooperative societies in our country there are about  lakhs of cooperative societies with membership of more than crores it covers a wide range of commercial activities and nearly  of them are engaged in agriculture and agriculture related matters nearly  of the indian population beingdependant on agriculture is thus connected with agricultural cooperatives cooperatives have covered  of villages and  of rural households cooperative sectorcontributes  of total agricultural credit and distributes  of total fertilizer consumption in the country they are procuring  of total sugarcane they are also playing crucial role in the agroprocessing sector ie processing of sugarcane milk cotton and oil seeds etcdairy cooperatives have excelled in their area of operation and have enabled india to attain top position in milk production in the world edible oil marketed through cooperative channel is estimated at  and handloom cooperatives account for  of the total output but in spite of being largest movement in the world and strongest link it faces number of challenges like lack of internal resources and poor mobilization of external resources inadequate infrastructure competitive tier structure apathy of members towards management lack of accountability increasing sickness dormancy low level professionalism excessive government control political interference dominance of vested interest over the management lack of human resources development education and trainingdespite all challenges cooperatives have to be sustainable over a period of time for which professionalism is a must cooperatives have been looking for governmental help but they have been paying of it like official domination and interference in their daytoday working etc dr kuriyan an eminent cooperator in the country said recently that the cooperatives have undergone a crisis of identity being neither government nor private he further said that cooperatives need to be more efficient and competitive but at the same time they cannot sacrifice the basictenets of cooperation inefficient cooperatives will have to either pull up their socks or down their shutters cooperatives have many advantages in tackling problem poverty alleviation employment generation and food security they also have the potential to deliver goods and services in areas where both the state and private sectors have failed over the past few years steps like the enactment of mutually aided cooperative societies act by some states and the multistate cooperative societies act have been taken to give the cooperative sector a boost but i am aware that the cooperatives registered under the mutual aided act have certain constraints and deficiencies which may be  lack of supervision and inspection by registrar of cooperative societies resulting into financial misuse and disproportion institutional development government is hesitating to entrust any important government work since it does not have any participation these cooperatives are away from the mainstream the cooperative banks and other important institutions are not prepared to admit them as members nabard and rbi are not agreeing for conversion of central and urban cooperative banks rbi has also objection about the use of word cooperative since banking regulation act uses the word cooperative society perhaps we are not prepared or educated or sensitized enough to work without control and supervision mischievous persons may take advantage of the situation to cheat the general public when the government are exploring the possibility of regulating the nongovernmental organizations having vast experience it is doubtful as to whether the mutually aided cooperatives in various field can give desired result the circumstances and the situation give rise to the cooperative movement in the country are still prevalent the market is still not accessible to small and marginal farmers supply of agricultural credit is not adequate about  of our rural and tribal household still have no facility for institutional credit the cooperatives are today at the cross road at their existence particularly in view of the fast emerging economic liberalization and globalization the cooperatives still continued to function in a traditional way with poor governance and management poor resource mobilization outside interference dependence on government and lack of professionalization the cooperatives are neither memberdriven nor functioned professionally in a transparent manner with accountability to members in spite of all these no doubt the cooperatives have contributed a lot to the agriculture development of the country we cannot afford to see that these institutions wither away it needs reform it is notworthy to say that in the national common minimum programme of present upa government it has been mentioned to bring constitutional amendment to ensure the democratic autonomous and professional functioning of cooperatives the constitutional amendment may limit itself with  timely conduct of elections timely conduct of audit uniform tenure of managing committee conduct of general body meetings right of a member for access to informations and the accountability of the management in this context our strategies may be as follows  cooperatives need be memberdriven stakeholders should have a command over its affairs and activities there is need for more transparency more of interaction and confidence building measures aggressive marketing strategy be adopted for sensitizing members and general public about the service and quality rendered by the cooperatives commitment to best service and pursuit for excellence should be the hallmark of cooperative every society should adopt their customers or members charter and should meticulously adhere to this charter cooperative should compete with other players in prevailing market forces without any protectionist or discriminator approach in respect of shortterm mediumterm longterm sector and urban bank sectors restrictions have been stipulated by reserve bank of india nabard in respect of finance these restrictions need be liberalized which would help cooperative to optimize its lendable resources and provide finance to members strengthening information and database of cooperatives if of utmost importance mis need be adopted by the process of computerization and interconnectivity to provide best services to members and customers with anytime and anywhere service professionalization of management is one of the basic prerequisites of cooperatives both the personnel as well as directors of committee of management should be exposed to regular training interaction and orientation adoption of scientific planning for deployment of human resources on the principle of right man for the right post at right time would help cooperatives to accelerate the pace of reforms human resources need be proactive motivation recognition for good work and leadership be inculcated for augmenting productivity basic tenets corporate governance be adopted like fair play transparency and accountability the pacs as the foundation of the cooperative system are meeting the development needs of the farmers by providing credit inputs and storage and processing and marketing facilities the cooperative federated at the district and state level constitutes the cooperative system but it is found that the apex institutions have grown stronger whereas the primaries and in some cases central cooperatives have gone weaker the situation has to be changed and the primaries have to grow stronger the business of the primary societies have to be diversified cooperative credit in agriculture development role of agriculture cooperative societies in agriculture nowadays credit serves as an elevator it has been recognized as the life blood of all economic activities like all other producersagriculturists also need credit according to an old proverb credit supports the farmers as the hangmans rope supports the hanged this statement is fully true in the context of indian farmers thus for stimulating the tempo of agricultural production an adequate and timely credit is most essential the cooperative societies act  gave concretized shape for establishing primary cooperative societies to meet both the short and mediumterm loan needs of farmers the provision of these loans did not make any improvement and did not have any impact on the farmmers socioeconomic status and consequently they were head and ears indebt in order to solve this problem and make the farmers free from the cruel clutches of money lenders the idea of cooperative longterm credit institutions called cooperative agricultural and rural development bankscooperative gram vikas banks earlier called cooperative land developmentmortgage banks was mooted role of agriculture cooperative societies an agricultural cooperative society which is authorised by its rules to borrow money may at any time subject to the provisions of this section and with such consent of the minister as is mentioned in this act and whether the issue of debentures is or is not authorised or is or is not forbidden by the rules of such society issue debentures to any authorised lender for the purpose of securing to such lender the repayment with or without interest of any capital sum of money lent by such lender to such society before the issue of such debentures whether before or after the passing of this act or intended to be so lent at or after such issue or partly so lent and partly so intended to be lent an issue of debentures shall not be made by an agricultural cooperative society under this section unless either the committee of such society has power under the rules of such society to borrow money and the amount to be borrowed on the security of such debentures is within such borrowing power or a resolution approving of the making of such issue has been passed by a special meeting of the shareholders of such society convened expressly for the purpose of considering and if thought fit passing such resolution the following provisions shall apply to debentures issued by an agricultural cooperative society under this section that is to say— such debentures may be expressed to charge the money secured thereby in either or both of the following ways that is to say by way of fixed charge on any specified property including uncalled capital of such society or by way of floating charge on the assets property and undertaking either with or without specified exceptions for the time being and from time to time belonging to such society such debentures may contain all or any such provisions for enforcing or making effective the security thereby afforded as are usually contained in debentures issued by a limited company such debentures shall operate and have effect in accordance with the terms thereof so far as such terms are authorised by this act an issue of debentures made by an agricultural cooperative society under this section may consist either of a single debenture to secure the whole amount of the sum of money for the securing of which such issue is made or of a series of debentures for separate sums ranking pari passu and amounting in the aggregate to the full amount of the said sum of money and in any event shall rank in priority to any issue of debentures subsequently made by such society under this section an issue of debentures made by an agricultural cooperative society under this section may be accompanied and collaterally secured by a trust deed of the general character usual in respect of trust deeds entered into for similar purposes in relation to an issue of debentures or debenture stock by a limited company whenever an issue of debentures is made under this section by an agricultural cooperative society the authorised lender to whom such debentures are issued shall within twenty one days after the issue thereof apply in the prescribed form and manner to the minister for the registration of such issue in the register and if such authorised lender fails so to apply for such registration every debenture comprised in such issue shall upon the expiration of the said period of twentyone days become and be null and void future perspective cooperatives are not unaffected by structural adjustments and globalization of commodity market as a result cooperative banks are required to redesign their strategies for sustainability and growth the economic reforms initiated by the government of india in  have affected the financial institutions including the cooperative financial institutions these reforms aim at liberalization and deregulation of indian economy the cooperative banks of punjab have accepted the reforms in indian economy especially the financial reforms in right spirit since these banks have mainly been providing credit to agriculture sector changes in agricultural economy affect them more closely the banks envisage following scenario as a result of liberalized agricultural policy  liberalization of agricultural policy would result in greater capital intensity and borrowed capital requirements of agriculturists in order to induce diversification and produce quality products for international market for this purpose punjab farmers would need greater credit support for improved technology seeds and agroinputs liberalized agricultural policy would reverse the process of fragmentation of land holdings and would result in exodus of employment opportunities from agricultural sector to other sectors of economy such as small business enterprises services and industrial sector liberalization of agriculture would professionalize and modernize agriculture thereby earning a status of industry attracting high skilled professionals in agriculture sector liberalized agricultural economy would lead to a greater role of private research and development institutions in improving the productivity and quality of agricultural operations the liberalized agricultural policy would result in greater thrust on value addition in agriculture therefore a great deal of thrust would be on agroprocessing units the liberalized agricultural policy would lead to contract forming for ensuring marketing of agricultural produce at better prices the liberalized agricultural policy would bring greater thrust on export of raw and value added agroproducts the liberalized agricultural economy would lead to sowingplanting of new crops leading to a great deal of crop diversification bibliography www

the st century agricultural cooperatives in thailand innovations and opportunities in the st century suwanna thuvachote department of cooperatives faculty of economics kasetsart university phahol yotin rd bangkok  thailand  abstract agriculture has long been an important sector to thailands economy and will continue to be in the near future agricultural cooperatives with the concept of self reliance and cooperation have played an important role in raising the socioeconomic status of their farmer members at present the agricultural cooperative movement of thailand is facing challenges from changes in various external and internal environment to survive in such an evolving situation the agricultural cooperative movement has adjusted its structure and business approach to sustain its operation and business growth these changes could be observed at the agricultural cooperatives as well as policy levels the thayang agricultural cooperatives is a good example of the successful adaptation to such changing environment key words agricultural cooperatives thailand thayang agricultural cooperative roles of agriculture cooperatives in the thai economy agricultural structure and its development thailand is regarded as an agricultural country the agricultural sector has played an important role in contributing to the economy of thailand throughout history however as the nonagricultural sector has been growing at a rapid rate during the past decade agriculture has gradually declined in importance in terms of its share in economic growth table  shows that the share of the agricultural sector to gdp has declined steadily from  in  to less than  in  within the agricultural sector itself there has been no significant change in structure the agriculture livestock and forestry subsector is the largest component of gdp during  the valueadded generated from this subsector was about  while that from the fisheries subsector was only about  considering the composition of the agriculture livestock and forestry subsector cereals and field crops is the most important group this groups share to gdp was about   table  although the contribution of the agricultural sector to the thai economy is decreasing agriculture is still important with  of the total land area or  million hectares devoted to agriculture agriculture is the main occupation of the thai people employing about onethird of the labor force historical background of agricultural cooperatives the history of agricultural cooperatives in thailand can be traced back to  when the thai economy opened to international trade during the reign of king rama v rice production was becoming commercialized but farmers could not benefit from the situation moreover national disasters such as drought and flood forced farmers into chronic and severe indebtedness due to their inability to repay their loans consequently they were losing their farmlands turned into hired laborers and thus left their debts unpaid based on the recommendation of sir bernard hunter the head of the madras bank of india the concept of cooperatives was introduced to thailand through a special assistance program it was believed that this would help the farmers to pay their debts and improve their livelihood in  the thai government created the first cooperative society as a trial among small paddy farmers named wat chan cooperative in phitsanulok province it was known as a village credit cooperative with unlimited liability following the raiffesen credit cooperative type with a single purpose of providing farm credit to help the severely indebted farmers sixteen most indebted farmers in the province were chosen as the founding members although with a start up capital of only  baht the cooperatives operated very successfully within the first  months its members were able to repay  of their debts the success of this cooperative led to the increase of small village credit cooperatives all over the country the small credit cooperatives prevailed in the country until  after that other types of cooperatives were established in response to the peoples need with a view to facilitate financing support to cooperatives and their members the government set up the bank for cooperative in  credit cooperatives were urged to hold share capital in the bank with the hope that they would in the future be owners of the bank which would be their own financing center in  and  two provincial cooperative banks were established in chiangmai and uttaradit provinces respectively unfortunately the enactment of a new commercial bank law in  limited the services on deposit on current accounts to be provided only by commercial banks the two existing provincial cooperative banks were reorganized as credit cooperative federations and a program to set up new cooperative banks was dropped in  the bank for agriculture and agricultural cooperative baac a state enterprise was established to be a financial center for agricultural cooperatives as well as individual farmers in  the government enacted the cooperative act be to facilitate the expansion and improvement of the cooperatives this legislation embodied two important features the amalgamation of credit cooperatives at village level to district level and the establishment of the cooperative league of thailand clt to function as the apex organization of the cooperative movement the amalgamation was the most important one as it enhanced the economies of scale of the business operation the credit cooperatives were officially categorized as agricultural cooperatives in  the government changed the status of agricultural cooperatives from unlimited societies to limited ones this year the agricultural cooperative federation of thailand was also established as the apex agricultural cooperative of the country at present the cooperatives in thailand are officially categorized into seven types namely  agricultural cooperative  land settlement cooperative  fisheries cooperative  consumer cooperative  thrift and credit cooperative  service cooperative  credit union cooperative legal framework for agricultural cooperatives the first cooperative law in thailand called the amended associations act was enacted in  to register farmer cooperatives in order to help paddy growers this act remained until  and it was replaced by the act which allowed other types of cooperatives to be organized the latter act was amended many times and finally replaced in  by the cooperative act be the amendment of this act was done through consultation between government and nongovernment institutions this act was intended to govern all types of cooperatives the act has  sections and divided into  parts part i general provisions part ii supervision and promotion of cooperatives chapter  board of national cooperative development chapter  registrar of cooperatives chapter  supervision of cooperatives chapter  cooperative development fund part iii cooperatives chapter  formation and registration of cooperatives chapter  bylaws and amendment of bylaws chapter  operations of cooperatives chapter  audit chapter  dissolution of cooperatives part iv liquidation part v amalgamation of cooperatives part vi division of cooperatives part vii cooperative federations part viii cooperative league of thailand part ix farmers groups part x penalties the important provisions in this act are summarized below  defines cooperative society as a group of persons who jointly conduct affairs for socioeconomic interests on the basis of selfhelp and mutual assistance and are registered under this act  empowers the minister of agriculture and cooperatives to make ministerial regulations  provides financial assistance to cooperatives through the creation of the cooperative development funds for the development of cooperatives  creates the national cooperative development board which aims to promote the viability and growth of cooperatives  exempts cooperatives from payment of registration fee  empowers the registrar to control the lending borrowing or guarantee of loans and deposit services between cooperatives or provide deposit services to members of other cooperatives  controls the distribution of cooperative net profit ie not less than  to reserve funds not more than  to the cooperative league of thailand not more than  as bonus to board members and officials and not more than the rate prescribed in the ministerial regulations to dividend and patronage refund to member users  empowers the registrar to arrange audit to conduct enquiry in the affair of the cooperatives and take actions against persons found guilty and to suspend operations of cooperative or order for its liquidation this act was a result of several changes and revisions however for greater flexibility a new draft was developed and is now in the process of review and approval of the parliament current situation of agricultural cooperatives institutional arrangement membership as of january  the cooperative movement of thailand was composed of  primary cooperatives with an individual membership of  or about  of the total population of the country the cooperatives in the agricultural sector occupied the largest it had a total of  primary cooperatives with  individual members these represented more than  of the total primary societies as well as the total individual membership of the cooperatives of the country  table  members of primary agricultural cooperatives engage in various economic activities to provide an idea of the activities covered table  shows categories numbers of various cooperatives and their members these cooperatives in addition to their services as agricultural cooperatives also have specific activities or common interest as indicated by their categories for instance the animal raiser cooperatives and dairy cooperatives are formed by farmers whose main occupation is raising livestock the water users cooperatives are formed by farmers living in areas along the same canal members of this cooperative share irrigation water and jointly maintain the system regarding the membership of primary agricultural cooperatives report from the cooperative auditing department cad shows that during  there had been a gradual rise in membership of the audited agricultural cooperatives the increase however was due to an increase in the number of cooperatives and not to the expansion of the societies themselves in this period the number of individual members increased from around  to  million persons but the average members per cooperative during  decreased from  to  persons and rebounded slightly to  persons in  it appears that once registered the societies made little effort to increase their members  table  organizational structure of cooperatives in the agricultural sector agricultural cooperatives in thailand are vertically organized in a threetier system primary cooperative at district level provincial federation at provincial level and national federation at national level the primary cooperatives consist of individual members while members of provincial and national federations are cooperatives at the provincial level five or more primary cooperatives can together form a provincial federation which undertakes joint activities on behalf of their primary affiliates such as processing and trading of agricultural produce at the national level there is the agricultural cooperative federation of thailand acft of which all provincial agricultural cooperative federations are affiliates note that there are also other national federations formed by specific types of agricultural cooperatives such as the sugarcane growers cooperative federation of thailand swine raiser cooperative federation of thailand dairy cooperative federation of thailand and onion growers cooperative federation of thailand all types of cooperatives at all levels in thailand are affiliated to the cooperative league of thailand clt the top national apex organization which was established in  the clt is not involved in any business but operates as a cooperative education promoter of the country cooperatives have to pay  of their profit to clt as a fee for services primary cooperatives at the district level are the foundation of the cooperative movement they consist of individual members who are divided into groups at the village level members are directly involved in the affairs of the cooperative usually the general assembly consists of the total members according to the present cooperative act the general assembly of members will elect the board of directors bod with a maximum number of not greater than  persons with a twoyear term the bod formulates the policy of the cooperative and appoints a manager and staff to run the business of the cooperative  fig  business scope and performances business activities and scopes of agricultural cooperatives in order to achieve the economic and social interest of the members agricultural cooperatives carry out various activities such as  provide production and consumption loans to members at reasonable rate of interest  encourage savings among members by promoting savings deposits  provide agricultural equipment such as tractors water pumps and agricultural inputs such as fertilizer seeds as well as consumption goods to members at reasonable prices and  assist members to market their products at good prices and to maintain fairness in terms of weight and measurement agricultural cooperatives engage in a wide range of business activities in responding to their members needs their main business may differ from one area to another but they are mostly involved in four businesses which are credit business savings and deposit marketing business and purchasing business  credit business one of the main functions of agricultural cooperatives is to provide credit facilities to their members credit facilities provided by cooperatives cover a variety of activities such as paddy farming animal husbandry debt redemption and household consumption the sources of funds for agricultural cooperatives are their own capital share capital deposit from members and loans from financial institutions especially the bank for agriculture and agricultural cooperative baac and onward lending to their members for short medium and longterm periods the shortterm loans are only for emergency needs with a repayment period of two months the mediumterm loans are given for cultivation expenses including purchase of fertilizers and for other expenses during planting and harvesting the repayment period of mediumterm loans is  months the longterm loans are given for the purpose of purchase of agricultural equipment building or repairing houses purchase of property especially land and also repaying debts the period of repayment is more than five years  savings and deposit business agricultural cooperatives promote savings among members savings can also be used to invest and generate profit to both cooperatives and their members members of agricultural cooperatives can open savings deposit accounts special savings deposit accounts or fixed deposit accounts with their cooperatives they are encouraged to deposit a part of the income they receive from selling their produces to the cooperatives in their accounts  marketing business one of the important activities of agricultural cooperatives is marketing of agricultural products especially those produced by the members farmermembers can obtain good prices while fair weights and measures are guaranteed in some agricultural cooperatives food processing such as milled rice and canned fruits were introduced to generate more income for their members some have also become centers for marketing of members products  purchasing business the business of selling major agricultural inputs such as fertilizer seeds gasoline etc and farm supplies and equipment also benefits members because it reduces production costs as well as household expenses farmers are assured of fair prices when they buy through cooperatives business of agricultural cooperatives during  the total volume of agricultural cooperative business increased by more than  from  to  million baht the average business volume per member increased by about  from  to  bahtmember and the average business volume per cooperative increased by about  from  to  million bahtcoop by activity marketing business was the most successful one with an increasing rate of about  from  billion baht in  to  billion baht in  followed by credit business which had an increasing rate of about  from  billion baht in  to  billion baht in   table  the successful marketing business of agricultural cooperatives also contributed positively to the national agricultural market value table  shows an increase in percentage share of this business to gdp during  their market share had grown gradually the aggregate market transactions of cooperatives increased from about  of the gross value of the domestic agricultural market in  to about  in  the important commodities marketed by cooperatives were pararubber and paddy financial performances of agricultural cooperatives during  the total assets of agricultural cooperatives in thailand increased from  to  billion baht liabilities also increased from  to  billion baht while members equity rose from  to  million baht reserve fund also rose from  to  billion baht during the same period revenues increased by about  from  billion baht in  to  billion baht in  while expenditures increased by about  from  billion baht in  to  billion baht in  consequently their net profit dropped to  billion baht in  from  billion baht in  this amounts to about  decline  table  governance system and management performance management and control system the management and control system of agricultural cooperatives are basically similar to those of different types of cooperatives they all maintain a uniform management and control structure for instance a general assembly of members is the supreme authority which elects a board of directors the board of directors is empowered to appoint manager and staff to run the business of the cooperative the chain of command in a cooperative is in fig  the general assembly is required to meet at least once a year within  days after the closure of its fiscal year it also has the power and responsibility to elect an internal auditor to consider the annual

interest rate ranged from  to  depending on the classification of the cooperatives  loans provided by other cooperatives agricultural cooperatives can also receive loans from other cooperatives the rate of interest and the duration of the loan depend on the policy of each cooperative taxation policy in thailand the system for tax collection is based on the assumption that a cooperative is a user organization with no interest in making profit and hence exempted from corporate income tax but subject to valueadded tax likewise dividend or profits that members receive from the cooperatives are also exempted from personal income tax recent developments in agricultural cooperatives in thailand like those of other countries in asia agricultural cooperatives in thailand are now confronting new emerging needs and challenges from farmermembers and markets caused by national and global changes in the  st century farmermembers want not only to sell their products as fast as possible but also with high economic returns thus it becomes the responsibility of the cooperatives to assist their members not only in selling their products but also at good prices furthermore the new market economy in which agricultural cooperatives operate bring about new types of consumers who demand highquality products at reasonable prices and prefer healthy and chemicalfree food at international standards they want to know the origin of the foods they buy and whether they are grown through socially acceptable and environmentfriendly methods these phenomena offer both new opportunities and also threats to agricultural cooperatives although most of thai agricultural cooperatives in the rural area remain confined to their main functions like distribution of credit and fertilizers and procurement of farm products some agricultural cooperatives have tried to transform themselves and implemented new strategies in this new economic environment the innovative practices as a new direction of agricultural cooperatives in thailand are as follows collaboration with the private sector this concept is implemented not only in the agricultural cooperatives but also in other types of cooperatives for agricultural cooperatives the main aim of this strategy is to gain some advantages from private enterprises such as strong marketing channel popular brand companies etc an example is the collaboration between  agricultural cooperatives in the northeastern part of thailand and amway corporation thailand a global directsale company in producing amway hom mali rice for consumers in the premium market segment high quality of products and traceability a major development in some agricultural cooperatives is their attempt to satisfy consumer demand by offering high quality products and introducing product traceability the thayang agricultural cooperative ltd in phetchaburi province is a successful example of agricultural cooperatives that took such initiatives this cooperative has successfully delivered the chemicalfree hom thong bananas to toto consumer cooperatives in japan farmermembers are advised to use organic fertilizers and avoid farm chemicals transport of products from thailand to japan is fully temperature controlled this good practice enhances the quality and safety of farm products moreover the producers and consumers work closely they prepare production plan together twice a year thayang agricultural cooperative keeps detailed records on inputs weather conditions and yield information similarly toto consumer cooperatives provide consumer needs information so that they both can improve product quality that meets market specifications this business has generated an income to thayang agricultural cooperative members of more than  baht per family per year this concept has been extended to other agricultural cooperatives eg banlat agricultural cooperative ltd in phetchaburi province and thungkawat farmers group in chumporn province they both now can export high quality bananas to consumer cooperatives in tokyo and osaka japan electronic commerce and use of internet ecommerce is a new way of commercializing products it offers marketing of products and services via the internet cpd has promoted and supported agricultural cooperatives to set up their web sites for ecommerce of their products however the development so far is limited only few agricultural cooperatives have their own websites cooperative womens group under the guidance of the agricultural cooperatives the cooperative womens groups cwg are formed among cooperative members and their family to run micro activities by using indigenous knowledge each group has between  womanmembers and conducting various activities relevant to members needs and skill generally the cwg has three major roles economic development family health care improvement and moral activity nowadays cwg can generate supplementary nonfarm income to family by selling their products such as processed food and handicraft throughout the country about  cwg have been formed with more than  quality certified products marketed under the one tambon one product otop program t he concept of cooperative company because of some limitations of agricultural cooperatives to carry out business quickly some have created subsidiary companies which are owned and controlled by them an example in this case is the thai agribusiness co ltd tabco tabco is a company owned by  primary agricultural cooperatives in the country it serves its cooperative members by purchasing and distributing fertilizers and equipment for agricultural production and collecting and marketing farm products such as paddy coffee corn pararubber or fruits for their cooperative members to domestic and export market associate members by law agricultural cooperatives are permitted to admit associate members however associate members have no right to vote in terms of business this permission will make agricultural cooperatives to become a more communitybased cooperative they can work with young people who are not qualified to be regular members ban lat agricultural cooperative ltd is a good example of this case it has more than  associated members most of them are nonfarmers but town residents and therefore are not eligible to certain services such as credit and marketing of farm products however they are eligible for savings services this cooperative is able to tie up different groups of people in the community together valueaddition some agricultural cooperatives in thailand undertake valueadded operation through processing grading packaging and branding products in order to gain market competitive advantages examples of these are kasetvisai agricultural cooperative ltd in roied province and tappratan farmers group in angthong province the former created its own brand for hommali  rice to distinguish its products from others while the latter changed conventional rice to herbcoating one in responding to high demand in addition in the macro view the two significant observable features in the agricultural cooperative movement are  cooperative policy development in  the cooperative movement in thailand had its first master plan  cooperative development plan  this plan was regarded as a road map for development of cooperative movement it was the outcome of joint efforts of those in the cooperative movement and the general public as a result of the six strategies clearly outlined in the master plan significant progress has already been noted because of this master plan the cooperative act has been amended to allow for greater flexibility the act is now being reviewed by the parliament  support from the government the thai government through cooperative promotion department cpd has continuously invested a large amount of resources through various programs for agricultural cooperative development the important development schemes among others are the establishment of central markets for agricultural products in  villages and  bigger product distribution centers throughout the country moreover the cpd has launched a minimba program for management staff of the cooperatives throughout the country implications and emerging needs there are two important challenges for agricultural cooperatives in all countries in the liberalized global economy one is the open market economy in which cooperatives have to compete by offering high quality goods and services at competitive prices and the other is the wellbeing of their farmermembers which cooperatives have to create by offering services to them rodriguez  agricultural cooperatives are business enterprises that need to cope with challenges on their own in the future they need a strong identity and at the same time an innovative ability compatible with the changing needs in the new market cooperatives should know how to change along with market changes while maintaining the fundamental cooperative values however in the new global market the challenges are more difficult and more complex in the case of thai agricultural cooperatives these challenges need the following measures from both the movement and the government strengthening of the national federation of agricultural cooperatives due to the ineffectiveness of the agricultural cooperative federation of thailand ltd acft which functions as a national federation of agricultural cooperatives in the country the primary agricultural cooperatives have no support from the movement at the national level the acft currently has limited functions and does not provide the desired backup support to primary cooperatives it has  provincial cooperative federation affiliates with over  primary agricultural cooperatives throughout the country but has invested only around us million in its operations and sold only about us million worth of products the acft should have performed as the apex agricultural cooperative and engaged in marketing functions such as agroprocessing and market information trade in both local and foreign market human resource development consulting services for cooperative management cooperation with overseas cooperatives and protection of the interest of primary cooperatives restructuring of agricultural cooperatives organization thailand agricultural cooperatives are structured in a threetier system primary cooperatives at district level provincial federation at provincial level and national federation at national level under the existing system the provincial federations may or may not operate business activities these allowances created ambiguous roles of the federations and hindered rather than enhanced the efficiency of cooperative movement the movement should seriously reconceptualize the system such as reducing the threetier into twotier system by eliminating the second level this concept has been proven remarkably successful in japan and korea the twotier system increases efficiency in management and provision of services of the primary cooperatives lee  prakash  it is shown that under the twotier system farmermembers of the primary cooperatives are better off in terms of direct services from the national federation however the tier restructuring is not an easy task due to its sophisticated highly diplomatic and time consuming process it requires the commitment of the leaders and the support of the government and the public the thayang agricultural cooperative ltd a success story the story of the thayang agricultural cooperative ltd tac is a case study of successful innovation practices in the export of chemicalfree hom tong banana to toto consumer cooperative tcc in japan through improved product quality that meets market specifications and through value chain innovations tacs product was awarded in  as the outstanding product to consumer this section aims to describe the operation and management of tac in banana export business and to find out the key factors of the success of the cooperative in this business tac general information the thayang agricultural cooperative ltd tac is located in petchaburi province approximately  kilometers from bangkok established in  tac is one of the biggest multipurpose agricultural cooperatives in the country its main businesses are credit deposit banana export and central market service as of march  there were  members in order to provide a better service the members are divided into  groups according to geographical locations the working capital of tac is about  million baht of which share capital is about  million baht the tac operation is described in table  banana exporting business the banana export of tac began in  when tcc of japan became interested in high quality and chemicalfree banana from thailand with the support and assistance from the government in that year tac exported high quality banana as a pilot phase at this early stage the export encountered various problems and constraints ranging from quality standard freight damages etc with high determination and cooperation the two cooperatives worked closely to improve production and postharvest process as well as freight control this resulted in banana with qualities that satisfy the tcc consumers in addition the two cooperatives also worked closely to arrange supply schedules and exchange production and marketing information in a transparent manner business based on trust between the two cooperatives increased the banana export from  tons per month in the first year to more than  tons per month currently the business adds price margins of banana of about  above those of market it also reduces the risk from pesticides of  growers of tac while the tcc consumers maximize their utilities by consuming high quality banana at appropriate prices business operation to produce chemicalfree banana for export tac has to control the production that meets the standards required by tcc consumers ie no chemicals used in the production process each banana should not be less than  grams free of pest or diseases and remains raw prior to export tac has the following measures  select the members with potentials to comply with the production quality requirements of the project  provide training for crop production and maintenance to all project members the training is under technical support from the government  cooperate with tcc to prepare the monthly supplyexport schedules  harvest the crop at  ripeness and control postharvest quality  transport to destination under full temperaturecontrolled storage facilities in general tac and tcc make purchase agreements annually in  tcc specified their demand at  tons to be distributed evenly with supply of twice a month for its  project members with a total area of  rai  rai   ha tac allocated about  rai for each member to produce following the schedules provided it was expected that each member could earn about  bahtrai while the cost of production was about  bahtrai the net profit of about  bahtrai of a project member is about  baht more than that of nonproject banana growers in thailand factors to success the main factors contributing to the success story of banana export to japan of tac are c ooperation among cooperatives it can be said that this successful business is mainly due to the cooperation between the cooperatives with a common objective to produce chemicalfree banana to fulfill demand of the consumers both cooperatives have patiently and energetically resolved technical and management problems encountered since the start of the cooperation trust  this business has been built around trust with each other the two cooperatives closely cooperate in production control transparent information exchange and consultation on production and marketing plan for instance when tcc conducted market promotion tac offered special prices when tac production was damaged from flood and they could not deliver the products timely tcc informed their member consumers instead of fining for not compliance with agreement tcc members donated money to help tac producers product traceability one important factor to this success is the confidence given to the consumers each banana can be traced back by the consumers to the producers tac records all information about producers location and date of harvest on each product while tcc provides all information to the consumers the transparent information flow benefits both producers and consumers while consumers can provide feedback on product problems if any producers can improve their weakness to satisfy the consumers technical support part of this successful business could be attributed to the technical support of the government in the pilot phase of the banana export to japan in  the department of agriculture closely provided technical support in production cleaning standardization packaging and transportation this led to the successful pilot phase of the technology which has now been developed into a complete technology package references cooperative auditing department  financial condition of cooperative
