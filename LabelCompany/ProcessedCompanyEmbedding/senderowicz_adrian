registration in rd and th line renal cell carcinoma or rcc and other solid tumor indications and he will lead crlx0 into midstage clinical trials his broad regulatory and industry expertise will be particularly valuable to us as we seek to advance our first nanoparticledrug conjugate or ndc toward commercialization and as we expand our portfolio of platformgenerated ndcs in clinical development” dr senderowicz was most recently chief medical officer and senior vice president clinical development and regulatory affairs at ignyta inc previously he was vice president global regulatory oncology at sanofi chief medical officer at tokai pharmaceuticals and senior medical director oncology clinical development at astrazeneca before working for biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies dr senderowicz held a variety of leadership positions at the us food and drug administration fda division of oncology drug products in the center for drug evaluation and research and a variety of clinical and research positions with the national cancer institutenational institutes of health nci he currently serves as a director of puma biotechnology inc a publicly traded biopharmaceutical

targeted therapies for cancer he completed his internal medicine residency training at the icahn school of medicine at mount sinai and a clinical oncology fellowship at the nci dr senderowicz holds an md degree from the school of medicine at the universidad de buenos aires in argentina and has authored over  scientific and medical publications “cerulean’s platform creates ndcs that are designed to provide safer and more effective therapies for people living with cancer tumor targeting has been a goal of academia industry and government but it has been elusive crlx’s data to date make me believe that our technology can significantly advance the field of tumor targeting” explained dr senderowicz “i also am eager to progress our second ndc crlx0 already in clinic with the goal of rapid development in selected indications and to make it available as soon as possible to these patients in need” dr senderowicz worked closely as a consultant with dr garmey in recent months becoming wellacquainted with the company’s clinical programs “i am very grateful to edward for his contributions to cerulean” mr guiffre continued “he played an instrumental role in designing and leading the randomized phase  trial of crlx plus avastin® in rd and th line rcc and he put our second platformgenerated candidate crlx0 into the clinic i understand edward’s desire to make a transition at this time and i look forward to his continued guidance as a member of our medical advisory board” “having served as chief medical officer at cerulean for over four years and nearing the completion of enrollment for our randomized trial in rd and th line rcc this is the perfect time for a transition” said dr garmey “it will allow me to spend more time with my family and pursue consulting projects and it provides cerulean the opportunity to work with a successor of adrian’s caliber and experience adrian’s drug development experience will be invaluable as cerulean expands its clinical development of crlx and crlx0 and his extensive fda experience will enhance cerulean’s ability to work cooperatively with the agency to bring its tumortargeted ndcs to people living with cancer” about crlx crlx is a nanoparticledrug conjugate ndc designed to concentrate in tumors and slowly release its anticancer payload camptothecin inside tumor cells crlx inhibits topoisomerase  topo  which is involved in cellular replication and also inhibits hypoxiainducible factorα hifα which research suggests is a master regulator of cancer cell survival mechanisms crlx has shown activity in four different tumor types both as monotherapy and in combination with other cancer treatments crlx is in phase  clinical development and has been dosed in more than  patients the us fda has granted crlx orphan drug designation for the treatment of ovarian cancer and fast track designation in combination with avastin in metastatic renal cell carcinoma about crlx0 crlx0 is a dynamically tumortargeted ndc designed to concentrate in tumors and slowly release its anticancer payload docetaxel inside tumor cells in preclinical studies crlx0 delivers up to 0 times more docetaxel into tumors compared to an equivalent milligram dose of commercially available docetaxel and was similar to or better than docetaxel in seven of seven animal models with a statistically significant survival benefit seen in five of those seven models in addition preclinical data show that crlx0 had lower toxicity than has been reported with docetaxel in similar preclinical studies crlx0 is currently in phase a clinical development about cerulean pharma the cerulean team is committed to improving treatment for people living with cancer we apply our dynamic tumor targeting platform to create a portfolio of ndcs designed to selectively attack tumor cells reduce toxicity by sparing the body’s normal cells and enable therapeutic combinations our first platformgenerated candidate crlx is in multiple clinical trials in combination with other cancer treatments all of which aim to unlock the power of combination therapy our second platformgenerated candidate crlx0 is in a phase a clinical trial for more information please visit wwwceruleanrxcom about cerulean’s dynamic tumor targeting™ platform cerulean’s dynamic tumor targeting platform creates ndcs that are designed to provide safer and more effective cancer treatments we believe our ndcs concentrate their anticancer payloads inside tumors while sparing normal tissue because they are small enough to pass through the “leaky” vasculature present in tumors but are too large to pass through the wall of healthy blood vessels once inside tumors our ndcs enter tumor cells where they slowly release anticancer payloads from within the tumor
