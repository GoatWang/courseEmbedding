wellpoint inc and lori beer dr harlan levine and randy brown editors’ notein june  angela braly was named president and chief executive officer and she assumed the role of chair of the board in march  prior to becoming ceo braly served as executive vice president general counsel and chief public affairs officer for wellpoint braly was previously president and ceo of anthem blue cross and blue shield in missouri she joined anthem blue cross and blue shield in january  as general counsel after serving for several years as a lawyer in private practice braly serves on the board of directors of procter  gamble the blue cross blue shield association and the national institute for health care management she received her juris doctor from southern methodist university school of law and her undergraduate degree from texas tech university company briefwellpoint inc is one of the nation’s largest health benefits companies with approximately  million americans nationwide covered through its affiliated health plans the company offers leading health benefits plans as well as specialty products and services designed to provide quality and value to its customers wellpoint primarily does business as anthem blue cross anthem blue cross and blue shield blue cross and blue shield of georgia or empire blue cross blue shield wellpoint wwwwellpointcom also serves customers throughout the country as unicare how have you remained strong and grown in these challenging times our consumer brand which is how most people know us is blue cross blue shield and the blue cross brand is synonymous with health care security and benefits so it has an incredibly important legacy of taking care of the customer as part of that we serve one in nine americans who carry around one of our cards the blue cross system overall has  million members so we have a great foundation for caring for our members we have great networks and we’ve delivered excellent service we’re a mission driven organization and that comes through in our interactions with the customer where will growth come from there are about one million members who will age into medicare every year between now and  across the states in which we operate we also recognize that with health care reform even more will become eligible for medicaid as health care reform is fully implemented there will be an estimated plus million people who are currently uninsured who will gain eligibility and receive subsidies to get their health insurance from us through an exchange we have diversity through all of those segments so we expect continued growth how do you define health care value and how are you focused around that value equation in terms of value you have to think about cost without losing focus on quality and you have to ensure that procedures services and pharmaceuticals are used wisely in the process part of our strategy is to make sure the customer ultimately gets a benefit that is affordable we’ve reached a crisis level when it comes to affordability which is part of what all of the reform efforts are intended to resolve but to resolve it responsibly we need to make sure we’re focusing on both cost and quality how critical is innovation and where are the greatest opportunities for innovation in this business there are obvious innovations like our partnership with ibm using watson technology – a relational languagebased artificial intelligence device – to create the first commercial application of watson in health care health care studies have shown that evidencebased medicine is not followed as much as we would like a rand study indicated that in only  percent of the time you seek and receive health care are you getting the evidencebased medicine that is indicated part of the reason it’s that low is that medicine is always changing and you can’t possibly keep up with all the latest information so we’re doing two “use cases” the first is that we’re feeding our cases into watson and it is being trained to assist our nurse case managers as they care for some of our most acutely ill members throughout the courses of their diseases the second use case is one in which we will partner with different physicians who will train watson by feeding it additional realworld clinical expertise and it will then produce decision support for the physicians who are meeting the needs of our members so innovation is essential to creating health care value because if we can raise the use of evidencebased medicine from  percent to  percent imagine how much more efficient and cost effective our system would be we have also developed a smart shopper assistance program where we help our members and their physicians “shop” the options to make sure their procedures are performed by vendors who have proven to be the highest quality and most effective at an affordable price so we’ve done a lot of innovative things around health care reform but there is a lot about health care that is disconnected part of our unique opportunity is that we’re in the center of the equation – we have the data and information about our members and the providers and we can use that data to meaningfully improve our members’ interactions in health care what needs to be done to improve the public’s trust of the health care system studies have shown that members like their health insurance but they don’t necessarily have a positive reaction to the industry as a whole so we have to continue to focus on repeatedly satisfying our customers that will not only foster their impression of us individually but will also link to a better appreciation of the industry overall perception has been so challenging for us to turn around because we are a disciplinarian in health care and that means that we have to point out to people that there are meaningful choices that should be made we have to change the culture of people who for many years have not had enough transparency in either their health care benefits or their health care delivery we’re partly responsible for having created a program where their employer paid the bill and the enduserconsumer never saw it so we have focused on transparency and making sure that our members have the information that they need when they’re engaging in the health care system that it has both cost and quality information and that it’s accessible our tool anthem care comparison covers  common procedures so if you’re going to have an mri of your spine you know the options for where you can go and how much it will cost and we’re getting ready to roll out an estimator of what your percentage of that cost will be that transparency will create more trust among the public and our members• lori beer an interview with lori beer executive vice presidententerprise business services wellpoint inc editors’ notelori beer has more than  years of executive experience leading the delivery of strategic business solutions  of those years with

healthcare caqh she earned a bachelor of science degree in computer science from the university of dayton would you provide an overview of the enterprise business services unit our goal is to optimize the services we provide for our customers so we look at all the different components involved in providing a particular service – the technology required the processes around that the people required etc – and look at how we can provide that service more efficiently and effectively there are about  employees within enterprise business services and a portion of those are in service operations they are on the frontlines with our customers every day – answering phone calls from members and providers and helping them navigate the health care system the next area is information technology which provides infrastructure and application development but also helps use technology to drive innovation the third organization is information management we have data in this company on more than  million members information management turns that data into useful information and actionable insight that allows us to take better care of our members another part of the organization is the sourcing and supplier organization which handles procurement we also have an operational excellence team which focuses on bringing all the pieces together our enterprise project management office runs  concurrent projects implementing new strategic initiatives and operational excellence helps organize the project and monitors its leadership to ensure the execution of that strategic initiative a recent addition to our organization is our federal government solutions unit where we provide benefits and processing services for the federal employee program and national government services serving as a claims processor for medicare much of this work is operationally focused looking at how we streamline and optimize so it made sense bringing it together with the rest of enterprise business

provider contracting point of view we have bestinclass value contracts across our network from a care management point of view we have accumulated a vast information asset that provides insights that have not only helped us manage care across the entire continuum from wellness to illness but also has an analytic tool that does ongoing surveillance of the population it looks for gaps in care where our evidence shows that according to industrystandard evidencebased medicine there may be opportunities to improve the care of our members we’re able to identify that and deliver messages to both the consumer and the physician so we have the people technology and capabilities that when you put them all together comprise an industry leading aggregation of assets how critical is innovation to the culture here and how deep does it permeate i came here because of the uniqueness of chs at wellpoint we have scale and deep local presence that’s important because being innovative means change and change can be potentially disruptive to the market we’re actually relevant to the delivery system and we’re able to deliver these changes there is also a strong sense of accountability on this team between the deep market presence and the culture of holding ourselves accountable for making a difference it’s fertile ground for that innovative spirit people who are senior leaders in chs are here because they feel that we’re the company in the best position to make a difference we believe that if we don’t make changes we’re going to fall behind in the market and if any company can help bring affordability and quality to health care in the future it’s wellpoint that drives our innovation every day• randy brown an interview with randy brown executive vice president and chief human resources

feeling that people aren’t fully included so creating the right representation and diversity in your workforce is step one but you also have to create a culture where people can be themselves we want people to bring their whole selves to work to express different points of view that richness helps us to be more aligned with and reflective of our customer base how has the role of an hr leader evolved and how critical is executive involvement the reason we’re here is to further the business of wellpoint and we do that by teaching the organization good hr practices and rolemodeling them ourselves what i enjoy about wellpoint is that regardless of our function when we’re at angela’s braly table we’re free to contribute on all matters so i want my counterparts to contribute to the shaping of hr policy similarly i’m free to talk about nonhr matters and that’s what makes this leadership team vibrant and fun from an employment point of view will there be a new model in the future productivity is going to be key for many years to come and organizations have learned how to be more effective and efficient and to operate with flatter organizational structures – that trend is here to stay but what we’re all striving for is growth because with that comes new jobs and opportunities while this industry does so much good public perception of it is not always favorable are young people aware of the impact that can be made in this industry what young people understand is the huge opportunity to affect the health of the american workforce and population people know the us has obesity problems and healthrelated issues sometimes driven by our own behaviors to the extent that new entrants into the workforce know that health plans can make a difference in improving people’s

of the year angela braly an attorney by trade served as ceo of health insurer wellpoint inc from  to  when she resigned amid pressure from shareholders named by forbes as one of the most powerful women in the world for most of her tenure at wellpoint braly has continued serving in corporate boardrooms since her departure albeit with a lower profile she’s also invested more time in charitable and community endeavors ibj photodaniel axler ibj i’ll venture a guess that a lot of our readers have been wondering what you’ve been up to the last couple of years and may even be surprised you’re still in indianapolis why did you stick around braly indianapolis is our home and we’ve been here now almost  years our kids have gone to school here we’ve made friends and we feel like we’re part of the community there was no debate about it i’ve had great success here and i want to give back to the community ibj according to forbes you were the fourthmostpowerful woman in the world in  do you prefer influence a little more out of the public view braly i do i was so honored and grateful to have that opportunity and to lead wellpoint and to get all that recognition i’m enjoying influencing and making things happen and not being the tip of the spear as much ibj you haven’t left the corporate life altogether you serve on the boards of procter  gamble since  and lowe’s since  what do you see as your role on those boards braly i do think because my history included being a general counsel and ceo that gives me an interesting perspective to add specifically i used to serve boards of directors boards play a very important role they don’t manage a company but they’re actively involved in strategy risk and talent ibj do board meetings ever get heated or are they mostly cordial braly board meetings by definition should be more than just a cordial discussion they should be engaged and active ibj board service must also be a fantastic networking and learning opportunity the pg board you serve on includes the ceos of american express boeing macy’s and hewlett packard braly it’s an incredible group of people and an incredible company frankly ag lafley procter  gamble’s chairman and ceo is the best businessperson i’ve ever seen in action he’s so strategic and so analytical and such a great leader i’ve learned so much from him ibj is there a specific lesson you learned from him braly it’s really important for ceos to have deep understanding of each of the elements of your business—in the pg context knowing each category each product how it works in each geography the other thing at pg and lowe’s they know the consumer that was the reason i chose to join the pg board when i was still at wellpoint i really felt like health care was going to go to the consumer and i thought who is the best in the world at serving a consumer procter  gamble ibj do you have any advice for a firsttime board member braly my advice be on the audit committee i’m on the audit committee for both lowe’s and procter  gamble i think that’s the best place to understand the business ibj what can government learn from business braly the thing that’s most obvious is that companies government agencies volunteer organizations probably all have an opportunity to be more efficient and effective at what they do you really have to look at the work that’s getting done and decide if that’s where the value is it’s rarely the person who’s doing the least valuable thing in an organization that says “i don’t have to do my job this thing i’m doing is not that valuable” you have to have a way to evaluate what is the most effective in meeting your goal i think those principles apply in frankly any group or organizations of human beings who come together and achieve a goal ibj have you ever considered politics braly i’m happy to support others who feel that is their calling i don’t see it as mine i’m working with other women who are running for office and are serving publicly ibj what have you learned the last few years braly i feel like i’ve learned from successes along the way and failures people make mistakes and i made some my encouragement to people particularly women in business or aspiring to be in government is know who you are that’s really important because other people will try to tell you who you should be make sure you take risks there’s a big conversation about women now—do they have the confidence they need or take the risks that they need much is lost for want of asking you’ve gotta ask for the tough assignment really go for it and be willing to take that risk but ultimately every job  is about serving other people i was a lawyer and i took care of my clients i was a ceo and took care of my customers and i’m a board member and take care of ultimately the shareholders and customers ibj we had ground rules to not talk about wellpoint thanks to her severance agreement is there some point in the future where you’ll talk more about what happened braly it’s kind of like ancient history i’m so proud of that company i’m so proud of what they’re doing i think some of the strategies being executed on that are really great we bought some really important companies and they’re being really well run there’s new leadership there and i need to be respectful that they’re running the company i had a wonderful opportunity to do

parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate
