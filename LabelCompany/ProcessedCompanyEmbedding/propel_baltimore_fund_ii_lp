startups  baltimore sun business baltimore foundations raising second fund to propel local startups scott dancecontact reporterthe baltimore sun a group of baltimore foundations is looking to triple the size of a fund dedicated to city startups a group of charitable organizations led by the abell foundation hopes to raise up to  million for a new fund to invest in startups within baltimores city limits tripling the size of a wellreceived program started in that program known as propel baltimore invests up to  in young companies willing to move to baltimore or already based here its initial  million coffer has funded nine fledgling businesses that now employ about  people combined  more than before and helped those firms lock down millions of dollars in other investments the foundations now aim to more than double down on their investment inviting wealthy individuals and other financiers to join in an effort to attract and multiply highpaying hightech jobs to the city the effort comes as many of baltimores wealthiest trusts and charities look beyond grantmaking to further their missions risking some of their millions in investments on ventures to promote the local economy and society and even earn a few dollars backpropel baltimores goal is to enrich the city at large helping to lure educated professionals to broaden its tax base but the investors and business advocates also hope for strong returns by funding young companies at the makeorbreak point when they require more money than they can get from family or friends but dont have the track record to nail down more traditional financing we went to other foundations and pointed out that baltimores major problem was jobs robert c embry the abell foundations president said of propel baltimores genesis we werent going to attract large companies to move here it would be a very difficult case to make we did have an opportunity with startups with entrepreneurship scott dance there are a couple of common analogies for startups wooing potential investors said entrepreneur brian razzaque — its like herding cats or getting one lemming to lead the others most investors are wary of bankrolling an unproven company without someone elses seal of approval thats why the there are a couple of common analogies for startups wooing potential investors said entrepreneur brian razzaque — its like herding cats or getting one lemming to lead the others most investors are wary of bankrolling an unproven company without someone elses seal of approval thats why the scott dance several investors in the initial propel fund have committed to participating again led by abell and including the robert w deutsch foundation and clayton baker trust organizers want to broaden participation drawing in new institutional investors and individuals the maryland technology development corp or tedco also supports the fund and manages its investmentssince the first fund launched it has become a welcome resource for startups along with other tedco technology investment funds and angel investing groups robert rosenbaum executive director of tedco said the fund is among the tools the state organization uses as a seal of approval that can help young companies convince other investors to support themthe first propel baltimore fund has invested in companies including zerofox a social media cybersecurity company redowl analytics a cybersecurity firm focused on insider threats bambeco a retailer of sustainable furniture and housewares and welldoc developer of a mobile application to help patients manage diabetes at least two companies in the propel baltimore portfolio relocated from outside the region in part because of the opportunity to receive investment hereour company wouldnt be where it is without the network here said saad alam ceo of citelighter an education technology company that moved from new york in the fall of  lured by a tedco investment and veterans of education companies sylvan learning and laureate education they have given us amazing feedback we could not have gotten anywhere elsecitelighter which is developing a software system that helps k students learn how to improve their writing received  from propel in a  million funding round it closed this year the company has grown from a single desk at federal hills betamore incubator to  desks plus  remote employees and is searching for permanent space of its own alam saidanother socalled ed tech company threering also moved from new york in part because of the chance for propel funding and other investment and mentorship opportunities the companys software application allows teachers and students to share work across mobile devices and is now used in school districts across the statesteve silvius threerings chief education officer welcomed the prospect of another propel fund saying he hopes the infusion of money allows organizers to take on different investment strategies and gets baltimore more attention from larger venture capital investorsi think theyll put it to good use silvius said of the second fund theyre not afraid to take some risk in putting capital to work which is a good thing for that kind of fundtheres no money left in the first fund for new investments though officials retained some money to make followup investments in its portfoliothe programs investments are all so new that it has yet to show a return for the investors while its success isnt proven yet investors said it is promising enough to win their supportthis is still a leap of faith its a belief that its important said john b powell jr executive director of the clayton baker trust a charitable foundation i dont think the results are clear yet certainly theres been some good results in terms of employmentsuch investments also further the foundations mission better than others that simply promise a decent return some say tax law requires foundations to give away  percent of their endowments in grants or other awards each year or face penalties but foundation leaders said opportunities like propel baltimore and other direct investments in business ventures or social programs allow them to go beyond grant making to better their communitieswere living at a time of such huge need that you increasingly want to get the most value possible out of both your grant making and your investing said jane brown executive director of the deutsch foundation youve got to invest these assets anywayfor deutsch other such investments include a  million maker space for artists and manufacturers in station north known as open works the abell foundation which is also an investor in open works channels  percent of its investment dollars to community projects and startup companies embry saidand the goldseker foundation which supported the first propel baltimore fund has backed healthy neighborhoods a program offering mortgage guarantees in distressed baltimore neighborhoods said ceo matthew gallagher he said it also is considering participating in a program to offer what are known as social impact bonds which invest money to improve a specific social outcome and are repaid by the associated savings in government spendingwith all such investments the aim is to both make money and to benefit the city the foundation executives said business advocates said there is
