income and overall total return while rivernorth capital management llc rivernorth believes markets are generally efficient closedend funds offer a unique structure whereby investors can purchase a diversified fund and potentially generate additional return through the change in the relationship between the closedend funds market price and net asset value nav rivernorth also believes combining a closedend fund strategy with a proven fixed income manager such as doubleline capital lp doubleline® provides an attractive investment vehicle for investors diversification does not ensure a profit or guarantee against loss investment strategy rivernorth allocates the funds assets among two principal strategies tactical closedend fund income strategy managed by rivernorth and opportunistic income strategy managed by doubleline  investments may include securities that have a rating that is below investment grade including high yield securities target portfolio asset allocations are estimates made by the adviser and subject to change high yield bonds are subject to interest rate risk if rates increase the value generally declines investment rationale rivernorthdoubleline strategic opportunity fund inc is a multimanager closedend fund that opportunistically invests in fixed income securities and tactically invests in closedend funds in order to potentially provide access to a diversified portfolio of fixed income securities and closedend funds representing a wide array of underlying asset classes value from investments in both the closedend fund and fixed income markets use of leverage in order to enhance current income and capitalize at times on market dislocations the fund also provides contingent conversion by shareholder vote to openend in  years active portfolio management by rivernorth  doubleline two awardwinning managers in their respective disciplines who have worked together since  leverage is a speculative technique that exposes a closedend fund to greater risk and increased costs than if it were not used the use of leverage may cause greater volatility in the level of a closedend funds nav market price and distributions on its common shares leverage will also result in higher fees to the closedend fund manager because the amount of assets under management will be included in the funds managed assets there can be no assurance that a
