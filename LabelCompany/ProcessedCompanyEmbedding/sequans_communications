sequans communications a comeback in the making  sequans communications nysesqns  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»sequans communications a comeback in the makingjul  about sequans communications sqns kevin whalen growth momentum deep value eventdrivensummary shifts in wimax technology put sequans communications in a tough competitive positionsequans quickly modernized their product portfolio to focus on key growth prospectsthe new product applications are well positioned for industry growth while sequans forges key certifications and partnershipsrevenue and gross margins appear to be showing positive trends for the first time in years sequans ipo when it went public in  sequans communications nyse sqns was a blossoming chip producer positioned heavily in wimax hardware wimax is a highspeed wireless broadband service similar to wifi but it can accommodate a broader traffic flow at the time it appeared that some cities were looking at implementing this service for residents president obama even traveled to marquette mi in february  to speak about the impact wimax had on local business and university distance learning it looked as though wimax would soon be the dominant technology however long term evolution also was emerging as a competitive standard for wireless connectivity sprint nye s had already invested in a wimax network while att nyse t and verizon nyse vz both committed to lte networks lte is said to have benefits over wimax including more bandwidth reduced latency and easier integration into existing cell frequencies at the time sprints strategy began evolving to focus on adding the iphone to its network in part because of these reasons sprint began planning their own lte network investment with lightsquared marking the beginning of the end for wimax in the us the remains at the close of  sequans recorded  million in sales marking a  decline from the previous year q of that year contributed a dismal  million in revenue and  gross margin sequans went through an overwhelming decrease in stock value while trailing industry peers in technology breadth of line and financial strength they would likely sit on aging inventory while their product strategy remained nebulous if this company were to return confidence to their shareholders it would require a significant shift in focus npd and strategy emerge fast forward to the present day and the company has a welldefined product strategy targeting growth in an expanding g lte network ceo georges karam focused on a niche strategy within iot and mm devices while most industry peers went after the larger mobile device market their product range is small by comparison but this strategy has created an exclusive offer that is positioned to prevail internet of things the internet of things iot is disrupting the world paving the way for smart cities and connected consumer devices there is a tremendous profit opportunity in the entire supply chain of iot research predicts that worldwide iot chip revenue will reach  billion by  research and markets  thats all great in theory but with industry peers chasing this same opportunity why should we count on sequans to win market share peers like broadcom nasdaq avgo do have iot focus but their portfolio is more concentrated on shortrange bluetooth and wifi connected devices rather than lte optimization at this time broadcom also has an advantage of offering bundled hardware solutions to their customers but they still cannot offer a comparable product solution to sequans larger peers also need to divide resources across managing robust sku portfolios which can strain employee focus and form bottlenecks in operations comparably sequans may be more agile allowing their leadership team to focus purely on g lte profit contribution if youre not convinced that sequans can compete lets look at product performance in  sequans took home an iot innovation award from connected world magazine for their cat  trials with verizon and ericcson no more than a year later they were honored with most innovative iotmm strategy by leading lights for their new cat m technology sequans has three iot platforms under the names monarch calliope and colibri these provide cat m cat  and cat  classes respectively cat m and cat  are the only ones of their kind in the market providing low cost and power consumption solutions for devices that require smaller data transfers eg utility meters asset trackers and health sensors on the other hand the colibri platform can support more robust connections required for tablets routers and pcs there are still more proprietary benefits including cat ms dynamic power management technology which uses less power saving you battery life while also promising up to  years of operation helping reduce warranty claims for manufacturers finally sequans introduced sequans air in their cat chip which is an active interference rejection technology as our lte networks get more and more crowded service providers need to find solutions to support higher traffic sequans air allows service providers to handle twice the network capacity and provides a throughput increase of three and a half times which will allow companies like verizon to offer better service to their consumers volte sequans cat  and cat  chips support voice over lte volte sequans is the first to bring volte capability to a cat  chip and the first to have it certified by verizon compared to a traditional voice connection volte is said to provide a better quality sound and a more stable connection however where i see its largest opportunity is within iot rather than traditional cellular applications the verbal command creates an opportunity to enhance multitasking and replace some uses of touch screens an example of this is for wearable health trackers which may have compact screens that are difficult to navigate by touch peers like qualcomm nasdaq qcom also can provide volte but the unique positioning for sequans is the lowcost and lowpower cat  product lowcost components help device manufacturers reduce cogs expanding gross profit margin and also reducing consumer barrier to entry at more affordable retails modems and routers sequans supplies chips for more robust devices as well including modems and routers for residential and industrial applications their design wins extend to major names such as dlink and netgear verizons jetpack produced in partnership with netgear is a g lte hot spot verizon is a great partner for sequans as they can invest heavily in partnered product marketing support in addition verizons q earnings presentation shows a steady growth in g lte devices though most of these are phones this growth rate is encouraging for the platform as a whole verizon has recently increased the retail of their jetpack substantially which may pose a risk to chip volume sequans also has potential to support reliance jio in india though it is not currently in the forecast reliance is planning on rolling out their network in late  to their  subscribers and is testing on  subscribers this year as a basis for population with disposable income it may be fair to compare to the middle class population in india estimated at  according to ernst  young that same middle class is predicted to reach an incredible  in just five years certifications and partnerships partnerships are forged on a few different levels and typically require collaboration for a successful launch network service providers are the key to sequans distribution success a component would never be considered by an original equipment manufacturer oem unless it earned validation for the end network therefore it is important that both cat  and cat  chipsets have been validated by verizon and att sequans can now open up more opportunities with major consumer devices selling through these network providers sequans is additionally working to certify their cat  chip with telstra which would open up their distribution to australian networks other important partnerships forming include lte for thales aviation and a new partnership with socle technologies socle is a subsidiary of foxconn which i find very intriguing based on foxconns relationships with global technology manufacturers this could be a great opportunity for sequans expansion financial performance and investment value at the close of  sequans grew revenue to  million a  increase over  this is still a far cry from s  million to date sequans is not a profitable company but they are effectively closing the gap in their operating loss for example their  annual operating loss of  million compares favorably to a loss of  million in  q  also suggests that this trend may continue in  sequans lost just  million while in the first quarter of  that number was  million the weight of this operating loss to revenue also is improving due to an increase in design wins source etrade research investors should be aware that the company has been in a tight cash position though burning through  of their cash in the past two quarters because of this theyve recently issued an additional  million in convertible debt where sequans has substantial pressure is on their gross margin contribution which has struggled for years luckily the company reached  gross margins at the close of  a  increase over the previous year in addition q  margins were  which may indicate sequans is returning to parity within the industry even with this accomplishment peers like qualcomm have heftier gross margins of  qualcomm also provides a stable  yield helping cover any shortterm volatility in the market the point is that there are different investment strategies depending on if you are seeking value or speculative growth investors may look past these shortterm issues if they are seeking a speculative growth addition to their portfolio according to yahoo finance six analysts have an average price target of  per share while it currently resides around  per share closing remarks sequans met a horrible fate while the market landscape evolved but adapted during this inflection point their product portfolio today is relatively small but unique in performance and exclusive for market applications in the short term the company must continue to innovate their product portfolio in order to maintain shareholder confidence since industry peers can invest heavily in new product development the company also needs to prove they can return to  or greater gross margins like their counterparts finally they need to turn an operating profit and manage their cash positions more conservatively overall their product portfolio today is one that meets a niche market need for lowcost and lowpower chips the booming iot category will create enough opportunity for the majority of competitors to succeed though im confident in the payoff for design wins over the next three to five years im not yet convinced sequans can maintain proprietary advantages beyond the fiveyear mark in the end sequans growth in revenue reduction in operating loss certifications and proprietary product features are indicators of a hidden growth opportunity overshadowed by its peers disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned but may initiate a long position in sqns over the next  hours i wrote this article myself

sustainablesequans calliope lte cat chipset sales set to grow by hundreds of percentage points in lte will be the dominant provider of connectivity for mobile iot devices and sequans is well positionedsequans sells  million singlemode lte chipsets per year with the iot potential measured in billions the growth could be explosivethe low cost small size and long battery life of lte cat m chips will enable the largest wave of innovation since the smartphone and sequans is a leading providerthis is my third article on sequans nysesqns you can find the others here and here while the past articles took the form of a short and punchy top ten list i decided to embrace an essay style article that would be more accessible to a broader and less technical audience on the date of my first article the stock closed at share at the time of writing the stock is around  having hit a new week high of  on may th the blue line in the chart below shows the volume for the day moving average clearly the interest in sequans has been growing steadily since late last year and especially so over the last two months despite the stock having more than doubled in the past six months i believe the market is still waking up to the potential of sequans and the significance of single mode lte in the nascent internet of things market hopefully by reading this article you will also come to realize the potential of sequans to electrify your portfolio this article is broken into the following parts for easier comprehension part   broadband lte  sequans streamrich segment part   internet of things  sequans streamlite segment part   why lte will be the dominant lpwan technology part   why sequans offers the best opportunity in lte sequans product lineup sequans designs and sells single mode lte chips typical cell phone chips are multimode and capable of falling back to g or g as required these extra fallback capabilities come at a cost with multimode chips being larger more complex power hungry and more expensive now that lte coverage is widely available the cheaper single mode lte chips have become attractive a very significant consideration when dealing with billions of devices sequans created the first single mode lte chipset and leads the market in this area sequans has two product categories streamrich for highspeed lte and streamlite for iot devices the capabilities and primary uses of each of these products are shown in the table below nbaka nb iotcatmlte catm operates at kbps dlkbps ul a note on terminology when lowspeed lte was introduced in release  it was originally known as catm and had two subclasses cat m and cat m together these are often called ltem cat m or lte cat m while the name cat m remains in everyday use cat m has morphed and is now more commonly known as nbiot or nb nb  narrow band part   broadband lte  sequans streamrich segment the streamrich segment deals with broadband lte solutions with speeds nominally in the range of mbpsmbps most commonly these are home and portable routers providing highspeed internet access without a permanent connection such as cable or dsl although sequans does not break out its revenue by segment it did provide sufficient commentary during its q earnings call for it to be deduced this market continues to account for our threequarters of our total revenue in the first quarter  georges karam this statement would place the broadband business at  million in q later in the same call georges karam ceo said this about broadband revenue for  based on the strong momentum we are seeing we continue to believe the broadband data device business will exceed  million quarterly run rate by the end of this year and could even reach  million per quarter by yearend if the new devices ramp quickly also this target assumes revenue from india or china would be considered as potential upside in q broadband revenue was already at  million but we have had a steady stream of announcements on broadband partners since then april rd   verve connect lte hub april st   verizon jetpack hotspot may th   comba telecom router china two oems added in q mentioned in q earnings call of course some of these are expected wins and may already be factored into the companys broadband sales estimates for  however i believe the company has been prudently cautious in setting expectations and has good potential to hit the highend of its guidance in my past articles on sequans i have focused heavily on its streamlite nysemktiot product family as the growth engine of the company and certainly the potential there is huge but i have performed a disservice to the contribution and growth of its broadband business with yoy growth in q of  most of this was driven by its broadband business so its worth taking a closer look at this market the broadband lte market a consumer can buy the new verizon ellipsis jetpack mhsl which contains the sequans colibri chipset for  with a twoyear contract on top of that a customer would pay mo for gb of data and then  per each additional gb alternately a consumer can choose to pay mo for unlimited data neither of these plans is likely to appeal as a replacement for most wired home internet connections at those prices but broadband lte does have the advantage of being portable making it ideal for mobile solutions such as cars buses trains or temporary events such as trade shows and conventions while solutions for these scenarios exist today the sequans cat  colibri chipset can achieve speeds up to mbps and users can enjoy familiar desktop speeds on the go while the economics in the us prohibit explosive growth it is a different story elsewhere in central london you can get a oneyear contract with internet provider relish £  down gets you a broadband lte hub and £  a month for a mbit connection and unlimited data relish uses the verve connect lte hub powered by a sequans colibri chipset in france you can get gbmo of lte data for €  from provider free slowly lte is making inroads into the traditional wired marketplace if you think that cant happen in the us that the big carriers have too big of a lock on the market then you would be partly correct verizon nysevz and att nyset are not likely to lower their pricing sufficiently to make broadband lte competitive for most home users anytime soon streaming of video is just too data intensive for their existing lte networks while broadband lte is not mainstream in the us there are forces on the horizon that are about to change the dynamics and economics of the lte market in dramatic ways the future is wireless the days of home internet being dominated by wired connections are coming to an end does this sound like an audacious claim google nasdaqgoog nasdaqgoogl doesnt think so google fiber is cancelling orders and restructuring its business digging up streets and pulling fiber to every home is just too expensive and time consuming so what is causing google to rethink its internet business the ghz spectrum in the us the fcc has undertaken an innovative departure from its previous approach to spectrum allocation rather than have a range of spectrum dedicated to one specific purpose the fcc has approved a model that allows spectrum to be shared on a hierarchical priority basis this range of spectrum in the ghz range mhz  mhz is known as the citizens broadband radio service or cbrs also called the innovative band by some the properties of the  ghz range place it in the sweet spot of the spectrum for use in communications making it well suited for highspeed wireless communications the shared spectrum will have three tenants at different priorities the incumbent usage methods have the highest priority paying lessees for a geographic area will have the second highest priority and private citizens will have the lowest level of priority what has all this to do with broadband lte once cbrs is approved for public use anyone yes even you can set up an lte network using these frequencies without having to pay a license fee for the spectrum this takes the lte monopoly out of the hands of the telcos and opens a huge door for other service providers to step through enter google and others google is embracing ghz as a better option to provide high speed internet to the home google sought permission from the fcc to test this innovative technology using the cbrs band in up to  markets and has been heavily involved in establishing the required standards and testing bodies to support cbrs deployment verizon att sprint nyses and tmobile nasdaqtmus are all members of the cbrs alliance as are intel nasdaqintc samsung otcssnlf nokia nysenok qualcomm nasdaqqcom cisco nasdaqcsco alphabet and many others this is not a standard that lacks for industry support certainly the telcos must see cbrs as an opportunity and a threat the opportunity to expand their footprint into the home internet market must be enticing att has petitioned the fcc to set up early trials in the ghz band and verizon is already engaged in testing with the cellular phone market in the us being saturated the addition of highperformance spectrum at much lower licensing costs makes the possibility of expanding their services into the home market a very attractive growth opportunity while it is not expected that the fcc will grant operating licenses tier  of the  priority tiers until  there is clearly industry momentum behind cbrs it will take some time for broadband lte to become competitive in the us because cbrs has added complexities however in other parts of the world china for example where shared spectrum is a not a requirement the ghz range is already is gaining ground and is often mentioned in connection with g the next big leap in lte speeds sequans already has lte solutions that operate at ghz and only require a software modification to operate on cbrs so it is well positioned for this growth area sequans is currently achieving significant growth in its streamrich segment and technology trends strongly suggest that growth in broadband lte will continue and most likely increase over time part   sequans streamlite segment the streamlite segment represents sequans solutions for the iot market industrial commercial or consumer devices in this category are relatively low bandwidth low power solutions and due to their simpler single mode design are cheap relative to their multimode predecessors this segment offers three products in two categories which are discussed below part a  sequans calliope  lte cat  the sequans calliope cat  mbps lte chipset is primarily designed for wearables as such it is highly optimized for size power and speed the table below lists some of the key events in the evolution of the sequans calliope as i pointed out in one of my earlier articles the sequans calliope is included as part of the verizon wearable reference kit event date product introduction january th  first cat  lte module with gemalto september st  certified on verizon july rd  certified on ntt docomo march th  certified for volte on verizon april th  certified on att may th  certified on tmobile august th  certified for volte on tmobile february th  despite the availability of this product on both major us networks for over a year it does not seem to have made much impression we can deduce the approximate quarterly revenue contribution by cat  as follows  q revenue of  million broadband accounts for our threequarters of our total revenue in the first quarter leaving  million other revenue for q of  was  million monarch product line is not yet contributing therefore cat  revenue is  or less in q i can buy a gemalto cinterion els module containing a sequans oem cat  chip for about  probably significantly cheaper in bulk for easy math lets say the els module is  in bulk and that gemalto pays sequans  for the cat  chipset that would generate an approximate sales rate of around  unitsquarter this is a paltry amount for a chipset that has been certified on four major networks totaling  million subscribers sequans created the single mode lte market and evangelizing takes time and effort while uptake in cat  has been slow in  the comments made by georges karam ceo in the q earnings call indicate confidence in its growth in  after accumulating design wins at both the device and module level all last year cat  products will fuel our growth in  we have projects where the people selected gemalto or selected us its for three four years project so it really gives us a lot of visibility and confidence that the revenue will be there for the cat we are seeing several customers choosing to ramp their cat products on more than one carriers network … we are pleased to note that we are beginning to build the backlog we have received orders for our cat customers and we are moving to full production i contacted the company regarding what it meant to enter full production for cat  thus far cat  production has been sufficient for providing samples or small quantities for testing and limited trials full production simply means it will be producing chips based on customer orders below is a list of known customers using sequans cat  chipset geotab to use sequans cat  wisol to make cat  modules encore networks en router nimbelink skywire cat  modem gemalto els modules autonet in car connectivity witivity iot modem in april sequans announced a partnership with geotab a vehicle and telematics company geotab has only one hardware product the go which will be updated to use sequans cat  and presumably named the go it has trademarked the name geotab has over  devices under management today and vehicle telematics is a rapidly expanding field estimating a device life of five years and continued growth an annual run rate in the range of  unitsyear would seem likely this one customer would more than double sequans cat  quarterly sales rate at the time of writing geotab has not yet released its go product but i expect this is part of sequans cat  pipeline voice over lte volte in a typical smartphone voice and data are two discrete types of communication that use different components of the phone and separate channels of communication like its cousin voip volte converts voice communication into data and passes it exclusively over the data network this capability opens the door for wearables to encompass a much higher degree of functionality than they do today people are becoming more comfortable speaking to their cell phones and tablets with phrases like ok google alexa or siri amazons nasdaqamzn echo dot has proven that a consumer device does not require a screen to be successful the technology and infrastructure are available today and its only a matter of time before wearables emerge that can provide a rich experience much like that experienced on larger devices from amazon and google but with the important addition of being entirely mobile and able to place and receive phone calls texts or emails sequans cat  future with the current customer list it seems probable that cat  growth is likely to increase by hundreds of percentage points as it moves into full production but cat  has some interesting prospects in the wearable space it was part of the verizon wearables reference kit after all and with the ability to support volte it seems likely one or more consumer oriented wearables will launch during  given the highly innovative and competitive nature of new tech devices even their existence are closely guarded secrets similarly sequans is also bound to secrecy regarding which companies are building solutions using their technology while the company forecasts a cat  ramp it is likely to manifest as a stairstep as electronics manufacturers build significant inventory prior to launch part b  sequans monarch  lte cat mnb while lte standards have typically pushed to higher data rates release  introduced two new low speed options cat m  mbps and cat nb aka m or nb iot kbps these two new standards allow for very low power usage sleep mode and greater signal range sequans recognized the opportunity provided by these new standards to create a lowcost lte chip that could operate for years on a single battery at the right price point such a chip could greatly fuel the adoption of the internet of things with these goals in mind sequans created the worlds first single mode cat mnb chip the sequans monarch sequans monarch the monarch was announced in february of  a tiny chip that measures mm x mm mm by january  the monarch was certified for operation on the verizon network and gemalto had released a module ems that used the monarch chip sequans has been steadily building an impressive ecosystem around its monarch chip as demonstrated in the table below sequans monarch ecosystem networks module makers developer platforms customers verizon  certified wvolte gemalto stmicroelectronics nysestm orion labs tmobile  certified wvolte huawei arduino nimbelink att  end of q simcom raspberry pi link labs fibocom ti beaglebone black encore networks wisol stmicro nucleo pycom renesas nxp freedom naturally there is a considerable lag between the availability of a chip and the commercial availability of products using that chip in the q earnings call georges karam ceo stated they are not currently shipping monarch in any meaningful volume and do not expect the revenue stream from monarch to materialize until q of  my expectations are that once monarch revenue starts in q it will ramp very quickly and ill explain why internet of things adoption over the years as we have moved from mainframes to pcs to smartphones and tablets the number of devices has increased tenfold with each generation at the same time the device cost has decreased exponentially while no one agrees on how many devices will be added to the internet of things by  all agree that it will be measured in the billions an excellent list of  different iot sensor use cases can be found on the libelium site many of these use cases are represented in the diagram below source libeliumcom given the price of  for a monarch module we will certainly see many industrial iot sensors below  this is a huge market that will evolve over the next decade or more adding billions of sensors worldwide and improving the efficiency and quality of many aspects of industry and the environment however the industrial internet is only part of the picture and in my estimation will not be where the most immediate growth happens the low cost small size and long battery life of cat m chips will lead to the largest wave of innovation in the electronics industry since the arrival of the smartphone the graphic below illustrates some of the many ways in which cat m technology may reach into our everyday lives source microsoft iot presentation while some of these devices exist today the introduction of cheap and reliable connectivity gives device manufacturers a vast and fertile ground with which to enhance or develop compelling solutions for consumers here are a few simple examples a small tracker that shows the location of any object on a map children pets vehicles bicycles cargo parcels cell phones etc a clip for seniors that detects falls and allows them to call for help vending machines that notify owners of exact inventory levels sports trackers that do not require cell phone proximity health monitoring devices that feed information to your patient record we dont know when these products will arrive what they will look like which ones will be flops or which will have amazing success what we do know is that the opportunity brought about by lte cat m chips is vast and that it has the potential to provide huge rewards for those companies that make successful devices where cell phones and tablets have close to a  relationship to humans iot device density estimates range from  to  in industrialized nations with such a huge opportunity to make innovative devices and the potential to sell them by the tens of millions the incentive to enter this market is extremely high investing in sequans is bet across this entire spectrum of innovation monarch sx in january of  sequans announced the monarch sx a system on a chip soc variant that the company describes as follows monarch sx integrates sequans monarch the worlds first and most highly optimized ltem and nbiot platform and first to be certified by a tierone operator with an arm® cortex®m processor voice and audio engines with support for volte on ltem an alwayson ultralow power sensor hub and an advanced display controller to support a graphical user interface with touch screen functions all the above is contained within a package that measures mm less than half the area of a us  cent piece as shown in the representation below the graphics components are provided by think silicon using its nemadc line probably the nema dc which would yield a display resolution of x given the size and capabilities of the device the possibilities are enormous essentially any mobile device with a screen and moderate internet speed requirements comes into play probably the most obvious use case is an lteenabled smartwatch that isnt huge or need daily charging another significant opportunity is a lowcost volte only phone for price sensitive emerging markets although the monarch sx is not yet contributing to earnings the company stated that the monarch sx is getting great traction and appears to be a very compelling and market leading solution which is expected to begin ramping up in q of  sequans product summary sequans broadband chips are carrying the company at present and generate over  of their revenue despite this narrow product line sequans delivered  yoy growth in  and expects to do so again in  with its lte cat  calliope moving into full production and the revenue ramp for lte cat m monarch expected to start in q the multiyear growth potential for sequans looks very strong an investment in sequans is a bet on the ongoing supremacy of lte but why should lte be dominant in the internet of things we will answer that next part   why lte lte is not the only way to connect to the internet there are many other methods that must be considered before crowning a winner there are many shortrange solutions with a maximum range of less than  meters common ones are bluetooth wifi nfc zigbee and zwave these have their uses but given the range limitations none of them are truly mobile even within a home that has an internet connection there are many use cases where a direct connection between the device and the internet is required such as utility metering security systems automotive diagnostics or fire alarms many devices use g and g to connect to the internet but these technologies are already in decline g has been sunsetted by att verizon and tmobile have dates and g will follow in a few years to free additional spectrum besides both methods are too power hungry and inferior to lte low power wide area network lpwan unless you are in the tech world lpwan is probably an addition to your lexicon the wikipedia definition for lpwan reads as follows lowpower widearea network lpwan or lowpower network lpn is a type of wireless telecommunication wide area network designed to allow long range communications at a low bit rate among things connected objects such as sensors operated on a battery in fact this technology has been around for over  years and has generated a multitude of competing solutions outside of the cellular realm lora sigfox ingenu symphony weightless all these technologies use public spectrum to transmitreceive radio signals with remote devices that can be miles away from the central receiver data speeds are low ranging from kbps to kbps in practical situations network coverage of these solutions is very spotty even the better ones sigfox lora via senetco and ingenu have very limited us coverage vs verizons lte network or att or tmobile for that matter lpwan technologies certainly have their use cases but if a device is truly mobile city to city or requires a moderate data connection then these options are immediately ruled out where they are well suited is low bandwidth stationary solutions like metering or switching or limited mobility solutions such as agriculture lte cat m is the smallest fastest most mobile and geographically available solution other lpwan technologies reportedly have an advantage in data pricing but the network availability is severely limited in most parts of the world with the lte network including cat m already in place nationwide on verizonatt nb iot coming it will be a very challenging environment for these alternate technologies to make further headway in the us if there are headwinds to ltem in the us it most likely lies in the business model that carriers adopt for these devices att and verizon both have pricing based on a per month basis which adds complexity to the purchasing decision and slows adoption once ltem devices are offered including lifetime data the final barrier will be removed so lte looks like its a winner in most scenarios but why buy sequans there must be a ton of companies making single mode lte chips as far as i am aware sequans only has two competitors in this niche lte competitors when i first found sequans last september i was very impressed by the achievements and foresight of this small french company with respect to recognizing and carving out the single mode lte niche ahead of its much larger competitors like qualcomm and intel after researching the single mode lte market more closely sequans became an even more attractive option given the limited nature of public competitors and the companys first mover advantage qualcomm qualcomm is an  billiondollar behemoth that has dominated the cellular market for years and is currently being sued by the ftc for anticompetitive behavior trying to get a  return on your investment here is going to be tough qualcomm does have an lte cat m chip mdm but is trailing sequans in a variety of ways see prior article for details sony entertainment nysesne sony is a bit smaller at a market cap of  billion but still too big to get a double just on the strength of lte sony acquired altair an israeli company in january of  sony also has an lte cat m chip alt that was introduced in february of  and is certified on att but not verizon author update  intel corp most of intels focus is on the fast end of the lte spectrum however they did announce two iot lte chips on february nd of   days after the sequans announcement the first is the xmm  which supports nb iot only the second is the xmm  which is cat m and also includes an application processor you wont find information on either of these on the intel website because neither one is commercially available nor has the company made any statement regarding certification on either verizon or att while definitely a serious competitor they appear to be lagging sequans in getting to market and carrier certifications with a market cap of  billion single mode lte is not going to be the decisive factor in the long term direction of the stock price arm holdings nasdaqarmh arm holdings made two acquisitions in february of  with the intent of incorporating iot capabilities into their arm chips initially they only plan to support nb iot and not cat  or cat m which reduces the competitive frontage with sequans they are off to a late start with commercial shipment of product not expected until the second half of  arm holdings was acquired by softbank in  for  billion so is not an option for direct investment nordic semiconductor listed on the oslo stock exchange nordic announced the nrf in july of  and the chip will eventually support cat m and cat m fortunately for sequans investors the chip is not expected to sample until the second half of  and wont be commercially available until sometime in  without any apparent lead with time to market or carrier certifications etc this does not appear to be well positioned sequans sequans invented the category of single mode lte and has led the competition in getting cat  and cat m chips to the market and network certified it has built a strong ecosystem of development resources and module makers that assures it a solid place in the future of lte sequans has a market cap around  million and only makes single mode lte chips making it perfectly positioned for growth in this market part   why sequans there are many reasons i like sequans which you can read in my prior articles here and here in this section i focus solely on the immediate growth prospects for  and some likely scenarios for  guidance and growth i have been following sequans closely for the last nine months and have been reassured by the accuracy of managements revenue guidance during that time here is a quick refresher of guidance vs actual over the last year quarter guidance millions actual millions  q       q      q      q      midpoint of sequans q guidance managements guidance has been spot on for the past three quarters so it gives me some confidence in its q guidance this is what georges karam ceo had to say in the q earnings call if we assume the midpoint of our guidance for the second quarter the first half of  will be up  over the first half of  we feel good about the secondhalf of the year so we continue to believe we are on track to grow more than  in  with further acceleration in  as we now know its cat  product has entered full production and the monarch ramp should start in q so these statements seem to correlate to the ramp in product shipment the statement with further acceleration into  is certainly intriguing the table below shows revenue estimates for sequans at different growth rates through the end of  although  growth rates of  to  may seem overly optimistic the  quarterly revenues are only in the  million range so this is not unreasonable when viewed in absolute dollar terms in addition the average revenue forecast by analysts listed on yahoo as shown below is  million for  and  million for  these numbers represent revenue growth of  in  and  in  with breakeven expected at around  million per quarter and gross margins of  sequans should be generating substantial ebitda in  no one knows what will happen in  but sequans has laid the groundwork and has the ecosystem in place to garner its fair share of success with its low quarterly revenues and the potential to sell tens of millions of lte chips in all kinds of devices its growth could be explosive what value the market places on sequans over the next year is impossible to say but high growth companies in a hot sector always demand and get a very significant premium just today  the price target by benchmark co was raised  from  to  making it the highest price target among the analysts that follow sequans summary sequans is the purest play on lte and mobile iot connectivity that exists today should you invest well ask yourself these questions do you believe the internet of things is becoming reality will lte continue its ascent to global dominance in communications do you believe that single mode lte offers the most compelling solution for connecting mobile and disparate low bandwidth devices to the internet can sequans capture a reasonable share of the iot lte market if the answer is yes then taking a position in sequans is a smart way to play the iot boom the question is not whether sequans can maybe double because it already has in the past six months but will it break the  mark in  or  i closed out my second article on sequans  with this statement sequans represents the confluence of five factors that make this a very rare investment opportunity a microcap undervalued company a welldefined huge and imminent market best in class products partnerships with key industry leaders a management team that is executing well i believe investors with the foresight to buy sequans and the patience to wait  months or more will be very well rewarded for doing so this statement holds as true now as it did when it was first written and i remain very bullish on the prospects for sequans in  and beyond appendix there are a few other points about sequans that i wanted to pass along but did not fit within the narrative of the main article so i am including them here a  qualcomm suit on january th the us federal trade commission filed suit against qualcomm arguing that qualcomm used its dominant market position to stifle competition as a leading producer of wimax chips in  sequans was certainly among those companies harmed by the actions of qualcomm on january rd sequans filed an article  complaint with the european union trade commission against an unknown party article  of the eutc deals with antitrust matters and specifically abuse of dominant position i cant say conclusively that the unknown party is qualcomm but i would certainly take that bet whether this might lead to a windfall for sequans remains to be seen but an ftc victory over qualcomm in this matter would certainly bring it considerably closer on may th  samsung and intel filed amicus briefs in support of the ftc case and detailing how samsung and intel had been harmed by qualcomms business practices apple nasdaqaapl is also suing qualcomm and withholding royalties with apple claiming that qualcomm has never offered frand fair reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms as it is required to do by law for the licensing of qualcomms essential ip these lawsuits will probably take years to go through the courts and sequans may never see any financial benefit however with a rift forming between appleintelsamsung and their key lte supplier it spells opportunity for sequans when those manufacturers look for suppliers of cat  and cat m lte chips thanks to seeking alpha frmrvzguy for pointing out the sequans  complaint a  recent lte network developments on may th  sprint announced that it would support lte cat  by the end of july  and would begin deploying lte cat m by mid on may th  att announced that it had completed deployment of its nationwide ltem cat m and that it would expand its ltem footprint across mexico by the end of  monthly plans for ltem devices would start as low as  with discounts for volume or term commitments sequans stated during its q earnings call that it expected its monarch chip to be att certified by the end of june  verizon and att deploying ltem ahead of schedule is as good a sign as you will ever get that the iot is finally going to happen a  more
