and  in the last decade several federal agencies have emphasized the need for developing formal biological inventory and monitoring programs these programs document both historical and current biodiversity and assess the impacts of natural and humaninduced environmental disturbance examples of such programs include the national park service inventory and monitoring program the national water quality assessment nawqa program of the us geological survey the environmental monitoring and assessment program emap of the us environmental protection agency and the national forest inventory and analysis program of the us forest service inventories of flora and fauna associated with literature reviews are typically the first phase of these programs and represent an extensive pointintime effort to determine the spatial distribution of species often based on these inventory data a followup monitoring program is implemented where study sites of special interest are determined and more
