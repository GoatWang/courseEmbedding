we suggest consuming our beers within  months from packaging though our beer is good to last up to  months see below for dates since our beers are not filtered some yeast is still in suspension of the beer when packaged though we do our best to minimize this with a thorough cold condition period you may see that some sediment has formed on the bottom of the bottle this is completely natural we recommend storing armada beers upright and in a fridge at least  hour prior to consumption enjoyyou say s are dead we are here to resurrect themarmadas mission is to bring together community around

man hopes mythical tale of armada’s beers helps build business armada brewing’s john kraszewski contributed photo by luther turmelle new haven register posted   pm edt  updated  weeks  days ago  comments john kraszewski knows the value of a good story telling his story of going from a onetime package store employee with a penchant for home brewing to launching his own craft beer helped the yearold west haven resident win the  first prize last month in a competition among startup brewers kraszewski’s story about how he founded armada brewing and his grassroots approach to building his business allowed him to beat out four other brewers at this year’s startup brewery challenge which was held in new york city on june  now kraszewski’s next goal is find a permanent home for armada brewing which is currently being made at a slightly more established beer maker overshores brewing co in east haven “we want to get our own place because where you drink beer the environment you drink it in affects how that beer tastes” kraszewski said “we want to find someplace that makes drinking our beer a memorable moment” advertisement for now krasewski has to be satisfied building his business one account at a time one beer at a time since launching its first beer at the beginning of the year armada brewing curently services about  accounts he said twothirds of those accouints are in new haven county kraszewski said one of the places selling armada beer is the new england beverage co in orange “we like to support local brews to begin with” said mario and the store’s manager who declined to give his last name “he kraszewski gave us a sample and i think he’s got a good product” it’s not easy getting into the beer business even at a local level said gregg glaser editor of “yankee brew news” and publisher of “modern distillery age” two fairfield countybased trade publications for the adult beverage industry “it takes chutzpah” glaser said “there are lots of new beers being brewed and shelf space is tight distribution is tight too” some of the new beers turning up on store shelves are from “brewers that are super small” glaser said to break out of the clutter in the beer marketplace a fledgling brewer needs do some creative marketing he said “a lot of them rely on clever names or clever images on their bottles and cans” glaser said “a lot of it is aimed at new drinkers who are young and find that attractive older drinkers might not find it as attractive” armada brewing is trying a little creative marketing creating a mythical story line with the names of the brews it has launched thus far the first india pale ale armada produced is called the cursed king subsequent brews armada has launched add to the back story about the mythical king and his adventures since then kraszewski has added the fortune raider the white storm and death to corruption to armada’s list of brews he believes the back story sets armada’s beers apart from rival brews so do the  milliliter bottles that the beer comes in “we hope that with bottles that size it will bring people together to share our beer and spark a conversation” kraszewski said call luther turmelle at
