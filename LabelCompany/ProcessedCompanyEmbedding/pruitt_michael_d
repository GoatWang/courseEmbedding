avalanchejournal skip to main content menu search form searchsearch login  register posted july    pm by don williams aj media jd dickerson michael pruitt close strong to win stampede the final round of a golf tournament is often described as a putting contest   there’s a way to avoid that though hit it close enough to take putting out of the equation — the way jd dickerson and michael pruitt did sunday at lakeridge country club in the last seven holes pruitt and dickerson hit three sparkling approach shots not to mention a chipin to wrap up a fourshot victory in the stampede partnership “it was  percent stressfree golf” dickerson said they sure made it look that way and on the second nine on sunday no less when the nerves are supposed to tighten up dickerson holed a chip at no  and stuck a wedge pin high for birdie on no  then pruitt plopped a soft wedge  feet from the hole on no  and dickerson pitched to about the same distance on no  to close out an under  “mine was  feet on no  his was uh …  inches” pruitt said jokingly pruitt and dickerson finished  holes at under using the sizzling finish to pull away from ben greene and beau burgess who shot  and came in second “we played solid” burgess said “there’s just nothing we can do they played better” on second thought burgess and greene noted there was something they could have done “we played the pars terrible all weekend” burgess said “more than anything i was happy we had a bogeyfree weekend we didn’t have any bogeys we just didn’t make enough birdies” the margin was two strokes after the leaders played holes  through  burgess birdied no  to bring his team back within one and the turning point came right after pruitt twoputted the par no  for birdie while their nearest pursuers playing in the same group couldn’t convert birdie putts at no  dickerson’s approach came up short of the green in the rough — nowhere near his ideal spot behind the hole but his chip hit the flagstick and dropped in that made the lead three and they had more shots in the bag burgess made an footer at the par no  but dickerson countered with an excellent wedge shot a dart to  feet right of the flag and rolled it in “we both played solid” pruitt said “individual round we both would have shot way under par so it was an easy good ride it’s always easy with jd” the victory was dickerson’s fifth stampede title the other four all coming in a fiveyear period from  with junior ashmore as a partner asked if he played the last three days like the old jd he said “it was pretty good for me i’m happy with it” burgess hit it to  inches on the last hole for birdie but he and his partner agreed the tournament got away from them when they gave up two strokes on holes  and  not making birdie on the par nd was especially galling “we did that three or four times this weekend” greene said “we’re right there to make birdie on a par we didn’t do it and we lose by four shots” the stampede at lakeridge country club par  — sunday’s
