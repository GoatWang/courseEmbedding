to llcs limited liability companies llcs are one of the newest types of business entities like corporations they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships whether an llc or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business the best comparison here is between an llc and an s corporation because an llc can choose to be taxed as an s corporation social security taxes the owners of the s corporation can take out some profits without social security taxes for a large business in which the owners take out salaries of  or more plus profits there would not be much difference since the social security tax cuts out at that level as of  however for a smaller business in which an owner could take out a  salary and  profit the extra taxes on the  would be over  raising money if a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the llc liability protection an important advantage of an llc is that in some states a creditor cannot collect the members’ llc distributions with a corporation creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets but can collect the shareholder’s dividends profits losses and taxes the other advantages of llcs are found in certain tax situations for example an llc can make special allocations of profits and losses among members whereas s corporations cannot s corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership in an llc money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis and lower the taxes of the owners whereas in an s corporation it does not contributing property to set up an llc is not taxable even for minority interest owners whereas for a corporation regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business foreign ownership the owners of an llc can be foreign persons other corporations or any kind of trust whereas the owners of s corporations cannot an llc may have an unlimited number of members while an s corporation is limited to one hundred management options llcs are also popular because of their flexible management options allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations llcs have fewer formalities than corporations another advantage for some business owners fringe benefits corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity various retirement stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations plus sole proprietors partners and employees owning more than  of an s corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits such as groupterm

products lawyers articles search term location legal topics business formation llcs  corporations llcs limited liability companies llc basics limited liability companies combine the best parts of partnerships and corporations by beth laurence jd share on google plus share on facebook a limited liability company llc offers protection from personal liability for business debts just like a corporation however unlike a corporation which must pay its own taxes an llc is a passthrough tax entity the profits and losses of the business pass through to its owners who report them on their personal tax returns just as they would if they owned a partnership or sole proprietorship moreover while setting up an llc is more difficult than creating a partnership or sole proprietorship running one is significantly easier than running a corporation here are the main features of an llc limited personal liability like shareholders of a corporation all llc owners are protected from personal liability for business debts and claims this means that if the business itself cant pay a creditor  such as a supplier a lender or a landlord  the creditor cannot legally come after an llc members house car or other personal possessions because only llc assets are used to pay off business debts llc owners stand to lose only the money that theyve invested in the llc this feature is often called limited liability exceptions to limited liability while llc owners enjoy limited personal liability for many of their business transactions this protection is not absolute this drawback is not unique to llcs however  the same exceptions apply to corporations an llc owner can be held personally liable if he or she personally and directly injures someone personally guarantees a bank loan or a business debt on which the llc defaults fails to deposit taxes withheld from employees wages intentionally does something fraudulent illegal or reckless that causes harm to the company or to someone else or treats the llc as an extension of his or her personal affairs rather than as a separate legal entity this last exception is the most important if owners dont treat the llc as a separate business a court might decide that the llc doesnt really exist and find that its owners are really doing business as individuals who are personally liable for their acts to keep this from happening make sure you and your coowners act fairly and legally do not conceal or misrepresent material facts or the state of your finances to vendors creditors or other outsiders fund your llc adequately invest enough cash in the business so that your llc can meet foreseeable expenses and liabilities keep llc and personal business separate get a federal employer identification number open up a businessonly checking account and keep your personal finances out of your llc accounting books create an operating agreement having a formal written operating agreement lends credibility to your llcs separate existence for more on this see nolos article the llc operating agreement for more information on llc limited liability protection and the differences in state laws see  llcs and limited  liability  what protection do you get   additional protection business insurance a good liability insurance policy can shield your personal assets when limited liability protection does not for instance if you are a massage therapist and you accidentally injure a clients back your liability insurance policy should cover you insurance can also protect your personal assets in the event that your limited liability status is ignored by a court in addition to protecting your personal assets in such situations insurance can protect the llcs assets from lawsuits and claims but your llc wont be protected if it doesnt pay its bills commercial insurance usually does not protect personal or corporate assets from unpaid business debts whether or not theyre personally guaranteed for more information on insurance see nolos article obtaining small business insurance llc taxes unlike a corporation an llc is not considered separate from its owners for tax purposes instead it is what the irs calls a passthrough entity like a partnership or sole proprietorship this means that business income passes through the business to the llc members who report their share of profits  or losses  on their individual income tax returns each llc member must make quarterly estimated tax payments to the irs while an llc itself doesnt pay taxes coowned llcs must file form 0 an informational return with the irs each year this form which partnerships also have to file sets out each llc members share of the llcs profits or losses which the irs reviews to make sure llc members are correctly reporting their income for more information on llc taxes see nolos article how llcs are taxed llc management the owners of most small llcs participate equally in the management of their business this arrangement is called member management there is an alternative management structure  somewhat awkwardly called manager management  in which you designate one or more owners or even an outsider to take responsibility for managing the llc the nonmanaging owners sometimes family members who have invested in the company simply sit back and share in llc profits in a managermanaged llc only the named managers get to vote on management decisions and act as agents of the llc choosing manager management sometimes makes sense but it might require you to deal with state and federal laws regulating the sale of securities for more information see nolos limited liability company llc faq forming an llc to create an llc you file articles of organization in some states called a certificate of organization or certificate of formation with the llc division of your state government this office is often in the same department as the corporations division which is usually part of the secretary of states office filing fees range from about  to  now in every state you can  form an llc with just one person many states supply a blank onepage form for the articles of organization on which you need only specify a few basic details about your llc such as its name and address and contact information for a person involved with the llc usually called a registered agent who will receive legal papers on its behalf some states also require you to list the names and addresses of the llc members in addition to filing articles of organization you must create a written llc operating agreement you dont have to file your operating agreement with the state but that doesnt mean you can get by without one the operating agreement is a crucial document because it sets out the llc members rights and responsibilities their percentage interests in the business and their share of the profits to learn more about these and other details involved in setting up an llc read nolos article how to form an llc to form your llc right now use nolos online llc which will collect the required information and file your articles of organization with your state ending an llc under the laws of many states unless your operating agreement says otherwise when one member wants to leave the llc the company dissolves in that case the llc members must fulfill any remaining business obligations pay off all debts divide any assets and profits among themselves and then decide whether they want to start a new llc to continue the business with the remaining members your llc operating agreement can prevent this kind of abrupt ending to your business by including buysell or buyout provisions that set up guidelines for what will happen when one member retires dies becomes disabled or leaves the llc to pursue other interests for more information see nolos article plan ahead for llc ownership changes share on google plus share on facebook talk to a lawyer need help start here

hunt for stealth my typical response is to say “whoever told you that is either i misinformed giving the “nevada law expert” the benefit of the doubt ii an idiot iii intentionally trying to deceive you to sell their nevada ultimate asset protection entity product or iv all of the above a few people also say they want to form their entity in nevada because nevada has the best entity laws of any state andor nevada has the series llc reality vs spin let us look at each of the alleged reasons to form an entity in nevada reason  – save taxes forming an entity in nevada will only allow you to avoid income taxes only if all of the revenue of the entity is derived in nevada or states that do not have an income tax the law of the united states is that if an llc or a corporation formed in state  has a presence in state  that has a state income tax and if the llc or corporation derives income from within state  then state  can tax all income derived within its borders thus a nevada llc or corporation that operates a retail store in arizona must report and pay arizona state income tax on the income derived from the arizona business reason  – hide ownership the california court of appeals in the well known case of associated vendors inc v oakland meat co inc   cal app d   cal rptr 0 listed facts that should be analyzed in determining if an alter ego situation exists and the corporate veil should be pierced and hold the shareholders liable for the debts of the corporation one of the  negative facts the court listed is the “concealment and misrepresentation of the identity of the responsible ownership management and financial interest or concealment of personal business activities” if you hide your ownership of your entity and you end up in court you will have some “splaining” to do to the judge or jury as to the business purpose in hiding the ownership of the company reason  – nevada laws best says who the person who is trying to sell you a nevada entity asset protection attorney jay adkinson says “nevada’s laws are not substantially better than the laws of any other state” randall k edwards an asset protection lawyer and litigator who has been licensed to practice law in nevada since  agrees with jay adkinson that nevada entity law is not better than entity laws of other states randall said “i rarely recommend to any of my clients that they utilize nevada entities unless they have some connection to nevada” that statement is from an attorney licensed in nevada who forms nevada entities see also the 0 state liability systems ranking study prepared by the us chamber institute for legal reform which ranks nevada 0th in a national sample of inhouse general counsel or other senior corporate litigators asked to rate the states in terms of how reasonable and fair their tort liability systems are perceived by us businesses reason  – series llc presumably the series llc works to segregate and limit liability among each series llc if all of the llc’s assets and activities occur in the state of formation the plaintiff is in the state of formation and the lawsuit is filed in the state of formation if however the plaintiff is a tenant injured on property located in california that is owned by a nevada series llc and the lawsuit is in a california court there is a good chance the california court will apply california law and disregard the series feature of the nevada llc there are no appellate court cases that have ruled that the series llc limits liability when the plaintiff and the court are outside the state in which the llc was formed jay adkinson said “the nonseries state is very unlikely to apply the serieslegislation as to creditors claimants and other thirdparties who did not agree to be bound by the series legislation” you may want to be a pioneer and create new appellate law in your state but i do not want my clients to hope the series llc will work when for a relatively small cost they can form an additional llc to hold assets nevada entities are on the national radar scope a february  0 story in usa today entitled “corporate owners hide assets identities” says “a multiagency us money laundering threat assessment issued in 0 cited nevada wyoming and delaware as the states with laws most conducive to anonymous corporate ownership” “usa today’s findings buttressed the money laundering report’s warning that a “race to the bottom” among states vying to set minimal corporate information requirements has enabled companies to hide the identities of their owners thereby making it harder for law enforcement agencies to track suspected tax evasion money laundering and other crimes” “concern about camouflaged corporate ownership prompted the irs to list the tactic this week in its 0 “dirty dozen” tax scams the irs said anonymous entities are facilitating “underreporting of income nonfiling of tax returns    money laundering financial crimes and possibly terrorist financing” a february  0 story entitled “forgery alleged in fraud probe” states “‘federal law enforcement officials are concerned that criminals are increasingly using us ‘shell’ companies … to conceal identities and illicit activities’ a us government accountability office report stated in late 0” the story tells how attorney michael l potter’s name was forged on a contract for centurion asset management or cam a company involved with dennis bolze cam is alleged to have defrauded investors of more than  million potter said his name likely came to dennis bolze’s attention when he was general counsel for cam’s incorporator nevada corporate services nevada’s largest incorporation service see also “nevada a scam haven” an april  0 story in the las vegas sun newspaper irs targets nevada entities on november  0 k steven burgess director examination small businessself employed division irs testified before the senate committee on homeland security  governmental affairs permanent subcommittee on investigations hearing his topic was on company formations in states that encourage owner secrecy the following key statements in director burgess’ testimony should make everybody carefully consider whether they want to risk forming an entity in nevada the irs has authorized several investigations under section  of the internal revenue code irc into promoters of nevada corporations and resident agents an initial sampling of the client lists showed that anywhere from 0 to  percent of those listed are currently or have been previously noncompliant with federal tax laws we are contemplating mass audits of nonfilers that would produce a list of nonfiler and noncompliant participants we are also looking at additional promoter investigations the service will consider “john doe summonses” to resident agents srobert lambert a nationally known asset protection expert recently told me that a friend of his in the us department of justice told him that the doj was investigating entities formed in nevada see mr lambert’s website called asset protection corporation it is an excellent asset protection information resource entity formation fundamental concept number  if you want to form an entity to operate a business or own investments the first question you should ask is in what state should i form the entity most of the time the answer to that question is in the state where the entity’s activities will occur for example a person who wants to form an entity to operate a widget sales business in arizona should form the entity in arizona unless there is some overriding reason to form in another state which rarely exists by the way if your entity will be doing business in more than one state you should compare the legal attributes of the entity in each state and form the entity in the state that has the best entity law unless there are good reasons to form in a different state entity formation fundamental concept number  is form your entity in the state where it will be located or in which it will engage in business unless there are one or more good reasons to form in another state for the reason i discuss below you should note that whether the state has or does not have a state income tax is not a consideration in determining if you should form an entity in the state entity formation fundamental concept number  the second question you must ask when you are forming a new entity is what type of entity should i form most of the time the answer to that question is a limited liability company entity formation fundamental concept number  is form a limited liability company unless there is a compelling reason to form a different type of entity nevada entities  applicable adages when people ask me about forming a nevada limited liability company or corporation i immediately think of the following trite but applicable proverbs a little knowledge is a dangerous thing it sounds too good to be true all that glitters is not gold a fool and his money are soon parted there’s no such thing as a free lunch look before you leap there are none so blind as those who refuse to see fools rush in where angels fear to tread a sucker is born every minute if at this point you have gotten the impression that i am not a fan of forming a limited liability company or a corporation in nevada unless the entity will do business in nevada you would be correct asset protection resources randall k edwards randall k edwards is another nationally known asset protection lawyer who also has a great website his website contains a lot of informative articles on asset protection including what about nevada the asset protection scams never end how to avoid an asset protection disaster – a few tips randall k edwards on forming entities in nevada “i’ve been practicing law in nevada since     at present i rarely recommend to any of my clients that they utilize nevada entities unless they have some connection to nevada other than a perception that they will have better privacy or some tax advantage regardless of the purported advantages for corporations provided in the nevada revised statutes and i would disagree that they are really any more advantageous than the laws of any other state if the laws of that other state are utilized correctly i believe that the burden is on the owner of a nevada corporation to justify using a nevada entity given the current political and legal climate unfortunately for a nonnevadan having a nevada corporation is more and more seen as a per se attempt to defraud a creditor unless there exists some easily identifiable reason for using an entity from nevada as opposed to an entity from that person’s home state” “when it comes to seeking and taking advice about the efficacy of nevada legal entities i believe that the consumer should rely on someone other than a promoter of nevada companies who makes his living setting up and maintaining nevada entities all of the huff and puff of such promoters about nevada’s strong ranking for asset protection by whom one might ask is usually just hustle there may be some advantages to using a nevada company under certain circumstances nevada resident actual operations in nevada nevada manufacturing or nevada warehousing but relentlessly pushing nevada corporations or llcs on the public simply on the basis of some perceived “nevada advantage” is simply unjustifiable i am amazed at the number of people who continue to push the same old scam regarding nevada corporations using the same tactics the same sales pitch and the same strategies that sunk apg folks it doesn’t work it can’t work it’s crap don’t fall for it” “of course as i’ve said    any asset protection strategy that relies on ‘hide the ball’ privacy nominee officers and directors blind bank accounts and worst of all socalled “bearer shares” is doomed from the outset the only meaningful way to protect one’s assets is going to be based on a combination of factors and strategies that are legally and logically defensible right now i’d say that nevada entities are under a microscope some might argue a proctoscope and their use will be automatically suspect where debtors are challenged that’s the simple fact right or wrong the usa today article is only the tip of the iceberg in this regard” “for most entities the choice of jurisdiction is not as crucial as the bylaws for a corporation or the operating agreement for a llc and while some simple governance matters for these defining documents may be spit out from a basic template it really takes an expert to fashion the nuances and details to optimize both tax and asset protections for any particular business entity this should usually be done by an experienced lawyer accountant or financial planner or better yet a combination of these advisers — not a promoter whose “asset protection packet” or “corporate packet” or whatever it is they are hawking looks the same regardless of who the client is or what their particular needs are” “you might want to check out the state liability systems ranking report for 0    after considering not only the statutes but also a state’s case law and the general ‘liability friendliness’ tenor of the legislature’s approach to corporate and personal liability issues the ranking analyzes all 0 states it finds the best as delaware interestingly nevada which ranks th is in the “worst” category yeah that’s right there are  states ranked better than nevada that coupled with the increased scrutiny that nevada entities are undergoing right now should give one pause about whether nevada’s really the best way to go unless you happen to be a nevada resident have important nevada contacts or have your business either headquartered in or engaging in operations in nevada” robert lambert robert lambert’s website says that it is the “internet’s leading resource for current up to the minute information on asset protection the purpose of this web site is to provide you with an introduction to asset protection and attempt to answer all your questions we will also debunk many of the myths and provide you with valuable data to protect yourself from scammers” here are three articles by robert that relate to forming entities in nevada jay adkinson jay adkinson is a nationally known asset protection attorney and prolific writer and speaker about asset protection law mr adkinson is the creator of quatlooscom one of the first internet websites to educate the public about financial scams and tax frauds his website at wwwassetprotectionbookcom is one of the best asset protection websites on the internet in addition to general discussions on various asset protection topics the website contains in depth analysis of asset protection in all fifty states see more on this topic in an article called false and misleading claims regarding nevada corporations jay adkinson on forming entities in nevada “i don’t have anything against nevada and in fact i like some features of their laws but it’s reputation is getting really bad in a given case the difference between somebody having a nevada corporation and a and i pick this state randomly kansas corporation might make the difference in a judge deciding that the arrangement was a sham because of this nevada is now probably the one state that you don’t want to use for asset protection planning” “imho a person is x better having a properly organized entity with good operating documents in their home state than they are attempting to “import” an entity and its laws from another state” “the “best” state for forming an entity is  the state you are resident in have assets in or are doing business in attempting to “import” law from another state is generally more of a forlorn hope than a strategy” written by richard keyt on january  0 share thisprintfacebookgoogletwitterlinkedin see our  five star reviewscommon llc mistakes buy a new llc now  silver   gold llc  articles of

llc what is an llc do i need to know about securities laws to set up an llc if youll be the sole owner of your llc and you dont plan to take investments from outsiders your ownership interest in the llc will not be considered a security and you dont have to concern yourself with these lawsfor coowned llcs however the answer to this question is not so clear a security is an investment in a profitmaking enterprise that is not run by the investor if a person invests in a business with the expectation of making money from the efforts of others that persons investment is generally considered a security under federal and state law conversely when a person will rely on his or her own efforts to make a profit that is he or she will be an active owner of an llc that persons ownership interest in the company will not usually be treated as a securityhow does this apply to you generally if all of the owners will actively manage the llc  which is typical in most small startup llcs  the llc ownership interests will not be considered securities but if one or more of your coowners will not work for the company or play an active role in managing the company  as may be true for llcs that accept investments from friends and family or that are run by a special management group  your llcs ownership interests may be treated as securities by your state and by the federal securities and exchange commission secif your ownership interests are considered securities you must qualify for an exemption from the state and federal securities laws before the initial owners of your llc invest their money if you dont fall within an exemption to the securities laws you must register the sale of your llcs ownership interests with the sec and your statefortunately smaller llcs even those that plan to sell memberships to passive investors usually qualify for securities law exemptions for example sec rules exempt the private sale of securities if all owners reside in one state and all sales are made within the state this is called the intrastate offering exemption another federal exemption covers private offerings a private offering is an unadvertised sale that is limited to a small number of people  or fewer or to those who because of their net worth or income earning capacity can reasonably be expected to be able to take care of themselves in the investment process most states have enacted their own versions of these popular federal exemptionsfor more information about sec exemptions visit the sec website at wwwsecgov a quick way to research your states exemption rules is to go to the home page of your states securities agency which typically posts the states exemptions rules and procedures to find your state securities agency go to your secretary of

like owners of a corporation however all llc owners are protected from personal liability for business debts and claims  a feature known as limited liability this means that if the business owes money

the 0misc used to report royalties rental income and other payments the 0div for capital gains and dividend distributions and the 0s for real estate transactions issuing requirements the irs requires that you issue 0s to any independent contractor who provided at least 0 worth of services to your business many businesses are unsure of the requirements for issuing 0s to limited liability companies the answer depends on how the llc is treated by the irs for federal tax purposes a limited liability company may elect to be taxed as a sole proprietorship or type d or disregarded entity a partnership or type p or a corporation type c sole proprietorships and partnerships if your payee is an llc that is taxed as a sole proprietorship you must issue the 0 with certain information needed by the irs this includes the name of the sole proprietor the name of the llc and the social security number of the sole proprietor which serves him as the tax identification number if the llc is taxed as a partnership then the 0 must carry the name of the business as well as its employer identification number or ein corporations you do not need to issue the 0 to an llc that is classified as a corporation for federal tax purposes corporations have strict irs guidelines and different forms for reporting income that replace the use of a 0 you may issue the 0 to a corporation if you wish but the purpose would only be to simplify your own recordkeeping you also do not need to issue a 0 to any llc structure when you pay transaction costs for merchandise including the item cost postage

wyoming llc home  articles  how limited is limited liability how limited is limited liability one of the key advantages of a limited liability company llc over a sole proprietorship or general partnership is the fact that the owners members of the llc are not personally liable for the debts and claims of the business normally that means that if the business is unable to pay a supplier lender landlord or other creditor that person cannot go after the personal assets of the members of the llc the members may lose their entire investment in the business but their other assets  car home and personal bank accounts  are safe from the creditors of the business or are they in truth there are many exceptions to the rule of limited liability many llc members will find that due to the way the business was operated the promised protection from the liabilities and claims of the business is not meaningful how personal liability arises a member of an llc can be held personally liable for many different types of claims but they typically arise under four different scenarios claims arising out of an act or omission by the member such as the members own negligence fraud or illegal act claims arising out of a contract particularly one that was personally guaranteed by the member claims based on the concept of piercing the veil of the llc liability for consenting to or receiving a distribution in violation of the llcs operating agreement or the applicable llc statute these claims are not a result of choosing an llc as a form of entity all of these exceptions apply equally to shareholders in corporations and in fact the exceptions were developed first under corporate law actions of a member every member who actively participates in the business of the llc runs the risk that his action or inaction will result in personal liability this is particularly a risk of a service business in which the members provide the key service if you are an electrician and you leave an exposed wire that electrocutes someone your llc is not going to protect you similarly if you make promises about your product or service that are not true the first claim may be against the llc for breach of contract but if the llc cannot perform or pay damages the injured party may come after you for fraud or a similar claim based upon your own action even if you have an employee who committed the action you may not be out of the woods if you personally hired the employee the injured party may have a claim against you for negligent hiring if a reasonable person would not have hired that employee a special category of personal liability that may trip up a member of an llc is failure to pay payroll taxes to the irs to protect these socalled trust fund taxes any person who had the ability to prevent the nonpayment can be personally liable for the failure to pay these taxes the irs applies this provision broadly so if you had power to direct which bills got paid and which didnt you are probably liable claims based on contract another and probably more common source of personal liability for many small business owners is the voluntary assumption of liability usually by means of a personal guarantee for many small businesses particularly new businesses with no credit history obtaining a loan without a personal guarantee is virtually impossible landlords too often insist on a personal guarantee particularly if the lease requires the landlord to incur costs such as buildouts that it expects to recoup over the term of the lease suppliers are sometimes more flexible on extending credit especially after the business is up and running getting payment terms out of the gate however often requires a personal guarantee even when the creditor isnt seeking a personal guarantee a member of the llc can inadvertently become a party to the contract by failing to clearly note his role if she signs her own name and does not indicate that she is executing the contract on behalf of the llc it is very likely that a court will hold her responsible for the contract every contract should clearly indicate that the party to the contract is the llc full name and should indicate the role of the person who is signing member or manager piercing the veil of the llc even if a member avoids personal guarantees he may find himself liable to creditors of the business under a theory developed under corporate law and known as piercing the corporate veil although the factors that courts look at vary to some extent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction the courts typically look at whether there is a unity of interest and ownership such that the separate personalities of the entity and the owner no longer exists and whether to respect the distinction between the owner and the entity would be an injustice in almost all cases of piercing the veil there is either commingling or diversion of assets some other facts that courts examine in corporate cases include inadequate capitalization failure to issue stock failure to observe corporate formalities nonpayment of dividends insolvency of the debtor corporation at the time nonfunctioning of other officers or directors absence of corporate records commingling of funds diversion of assets failure to maintain arms length relationships among related entities whether the corporation is a mere facade for the operation of the dominant shareholders a possible benefit of an llc over a corporation is that several of the commonly listed factors failure to issue stock failure to observe corporate formalities and absence of corporate records have no real counterparts in an llc however as case law develops the absence of those factors may simply shift emphasis on some of the other factors distributions in violation of law or agreement llc acts typically prohibit an llc from making certain distributions for example the final draft of the revised uniform limited liability company act provides that a limited liability company may not make a distribution if after the distribution  the company would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the ordinary course of the limited liability company�s activities or  the company�s total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed if the company were to be dissolved wound up and terminated at the time of the distribution to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution winding up and termination of members whose preferential rights are superior to those of persons receiving the distribution a member of a membermanaged limited liability company or manager of a managermanaged limited liability company who consents to an improper distribution is personally liable to the company for the amount of the distribution which is improper distributions in addition a person who receives a distribution knowing that it is in violation of the act is typically personally liable for the portion of the distribution that is improper is limited liability an illusion although it may seem that the exceptions swallow the rule the llc offers excellent protection from many types of liabilities for example if you properly hire and train an employee who then commits an act of negligence or fraud the llc should shield you from personal liability if you sell a product that without your knowledge or fault is defective you should not have personal liability trade creditors who deal with the llc without a personal guarantee should have no right to look to you for payment shoring up limited liability there are several things that you can do to strengthen the protection of limited liability within the llc business insurance carrying adequate business insurance wont change the fact that you are personally liable for your own negligence but it can help by providing a source for payment you might also consider a personal umbrella policy avoid personal guarantees not all personal guarantees can be avoided but do not automatically consent to every guarantee in many cases landlords or vendors routinely request personal guarantees even where the facts do not dictate that one be provided learn to question the request capitalize the business adequately provide adequate capital for the entitys intended purposes and document the capital infusion keep the llc separate from your personal business no matter how small the business is it should have its own bank account dont pay personal expenses from the business account instead write yourself a check called a draw on the llc account and deposit it in your account from which you pay expenses likewise dont use personal checks to pay llc bills if the llc needs funds make a capital contribution or loan and account for everything act ethically dont attempt to mislead the llcs creditors about the financial condition of the business do not divert assets if the business looks like it is going down dont attempt to lessen your own loss by taking big draws or moving assets out of the llc that will only help open the floodgates to your personal assets if you act responsibly and take a few precautions the limited liability of the llc

to llcs limited liability companies llcs are one of the newest types of business entities like corporations they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships whether an llc or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business the best comparison here is between an llc and an s corporation because an llc can choose to be taxed as an s corporation
