approach approach our approach business focused investing we invest in public securities with much the same approach a buyer would use if purchasing a partial interest in a private company we do not look for shortterm trading opportunities or mediocre companies that we can flip in a quarter or a year – we seek to own high quality modestly valued businesses over a period of many years so that we can profit from the growth in their intrinsic value as they expand and grow their earnings over time longterm orientation we take a longterm view in our business analysis and investing we approach each investment with the expectation that we will own it for five years or longer we believe that this provides an advantage in a shortterm oriented market – we often find buying opportunities when shortterm yet resolvable business problems create selling pressure from investors lacking the patience or perspective to see through temporary uncertainty concentration  convictionweightings we believe that it is rare to find a high quality business trading at a discount price so when we find such an opportunity we like to make it a meaningful part of the portfolio typically we hold  to  stocks with  to  of assets in the top ten positions at this portfolio size we can concentrate our investments in our best ideas and still have holdings spread across a variety of industries independent research a stock price generally reflects the investment community’s consensus thinking about a business and its future prospects to produce superior investment results we need to recognize when consensus thinking about a stock is wrong and capitalize on that opportunity our concentrated low turnover investment approach allows us to put more research time into each idea enabling thorough independent fundamental research that we believe is important to uncovering such marketplace mispricings risk management as longterm investors we are focused on the risk of “permanent capital loss” – the potential that an investment is worth less five years from now than it is worth today – rather than shortterm price volatility or benchmark tracking error we view fundamental business risk – new competition technological change financial leverage poor capital allocation etc – and excessive valuation as the key sources of this risk so we focus our efforts on
