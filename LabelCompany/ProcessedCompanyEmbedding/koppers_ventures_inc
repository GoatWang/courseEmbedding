classified  gum  wood chemicals  coal mining services  carbon  graphite products  railroad equipment company perspectives koppers industries is a diversified companyheavily based in metallurgical coke manufacturing coal tar processing and wood preserving technologyorganized to supply the key chemicals and materials required for successful manufacturing processing and construction company history although koppers industries inc began as a manufacturer of byproduct recovery coke ovens in  its circuitous route through a number of acquisitions and diversified products classifies it as an early predecessor to a modernday conglomerate from its long association with the mellon family interests in pittsburghs heavy industry to its forays into chemicals plastics wood products road building and even buttons the company struggled to secure an identity in the face of cyclical markets and dependence on capital goods spending while the impressive returns earned during the s expansion into chemicals were interrupted by a depressed market in the s koppers underwent several incarnations before becoming the pared down company of the late s from a successful stint in road building paving and repairs to its present status as a leading supplier of carbonbased materials and treated wood products as well as coke productsits initial foray into manufacturingkoppers has come full circle with a strong identity and a firm bottom line starting off with a bang s to  in the s an entrepreneur from virginia purchased a small coke oven company in an attempt to build a consortium of companies to integrate all aspects of coal production henry b rust then solicited support from andrew mellon one of the nations leading financiers and industrialists and was soon operating a vast network of holding companies engaged in mining railroad transportation shipping utilities and steel mills rusts conglomerate named kopper united successfully exploited all the potential uses of coal and subsequently became the favorite of mellons industry operations their empire however was shortlived the depression came and with it roosevelts public utility holding company act which forced the company to sell eastern gas  fuel associates by losing this divisionwhich directed the coal utility and railroad operationsthe company relinquished control of its integrated coal orientation of the remaining former empire the manufacturing and engineering divisions evolved into koppers inc the traditional business of manufacturing byproduct coke ovens and products related to coal such as tar became once again koppers major source of income yet sensing the company had lost its direction the koppers board of directors with the mellon family representing a major presence appointed brehon burke somervell a world war ii fourstar general to assume control of the operations as chief executive officer somervell proposed that the company follow a delineated course of action by imposing a strict military hierarchy minutiae of detail demarcating job responsibilities limits of authority and centralized powers were codified in books while many found this method of leadership incompatible with the industry somervells plan was to create an environment conducive to generating new technologies the generals tenure at koppers was shortened by illness upon his death in  he had only directed the company for five years postwar change late s to  although the rigid organizational structure was abandoned after somervells death the world war ii veteran had successfully launched a campaign into the new areas of chemicals and plastics fred foy a company executive who had served under the general during the war assumed somervells position and continued his predecessors program of diversification before joining koppers foy worked as vicepresident at j walter thompson and also worked at ford by  sales gained from the companys plastic operations heralded a long awaited revitalization of the almost yearold company unfortunately intense competition from large companies in petroleum caused a volatile price war after this price war ended koppers reported low profit figures the results from the plastic campaign did not represent koppers only disappointment the old product line also suffered from poor performance figures shares earning  in  now earned a little more than half that to prevent any further profit decrease foy along with his energetic young president fletcher l byron held a policy planning meeting together the two executives decided on strict measures to reduce costs and consolidate businesses nineteen plants producing low profits were closed and the engineering and construction division which built plants for the steel and iron industries acquired a general contracting firm this subsidiary purchased for  million released the division from sole dependence on the cyclical steel industry by encouraging business in other fields by  the first ninemonth earnings figures posted a healthy  percent increase while much of these encouraging numbers resulted from sales in the engineering and construction division closer inspection revealed that a backlog of orders carried over from the previous year had artificially increased the new years figures the entry into the chemicals field initiated under general somervell remained a disappointment while some  percent of the  million in sales could be traced to chemicals koppers profits remained far behind competing chemical companies this discrepancy resulted from the companys dependence on oldline products at the expense of new technologies while competitors manufactured innovative plastics such as styrene polystyrene and polyethylene koppers produced ageold products such as roofing pitch and roadpaving items a major integration of plastics operations had not occurred until the mids well behind the industrywide movement to remedy this situation foy announced plans to market an innovative plastic building panel and double capacity projections for polystyrene production by bolstering the chemical operations through the sale of new plastics as well as attempting to provide an entry for old products into new markets foy hoped to mitigate the effects of chronic fluctuations in the market for engineering and construction products working alongside foy in this major revision of company operations was the indefatigable byron the company president had joined koppers as an assistant to a division manager soon after world war ii and in the following  years he assumed eight different positions of increasing responsibility the son of a coal buyer at the american steel  wire company byron decided at an early age that his career was in the steel industry after college he joined the same company that employed his father and began working as a sales trainee during world war ii bryon took a leave from the company to work as a coordinator for a research project at the naval ordnance laboratory in washington after participating in the conceptualization of surfacetoair missiles byron decided at the end of the war to return to the steel company when american steel responded with only lukewarm enthusiasm byron applied for a job at koppers in three years he was promoted to plant superintendent after helping negotiate a compromise to a strike at a west virginia plant in a daring act of independence byron spent  to replace aging equipment without the authority of his supervisor when the replacement equipment upgraded plant productivity so that in just over a year profits jumped from negative figures to  million byrons grateful superiors forgave him his impetuosity the company then sent the young executive to a management training program at the harvard business school where he was exposed for the first time to an intellectual environment full of different ideas and philosophies this exposure eventually led to the implementation of a highly decentralized yet intellectually demanding approach to business that would characterize byrons tenure at koppers in  foy retaining titles of both chairman and ceo promoted byron to president this promotion came after initially rejecting the candidate as too young four years later the byronfoy team had successfully molded a company whose revenues surpassed the  billion mark by identifying expandable markets koppers began producing piston rings for highspeed diesel engines which accounted for over  percent of net income in one year similarly koppers ranked fifth among domestic producers of polyester resins and ranked high among those producing phthalic anhydride one particularly successful branch of koppers polyester resin business was the manufacture of buttons growth and decline  koppers foray into plastic building panels proved less successful because marketing of the unusual product demanded timeconsuming and expensive planning similarly an attempted partnership to produce polyethylene from koppers plastic division using ethylene manufactured by the sinclair oil company also failed to generate hoped for profits despite an impressive beginning the joint venture fell victim to intensive competition from other oil companies this failed venture ended koppers participation in the thermoplastic and petrochemical markets notwithstanding these disappointments koppers overall performance in the s caused common stock shares to triple in value as management announced a twoforone split by  earnings reached a high of  a share to encourage growth byron guided koppers into several high technology projects purchasing  percent of genex corporation a recombinantdna research company byrons strategy suggested many benefits for koppers organic chemical production it was hoped that the research would discover the process to genetically engineer resorcinol a product previously manufactured by a traditional method additional plans were underway to explore synfuel processes such as coal gasification by  however company equity dropped from  percent to  percent a depressed market started by a recession once again had adverse effects on company performance apart from the cyclical nature of the market industry observers began blaming internal structural problems for koppers ailing profit margins while byrons decentralized policy of encouraging middle managers to assume greater responsibility in decisionmaking actually allowed for a certain number of mistakes the costs of these mistakes started to reflect on productivity miscalculations and faulty equipment forced writeoffs and reduced profit margins while byron promised better returns once an assured turn in the economy revived capital spending he continued to pursue his unorthodox policy of management this policy promoted the delegation of authority to such a degree that much of byrons time was actually spent outside the area of daily decisionmaking by giving priority to the intellectual and civic responsibilities believed to be incumbent upon himself as a business leader byron functioned more as a spiritual guide than an actual company director not only did he traverse the country on a lecture circuit to prominent universities and businesses he also conducted trimonthly seminars for his own young executives to examine the philosophies of such thinkers as john kenneth galbraith john maddox and michael harrington by  profits dropped  million to a total of  million instead of patiently waiting for the recession to end management announced an effort to reduce capital outlays and sell unprofitable businesses selling up to  percent of poorly performing operations in all four of the major divisions as well as allotting just  million for capital spending koppers management hoped to find immediate relief for the companys disappointed shareholders high technology research remained a protected project as maturing operations in the wood and forest division were terminated the ascension of charles r pullin to the positions of chairman and ceo gave further impetus to this consolidation effort new leadership new goals  a former president of koppers road material group pullin unlike his predecessor thoroughly immersed himself in daytoday operations the new company leader had grown up in west virginia as the son of a steel worker a high school summer job with the state highway department directed his ambitions toward the road building industry from the time he joined koppers in  as a technical service engineer to his final promotion to top management pullin was employed in the road building industry although some of that time was spent at another construction company he returned to koppers when the new road materials division needed an experienced leader while pullin continued to invest money in high technology research koppers most impressive results emerged from the division closest to pullins experience namely road building two new ventures in innovative production increased research spending to  million in  these projects included the exploration of engine technology and the development of plant disease diagnostic equipment koppers recovery however did not result from revenues generated from these new technologies rather it was traditional blacktop roadway production that symbolized the beginning of the companys revitalization during the first six months of  the road building division generated  million of the  million in total revenues by developing an integrated operation independent of subcontractors koppers emerged as the first nationwide paving company furthermore the fivecentagallon fuel tax included in the surface transportation act allocated funds for the rehabilitation of the nations highways koppers moved to capitalize on this growing market when road building emerged as the mainstay of company profits pullin reduced koppers investment in technological research the  percent stake in genex failed to produce the sought after financial rewards as a result it was sold along with several other mature businesses some  million in assets were generated from the sale of the coke ovens button and several wood product operations this housecleaning included the sale of koppers original steel industry construction business a hard decision for many of koppers executives in addition pullin slashed capital spending by reducing koppers workforce thus as nationwide spending for bridge and road construction increased  percent between  and  koppers successfully exploited the market trend the price of common
