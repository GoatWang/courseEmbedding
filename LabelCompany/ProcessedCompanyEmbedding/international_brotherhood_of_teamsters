cornelius shea first general president of the teamsters circa  the american federation of labor afl had helped form local unions of teamsters since  in november  the afl organized the team drivers international union tdiu in  a group of teamsters in chicago illinois broke from the tdiu and formed the teamsters national union unlike the tdiu which permitted large employers to be members the new teamsters national union permitted only employees teamster helpers and owneroperators owning only a single team to join and advocated higher wages and shorter hours more aggressively than the tdiu claiming more than  members in  locals its president albert young applied for membership in the afl the afl asked the tdiu to merge with youngs union to form a new aflaffiliated union and the two groups did so in  forming the international brotherhood of teamsters ibt and electing cornelius shea as the new unions first president the election process proved tumultuous shea effectively controlled the convention because the chicago locals—representing nearly half the ibts membership—supported for his candidacy en bloc shea was opposed by john sheridan president of the ice drivers union of chicago sheridan and george innes president of the tdiu accused shea of embezzlement in an attempt to prevent his election shea won the election on august   by a vote of  to  the new grouping elected edward l turley of chicago as secretarytreasurer and albert young as general organizer the union like most unions within the american federation of labor afl at the time had a largely decentralized structure with a number of local unions that governed themselves autonomously and tended to look only after their own interests in the geographical jurisdiction in which they operated the teamsters were vitally important to the labor movement for a strike or sympathy strike by the teamsters could paralyze the movement of goods throughout a city and bring a strike into nearly every neighborhood it also meant that teamsters leaders were able to demand bribes in order to avoid strikes and control of a teamsters local could bring organized crime significant revenues during sheas presidency the entire teamsters union was notoriously corrupt noted labor historian john r commons famously concluded that during this time the teamsters were less a union and more a criminal organization informal portrait of left to right cornelius p shea john miller fred mader and tim murphy sitting in a row in a courtroom in chicago illinois during a labor trial murphy was a politician union organizer and reputed gangster and he was murdered in  several major strikes occupied the union in its first three years in november  teamsters employed by the chicago city railway went out on strike shea attempted to stop sympathy strikes by other teamster locals but three locals walked out and eventually disaffiliated over the sympathystrike issue a sympathy strike in support of  striking meat cutters in chicago in july  led to riots before the extensive use of strikebreakers led shea to force his members back to work leading to the collapse of the meat cutters strike in the midst of the strife in  the teamsters convention in cincinnati ohio reelected shea by acclamation on august   under his leadership the union had expanded to nearly  members in  locals in  cities making the teamsters one of the largest unions in the united states in   teamsters struck in support of lockedout tailors at montgomery ward and eventually more than  teamsters manned the picket lines but when local newspapers discovered that shea was living in a local brothel kept a yearold waitress as a mistress and had spent the strike hosting parties public support for the strike collapsed and the strike ended on august   despite the revelations shea won reelection on august   by a vote of  to  shea was reelected again in  and  although significant challenges to his presidency occurred each time sheas first trial on charges stemming from the  montgomery ward strike ended in a mistrial however during the  reelection shea had promised that he would resign the presidency once his trial had ended but he did not and most union members withdrew their support for him daniel j tobin of boston was elected sheas successor by a vote of  to  in august  historic references to early freight transportation in the us refer to teamsters as those who drove teams of horses pulling huge wagons organizing and growth during the great depressionedit tobin was president of the teamsters from  to  although he faced opposition in his reelection races in   and  he never faced opposition again until his retirement in  the teamsters began to expand dramatically and mature organizationally under tobin he pushed for the development of joint councils to which all local unions were forced to affiliate varying in geographical and industrial jurisdiction the joint councils became important incubators for upandcoming leadership and negotiating master agreements which covered all employers in a given industry tobin also actively discouraged strikes in order to bring discipline to the union and encourage employers to sign contracts and founded and edited the union magazine the international teamster under tobin the teamsters also first developed the regional conference system developed by dave beck in seattle which provided stability organizing strength and leadership to the international union tobin undertook long jurisdictional battles with many unions during this period fierce disputes occurred between the teamsters and the gasoline state operators national council an afl federal union of gas station attendants the international longshoremens association the retail clerks international union and the brotherhood of railway clerks the most significant disagreement however was with the united brewery workers over the right to represent beer wagon drivers while the teamsters lost this battle in  when the afl awarded jurisdiction to the brewers they won when the issue came before the afl executive board again in  when the brewers were still recovering from their nearelimination during prohibition the raids and new member organizing in the s led to significant membership increases teamster membership stood at just  in  tobin took advantage of the wave of prounion sentiment engendered by the passage of the national industrial recovery act and by  union membership had increased nearly  percent to  by  tobin had a duespaying membership of —making the teamsters the fastestgrowing labor union in the united states one of the most significant events in union history occurred in  a group of radicals in local  in minneapolis—led by farrell dobbs carl skoglund and the dunne brothers ray miles and grant all members of the trotskyist communist league of america—began successfully organizing coal truck drivers in the winter of  tobin an ardent anticommunist opposed their efforts and refused to support their  strike local  struck again in  leading to several riots over a nineday period in may when the employers association reneged on the agreement local  resumed the strike although it ended again after nine days when martial law was declared by governor floyd b olson although local  won a contract recognizing the union and which broke the back of the antiunion citizens alliance in minneapolis tobin expelled local  from the teamsters member outrage was extensive and in august  he was forced to recharter the local as  within a year the newly formed local  had organized  truckers in the midwest and formed the central conference of teamsters extensive organizing also occurred in the west harry bridges radical leader of the international longshoremens and warehousemens union ilwu was leading the march inland—an attempt to organize warehouse workers away from shipping ports alarmed by bridges radical politics and worried that the ilwu would encroach on teamster jurisdictions dave beck formed a large regional organization the western conference of teamsters to engage in fierce organizing battles and membership raids against the ilwu which led to the establishment of many new locals and the organization of tens of thousands of new members but corruption became even more widespread in the teamsters during the tobin administration by  the union was considered the most corrupt in the united states and the most abusive towards its own members tobin vigorously defended the union against such accusations but also instituted many constitutional and organizational changes and practices which made it easier for union officials to engage in criminal offenses world war ii and the postwar periodedit by the beginning of world war ii the teamsters was one of the most powerful unions in the country and teamster leaders influential in the corridors of power union membership had risen more than  percent between  and  to  in june  president franklin roosevelt appointed ibt president daniel j tobin to be the official white house liaison to organized labor and later that year chair of the labor division of the democratic national committee in  president roosevelt appointed tobin special representative to the united kingdom and charged him with investigating the state of the labor movement there tobin was considered three times for secretary of labor and twice refused the post—in  and  on september   roosevelt gave his famous fala speech while campaigning in the  presidential election because of roosevelts strong relationship with tobin and the unions large membership the president delivered his speech before the teamster convention nonetheless teamsters members were restive dissident members of the union accused the leadership of suppressing democracy in the union a charge president tobin angrily denied over the next year tobin cracked down on dissidents and trusted several large locals led by his political opponents during world war ii the teamsters strongly endorsed the american labor movements nostrike pledge the teamsters agreed to cease raiding other unions and not strike for the duration of the national emergency president tobin even ordered teamsters members to cross picket lines put up by other unions nevertheless the national leadership sanctioned strikes by midwestern truckers in august  southern truckers in october  and brewery workers and milk delivery drivers in january  the teamsters did not however participate in the great postwar wave of labor strikes in the two years following the cessation of hostilities the teamsters struck only three times  truckers in new jersey struck for two weeks workers at ups struck nationwide for three weeks and workers at railway express agency struck for almost a month teamsters leaders strongly opposed enactment of the tafthartley act and repeatedly called for its repeal president tobin however was one of the first labor leaders to sign the noncommunist affidavit required by the law the great wave of organizing which the union engaged in during the great depression and the war significantly boosted the political power of a number of regional teamsters leaders and the leadership of the union engaged in a number of power struggles in the postwar period by  the unions membership had topped one million dave beck elected an international vicepresident in  was increasingly influential in the international union and tobin attempted to check his growing power but failed in  beck successfully overcame tobins opposition and won approval of an amendment to the unions constitution creating the post of executive vicepresident beck then won the  election to fill the position beck also successfully opposed in  a tobinbacked dues increase to fund new organizing the following year beck was able to demand the ouster of the editor of international teamster magazine and install his own man in the job in  beck allied with his longtime rival jimmy hoffa and effectively seized control of the union he announced a raid on the international association of machinists local at boeing although president dan tobin publicly repudiated becks actions beck had more than enough support from hoffa and other members of the executive board to force tobin to back down five months later beck won approval of a plan to dissolve the unions four divisions and replace them with  divisions organized around each of the major job categories in the unions membership in  tom hickey reformist leader of the teamsters in new york city won election to the teamsters executive board tobin needed becks support to prevent hickeys election and beck refused to give it on september   tobin announced he would step down as president of the teamsters at the end of his term at the unions  convention beck was elected general president and pushed through a number of changes intended to make it harder for a challenger to build the necessary majority to unseat a president or reject his policies influence of organized crimeedit beck was elected to the executive council of the afl on august   but his election generated a tremendous political battle between afl president george meany who supported his election and federation vice presidents who felt beck was corrupt and should not be elected to the post beck was the first teamster president to negotiate a nationwide master contract and a national grievance arbitration plan established organizing drives in the deep south and the east and built the current teamsters headquarters the marble palace in washington dc on louisiana avenue nw across a small plaza from the united states senate but his intervention in a construction and a milk strike both centered on new york city and refusal to intervene in a northeastern trucking strike created major political problems for him perceiving beck to be weak jimmy hoffa began challenging beck on various union decisions and policies in  with an eye to unseating him as general president in the regularly scheduled union elections in  infiltration by organized crime dominated the agenda of the teamsters throughout the s the teamsters had suffered from extensive corruption since its formation in  although the more extreme public forms of corruption had been eliminated after general president cornelius shea was removed from office the extent of corruption and control by organized crime increased during general president tobins time in office  to  in  the teamsters and unions in chicago even approached gangster roger touhy and asked for his protection from al capone and his chicago outfit which were seeking to control the areas unions evidence of widespread corruption within the teamsters began emerging shortly after tobin retired in kansas city corrupt teamsters locals spent years seeking bribes embezzling money and engaging in extensive extortion and labor rackets as well as beatings vandalism and even bombings in an attempt to control the construction and trucking industries the problem was so serious that the us house of representatives held hearings on the issue hoffas attempt to challenge beck caused a major national scandal which led to two congressional investigations several indictments for fraud and other crimes against beck and hoffa strict new federal legislation and regulations regarding labor unions and even helped launch the political career of robert f kennedy believing he needed additional votes to unseat beck in october  mobster johnny dio met with hoffa in new york city and the two men conspired to create as many as  paper locals to boost hoffas delegate totals when the paper locals applied for charters from the international union hoffas political foes were outraged a major battle broke out within the teamsters over whether to charter the locals and the media attention led to inquiries by the us department of justice and the permanent subcommittee on investigations of the us senate committee on government operations beck and other teamster leaders challenged the authority of the us senate to investigate the union which caused the senate to establish the select committee on improper activities in labor and management – a new committee with broad subpeona and investigative powers senator john l mcclellan chair of the select committee hired robert f kennedy as the subcommittees chief counsel and investigator the select committee also known as the mcclellan committee after its chairman exposed widespread corruption in the teamsters union dave beck fled the country for a month to avoid its subpoenas before returning four of the paper locals were dissolved to avoid committee scrutiny several teamster staffers were charged with contempt of congress and union records were lost or destroyed allegedly on purpose and wiretaps were played in public before a national television audience in which dio and hoffa discussed the creation of even more paper locals evidence was unearthed of a mobsponsored plot in which oregon teamsters unions would seize control of the state legislature state police and state attorney generals office through bribery extortion and blackmail initially members of the union did not believe the charges and support for beck was strong but after three months of continuous allegations of wrongdoing many rankandfile teamsters withdrew their support and openly called for beck to resign beck initially refused to address the allegations but broke his silence and denounced the committees inquiry on march  but even as the committee conducted its investigation the teamsters chartered even more paper locals in midmarch  jimmy hoffa was arrested for allegedly trying to bribe a senate aide hoffa denied the charges but the arrest triggered additional investigations and more arrests and indictments over the following weeks a week later beck admitted to receiving an interestfree  loan from the teamsters which he had never repaid and senate investigators claimed that loans to beck and other union officials and their businesses had cost the union more than  beck appeared before the select committee for the first time on march   and invoked his fifth amendment right against selfincrimination  times the mcclellan committee turned its focus to hoffa and other teamsters officials and presented testimony and evidence alleging widespread corruption in hoffacontrolled teamster units several historic legal developments came out of the select committees investigation the scandals uncovered by the mcclellan committee which affected not only the teamsters but several other unions led directly to the passage of the labormanagement reporting and disclosure act also known as the landrumgriffin act in  the right of union officials to exercise their fifth amendment rights was upheld and a significant refinement of constitutional law made when the us supreme court reaffirmed the right of union officials to not divulge the location of union records in curcio v united states  us   rankandfile anger over the mcclellan committees revelations eventually led beck to retire from the teamsters and allowed jimmy hoffa to take over immediately after his testimony in late march  beck won approval from the unions executive board to establish a  million fund to defend himself and the union from the committees allegations but member outrage at the expenditure was significant and permission to establish the fund rescinded member anger continued to grow throughout the spring and becks majority support on the executive board vanished beck was called before the mcclellan committee again in early may  and additional interestfree loans and other potentially illegal and unethical financial transactions exposed based on these revelations beck was indicted for tax evasion on may   becks legal troubles led him to retire and hoffa to win election to the union presidency support for beck among the membership evaporated beck announced on may  he would not run for reelection in october the announcement created chaos among the union leadership and despite additional indictments hoffa announced he would seek the presidency on july  rankandfile support for hoffa was strong although there were some attempts to organize an opposition candidate hoffas opponents asked a federal judge to postpone the election but the request was granted only temporarily and hoffa was duly elected general president of the union on october   beck offered to retire early to allow hoffa to take control of the union in december a federal district court barred hoffa from taking power unless he was acquitted in his wiretapping trial the ruling was upheld by a court of appeals but the trial ended in a hung jury on december   and hoffa assumed the presidency on february   the worsening corruption scandal led the aflcio to eject the teamsters aflcio president george meany worried that corruption scandals plaguing a number of unions at the time might lead to harsh regulation of unions or even the withdrawal of federal labor law protection began an anticorruption drive in april  new rules were enacted by the labor federations executive council that provided for the removal of vice presidents engaged in corruption as well as the ejection of unions considered corrupt the mcclellan committees investigation only worsened the dispute between the aflcio and the teamsters in january  the aflcio proposed a new rule which would bar officers of the federation from continuing to hold office if they exercised their fifth amendment rights in a corruption investigation beck opposed the new rule but the ethical practices committee of aflcio instituted rule on january   the teamsters were given  days to reform but beck retaliated by promising more raids on aflcio member unions if the union was ousted becks opposition prompted a successful move by meany to remove beck from aflcio executive council on grounds of corruption after extensive hearings and appeals which lasted from july to september  the aflcio voted on september   to eject the teamsters if the union did not institute reforms within  days beck refused to institute any reforms and the election of jimmy hoffa whom the aflcio considered as corrupt as beck led the labor federation to suspend the teamsters union on october   meany offered to keep the teamsters within the aflcio if hoffa resigned as president but hoffa refused and the formal expulsion occurred on december   the teamsters were not the only corrupt union in the aflcio by any means another was the international longshoremens association ila which represented stevedores in most east coast ports the teamsters had long desired to bring all shipping and transportation workers into the union so that no product could be moved anywhere in the us without it being touched by teamsters hands as the ila came under increasing attack for permitting corruption in its locals president beck sought to bring the ila into the teamsters the afl ousted the ila in september  and formed the international brotherhood of longshoremenafl iblafl to represent longshoremen on the great lakes and east coast the teamsters planned to raid the expelled union and may even have hoped to seize control of the iblafl beck undertook a campaign to bring the ila back into the afl in early  but the election of mob associate anthony tough tony anastasio as an ila vice president forced beck to end the effort but even as beck backed away from any ila deal jimmy hoffa secretly negotiated a major package of financial and staff aid to the ila and then went public with the deal – forcing beck to accept it as a fait accompli or risk embarrassing hoffa the aflcio threatened to expel the teamsters if it aided the ila beck fought hoffa over the ila aid package and won withdrawing the offer to the ila in the spring of  the ila was not the only union the teamsters sought to merge with the union attempted to merge with the mine mill  smelter workers in  but the effort failed the union also sought a merger with the brewery workers but the smaller union rejected the offer when the overture failed the teamsters raided the brewery workers leading to fierce protests by the cio raiding by the teamsters was such a serious issue that it prompted the afl and cio which had attempted to sign a noraid agreement for years to finally negotiate and implement such a pact in december  president beck initially refused to sign the agreement and threatened to take the teamsters out of the afl if forced to adhere to it three months after the pact was signed the teamsters agreed to submit to the terms of the noraid agreement shortly thereafter the afl adopted article  of its constitution which prevented its member unions from raiding one another the unions affection for raiding led it to initially oppose the aflcio merger in january  but it quickly reversed itself rise fall and disappearance of jimmy hoffaedit hoffa achieved his goal of unifying all freight drivers under a single collective bargaining agreement the national master freight agreement in  hoffa used the grievance procedures of the agreement which authorized selective strikes against particular employers to police the agreement or if hoffa thought that it served the unions interest to drive marginal employers out of the industry the union won substantial gains for its members fostering a nostalgic image of the hoffa era as the golden age for teamster drivers hoffa also succeeded where tobin had failed concentrating power at the international level dominating the conferences which beck and dobbs had helped build in addition hoffa was instrumental in using the assets of the teamsters pension plans particularly the central states plan to support mafia projects such as the development of las vegas in the s and s pension funds were loaned to finance las vegas casinos such as the stardust resort  casino the fremont hotel  casino the desert inn the dunes hotel and casino which was controlled by hoffas attorney morris shenker the four queens the aladdin hotel  casino circus circus and caesars palace the pension fund also made a number of loans to associates and relatives of highranking teamster officials a close associate of hoffa during this period was allen dorfman dorfman owned an insurance agency that provided insurance claims processing to the teamsters union and which was the subject of an investigation by the mcclellan committee dorfman also had increasing influence over loans made by the teamsters pension fund and after hoffa went to prison in  dorfman had primary control over the fund dorfman was murdered in january  shortly after his conviction along with teamsters president roy lee williams in a bribery case hoffa was moreover defiantly unwilling to reform the union or limit his own power in response to the attacks from robert f kennedy formerly chief counsel to the mcclellan committee then attorney general kennedys department of justice tried to convict hoffa for a variety of offenses over the s finally succeeding on a witness tampering charge in  with key testimony provided by teamsters business agent edward grady partin of baton rouge louisiana after exhausting his appeals hoffa entered prison in  hoffa installed frank fitzsimmons an associate from his days in local  in detroit to hold his place for him while he served time fitzsimmons however began to enjoy the exercise of power in hoffas absence in addition the organized crime figures around him found that he was more pliant than hoffa had been while president nixons pardon barred hoffa from resuming any role in the teamsters until  hoffa challenged the legality of that condition and planned to run again for presidency of the union but disappeared in  under mysterious circumstances he is presumed dead although his body has never been found decentralization deregulation and driftedit under general president frank fitzsimmons authority within the teamsters was decentralized back into the hands of regional joint council and local leaders while this helped solidify fitzsimmons own political position in the union it also made it more difficult for the union to act decisively on policy issues fitzsimmons also moved the unions political stands slowly to the left supporting universal health care an immediate end to the vietnam war urban renewal and community organizing in  fitzsimmons and united auto workers president walter reuther formed the alliance for labor action a new national trade union center which competed with the aflcio the alliance dissolved in  after reuthers death while the teamsters won rich national master contracts in trucking and package delivery in the s it did little to adapt to the changes occurring in the transportation industry a major jurisdictional battle with the united farm workers ufw broke out in  and did not end until  the teamsters and ufw had both claimed jurisdiction over farm workers for many years and in  had signed an agreement settling their differences but decentralization of power within the union led several teamster leaders in california to repudiate this agreement without fitzsimmons permission and organize large numbers of field workers his hand forced fitzsimmons ordered teamsters contract negotiators to reopen the handful of contracts it had signed with california growers the ufw sued the aflcio condemned the action and many employers negotiated contracts with the teamsters rather than with the ufw the teamsters subsequently signed contracts which many denounced as sweetheart deals with more than  california growers although an agreement giving ufw jurisdiction over field workers and the teamsters jurisdiction over packing and warehouse workers was reached on september   fitzsimmons reneged on the agreement within a month and moved ahead with forming a farm workers regional union in california the organizing battles even became violent at times by  the ufw had won  elections and the teamsters  ufw membership had plummeted to just  from nearly  while the teamsters farmworker division counted  workers the ufw signed an agreement with fitzsimmons in march  in which the ufw agreed to seek to organize only those workers covered by the california agricultural labor relations act while the teamsters retained jurisdiction over some agricultural workers who had been covered by teamsters local union contracts prior to the formation of the ufw in october  fitzsimmons ended the longrunning jurisdictional dispute with the united brewery workers and the brewery workers merged with the teamsters in  congress passed legislation that deregulated the freight industry removing the interstate commerce commissions power to impose detailed regulatory tariffs on interstate carriers the union tried to fight deregulation by attempting to bribe senator howard cannon of nevada that attempt not only failed but resulted in the conviction in  of roy williams the general president who had succeeded fitzsimmons in  williams subsequently resigned in  as a condition of remaining free on bail while his appeal proceeded deregulation had catastrophic effects on the teamsters opening up the industry to competition from nonunion companies who sought to cut costs by avoiding unionization and curbing wages nearly  unionized carriers went out of business in the first few years of deregulation leaving thirty percent of teamsters in the freight division unemployed the remaining unionized carriers demanded concessions in wages work rules and hours williams successor jackie presser was prepared to grant most of these concessions in the form of a special freight relief rider that would cut wages by up to  percent and establish twotier wages teamsters for a democratic union which had grown out of efforts to reject the  freight agreement launched a successful national campaign to defeat the relief rider which was defeated by a vote of  to  the pressure on the freight industry and the national freight agreement continued however by the end of the s the national master freight agreement which had covered  drivers in the late s dropped to fewer than  with numerous local riders weakening it further in some areas internal and external challengesedit the decline in working conditions in the freight industry combined with longsimmering unhappiness among members employed by the united parcel service led to the development of two nationwide dissident groups within the union in the s teamsters for a democratic union tdu an assemblage of a number of local efforts and the professional drivers council better known as prod which began as a public interest group affiliated with ralph nader that was concerned with worker safety the two groups merged in  tdu was able to win some local offices within the union although the international union often attempted to make those victories meaningless by marginalizing the officer or the union tdu acquired greater prominence however with the election reforms forced on the union by the consent decree it had entered into in  on the eve of trial on a suit brought by the federal government under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico the decree required the direct election of international officers by the membership as tdu had been demanding for years leading up to the decree to replace the indirect election by delegates at the unions convention while the delegates at the unions  convention balked at amending the constitution they ultimately capitulated under pressure from the government that consent decree might not have been possible however if it had not been for the testimony of roy williams who described in an affidavit he gave the government in return for a delay of his imprisonment his own dealings with organized crime as the secretarytreasurer of a local union in kansas city and as an officer of the international union the decree also gave the government the power to install an independent review board with the power to expel any member of the union for conduct unbecoming to the union which the irb proceeded to exercise far more aggressively than the teamsters officials who had agreed to the decree had expected while the government was pursuing a civil case against the union as an entity it was also indicting presser who had succeeded williams as general president for embezzling from two different local unions in cleveland prior to his election as president presser resigned in  but died before his trial was scheduled to begin he was succeeded by william j mccarthy who came from the same local that dan tobin had led eighty years earlier the independent review board irb is a threemember panel established to investigate and take appropriate action with respect to any allegations of corruption any allegations of domination or control or influence of any part of the union by organized crime and any failure to cooperate fully with the irb recent historyedit a teamsters gathering at the yearlykos

president in the unions history defeating two old guard candidates rv durham and walter shea careys slate supported by tdu also won nearly all of the seats on the international executive board carey acquired a fair amount of influence within the aflcio which had readmitted the teamsters in  carey was close with the new leadership elected in  particularly richard trumka of the united mine workers of america who became secretarytreasurer of the aflcio under john sweeney carey had also swung the teamsters support behind the democratic party a change from past administrations that had supported the republican party the new administration set out to break from the past in other ways making energetic efforts to head off a vote to oust the union as representative of northwest airlines flight attendants negotiating a breakthrough agreement covering carhaulers and supporting local strikes such as the one against diamond walnut to restore the unions strength the carey administration did not on the other hand have much power in the lower reaches of the teamster hierarchy all of the large regional conferences were run by old guard officers as were most of the locals disagreements between those two camps led the old guard to campaign against the carey administrations proposed dues increase the carey administration retaliated by dissolving the regional conferences calling them expensive redundancies and fiefdoms for old guard union officers and rearranging the boundaries of some joint councils that had fought against the dues increase the opposition responded by uniting around a single candidate james p hoffa son of james r hoffa to run against carey in  hoffa ran a strong campaign trading on the mystique still attached to his late fathers name and promising to restore those days of glory carey appeared however to have won a close election shortly afterward in  the union initiated a large and successful strike against ups the parcel services department by that time had become the largest division in the union carey was removed from the unions leadership by the irb shortly thereafter when evidence that individuals in his office had arranged for transfer of several thousand dollars to an outside contractor which then arranged for another entity to make an equivalent contribution to the carey campaign carey was indicted for lying to investigators about his campaign funding but was acquitted of all charges in a  trial in the  election to succeed carey james p hoffa was elected handily he became president of the teamsters on march   and took the union in a more moderate direction tempering the unions support for democrats and attempting to come to terms with powerful republicans in congress the union has merged in recent years with a number of unions

online advertising campaign aimed at ups and the teamsters called stop the brown bailout internal teamsters politicsedit prior to the s no longlived caucuses existed within the teamsters union challengers for office ran on their personal appeal and individual power base rather than on caucus or party platforms and such challenges were infrequent the teamster leadership was wellestablished and somewhat selfperpetuating and challengers only rarely achieved victories at the local and even less frequently regional levels this changed in the s a national wildcat strike challenged president frank fitzsimmons control over the union but failed after the strike a reform movement known as teamsters united rank and file turf formed to continue to challenge against the unions national leadership but turf collapsed after a few years due to internal dissent in  two new caucuses formed teamsters for a decent contract tdc and upsurge both groups pushed the national leadership for a vastly improved contract at the ups freight and shipping company in  a new formal caucus teamsters for a democratic union tdu formed when tdc and upsurge merged the new caucus goal was to make internal teamster governance more transparent and democratic which included giving rankandfile more of a say in the terms and approval of contracts in the s tdu occasionally won elections for positions on local councils but it was not until —when the tdu forced president jackie presser to withdraw and make changes to a concessionladen national master freight agreement—that tdu had a national impact tdu publicized the very centralized and not very transparent national union decisionmaking process criticized what it said was lack of member input into these decisions and published contract salary membership and other data critical of the national union leadership these criticisms led to another success for tdu with many tdu proposals finding their way into the  court decree in which the federal government took over of the teamsters although the tdu has never won the presidency of the national union as of mid it strongly supported ron carey for the presidency in  carey in turn adopted many of tdus reform proposals as part of his platform carey ran with nearly a full slate which included a candidate for secretarytreasurer and  vice presidencies rv durham leader of the teamsters in north carolina was considered the establishment candidate and frontrunner in the campaign he had the backing of a majority of the unions executive board a second candidate in the race walter shea was a veteran union staffer from washington dc carey won with  percent of the vote to durhams  percent and sheas  percent turnout was low only about  percent of the unions total membership careys election sociologist charlotte ryan says was another success for tdu even though carey was not a tdu candidate carey won reelection in  in a corrupt election defeating james p hoffa son of the former union president prior to entering the race hoffa formed a caucus of his own the hoffa unity slate to counter the grassroots organizing of tdu and carey carey was later ousted as union president by us government officials a rerun election in  saw hoffa and the unity slate easily defeat tdu candidate tom leedham  percent to  percent with  percent turnout hoffa was reelected over leedham again running on the tdu platform in   percent to  percent leedham challenged hoffa and the hoffa unity slate a third time in  losing  percent to  percent with  percent turnout hoffa faced tdu candidate sandy pope a local union president in  also running with a full slate of officer and vice presidential candidates was former hoffa supporter and former national vice president fred gegare hoffa again easily won reelection earning  percent of the vote to gregares  percent and popes  percent the hoffa unity slate also won all five regional vice presidencies although the slates support declined

historyedit early historyedit cornelius shea first general president of the teamsters circa  the american federation of labor afl had helped form local unions of teamsters since  in november  the afl organized the team drivers international union tdiu in  a group of teamsters in chicago illinois broke from the tdiu and formed the teamsters national union unlike the tdiu which permitted large employers to be members the new teamsters national union permitted only employees teamster helpers and owneroperators owning only a single team to join and advocated higher wages and shorter hours more aggressively than the tdiu claiming more than  members in  locals its president albert young applied for membership in the afl the afl asked the tdiu to merge with youngs union to form a new aflaffiliated union and the two groups did so in  forming the international brotherhood of teamsters ibt and electing cornelius shea as the new unions first president the election process proved tumultuous shea effectively controlled the convention because the chicago locals—representing nearly half the ibts membership—supported for his candidacy en bloc shea was opposed by john sheridan president of the ice drivers union of chicago sheridan and george innes president of the tdiu accused shea of embezzlement in an attempt to prevent his election shea won the election on august   by a vote of  to  the new grouping elected edward l turley of chicago as secretarytreasurer and albert young as general organizer the union like most unions within the american federation of labor afl at the time had a largely decentralized structure with a number of local unions that governed themselves autonomously and tended to look only after their own interests in the geographical jurisdiction in which they operated the teamsters were vitally important to the labor movement for a strike or sympathy strike by the teamsters could paralyze the movement of goods throughout a city and bring a strike into nearly every neighborhood it also meant that teamsters leaders were able to demand bribes in order to avoid strikes and control of a teamsters local could bring organized crime significant revenues during sheas presidency the entire teamsters union was notoriously corrupt noted labor historian john r commons famously concluded that during this time the teamsters were less a union and more a criminal organization informal portrait of left to right cornelius p shea john miller fred mader and tim murphy sitting in a row in a courtroom in chicago illinois during a labor trial murphy was a politician union organizer and reputed gangster and he was murdered in  several major strikes occupied the union in its first three years in november  teamsters employed by the chicago city railway went out on strike shea attempted to stop sympathy strikes by other teamster locals but three locals walked out and eventually disaffiliated over the sympathystrike issue a sympathy strike in support of  striking meat cutters in chicago in july  led to riots before the extensive use of strikebreakers led shea to force his members back to work leading to the collapse of the meat cutters strike in the midst of the strife in  the teamsters convention in cincinnati ohio reelected shea by acclamation on august   under his leadership the union had expanded to nearly  members in  locals in  cities making the teamsters one of the largest unions in the united states in   teamsters struck in support of lockedout tailors at montgomery ward and eventually more than  teamsters manned the picket lines but when local newspapers discovered that shea was living in a local brothel kept a yearold waitress as a mistress and had spent the strike hosting parties public support for the strike collapsed and the strike ended on august   despite the revelations shea won reelection on august   by a vote of  to  shea was reelected again in  and  although significant challenges to his presidency occurred each time sheas first trial on charges stemming from the  montgomery ward strike ended in a mistrial however during the  reelection shea had promised that he would resign the presidency once his trial had ended but he did not and most union members withdrew their support for him daniel j tobin of boston was elected sheas successor by a vote of  to  in august  historic references to early freight transportation in the us refer to teamsters as those who drove teams of horses pulling huge wagons organizing and growth during the great depressionedit tobin was president of the teamsters from  to  although he faced opposition in his reelection races in   and  he never faced opposition again until his retirement in  the teamsters began to expand dramatically and mature organizationally under tobin he pushed for the development of joint councils to which all local unions were forced to affiliate varying in geographical and industrial jurisdiction the joint councils became important incubators for upandcoming leadership and negotiating master agreements which covered all employers in a given industry tobin also actively discouraged strikes in order to bring discipline to the union and encourage employers to sign contracts and founded and edited the union magazine the international teamster under tobin the teamsters also first developed the regional conference system developed by dave beck in seattle which provided stability organizing strength and leadership to the international union tobin undertook long jurisdictional battles with many unions during this period fierce disputes occurred between the teamsters and the gasoline state operators national council an afl federal union of gas station attendants the international longshoremens association the retail clerks international union and the brotherhood of railway clerks the most significant disagreement however was with the united brewery workers over the right to represent beer wagon drivers while the teamsters lost this battle in  when the afl awarded jurisdiction to the brewers they won when the issue came before the afl executive board again in  when the brewers were still recovering from their nearelimination during prohibition the raids and new member organizing in the s led to significant membership increases teamster membership stood at just  in  tobin took advantage of the wave of prounion sentiment engendered by the passage of the national industrial recovery act and by  union membership had increased nearly  percent to  by  tobin had a duespaying membership of —making the teamsters the fastestgrowing labor union in the united states one of the most significant events in union history occurred in  a group of radicals in local  in minneapolis—led by farrell dobbs carl skoglund and the dunne brothers ray miles and grant all members of the trotskyist communist league of america—began successfully organizing coal truck drivers in the winter of  tobin an ardent anticommunist opposed their efforts and refused to support their  strike local  struck again in  leading to several riots over a nineday period in may when the employers association reneged on the agreement local  resumed the strike although it ended again after nine days when martial law was declared by governor floyd b olson although local  won a contract recognizing the union and which broke the back of the antiunion citizens alliance in minneapolis tobin expelled local  from the teamsters member outrage was extensive and in august  he was forced to recharter the local as  within a year the newly formed local  had organized  truckers in the midwest and formed the central conference of teamsters extensive organizing also occurred in the west harry bridges radical leader of the international longshoremens and warehousemens union ilwu was leading the march inland—an attempt to organize warehouse workers away from shipping ports alarmed by bridges radical politics and worried that the ilwu would encroach on teamster jurisdictions dave beck formed a large regional organization the western conference of teamsters to engage in fierce organizing battles and membership raids against the ilwu which led to the establishment of many new locals and the organization of tens of thousands of new members but corruption became even more widespread in the teamsters during the tobin administration by  the union was considered the most corrupt in the united states and the most abusive towards its own members tobin vigorously defended the union against such accusations but also instituted many constitutional and organizational changes and practices which made it easier for union officials to engage in criminal offenses world war ii and the postwar periodedit by the beginning of world war ii the teamsters was one of the most powerful unions in the country and teamster leaders influential in the corridors of power union membership had risen more than  percent between  and  to  in june  president franklin roosevelt appointed ibt president daniel j tobin to be the official white house liaison to organized labor and later that year chair of the labor division of the democratic national committee in  president roosevelt appointed tobin special representative to the united kingdom and charged him with investigating the state of the labor movement there tobin was considered three times for secretary of labor and twice refused the post—in  and  on september   roosevelt gave his famous fala speech while campaigning in the  presidential election because of roosevelts strong relationship with tobin and the unions large membership the president delivered his speech before the teamster convention nonetheless teamsters members were restive dissident members of the union accused the leadership of suppressing democracy in the union a charge president tobin angrily denied over the next year tobin cracked down on dissidents and trusted several large locals led by his political opponents during world war ii the teamsters strongly endorsed the american labor movements nostrike pledge the teamsters agreed to cease raiding other unions and not strike for the duration of the national emergency president tobin even ordered teamsters members to cross picket lines put up by other unions nevertheless the national leadership sanctioned strikes by midwestern truckers in august  southern truckers in october  and brewery workers and milk delivery drivers in january  the teamsters did not however participate in the great postwar wave of labor strikes in the two years following the cessation of hostilities the teamsters struck only three times  truckers in new jersey struck for two weeks workers at ups struck nationwide for three weeks and workers at railway express agency struck for almost a month teamsters leaders strongly opposed enactment of the tafthartley act and repeatedly called for its repeal president tobin however was one of the first labor leaders to sign the noncommunist affidavit required by the law the great wave of organizing which the union engaged in during the great depression and the war significantly boosted the political power of a number of regional teamsters leaders and the leadership of the union engaged in a number of power struggles in the postwar period by  the unions membership had topped one million dave beck elected an international vicepresident in  was increasingly influential in the international union and tobin attempted to check his growing power but failed in  beck successfully overcame tobins opposition and won approval of an amendment to the unions constitution creating the post of executive vicepresident beck then won the  election to fill the position beck also successfully opposed in  a tobinbacked dues increase to fund new organizing the following year beck was able to demand the ouster of the editor of international teamster magazine and install his own man in the job in  beck allied with his longtime rival jimmy hoffa and effectively seized control of the union he announced a raid on the international association of machinists local at boeing although president dan tobin publicly repudiated becks actions beck had more than enough support from hoffa and other members of the executive board to force tobin to back down five months later beck won approval of a plan to dissolve the unions four divisions and replace them with  divisions organized around each of the major job categories in the unions membership in  tom hickey reformist leader of the teamsters in new york city won election to the teamsters executive board tobin needed becks support to prevent hickeys election and beck refused to give it on september   tobin announced he would step down as president of the teamsters at the end of his term at the unions  convention beck was elected general president and pushed through a number of changes intended to make it harder for a challenger to build the necessary majority to unseat a president or reject his policies influence of organized crimeedit beck was elected to the executive council of the afl on august   but his election generated a tremendous political battle between afl president george meany who supported his election and federation vice presidents who felt beck was corrupt and should not be elected to the post beck was the first teamster president to negotiate a nationwide master contract and a national grievance arbitration plan established organizing drives in the deep south and the east and built the current teamsters headquarters the marble palace in washington dc on louisiana avenue nw across a small plaza from the united states senate but his intervention in a construction and a milk strike both centered on new york city and refusal to intervene in a northeastern trucking strike created major political problems for him perceiving beck to be weak jimmy hoffa began challenging beck on various union decisions and policies in  with an eye to unseating him as general president in the regularly scheduled union elections in  infiltration by organized crime dominated the agenda of the teamsters throughout the s the teamsters had suffered from extensive corruption since its formation in  although the more extreme public forms of corruption had been eliminated after general president cornelius shea was removed from office the extent of corruption and control by organized crime increased during general president tobins time in office  to  in  the teamsters and unions in chicago even approached gangster roger touhy and asked for his protection from al capone and his chicago outfit which were seeking to control the areas unions evidence of widespread corruption within the teamsters began emerging shortly after tobin retired in kansas city corrupt teamsters locals spent years seeking bribes embezzling money and engaging in extensive extortion and labor rackets as well as beatings vandalism and even bombings in an attempt to control the construction and trucking industries the problem was so serious that the us house of representatives held hearings on the issue hoffas attempt to challenge beck caused a major national scandal which led to two congressional investigations several indictments for fraud and other crimes against beck and hoffa strict new federal legislation and regulations regarding labor unions and even helped launch the political career of robert f kennedy believing he needed additional votes to unseat beck in october  mobster johnny dio met with hoffa in new york city and the two men conspired to create as many as  paper locals to boost hoffas delegate totals when the paper locals applied for charters from the international union hoffas political foes were outraged a major battle broke out within the teamsters over whether to charter the locals and the media attention led to inquiries by the us department of justice and the permanent subcommittee on investigations of the us senate committee on government operations beck and other teamster leaders challenged the authority of the us senate to investigate the union which caused the senate to establish the select committee on improper activities in labor and management – a new committee with broad subpeona and investigative powers senator john l mcclellan chair of the select committee hired robert f kennedy as the subcommittees chief counsel and investigator the select committee also known as the mcclellan committee after its chairman exposed widespread corruption in the teamsters union dave beck fled the country for a month to avoid its subpoenas before returning four of the paper locals were dissolved to avoid committee scrutiny several teamster staffers were charged with contempt of congress and union records were lost or destroyed allegedly on purpose and wiretaps were played in public before a national television audience in which dio and hoffa discussed the creation of even more paper locals evidence was unearthed of a mobsponsored plot in which oregon teamsters unions would seize control of the state legislature state police and state attorney generals office through bribery extortion and blackmail initially members of the union did not believe the charges and support for beck was strong but after three months of continuous allegations of wrongdoing many rankandfile teamsters withdrew their support and openly called for beck to resign beck initially refused to address the allegations but broke his silence and denounced the committees inquiry on march  but even as the committee conducted its investigation the teamsters chartered even more paper locals in midmarch  jimmy hoffa was arrested for allegedly trying to bribe a senate aide hoffa denied the charges but the arrest triggered additional investigations and more arrests and indictments over the following weeks a week later beck admitted to receiving an interestfree  loan from the teamsters which he had never repaid and senate investigators claimed that loans to beck and other union officials and their businesses had cost the union more than  beck appeared before the select committee for the first time on march   and invoked his fifth amendment right against selfincrimination  times the mcclellan committee turned its focus to hoffa and other teamsters officials and presented testimony and evidence alleging widespread corruption in hoffacontrolled teamster units several historic legal developments came out of the select committees investigation the scandals uncovered by the mcclellan committee which affected not only the teamsters but several other unions led directly to the passage of the labormanagement reporting and disclosure act also known as the landrumgriffin act in  the right of union officials to exercise their fifth amendment rights was upheld and a significant refinement of constitutional law made when the us supreme court reaffirmed the right of union officials to not divulge the location of union records in curcio v united states  us   rankandfile anger over the mcclellan committees revelations eventually led beck to retire from the teamsters and allowed jimmy hoffa to take over immediately after his testimony in late march  beck won approval from the unions executive board to establish a  million fund to defend himself and the union from the committees allegations but member outrage at the expenditure was significant and permission to establish the fund rescinded member anger continued to grow throughout the spring and becks majority support on the executive board vanished beck was called before the mcclellan committee again in early may  and additional interestfree loans and other potentially illegal and unethical financial transactions exposed based on these revelations beck was indicted for tax evasion on may   becks legal troubles led him to retire and hoffa to win election to the union presidency support for beck among the membership evaporated beck announced on may  he would not run for reelection in october the announcement created chaos among the union leadership and despite additional indictments hoffa announced he would seek the presidency on july  rankandfile support for hoffa was strong although there were some attempts to organize an opposition candidate hoffas opponents asked a federal judge to postpone the election but the request was granted only temporarily and hoffa was duly elected general president of the union on october   beck offered to retire early to allow hoffa to take control of the union in december a federal district court barred hoffa from taking power unless he was acquitted in his wiretapping trial the ruling was upheld by a court of appeals but the trial ended in a hung jury on december   and hoffa assumed the presidency on february   the worsening corruption scandal led the aflcio to eject the teamsters aflcio president george meany worried that corruption scandals plaguing a number of unions at the time might lead to harsh regulation of unions or even the withdrawal of federal labor law protection began an anticorruption drive in april  new rules were enacted by the labor federations executive council that provided for the removal of vice presidents engaged in corruption as well as the ejection of unions considered corrupt the mcclellan committees investigation only worsened the dispute between the aflcio and the teamsters in january  the aflcio proposed a new rule which would bar officers of the federation from continuing to hold office if they exercised their fifth amendment rights in a corruption investigation beck opposed the new rule but the ethical practices committee of aflcio instituted rule on january   the teamsters were given  days to reform but beck retaliated by promising more raids on aflcio member unions if the union was ousted becks opposition prompted a successful move by meany to remove beck from aflcio executive council on grounds of corruption after extensive hearings and appeals which lasted from july to september  the aflcio voted on september   to eject the teamsters if the union did not institute reforms within  days beck refused to institute any reforms and the election of jimmy hoffa whom the aflcio considered as corrupt as beck led the labor federation to suspend the teamsters union on october   meany offered to keep the teamsters within the aflcio if hoffa resigned as president but hoffa refused and the formal expulsion occurred on december   the teamsters were not the only corrupt union in the aflcio by any means another was the international longshoremens association ila which represented stevedores in most east coast ports the teamsters had long desired to bring all shipping and transportation workers into the union so that no product could be moved anywhere in the us without it being touched by teamsters hands as the ila came under increasing attack for permitting corruption in its locals president beck sought to bring the ila into the teamsters the afl ousted the ila in september  and formed the international brotherhood of longshoremenafl iblafl to represent longshoremen on the great lakes and east coast the teamsters planned to raid the expelled union and may even have hoped to seize control of the iblafl beck undertook a campaign to bring the ila back into the afl in early  but the election of mob associate anthony tough tony anastasio as an ila vice president forced beck to end the effort but even as beck backed away from any ila deal jimmy hoffa secretly negotiated a major package of financial and staff aid to the ila and then went public with the deal – forcing beck to accept it as a fait accompli or risk embarrassing hoffa the aflcio threatened to expel the teamsters if it aided the ila beck fought hoffa over the ila aid package and won withdrawing the offer to the ila in the spring of  the ila was not the only union the teamsters sought to merge with the union attempted to merge with the mine mill  smelter workers in  but the effort failed the union also sought a merger with the brewery workers but the smaller union rejected the offer when the overture failed the teamsters raided the brewery workers leading to fierce protests by the cio raiding by the teamsters was such a serious issue that it prompted the afl and cio which had attempted to sign a noraid agreement for years to finally negotiate and implement such a pact in december  president beck initially refused to sign the agreement and threatened to take the teamsters out of the afl if forced to adhere to it three months after the pact was signed the teamsters agreed to submit to the terms of the noraid agreement shortly thereafter the afl adopted article  of its constitution which prevented its member unions from raiding one another the unions affection for raiding led it to initially oppose the aflcio merger in january  but it quickly reversed itself rise fall and disappearance of jimmy hoffaedit hoffa achieved his goal of unifying all freight drivers under a single collective bargaining agreement the national master freight agreement in  hoffa used the grievance procedures of the agreement which authorized selective strikes against particular employers to police the agreement or if hoffa thought that it served the unions interest to drive marginal employers out of the industry the union won substantial gains for its members fostering a nostalgic image of the hoffa era as the golden age for teamster drivers hoffa also succeeded where tobin had failed concentrating power at the international level dominating the conferences which beck and dobbs had helped build in addition hoffa was instrumental in using the assets of the teamsters pension plans particularly the central states plan to support mafia projects such as the development of las vegas in the s and s pension funds were loaned to finance las vegas casinos such as the stardust resort  casino the fremont hotel  casino the desert inn the dunes hotel and casino which was controlled by hoffas attorney morris shenker the four queens the aladdin hotel  casino circus circus and caesars palace the pension fund also made a number of loans to associates and relatives of highranking teamster officials a close associate of hoffa during this period was allen dorfman dorfman owned an insurance agency that provided insurance claims processing to the teamsters union and which was the subject of an investigation by the mcclellan committee dorfman also had increasing influence over loans made by the teamsters pension fund and after hoffa went to prison in  dorfman had primary control over the fund dorfman was murdered in january  shortly after his conviction along with teamsters president roy lee williams in a bribery case hoffa was moreover defiantly unwilling to reform the union or limit his own power in response to the attacks from robert f kennedy formerly chief counsel to the mcclellan committee then attorney general kennedys department of justice tried to convict hoffa for a variety of offenses over the s finally succeeding on a witness tampering charge in  with key testimony provided by teamsters business agent edward grady partin of baton rouge louisiana after exhausting his appeals hoffa entered prison in  hoffa installed frank fitzsimmons an associate from his days in local  in detroit to hold his place for him while he served time fitzsimmons however began to enjoy the exercise of power in hoffas absence in addition the organized crime figures around him found that he was more pliant than hoffa had been while president nixons pardon barred hoffa from resuming any role in the teamsters until  hoffa challenged the legality of that condition and planned to run again for presidency of the union but disappeared in  under mysterious circumstances he is presumed dead although his body has never been found decentralization deregulation and driftedit under general president frank fitzsimmons authority within the teamsters was decentralized back into the hands of regional joint council and local leaders while this helped solidify fitzsimmons own political position in the union it also made it more difficult for the union to act decisively on policy issues fitzsimmons also moved the unions political stands slowly to the left supporting universal health care an immediate end to the vietnam war urban renewal and community organizing in  fitzsimmons and united auto workers president walter reuther formed the alliance for labor action a new national trade union center which competed with the aflcio the alliance dissolved in  after reuthers death while the teamsters won rich national master contracts in trucking and package delivery in the s it did little to adapt to the changes occurring in the transportation industry a major jurisdictional battle with the united farm workers ufw broke out in  and did not end until  the teamsters and ufw had both claimed jurisdiction over farm workers for many years and in  had signed an agreement settling their differences but decentralization of power within the union led several teamster leaders in california to repudiate this agreement without fitzsimmons permission and organize large numbers of field workers his hand forced fitzsimmons ordered teamsters contract negotiators to reopen the handful of contracts it had signed with california growers the ufw sued the aflcio condemned the action and many employers negotiated contracts with the teamsters rather than with the ufw the teamsters subsequently signed contracts which many denounced as sweetheart deals with more than  california growers although an agreement giving ufw jurisdiction over field workers and the teamsters jurisdiction over packing and warehouse workers was reached on september   fitzsimmons reneged on the agreement within a month and moved ahead with forming a farm workers regional union in california the organizing battles even became violent at times by  the ufw had won  elections and the teamsters  ufw membership had plummeted to just  from nearly  while the teamsters farmworker division counted  workers the ufw signed an agreement with fitzsimmons in march  in which the ufw agreed to seek to organize only those workers covered by the california agricultural labor relations act while the teamsters retained jurisdiction over some agricultural workers who had been covered by teamsters local union contracts prior to the formation of the ufw in october  fitzsimmons ended the longrunning jurisdictional dispute with the united brewery workers and the brewery workers merged with the teamsters in  congress passed legislation that deregulated the freight industry removing the interstate commerce commissions power to impose detailed regulatory tariffs on interstate carriers the union tried to fight deregulation by attempting to bribe senator howard cannon of nevada that attempt not only failed but resulted in the conviction in  of roy williams the general president who had succeeded fitzsimmons in  williams subsequently resigned in  as a condition of remaining free on bail while his appeal proceeded deregulation had catastrophic effects on the teamsters opening up the industry to competition from nonunion companies who sought to cut costs by avoiding unionization and curbing wages nearly  unionized carriers went out of business in the first few years of deregulation leaving thirty percent of teamsters in the freight division unemployed the remaining unionized carriers demanded concessions in wages work rules and hours williams successor jackie presser was prepared to grant most of these concessions in the form of a special freight relief rider that would cut wages by up to  percent and establish twotier wages teamsters for a democratic union which had grown out of efforts to reject the  freight agreement launched a successful national campaign to defeat the relief rider which was defeated by a vote of  to  the pressure on the freight industry and the national freight agreement continued however by the end of the s the national master freight agreement which had covered  drivers in the late s dropped to fewer than  with numerous local riders weakening it further in some areas internal and external challengesedit the decline in working conditions in the freight industry combined with longsimmering unhappiness among members employed by the united parcel service led to the development of two nationwide dissident groups within the union in the s teamsters for a democratic union tdu an assemblage of a number of local efforts and the professional drivers council better known as prod which began as a public interest group affiliated with ralph nader that was concerned with worker safety the two groups merged in  tdu was able to win some local offices within the union although the international union often attempted to make those victories meaningless by marginalizing the officer or the union tdu acquired greater prominence however with the election reforms forced on the union by the consent decree it had entered into in  on the eve of trial on a suit brought by the federal government under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico the decree required the direct election of international officers by the membership as tdu had been demanding for years leading up to the decree to replace the indirect election by delegates at the unions convention while the delegates at the unions  convention balked at amending the constitution they ultimately capitulated under pressure from the government that consent decree might not have been possible however if it had not been for the testimony of roy williams who described in an affidavit he gave the government in return for a delay of his imprisonment his own dealings with organized crime as the secretarytreasurer of a local union in kansas city and as an officer of the international union the decree also gave the government the power to install an independent review board with the power to expel any member of the union for conduct unbecoming to the union which the irb proceeded to exercise far more aggressively than the teamsters officials who had agreed to the decree had expected while the government was pursuing a civil case against the union as an entity it was also indicting presser who had succeeded williams as general president for embezzling from two different local unions in cleveland prior to his election as president presser resigned in  but died before his trial was scheduled to begin he was succeeded by william j mccarthy who came from the same local that dan tobin had led eighty years earlier the independent review board irb is a threemember panel established to investigate and take appropriate action with respect to any allegations of corruption any allegations of domination or control or influence of any part of the union by organized crime and any failure to cooperate fully with the irb recent historyedit a teamsters gathering at the yearlykos

president in the unions history defeating two old guard candidates rv durham and walter shea careys slate supported by tdu also won nearly all of the seats on the international executive board carey acquired a fair amount of influence within the aflcio which had readmitted the teamsters in  carey was close with the new leadership elected in  particularly richard trumka of the united mine workers of america who became secretarytreasurer of the aflcio under john sweeney carey had also swung the teamsters support behind the democratic party a change from past administrations that had supported the republican party the new administration set out to break from the past in other ways making energetic efforts to head off a vote to oust the union as representative of northwest airlines flight attendants negotiating a breakthrough agreement covering carhaulers and supporting local strikes such as the one against diamond walnut to restore the unions strength the carey administration did not on the other hand have much power in the lower reaches of the teamster hierarchy all of the large regional conferences were run by old guard officers as were most of the locals disagreements between those two camps led the old guard to campaign against the carey administrations proposed dues increase the carey administration retaliated by dissolving the regional conferences calling them expensive redundancies and fiefdoms for old guard union officers and rearranging the boundaries of some joint councils that had fought against the dues increase the opposition responded by uniting around a single candidate james p hoffa son of james r hoffa to run against carey in  hoffa ran a strong campaign trading on the mystique still attached to his late fathers name and promising to restore those days of glory carey appeared however to have won a close election shortly afterward in  the union initiated a large and successful strike against ups the parcel services department by that time had become the largest division in the union carey was removed from the unions leadership by the irb shortly thereafter when evidence that individuals in his office had arranged for transfer of several thousand dollars to an outside contractor which then arranged for another entity to make an equivalent contribution to the carey campaign carey was indicted for lying to investigators about his campaign funding but was acquitted of all charges in a  trial in the  election to succeed carey james p hoffa was elected handily he became president of the teamsters on march   and took the union in a more moderate direction tempering the unions support for democrats and attempting to come to terms with powerful republicans in congress the union has merged in recent years with a number of unions from other industries including the graphic communications international union a printing industry union and the brotherhood of maintenance of way employes and brotherhood of locomotive engineers both from the railway industry on july   the teamsters disaffiliated from the aflcio and became a founding member of the new national trade union center the change to win federation in  ups many employees of which are members of the teamsters lobbied to have language added to the faa reauthorization act of  hr  to change how ups and fedex compete with one another in response fedex launched a large online advertising campaign aimed at ups and the teamsters called stop the brown bailout internal teamsters politicsedit prior to the s no longlived caucuses existed within the teamsters union challengers for office ran on their personal appeal and individual power base rather than on caucus or party platforms and such challenges were infrequent the teamster leadership was wellestablished and somewhat selfperpetuating and challengers only rarely achieved victories at the local and even less frequently regional levels this changed in the s a national wildcat strike challenged president frank fitzsimmons control over the union but failed after the strike a reform movement known as teamsters united rank and file turf formed to continue to challenge against the unions national leadership but turf collapsed after a few years due to internal dissent in  two new caucuses formed teamsters for a decent contract tdc and upsurge both groups pushed the national leadership for a vastly improved contract at the ups freight and shipping company in  a new formal caucus teamsters for a democratic union tdu formed when tdc and upsurge merged the new caucus goal was to make internal teamster governance more transparent and democratic which included giving rankandfile more of a say in the terms and approval of contracts in the s tdu occasionally won elections for positions on local councils but it was not until —when the tdu forced president jackie presser to withdraw and make changes to a concessionladen national master freight agreement—that tdu had a national impact tdu publicized the very centralized and not very transparent national union decisionmaking process criticized what it said was lack of member input into these decisions and published contract salary membership and other data critical of the national union leadership these criticisms led to another success for tdu with many tdu proposals finding their way into the  court decree in which the federal government took over of the teamsters although the tdu has never won the presidency of the national union as of mid it strongly supported ron carey for the presidency in  carey in turn adopted many of tdus reform proposals as part of his platform carey ran with nearly a full slate which included a candidate for secretarytreasurer and  vice presidencies rv durham leader of the teamsters in north carolina was considered the establishment candidate and frontrunner in the campaign he had the backing of a majority of the unions executive board a second candidate in the race walter shea was a veteran union staffer from washington dc carey won with  percent of the vote to durhams  percent and sheas  percent turnout was low only about  percent of the unions total membership careys election sociologist charlotte ryan says was another success for tdu even though carey was not a tdu candidate carey won reelection in  in a corrupt election defeating james p hoffa son of the former union president prior to entering the race hoffa formed a caucus of his own the hoffa unity slate to counter the grassroots organizing of tdu and carey carey was later ousted as union president by us government officials a rerun election in  saw hoffa and the unity slate easily defeat tdu candidate tom leedham  percent to  percent with  percent turnout hoffa was reelected over leedham again running on the tdu platform in   percent to  percent leedham challenged hoffa and the hoffa unity slate a third time in  losing  percent to  percent with  percent turnout hoffa faced tdu candidate sandy pope a local union president in  also running with a full slate of officer and vice presidential candidates was former hoffa supporter and former national vice president fred gegare hoffa again easily won reelection earning  percent of the vote to gregares  percent and popes  percent the hoffa unity slate also won all five regional vice presidencies although the slates support declined

historyedit early historyedit cornelius shea first general president of the teamsters circa  the american federation of labor afl had helped form local unions of teamsters since  in november  the afl organized the team drivers international union tdiu in  a group of teamsters in chicago illinois broke from the tdiu and formed the teamsters national union unlike the tdiu which permitted large employers to be members the new teamsters national union permitted only employees teamster helpers and owneroperators owning only a single team to join and advocated higher wages and shorter hours more aggressively than the tdiu claiming more than  members in  locals its president albert young applied for membership in the afl the afl asked the tdiu to merge with youngs union to form a new aflaffiliated union and the two groups did so in  forming the international brotherhood of teamsters ibt and electing cornelius shea as the new unions first president the election process proved tumultuous shea effectively controlled the convention because the chicago locals—representing nearly half the ibts membership—supported for his candidacy en bloc shea was opposed by john sheridan president of the ice drivers union of chicago sheridan and george innes president of the tdiu accused shea of embezzlement in an attempt to prevent his election shea won the election on august   by a vote of  to  the new grouping elected edward l turley of chicago as secretarytreasurer and albert young as general organizer the union like most unions within the american federation of labor afl at the time had a largely decentralized structure with a number of local unions that governed themselves autonomously and tended to look only after their own interests in the geographical jurisdiction in which they operated the teamsters were vitally important to the labor movement for a strike or sympathy strike by the teamsters could paralyze the movement of goods throughout a city and bring a strike into nearly every neighborhood it also meant that teamsters leaders were able to demand bribes in order to avoid strikes and control of a teamsters local could bring organized crime significant revenues during sheas presidency the entire teamsters union was notoriously corrupt noted labor historian john r commons famously concluded that during this time the teamsters were less a union and more a criminal organization informal portrait of left to right cornelius p shea john miller fred mader and tim murphy sitting in a row in a courtroom in chicago illinois during a labor trial murphy was a politician union organizer and reputed gangster and he was murdered in  several major strikes occupied the union in its first three years in november  teamsters employed by the chicago city railway went out on strike shea attempted to stop sympathy strikes by other teamster locals but three locals walked out and eventually disaffiliated over the sympathystrike issue a sympathy strike in support of  striking meat cutters in chicago in july  led to riots before the extensive use of strikebreakers led shea to force his members back to work leading to the collapse of the meat cutters

 cities making the teamsters one of the largest unions in the united states in   teamsters struck in support of lockedout tailors at montgomery ward and eventually more than  teamsters manned the picket lines but when local newspapers discovered that shea was living in a local brothel kept a yearold waitress as a mistress and had spent the strike hosting parties public support for the strike collapsed and the strike ended on august   despite the revelations shea won reelection on august   by a vote of  to  shea was reelected again in  and  although significant challenges to his presidency occurred each time sheas first trial on charges stemming from the  montgomery ward strike ended in a mistrial however during the  reelection shea had promised that he would resign the presidency once his trial had ended but he did not and most union members withdrew their support for him daniel j tobin of boston was elected sheas successor by a vote of  to  in august  historic references to early freight transportation in the us refer to teamsters as those who drove teams of horses pulling huge wagons organizing and growth during the great depressionedit tobin was president of the teamsters from  to  although he faced opposition in his reelection races in   and  he never faced opposition again until his retirement in  the teamsters began to expand dramatically and mature organizationally under tobin he pushed for the development of joint councils to which all local unions were forced to affiliate varying in geographical and industrial jurisdiction the joint councils became important incubators for upandcoming leadership and negotiating master agreements which covered all employers in a given industry tobin also actively discouraged strikes in order to bring discipline to the union and encourage employers to sign contracts and founded and edited the union magazine the international teamster under tobin the teamsters also first developed the regional conference system developed by dave beck in seattle which provided stability organizing strength and leadership to the international union tobin undertook long jurisdictional battles with many unions during this period fierce disputes occurred between the teamsters and the gasoline state operators national council an afl federal union of gas station attendants the international longshoremens association the retail clerks international union and the brotherhood of railway clerks the most significant disagreement however was with the united brewery workers over the right to represent beer wagon drivers while the teamsters lost this battle in  when the afl awarded jurisdiction to the brewers they won when the issue came before the afl executive board again in  when the brewers were still recovering from their nearelimination during prohibition the raids and new member organizing in the s led to significant membership increases teamster membership stood at just  in  tobin took advantage of the wave of prounion sentiment engendered by the passage of the national industrial recovery act and by  union membership had increased nearly  percent to  by  tobin had a duespaying membership of —making the teamsters the fastestgrowing labor union in the united states one of the most significant events in union history occurred in  a group of radicals in local  in minneapolis—led by farrell dobbs carl skoglund and the dunne brothers ray miles and grant all members of the trotskyist communist league of america—began successfully organizing coal truck drivers in the winter of  tobin an ardent anticommunist opposed their efforts and refused to support their  strike local  struck again in  leading to several riots over a nineday period in may when the employers association reneged on the agreement local  resumed the strike although it ended again after nine days when martial law was declared by governor floyd b olson although local  won a contract recognizing the union and which broke the back of the antiunion citizens alliance in minneapolis tobin expelled local  from the teamsters member outrage was extensive and in august  he was forced to recharter the local as  within a year the newly formed local  had organized  truckers in the midwest and formed the central conference of teamsters extensive organizing also occurred in the west harry bridges radical leader of the international longshoremens and warehousemens union ilwu was leading the march inland—an attempt to organize warehouse workers away from shipping ports alarmed by bridges radical politics and worried that the ilwu would encroach on teamster jurisdictions dave beck formed a large regional organization the western conference of teamsters to engage in fierce organizing battles and membership raids against the ilwu which led to the establishment of many new locals and the organization of tens of thousands of new members but corruption became even more widespread in the teamsters during the tobin administration by  the union was considered the most corrupt in the united states and the most abusive towards its own members tobin vigorously defended the union against such accusations but also instituted many constitutional and organizational changes and practices which made it easier for union officials to engage in criminal offenses world war ii and the postwar periodedit by the beginning of world war ii the teamsters was one of the most powerful unions in the country and teamster leaders influential in the corridors of power union membership had risen more than  percent between  and  to  in june  president franklin roosevelt appointed ibt president daniel j tobin to be the official white house liaison to organized labor and later that year chair of the labor division of the democratic national committee in  president roosevelt appointed tobin special representative to the united kingdom and charged him with investigating the state of the labor movement there tobin was considered three times for secretary of labor and twice refused the post—in  and  on september   roosevelt gave his famous fala speech while campaigning in the  presidential election because of roosevelts strong relationship with tobin and the unions large membership the president delivered his speech before the teamster convention nonetheless teamsters members were restive dissident members of the union accused the leadership of suppressing democracy in the union a charge president tobin angrily denied over the next year tobin cracked down on dissidents and trusted several large locals led by his political opponents during world war ii the teamsters strongly endorsed the american labor movements nostrike pledge the teamsters agreed to cease raiding other unions and not strike for the duration of the national emergency president tobin even ordered teamsters members to cross picket lines put up by other unions nevertheless the national leadership sanctioned strikes by midwestern truckers in august  southern truckers in october  and brewery workers and milk delivery drivers in january  the teamsters did not however participate in the great postwar wave of labor strikes in the two years following the cessation of hostilities the teamsters struck only three times  truckers in new jersey struck for two weeks workers at ups struck nationwide for three weeks and workers at railway express agency struck for almost a month teamsters leaders strongly opposed enactment of the tafthartley act and repeatedly called for its repeal president tobin however was one of the first labor leaders to sign the noncommunist affidavit required by the law the great wave of organizing which the union engaged in during the great depression and the war significantly boosted the political power of a number of regional teamsters leaders and the leadership of the union engaged in a number of power struggles in the postwar period by  the unions membership had topped one million dave beck elected an international vicepresident in  was increasingly influential in the international union and tobin attempted to check his growing power but failed in  beck successfully overcame tobins opposition and won approval of an amendment to the unions constitution creating the post of executive vicepresident beck then won the  election to fill the position beck also successfully opposed in  a tobinbacked dues increase to fund new organizing the following year beck was able to demand the ouster of the editor of international teamster magazine and install his own man in the job in  beck allied with his longtime rival jimmy hoffa and effectively seized control of the union he announced a raid on the international association of machinists local at boeing although president dan tobin publicly repudiated becks actions beck had more than enough support from hoffa and other members of the executive board to force tobin to back down five months later beck won approval of a plan to dissolve the unions four divisions and replace them with  divisions organized around each of the major job categories in the unions membership in  tom hickey reformist leader of the teamsters in new york city won election to the teamsters executive board tobin needed becks support to prevent hickeys election and beck refused to give it on september   tobin announced he would step down as president of the teamsters at the end of his term at the unions  convention beck was elected general president and pushed through a number of changes intended to make it harder for a challenger to build the necessary majority to unseat a president or reject his policies influence of organized crimeedit beck was elected to the executive council of the afl on august   but his election generated a tremendous political battle between afl president george meany who supported his election and federation vice presidents who felt beck was corrupt and should not be elected to the post beck was the first teamster president to negotiate a nationwide master contract and a national grievance arbitration plan established organizing drives in the deep south and the east and built the current teamsters headquarters the marble palace in washington dc on louisiana avenue nw across a small plaza from the united states senate but his intervention in a construction and a milk strike both centered on new york city and refusal to intervene in a northeastern trucking strike created major political problems for him perceiving beck to be weak jimmy hoffa began challenging beck on various union decisions and policies in  with an eye to unseating him as general president in the regularly scheduled union elections in  infiltration by organized crime dominated the agenda of the teamsters throughout the s the teamsters had suffered from extensive corruption since its formation in  although the more extreme public forms of corruption had been eliminated after general president cornelius shea was removed from office the extent of corruption and control by organized crime increased during general president tobins time in office  to  in  the teamsters and unions in chicago even approached gangster roger touhy and asked for his protection from al capone and his chicago outfit which were seeking to control the areas unions evidence of widespread corruption within the teamsters began emerging shortly after tobin retired in kansas city corrupt teamsters locals spent years seeking bribes embezzling money and engaging in extensive extortion and labor rackets as well as beatings vandalism and even bombings in an attempt to control the construction and trucking industries the problem was so serious that the us house of representatives held hearings on the issue hoffas attempt to challenge beck caused a major national scandal which led to two congressional investigations several indictments for fraud and other crimes against beck and hoffa strict new federal legislation and regulations regarding labor unions and even helped launch the political career of robert f kennedy believing he needed additional votes to unseat beck in october  mobster johnny dio met with hoffa in new york city and the two men conspired to create as many as  paper locals to boost hoffas delegate totals when the paper locals applied for charters from the international union hoffas political foes were outraged a major battle broke out within the teamsters over whether to charter the locals and the media attention led to inquiries by the us department of justice and the permanent subcommittee on investigations of the us senate committee on government operations beck and other teamster leaders challenged the authority of the us senate to investigate the union which caused the senate to establish the select committee on improper activities in labor and management – a new committee with broad subpeona and investigative powers senator john l mcclellan chair of the select committee hired robert f kennedy as the subcommittees chief counsel and investigator the select committee also known as the mcclellan committee after its chairman exposed widespread corruption in the teamsters union dave beck fled the country for a month to avoid its subpoenas before returning four of the paper locals were dissolved to avoid committee scrutiny several teamster staffers were charged with contempt of congress and union records were lost or destroyed allegedly on purpose and wiretaps were played in public before a national television audience in which dio and hoffa discussed the creation of even more paper locals evidence was unearthed of a mobsponsored plot in which oregon teamsters unions would seize control of the state legislature state police and state attorney generals office through bribery extortion and blackmail initially members of the union did not believe the charges and support for beck was strong but after three months of continuous allegations of wrongdoing many rankandfile teamsters withdrew their support and openly called for beck to resign beck initially refused to address the allegations but broke his silence and denounced the committees inquiry on march  but even as the committee conducted its investigation the teamsters chartered even more paper locals in midmarch  jimmy hoffa was arrested for allegedly trying to bribe a senate aide hoffa denied the charges but the arrest triggered additional investigations and more arrests and indictments over the following weeks a week later beck admitted to receiving an interestfree  loan from the teamsters which he had never repaid and senate investigators claimed that loans to beck and other union officials and their businesses had cost the union more than  beck appeared before the select committee for the first time on march   and invoked his fifth amendment right against selfincrimination  times the mcclellan committee turned its focus to hoffa and other teamsters officials and presented testimony and evidence alleging widespread corruption in hoffacontrolled teamster units several historic legal developments came out of the select committees investigation the scandals uncovered by the mcclellan committee which affected not only the teamsters but several other unions led directly to the passage of the labormanagement reporting and disclosure act also known as the landrumgriffin act in  the right of union officials to exercise their fifth amendment rights was upheld and a significant refinement of constitutional law made when the us supreme court reaffirmed the right of union officials to not divulge the location of union records in curcio v united states  us   rankandfile anger over the mcclellan committees revelations eventually led beck to retire from the teamsters and allowed jimmy hoffa to take over immediately after his testimony in late march  beck won approval from the unions executive board to establish a  million fund to defend himself and the union from the committees allegations but member outrage at the expenditure was significant and permission to establish the fund rescinded member anger continued to grow throughout the spring and becks majority support on the executive board vanished beck was called before the mcclellan committee again in early may  and additional interestfree loans and other potentially illegal and unethical financial transactions exposed based on these revelations beck was indicted for tax evasion on may   becks legal troubles led him to retire and hoffa to win election to the union presidency support for beck among the membership evaporated beck announced on may  he would not run for reelection in october the announcement created chaos among the union leadership and despite additional indictments hoffa announced he would seek the presidency on july  rankandfile support for hoffa was strong although there were some attempts to organize an opposition candidate hoffas opponents asked a federal judge to postpone the election but the request was granted only temporarily and hoffa was duly elected general president of the union on october   beck offered to retire early to allow hoffa to take control of the union in december a federal district court barred hoffa from taking power unless he was acquitted in his wiretapping trial the ruling was upheld by a court of appeals but the trial ended in a hung jury on december   and hoffa assumed the presidency on february   the worsening corruption scandal led the aflcio to eject the teamsters aflcio president george meany worried that corruption scandals plaguing a number of unions at the time might lead to harsh regulation of unions or even the withdrawal of federal labor law protection began an anticorruption drive in april  new rules were enacted by the labor federations executive council that provided for the removal of vice presidents engaged in corruption as well as the ejection of unions considered corrupt the mcclellan committees investigation only worsened the dispute between the aflcio and the teamsters in january  the aflcio proposed a new rule which would bar officers of the federation from continuing to hold office if they exercised their fifth amendment rights in a corruption investigation beck opposed the new rule but the ethical practices committee of aflcio instituted rule on january   the teamsters were given  days to reform but beck retaliated by promising more raids on aflcio member unions if the union was ousted becks opposition prompted a successful move by meany to remove beck from aflcio executive council on grounds of corruption after extensive hearings and appeals which lasted from july to september  the aflcio voted on september   to eject the teamsters if the union did not institute reforms within  days beck refused to institute any reforms and the election of jimmy hoffa whom the aflcio considered as corrupt as beck led the labor federation to suspend the teamsters union on october   meany offered to keep the teamsters within the aflcio if hoffa resigned as president but hoffa refused and the formal expulsion occurred on december   the teamsters were not the only corrupt union in the aflcio by any means another was the international longshoremens association ila which represented stevedores in most east coast ports the teamsters had long desired to bring all shipping and transportation workers into the union so that no product could be moved anywhere in the us without it being touched by teamsters hands as the ila came under increasing attack for permitting corruption in its locals president beck sought to bring the ila into the teamsters the afl ousted the ila in september  and formed the international brotherhood of longshoremenafl iblafl to represent longshoremen on the great lakes and east coast the teamsters planned to raid the expelled union and may even have hoped to seize control of the iblafl beck undertook a campaign to bring the ila back into the afl in early  but the election of mob associate anthony tough tony anastasio as an ila vice president forced beck to end the effort but even as beck backed away from any ila deal jimmy hoffa secretly negotiated a major package of financial and staff aid to the ila and then went public with the deal – forcing beck to accept it as a fait accompli or risk embarrassing hoffa the aflcio threatened to expel the teamsters if it aided the ila beck fought hoffa over the ila aid package and won withdrawing the offer to the ila in the spring of  the ila was not the only union the teamsters sought to merge with the union attempted to merge with the mine mill  smelter workers in  but the effort failed the union also sought a merger with the brewery workers but the smaller union rejected the offer when the overture failed the teamsters raided the brewery workers leading to fierce protests by the cio raiding by the teamsters was such a serious issue that it prompted the afl and cio which had attempted to sign a noraid agreement for years to finally negotiate and implement such a pact in december  president beck initially refused to sign the agreement and threatened to take the teamsters out of the afl if forced to adhere to it three months after the pact was signed the teamsters agreed to submit to the terms of the noraid agreement shortly thereafter the afl adopted article  of its constitution which prevented its member unions from raiding one another the unions affection for raiding led it to initially oppose the aflcio merger in january  but it quickly reversed itself rise fall and disappearance of jimmy hoffaedit hoffa achieved his goal of unifying all freight drivers under a single collective bargaining agreement the national master freight agreement in  hoffa used the grievance procedures of the agreement which authorized selective strikes against particular employers to police the agreement or if hoffa thought that it served the unions interest to drive marginal employers out of the industry the union won substantial gains for its members fostering a nostalgic image of the hoffa era as the golden age for teamster drivers hoffa also succeeded where tobin had failed concentrating power at the international level dominating the conferences which beck and dobbs had helped build in addition hoffa was instrumental in using the assets of the teamsters pension plans particularly the central states plan to support mafia projects such as the development of las vegas in the s and s pension funds were loaned to finance las vegas casinos such as the stardust resort  casino the fremont hotel  casino the desert inn the dunes hotel and casino which was controlled by hoffas attorney morris shenker the four queens the aladdin hotel  casino circus circus and caesars palace the pension fund also made a number of loans to associates and relatives of highranking teamster officials a close associate of hoffa during this period was allen dorfman dorfman owned an insurance agency that provided insurance claims processing to the teamsters union and which was the subject of an investigation by the mcclellan committee dorfman also had increasing influence over loans made by the teamsters pension fund and after hoffa went to prison in  dorfman had primary control over the fund dorfman was murdered in january  shortly after his conviction along with teamsters president roy lee williams in a bribery case hoffa was moreover defiantly unwilling to reform the union or limit his own power in response to the attacks from robert f kennedy formerly chief counsel to the mcclellan committee then attorney general kennedys department of justice tried to convict hoffa for a variety of offenses over the s finally succeeding on a witness tampering charge in  with key testimony provided by teamsters business agent edward grady partin of baton rouge louisiana after exhausting his appeals hoffa entered prison in  hoffa installed frank fitzsimmons an associate from his days in local  in detroit to hold his place for him while he served time fitzsimmons however began to enjoy the exercise of power in hoffas absence in addition the organized crime figures around him found that he was more pliant than hoffa had been while president nixons pardon barred hoffa from resuming any role in the teamsters until  hoffa challenged the legality of that condition and planned to run again for presidency of the union but disappeared in  under mysterious circumstances he is presumed dead although his body has never been found decentralization deregulation and driftedit under general president frank fitzsimmons authority within the teamsters was decentralized back into the hands of regional joint council and local leaders while this helped solidify fitzsimmons own political position in the union it also made it more difficult for the union to act decisively on policy issues fitzsimmons also moved the unions political stands slowly to the left supporting universal health care an immediate end to the vietnam war urban renewal and community organizing in  fitzsimmons and united auto workers president walter reuther formed the alliance for labor action a new national trade union center which competed with the aflcio the alliance dissolved in  after reuthers death while the teamsters won rich national master contracts in trucking and package delivery in the s it did little to adapt to the changes occurring in the transportation industry a major jurisdictional battle with the united farm workers ufw broke out in  and did not end until  the teamsters and ufw had both claimed jurisdiction over farm workers for many years and in  had signed an agreement settling their differences but decentralization of power within the union led several teamster leaders in california to repudiate this agreement without fitzsimmons permission and organize large numbers of field workers his hand forced fitzsimmons ordered teamsters contract negotiators to reopen the handful of contracts it had signed with california growers the ufw sued the aflcio condemned the action and many employers negotiated contracts with the teamsters rather than with the ufw the teamsters subsequently signed contracts which many denounced as sweetheart deals with more than  california growers although an agreement giving ufw jurisdiction over field workers and the teamsters jurisdiction over packing and warehouse workers was reached on september   fitzsimmons reneged on the agreement within a month and moved ahead with forming a farm workers regional union in california the organizing battles even became violent at times by  the ufw had won  elections and the teamsters  ufw membership had plummeted to just  from nearly  while the teamsters farmworker division counted  workers the ufw signed an agreement with fitzsimmons in march  in which the ufw agreed to seek to organize only those workers covered by the california agricultural labor relations act while the teamsters retained jurisdiction over some agricultural workers who had been covered by teamsters local union contracts prior to the formation of the ufw in october  fitzsimmons ended the longrunning jurisdictional dispute with the united brewery workers and the brewery workers merged with the teamsters in  congress passed legislation that deregulated the freight industry removing the interstate commerce commissions power to impose detailed regulatory tariffs on interstate carriers the union tried to fight deregulation by attempting to bribe senator howard cannon of nevada that attempt not only failed but resulted in the conviction in  of roy williams the general president who had succeeded fitzsimmons in  williams subsequently resigned in  as a condition of remaining free on bail while his appeal proceeded deregulation had catastrophic effects on the teamsters opening up the industry to competition from nonunion companies who sought to cut costs by avoiding unionization and curbing wages nearly  unionized carriers went out of business in the first few years of deregulation leaving thirty percent of teamsters in the freight division unemployed the remaining unionized carriers demanded concessions in wages work rules and hours williams successor jackie presser was prepared to grant most of these concessions in the form of a special freight relief rider that would cut wages by up to  percent and establish twotier wages teamsters for a democratic union which had grown out of efforts to reject the  freight agreement launched a successful national campaign to defeat the relief rider which was defeated by a vote of  to  the pressure on the freight industry and the national freight agreement continued however by the end of the s the national master freight agreement which had covered  drivers in the late s dropped to fewer than  with numerous local riders weakening it further in some areas internal and external challengesedit the decline in working conditions in the freight industry combined with longsimmering unhappiness among members employed by the united parcel service led to the development of two nationwide dissident groups within the union in the s teamsters for a democratic union tdu an assemblage of a number of local efforts and the professional drivers council better known as prod which began as a public interest group affiliated with ralph nader that was concerned with worker safety the two groups merged in  tdu was able to win some local offices within the union although the international union often attempted to make those victories meaningless by marginalizing the officer or the union tdu acquired greater prominence however with the election reforms forced on the union by the consent decree it had entered into in  on the eve of trial on a suit brought by the federal government under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico the decree required the direct election of international officers by the membership as tdu had been demanding for years leading up to the decree to replace the indirect election by delegates at the unions convention while the delegates at the unions  convention balked at amending the constitution they ultimately capitulated under pressure from the government that consent decree might not have been possible however if it had not been for the testimony of roy williams who described in an affidavit he gave the government in return for a delay of his imprisonment his own dealings with organized crime as the secretarytreasurer of a local union in kansas city and as an officer of the international union the decree also gave the government the power to install an independent review board with the power to expel any member of the union for conduct unbecoming to the union which the irb proceeded to exercise far more aggressively than the teamsters officials who had agreed to the decree had expected while the government was pursuing a civil case against the union as an entity it was also indicting presser who had succeeded williams as general president for embezzling from two different local unions in cleveland prior to his election as president presser resigned in  but died before his trial was scheduled to begin he was succeeded by william j mccarthy who came from the same local that dan tobin had led eighty years earlier the independent review board irb is a threemember panel established to investigate and take appropriate action with respect to any allegations of corruption any

president in the unions history defeating two old guard candidates rv durham and walter shea careys slate supported by tdu also won nearly all of the seats on the international executive board carey acquired a fair amount of influence within the aflcio which had readmitted the teamsters in  carey was close with the new leadership elected in  particularly richard trumka of the united mine workers of america who became secretarytreasurer of the aflcio under john sweeney carey had also swung the teamsters support behind the democratic party a change from past administrations that had supported the republican party the new administration set out to break from the past in other ways making energetic efforts to head off a vote to oust the union as representative of northwest airlines flight attendants negotiating a breakthrough agreement covering carhaulers and supporting local strikes such as the one against diamond walnut to restore the unions strength the carey administration did not on the other hand have much power in the lower reaches of the teamster hierarchy all of the large regional conferences were run by old guard officers as were most of the locals disagreements between those two camps led the old guard to campaign against the carey administrations proposed dues increase the carey administration retaliated by dissolving the regional conferences calling them expensive redundancies and fiefdoms for old guard union officers and rearranging the boundaries of some joint councils that had fought against the dues increase the opposition responded by uniting around a single candidate james p hoffa son of james r hoffa to run against carey in  hoffa ran a strong campaign trading on the mystique still attached to his late fathers name and promising to restore those days of glory carey appeared however to have won a close election shortly afterward in  the union initiated a large and successful strike against ups the parcel services department by that time had become the largest division in the union carey was removed from the unions leadership by the irb shortly thereafter when evidence that individuals in his office had arranged for transfer of several thousand dollars to an outside contractor which then arranged for another entity to make an equivalent contribution to the carey campaign carey was indicted for lying to investigators about his campaign funding but was acquitted of all charges in a  trial in the  election to succeed carey james p hoffa was elected handily he became president of the teamsters on march   and took the union in a more moderate direction tempering the unions support for democrats and attempting to come to terms with powerful republicans in congress the union has merged in recent years with a number of unions

challengers for office ran on their personal appeal and individual power base rather than on caucus or party platforms and such challenges were infrequent the teamster leadership was wellestablished and somewhat selfperpetuating and challengers only rarely achieved victories at the local and even less frequently regional levels this changed in the s a national wildcat strike challenged president frank fitzsimmons control over the union but failed after the strike a reform movement known as teamsters united rank and file turf formed to continue to challenge against the unions national leadership but turf collapsed after a few years due to internal dissent in  two new caucuses formed teamsters for a decent contract tdc and upsurge both groups pushed the national leadership for a vastly improved contract at the ups freight and shipping company in  a new formal caucus teamsters for a democratic union tdu formed when tdc and upsurge merged the new caucus goal was to make internal teamster governance more transparent and democratic which included giving rankandfile more of a say in the terms and approval of contracts in the s tdu occasionally won elections for positions on local councils but it was not until —when the tdu forced president jackie presser to withdraw and make changes to a concessionladen national master freight agreement—that tdu had a national impact tdu publicized the very centralized and not very transparent national union decisionmaking process criticized what it said was lack of member input into these decisions and published contract salary membership and other data critical of the national union leadership these criticisms led to another success for tdu with many tdu proposals finding their way into the  court decree in which the federal government took over of the teamsters although the tdu has never won the presidency of the national union as of mid it strongly supported ron carey for the presidency in  carey in turn adopted many of tdus reform proposals as part of his platform carey ran with nearly a full slate which included a candidate for secretarytreasurer and  vice presidencies rv durham leader of the

historyedit early historyedit cornelius shea first general president of the teamsters circa  the american federation of labor afl had helped form local unions of teamsters since  in november  the afl organized the team drivers international union tdiu in  a group of teamsters in chicago illinois broke from the tdiu and formed the teamsters national union unlike the tdiu which permitted large employers to be members the new teamsters national union permitted only employees teamster helpers and owneroperators owning only a single team to join and advocated higher wages and shorter hours more aggressively than the tdiu claiming more than  members in  locals its president albert young applied for membership in the afl the afl asked the tdiu to merge with youngs union to form a new aflaffiliated union and the two groups did so in  forming the international brotherhood of teamsters ibt and electing cornelius shea as the new unions first president the election process proved tumultuous shea effectively controlled the convention because the chicago locals—representing nearly half the ibts membership—supported for his candidacy en bloc shea was opposed by john sheridan president of the ice drivers union of chicago sheridan and george innes president of the tdiu accused shea of embezzlement in an attempt to prevent his election shea won the election on august   by a vote of  to  the new grouping elected edward l turley of chicago as secretarytreasurer and albert young as general organizer the union like most unions within the american federation of labor afl at the time had a largely decentralized structure with a number of local unions that governed themselves autonomously and tended to look only after their own interests in the geographical jurisdiction in which they operated the teamsters were vitally important to the labor movement for a strike or sympathy strike by the teamsters could paralyze the movement of goods throughout a city and bring a strike into nearly every neighborhood it also meant that teamsters leaders were able to demand bribes in order to avoid strikes and control of a teamsters local could bring organized crime significant revenues during sheas presidency the entire teamsters union was notoriously corrupt noted labor historian john r commons famously concluded that during this time the teamsters were less a union and more a criminal organization informal portrait of left to right cornelius p shea john miller fred mader and tim murphy sitting in a row in a courtroom in chicago illinois during a labor trial murphy was a politician union organizer and reputed gangster and he was murdered in  several major strikes occupied the union in its first three years in november  teamsters employed by the chicago city railway went out on strike shea attempted to stop sympathy strikes by other teamster locals but three locals walked out and eventually disaffiliated over the sympathystrike issue a sympathy strike in support of  striking meat cutters in chicago in july  led to riots before the extensive use of strikebreakers led shea to force his members back to work leading to the collapse of the meat cutters strike in the midst of the strife in  the teamsters convention in cincinnati ohio reelected shea by acclamation on august   under his leadership the union had expanded to nearly  members in  locals in  cities making the teamsters one of the largest unions in the united states in   teamsters struck in support of lockedout tailors at montgomery ward and eventually more than  teamsters manned the picket lines but when local newspapers discovered that shea was living in a local brothel kept a yearold waitress as a mistress and had spent the strike hosting parties public support for the strike collapsed and the strike ended on august   despite the revelations shea won reelection on august   by a vote of  to  shea was reelected again in  and  although significant challenges to his presidency occurred each time sheas first trial on charges stemming from the  montgomery ward strike ended in a mistrial however during the  reelection shea had promised that he would resign the presidency once his trial had ended but he did not and most union members withdrew their support for him daniel j tobin of boston was elected sheas successor by a vote of  to  in august  historic references to early freight transportation in the us refer to teamsters as those who drove teams of horses pulling huge wagons organizing and growth during the great depressionedit tobin was president of the teamsters from  to  although he faced opposition in his reelection races in   and  he never faced opposition again until his retirement in  the teamsters began to expand dramatically and mature organizationally under tobin he pushed for the development of joint councils to which all local unions were forced to affiliate varying in geographical and industrial jurisdiction the joint councils became important incubators for upandcoming leadership and negotiating master agreements which covered all employers in a given industry tobin also actively discouraged strikes in order to bring discipline to the union and encourage employers to sign contracts and founded and edited the union magazine the international teamster under tobin the teamsters also first developed the regional conference system developed by dave beck in seattle which provided stability organizing strength and leadership to the international union tobin undertook long jurisdictional battles with many unions during this period fierce disputes occurred between the teamsters and the gasoline state operators national council an afl federal union of gas station attendants the international longshoremens association the retail clerks international union and the brotherhood of railway clerks the most significant disagreement however was with the united brewery workers over the right to represent beer wagon drivers while the teamsters lost this battle in  when the afl awarded jurisdiction to the brewers they won when the issue came before the afl executive board again in  when the brewers were still recovering from their nearelimination during prohibition the raids and new member organizing in the s led to significant membership increases teamster membership stood at just  in  tobin took advantage of the wave of prounion sentiment engendered by the passage of the national industrial recovery act and by  union membership had increased nearly  percent to  by  tobin had a duespaying membership of —making the teamsters the fastestgrowing labor union in the united states one of the most significant events in union history occurred in  a group of radicals in local  in minneapolis—led by farrell dobbs carl skoglund and the dunne brothers ray miles and grant all members of the trotskyist communist league of america—began successfully organizing coal truck drivers in the winter of  tobin an ardent anticommunist opposed their efforts and refused to support their  strike local  struck again in  leading to several riots over a nineday period in may when the employers association reneged on the agreement local  resumed the strike although it ended again after nine days when martial law was declared by governor floyd b olson although local  won a contract recognizing the union and which broke the back of the antiunion citizens alliance in minneapolis tobin expelled local  from the teamsters member outrage was extensive and in august  he was forced to recharter the local as  within a year the newly formed local  had organized  truckers in the midwest and formed the central conference of teamsters extensive organizing also occurred in the west harry bridges radical leader of the international longshoremens and warehousemens union ilwu was leading the march inland—an attempt to organize warehouse workers away from shipping ports alarmed by bridges radical politics and worried that the ilwu would encroach on teamster jurisdictions dave beck formed a large regional organization the western conference of teamsters to engage in fierce organizing battles and membership raids against the ilwu which led to the establishment of many new locals and the organization of tens of thousands of new members but corruption became even more widespread in the teamsters during the tobin administration by  the union was considered the most corrupt in the united states and the most abusive towards its own members tobin vigorously defended the union against such accusations but also instituted many constitutional and organizational changes and practices which made it easier for union officials to engage in criminal offenses world war ii and the postwar periodedit by the beginning of world war ii the teamsters was one of the most powerful unions in the country and teamster leaders influential in the corridors of power union membership had risen more than  percent between  and  to  in june  president franklin roosevelt appointed ibt president daniel j tobin to be the official white house liaison to organized labor and later that year chair of the labor division of the democratic national committee in  president roosevelt appointed tobin special representative to the united kingdom and charged him with investigating the state of the labor movement there tobin was considered three times for secretary of labor and twice refused the post—in  and  on september   roosevelt gave his famous fala speech while campaigning in the  presidential election because of roosevelts strong relationship with tobin and the unions large membership the president delivered his speech before the teamster convention nonetheless teamsters members were restive dissident members of the union accused the leadership of suppressing democracy in the union a charge president tobin angrily denied over the next year tobin cracked down on dissidents and trusted several large locals led by his political opponents during world war ii the teamsters strongly endorsed the american labor movements nostrike pledge the teamsters agreed to cease raiding other unions and not strike for the duration of the national emergency president tobin even ordered teamsters members to cross picket lines put up by other unions nevertheless the national leadership sanctioned strikes by midwestern truckers in august  southern truckers in october  and brewery workers and milk delivery drivers in january  the teamsters did not however participate in the great postwar wave of labor strikes in the two years following the cessation of hostilities the teamsters struck only three times  truckers in new jersey struck for two weeks workers at ups struck nationwide for three weeks and workers at railway express agency struck for almost a month teamsters leaders strongly opposed enactment of the tafthartley act and repeatedly called for its repeal president tobin however was one of the first labor leaders to sign the noncommunist affidavit required by the law the great wave of organizing which the union engaged in during the great depression and the war significantly boosted the political power of a number of regional teamsters leaders and the leadership of the union engaged in a number of power struggles in the postwar period by  the unions membership had topped one million dave beck elected an international vicepresident in  was increasingly influential in the international union and tobin attempted to check his growing power but failed in  beck successfully overcame tobins opposition and won approval of an amendment to the unions constitution creating the post of executive vicepresident beck then won the  election to fill the position beck also successfully opposed in  a tobinbacked dues increase to fund new organizing the following year beck was able to demand the ouster of the editor of international teamster magazine and install his own man in the job in  beck allied with his longtime rival jimmy hoffa and effectively seized control of the union he announced a raid on the international association of machinists local at boeing although president dan tobin publicly repudiated becks actions beck had more than enough support from hoffa and other members of the executive board to force tobin to back down five months later beck won approval of a plan to dissolve the unions four divisions and replace them with  divisions organized around each of the major job categories in the unions membership in  tom hickey reformist leader of the teamsters in new york city won election to the teamsters executive board tobin needed becks support to prevent hickeys election and beck refused to give it on september   tobin announced he would step down as president of the teamsters at the end of his term at the unions  convention beck was elected general president and pushed through a number of changes intended to make it harder for a challenger to build the necessary majority to unseat a president or reject his policies influence of organized crimeedit beck was elected to the executive council of the afl on august   but his election generated a tremendous political battle between afl president george meany who supported his election and federation vice presidents who felt beck was corrupt and should not be elected to the post beck was the first teamster president to negotiate a nationwide master contract and a national grievance arbitration plan established organizing drives in the deep south and the east and built the current teamsters headquarters the marble palace in washington dc on louisiana avenue nw across a small plaza from the united states senate but his intervention in a construction and a milk strike both centered on new york city and refusal to intervene in a northeastern trucking strike created major political problems for him perceiving beck to be weak jimmy hoffa began challenging beck on various union decisions and policies in  with an eye to unseating him as general president in the regularly scheduled union elections in  infiltration by organized crime dominated the agenda of the teamsters throughout the s the teamsters had suffered from extensive corruption since its formation in  although the more extreme public forms of corruption had been eliminated after general president cornelius shea was removed from office the extent of corruption and control by organized crime increased during general president tobins time in office  to  in  the teamsters and unions in chicago even approached gangster roger touhy and asked for his protection from al capone and his chicago outfit which were seeking to control the areas unions evidence of widespread corruption within the teamsters began emerging shortly after tobin retired in kansas city corrupt teamsters locals spent years seeking bribes embezzling money and engaging in extensive extortion and labor rackets as well as beatings vandalism and even bombings in an attempt to control the construction and trucking industries the problem was so serious that the us house of representatives held hearings on the issue hoffas attempt to challenge beck caused a major national scandal which led to two congressional investigations several indictments for fraud and other crimes against beck and hoffa strict new federal legislation and regulations regarding labor unions and even helped launch the political career of robert f kennedy believing he needed additional votes to unseat beck in october  mobster johnny dio met with hoffa in new york city and the two men conspired to create as many as  paper locals to boost hoffas delegate totals when the paper locals applied for charters from the international union hoffas political foes were outraged a major battle broke out within the teamsters over whether to charter the locals and the media attention led to inquiries by the us department of justice and the permanent subcommittee on investigations of the us senate committee on government operations beck and other teamster leaders challenged the authority of the us senate to investigate the union which caused the senate to establish the select committee on improper activities in labor and management – a new committee with broad subpeona and investigative powers senator john l mcclellan chair of the select committee hired robert f kennedy as the subcommittees chief counsel and investigator the select committee also known as the mcclellan committee after its chairman exposed widespread corruption in the teamsters union dave beck fled the country for a month to avoid its subpoenas before returning four of the paper locals were dissolved to avoid committee scrutiny several teamster staffers were charged with contempt of congress and union records were lost or destroyed allegedly on purpose and wiretaps were played in public before a national television audience in which dio and hoffa discussed the creation of even more paper locals evidence was unearthed of a mobsponsored plot in which oregon teamsters unions would seize control of the state legislature state police and state attorney generals office through bribery extortion and blackmail initially members of the union did not believe the charges and support for beck was strong but after three months of continuous allegations of wrongdoing many rankandfile teamsters withdrew their support and openly called for beck to resign beck initially refused to address the allegations but broke his silence and denounced the committees inquiry on march  but even as the committee conducted its investigation the teamsters chartered even more paper locals in midmarch  jimmy hoffa was arrested for allegedly trying to bribe a senate aide hoffa denied the charges but the arrest triggered additional investigations and more arrests and indictments over the following weeks a week later beck admitted to receiving an interestfree  loan from the teamsters which he had never repaid and senate investigators claimed that loans to beck and other union officials and their businesses had cost the union more than  beck appeared before the select committee for the first time on march   and invoked his fifth amendment right against selfincrimination  times the mcclellan committee turned its focus to hoffa and other teamsters officials and presented testimony and evidence alleging widespread corruption in hoffacontrolled teamster units several historic legal developments came out of the select committees investigation the scandals uncovered by the mcclellan committee which affected not only the teamsters but several other unions led directly to the passage of the labormanagement reporting and disclosure act also known as the landrumgriffin act in  the right of union officials to exercise their fifth amendment rights was upheld and a significant refinement of constitutional law made when the us supreme court reaffirmed the right of union officials to not divulge the location of union records in curcio v united states  us   rankandfile anger over the mcclellan committees revelations eventually led beck to retire from the teamsters and allowed jimmy hoffa to take over immediately after his testimony in late march  beck won approval from the unions executive board to establish a  million fund to defend himself and the union from the committees allegations but member outrage at the expenditure was significant and permission to establish the fund rescinded member anger continued to grow throughout the spring and becks majority support on the executive board vanished beck was called before the mcclellan committee again in early may  and additional interestfree loans and other potentially illegal and unethical financial transactions exposed based on these revelations beck was indicted for tax evasion on may   becks legal troubles led him to retire and hoffa to win election to the union presidency support for beck among the membership evaporated beck announced on may  he would not run for reelection in october the announcement created chaos among the union leadership and despite additional indictments hoffa announced he would seek the presidency on july  rankandfile support for hoffa was strong although there were some attempts to organize an opposition candidate hoffas opponents asked a federal judge to postpone the election but the request was granted only temporarily and hoffa was duly elected general president of the union on october   beck offered to retire early to allow hoffa to take control of the union in december a federal district court barred hoffa from taking power unless he was acquitted in his wiretapping trial the ruling was upheld by a court of appeals but the trial ended in a hung jury on december   and hoffa assumed the presidency on february   the worsening corruption scandal led the aflcio to eject the teamsters aflcio president george meany worried that corruption scandals plaguing a number of unions at the time might lead to harsh regulation of unions or even the withdrawal of federal labor law protection began an anticorruption drive in april  new rules were enacted by the labor federations executive council that provided for the removal of vice presidents engaged in corruption as well as the ejection of unions considered corrupt the mcclellan committees investigation only worsened the dispute between the aflcio and the teamsters in january  the aflcio proposed a new rule which would bar officers of the federation from continuing to hold office if they exercised their fifth amendment rights in a corruption investigation beck opposed the new rule but the ethical practices committee of aflcio instituted rule on january   the teamsters were given  days to reform but beck retaliated by promising more raids on aflcio member unions if the union was ousted becks opposition prompted a successful move by meany to remove beck from aflcio executive council on grounds of corruption after extensive hearings and appeals which lasted from july to september  the aflcio voted on september   to eject the teamsters if the union did not institute reforms within  days beck refused to institute any reforms and the election of jimmy hoffa whom the aflcio considered as corrupt as beck led the labor federation to suspend the teamsters union on october   meany offered to keep the teamsters within the aflcio if hoffa resigned as president but hoffa refused and the formal expulsion occurred on december   the teamsters were not the only corrupt union in the aflcio by any means another was the international longshoremens association ila which represented stevedores in most east coast ports the teamsters had long desired to bring all shipping and transportation workers into the union so that no product could be moved anywhere in the us without it being touched by teamsters hands as the ila came under increasing attack for permitting corruption in its locals president beck sought to bring the ila into the teamsters the afl ousted the ila in september  and formed the international brotherhood of longshoremenafl iblafl to represent longshoremen on the great lakes and east coast the teamsters planned to raid the expelled union and may even have hoped to seize control of the iblafl beck undertook a campaign to bring the ila back into the afl in early  but the election of mob associate anthony tough tony anastasio as an ila vice president forced beck to end the effort but even as beck backed away from any ila deal jimmy hoffa secretly negotiated a major package of financial and staff aid to the ila and then went public with the deal – forcing beck to accept it as a fait accompli or risk embarrassing hoffa the aflcio threatened to expel the teamsters if it aided the ila beck fought hoffa over the ila aid package and won withdrawing the offer to the ila in the spring of  the ila was not the only union the teamsters sought to merge with the union attempted to merge with the mine mill  smelter workers in  but the effort failed the union also sought a merger with the brewery workers but the smaller union rejected the offer when the overture failed the teamsters raided the brewery workers leading to fierce protests by the cio raiding by the teamsters was such a serious issue that it prompted the afl and cio which had attempted to sign a noraid agreement for years to finally negotiate and implement such a pact in december  president beck initially refused to sign the agreement and threatened to take the teamsters out of the afl if forced to adhere to it three months after the pact was signed the teamsters agreed to submit to the terms of the noraid agreement shortly thereafter the afl adopted article  of its constitution which prevented its member unions from raiding one another the unions affection for raiding led it to initially oppose the aflcio merger in january  but it quickly reversed itself rise fall and disappearance of jimmy hoffaedit hoffa achieved his goal of unifying all freight drivers under a single collective bargaining agreement the national master freight agreement in  hoffa used the grievance procedures of the agreement which authorized selective strikes against particular employers to police the agreement or if hoffa thought that it served the unions interest to drive marginal employers out of the industry the union won substantial gains for its members fostering a nostalgic image of the hoffa era as the golden age for teamster drivers hoffa also succeeded where tobin had failed concentrating power at the international level dominating the conferences which beck and dobbs had helped build in addition hoffa was instrumental in using the assets of the teamsters pension plans particularly the central states plan to support mafia projects such as the development of las vegas in the s and s pension funds were loaned to finance las vegas casinos such as the stardust resort  casino the fremont hotel  casino the desert inn the dunes hotel and casino which was controlled by hoffas attorney morris shenker the four queens the aladdin hotel  casino circus circus and caesars palace the pension fund also made a number of loans to associates and relatives of highranking teamster officials a close associate of hoffa during this period was allen dorfman dorfman owned an insurance agency that provided insurance claims processing to the teamsters union and which was the subject of an investigation by the mcclellan committee dorfman also had increasing influence over loans made by the teamsters pension fund and after hoffa went to prison in  dorfman had primary control over the fund dorfman was murdered in january  shortly after his conviction along with teamsters president roy lee williams in a bribery case hoffa was moreover defiantly unwilling to reform the union or limit his own power in response to the attacks from robert f kennedy formerly chief counsel to the mcclellan committee then attorney general kennedys department of justice tried to convict hoffa for a variety of offenses over the s finally succeeding on a witness tampering charge in  with key testimony provided by teamsters business agent edward grady partin of baton rouge louisiana after exhausting his appeals hoffa entered prison in  hoffa installed frank fitzsimmons an associate from his days in local  in detroit to hold his place for him while he served time fitzsimmons however began to enjoy the exercise of power in hoffas absence in addition the organized crime figures around him found that he was more pliant than hoffa had been while president nixons pardon barred hoffa from resuming any role in the teamsters until  hoffa challenged the legality of that condition and planned to run again for presidency of the union but disappeared in  under mysterious circumstances he is presumed dead although his body has never been found decentralization deregulation and driftedit under general president frank fitzsimmons authority within the teamsters was decentralized back into the hands of regional joint council and local leaders while this helped solidify fitzsimmons own political position in the union it also made it more difficult for the union to act decisively on policy issues fitzsimmons also moved the unions political stands slowly to the left supporting universal health care an immediate end to the vietnam war urban renewal and community organizing in  fitzsimmons and united auto workers president walter reuther formed the alliance for labor action a new national trade union center which competed with the aflcio the alliance dissolved in  after reuthers death while the teamsters won rich national master contracts in trucking and package delivery in the s it did little to adapt to the changes occurring in the transportation industry a major jurisdictional battle with the united farm workers ufw broke out in  and did not end until  the teamsters and ufw had both claimed jurisdiction over farm workers for many years and in  had signed an agreement settling their differences but decentralization of power within the union led several teamster leaders in california to repudiate this agreement without fitzsimmons permission and organize large numbers of field workers his hand forced fitzsimmons ordered teamsters contract negotiators to reopen the handful of contracts it had signed with california growers the ufw sued the aflcio condemned the action and many employers negotiated contracts with the teamsters rather than with the ufw the teamsters subsequently signed contracts which many denounced as sweetheart deals with more than  california growers although an agreement giving ufw jurisdiction over field workers and the teamsters jurisdiction over packing and warehouse workers was reached on september   fitzsimmons reneged on the agreement within a month and moved ahead with forming a farm workers regional union in california the organizing battles even became violent at times by  the ufw had won  elections and the teamsters  ufw membership had plummeted to just  from nearly  while the teamsters farmworker division counted  workers the ufw signed an agreement with fitzsimmons in march  in which the ufw agreed to seek to organize only those workers covered by the california agricultural labor relations act while the teamsters retained jurisdiction over some agricultural workers who had been covered by teamsters local union contracts prior to the formation of the ufw in october  fitzsimmons ended the longrunning jurisdictional dispute with the united brewery workers and the brewery workers merged with the teamsters in  congress passed legislation that deregulated the freight industry removing the interstate commerce commissions power to impose detailed regulatory tariffs on interstate carriers the union tried to fight deregulation by attempting to bribe senator howard cannon of nevada that attempt not only failed but resulted in the conviction in  of roy williams the general president who had succeeded fitzsimmons in  williams subsequently resigned in  as a condition of remaining free on bail while his appeal proceeded deregulation had catastrophic effects on the teamsters opening up the industry to competition from nonunion companies who sought to cut costs by avoiding unionization and curbing wages nearly  unionized carriers went out of business in the first few years of deregulation leaving thirty percent of teamsters in the freight division unemployed the remaining unionized carriers demanded concessions in wages work rules and hours williams successor jackie presser was prepared to grant most of these concessions in the form of a special freight relief rider that would cut wages by up to  percent and establish twotier wages teamsters for a democratic union which had grown out of efforts to reject the  freight agreement launched a successful national campaign to defeat the relief rider which was defeated by a vote of  to  the pressure on the freight industry and the national freight agreement continued however by the end of the s the national master freight agreement which had covered  drivers in the late s dropped to fewer than  with numerous local riders weakening it further in some areas internal and external challengesedit the decline in working conditions in the freight industry combined with longsimmering unhappiness among members employed by the united parcel service led to the development of two nationwide dissident groups within the union in the s teamsters for a democratic union tdu an assemblage of a number of local efforts and the professional drivers council better known as prod which began as a public interest group affiliated with ralph nader that was concerned with worker safety the two groups merged in  tdu was able to win some local offices within the union although the international union often attempted to make those victories meaningless by marginalizing the officer or the union tdu acquired greater prominence however with the election reforms forced on the union by the consent decree it had entered into in  on the eve of trial on a suit brought by the federal government under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico the decree required the direct election of international officers by the membership as tdu had been demanding for years leading up to the decree to replace the indirect election by delegates at the unions convention while the delegates at the unions  convention balked at amending the constitution they ultimately capitulated under pressure from the government that consent decree might not have been possible however if it had not been for the testimony of roy williams who described in an affidavit he gave the government in return for a delay of his imprisonment his own dealings with organized crime as the secretarytreasurer of a local union in kansas city and as an officer of the international union the decree also gave the government the power to install an independent review board with the power to expel any member of the union for conduct unbecoming to the union which the irb proceeded to exercise far more aggressively than the teamsters officials who had agreed to the decree had expected while the government was pursuing a civil case against the union as an entity it was also indicting presser who had succeeded williams as general president for embezzling from two different local unions in cleveland prior to his election as president presser resigned in  but died before his trial was scheduled to begin he was succeeded by william j mccarthy who came from the same local that dan tobin had led eighty years earlier the independent review board irb is a threemember panel established to investigate and take appropriate action with respect to any allegations of corruption any allegations of domination or control or influence of any part of the union by organized crime and any failure to cooperate fully with the irb recent historyedit a teamsters gathering at the yearlykos

president in the unions history defeating two old guard candidates rv durham and walter shea careys slate supported by tdu also won nearly all of the seats on the international executive board carey acquired a fair amount of influence within the aflcio which had readmitted the teamsters in  carey was close with the new leadership elected in  particularly richard trumka of the united mine workers of america who became secretarytreasurer of the aflcio under john sweeney carey had also swung the teamsters support behind the democratic party a change from past administrations that had supported the republican party the new administration set out to break from the past in other ways making energetic efforts to head off a vote to oust the union as representative of northwest airlines flight attendants negotiating a breakthrough agreement covering carhaulers and supporting local strikes such as the one against diamond walnut to restore the unions strength the carey administration did not on the other hand have much power in the lower reaches of the teamster hierarchy all of the large regional conferences were run by old guard officers as were most of the locals disagreements between those two camps led the old guard to campaign against the carey administrations proposed dues increase the carey administration retaliated by dissolving the regional conferences calling them expensive redundancies and fiefdoms for old guard union officers and rearranging the boundaries of some joint councils that had fought against the dues increase the opposition responded by uniting around a single candidate james p hoffa son of james r hoffa to run against carey in  hoffa ran a strong campaign trading on the mystique still attached to his late fathers name and promising to restore those days of glory carey appeared however to have won a close election shortly afterward in  the union initiated a large and successful strike against ups the parcel services department by that time had become the largest division in the union carey was removed from the unions leadership by the irb shortly thereafter when evidence that individuals in his office had arranged for transfer of several thousand dollars to an outside contractor which then arranged for another entity to make an equivalent contribution to the carey campaign carey was indicted for lying to investigators about his campaign funding but was acquitted of all charges in a  trial in the  election to succeed carey james p hoffa was elected handily he became president of the teamsters on march   and took the union in a more moderate direction tempering the unions support for democrats and attempting to come to terms with powerful republicans in congress the union has merged in recent years with a number of unions from other industries including the graphic communications international union a printing industry union and the brotherhood of maintenance of way employes and brotherhood of locomotive engineers both from the railway industry on july   the teamsters disaffiliated from the aflcio and became a founding member of the new national trade union center the change to win federation in  ups many employees of which are members of the teamsters lobbied to have language added to the faa reauthorization act of  hr  to change how ups and fedex compete with one another in response fedex launched a large online advertising campaign aimed at ups and the teamsters called stop the brown bailout internal teamsters politicsedit prior to the s no longlived caucuses existed within the teamsters union challengers for office ran on their personal appeal and individual power base rather than on caucus or party platforms and such challenges were infrequent the teamster leadership was wellestablished and somewhat selfperpetuating and challengers only rarely achieved victories at the local and even less frequently regional levels this changed in the s a national wildcat strike challenged president frank fitzsimmons control over the union but failed after the strike a reform movement known as teamsters united rank and file turf formed to continue to challenge against the unions national leadership but turf collapsed after a few years due to internal dissent in  two new caucuses formed teamsters for a decent contract tdc and upsurge both groups pushed the national leadership for a vastly improved contract at the ups freight and shipping company in  a new formal caucus teamsters for a democratic union tdu formed when tdc and upsurge merged the new caucus goal was to make internal teamster governance more transparent and democratic which included giving rankandfile more of a say in the terms and approval of contracts in the s tdu occasionally won elections for positions on local councils but it was not until —when the tdu forced president jackie presser to withdraw and make changes to a concessionladen national master freight agreement—that tdu had a national impact tdu publicized the very centralized and not very transparent national union decisionmaking process criticized what it said was lack of member input into these decisions and published contract salary membership and other data critical of the national union leadership these criticisms led to another success for tdu with many tdu proposals finding their way into the  court decree in which the federal government took over of the teamsters although the tdu has never won the presidency of the national union as of mid it strongly supported ron carey for the presidency in  carey in turn adopted many of tdus reform proposals as part of his platform carey ran with nearly a full slate which included a candidate for secretarytreasurer and  vice presidencies rv durham leader of the teamsters in north carolina was considered the establishment candidate and frontrunner in the campaign he had the backing of a majority of the unions executive board a second candidate in the race walter shea was a veteran union staffer from washington dc carey won with  percent of the vote to durhams  percent and sheas  percent turnout was low only about  percent of the unions total membership careys election sociologist charlotte ryan says was another success for tdu even though carey was not a tdu candidate carey won reelection in  in a corrupt election defeating james p hoffa son of the former union president prior to entering the race hoffa formed a caucus of his own the hoffa unity slate to counter the grassroots organizing of tdu and carey carey was later ousted as union president by us government officials a rerun election in  saw hoffa and the unity slate easily defeat tdu candidate tom leedham  percent to  percent with  percent turnout hoffa was reelected over leedham again running on the tdu platform in   percent to  percent leedham challenged hoffa and the hoffa unity slate a third time in  losing  percent to  percent with  percent turnout hoffa faced tdu candidate sandy pope a local union president in  also running with a full slate of officer and vice presidential candidates was former hoffa supporter and former national vice president fred gegare hoffa again easily won reelection earning  percent of the vote to gregares  percent and popes  percent the hoffa unity slate also won all five regional vice presidencies although the slates support declined

historyedit early historyedit cornelius shea first general president of the teamsters circa  the american federation of labor afl had helped form local unions of teamsters since  in november  the afl organized the team drivers international union tdiu in  a group of teamsters in chicago illinois broke from the tdiu and formed the teamsters national union unlike the tdiu which permitted large employers to be members the new teamsters national union permitted only employees teamster helpers and owneroperators owning only a single team to join and advocated higher wages and shorter hours more aggressively than the tdiu claiming more than  members in  locals its president albert young applied for membership in the afl the afl asked the tdiu to merge with youngs union to form a new aflaffiliated union and the two groups did so in  forming the international brotherhood of teamsters ibt and electing cornelius shea as the new unions first president the election process proved tumultuous shea effectively controlled the convention because the chicago locals—representing nearly half the ibts membership—supported for his candidacy en bloc shea was opposed by john sheridan president of the ice drivers union of chicago sheridan and george innes president of the tdiu accused shea of embezzlement in an attempt to prevent his election shea won the election on august   by a vote of  to  the new grouping elected edward l turley of chicago as secretarytreasurer and albert young as general organizer the union like most unions within the american federation of labor afl at the time had a largely decentralized structure with a number of local unions that governed themselves autonomously and tended to look only after their own interests in the geographical jurisdiction in which they operated the teamsters were vitally important to the labor movement for a strike or sympathy strike by the teamsters could paralyze the movement of goods throughout a city and bring a strike into nearly every neighborhood it also meant that teamsters leaders were able to demand bribes in order to avoid strikes and control of a teamsters local could bring organized crime significant revenues during sheas presidency the entire teamsters union was notoriously corrupt noted labor historian john r commons famously concluded that during this time the teamsters were less a union and more a criminal organization informal portrait of left to right cornelius p shea john miller fred mader and tim murphy sitting in a row in a courtroom in chicago illinois during a labor trial murphy was a politician union organizer and reputed gangster and he was murdered in  several major strikes occupied the union in its first three years in november  teamsters employed by the chicago city railway went out on strike shea attempted to stop sympathy strikes by other teamster locals but three locals walked out and eventually disaffiliated over the sympathystrike issue a sympathy strike in support of  striking meat cutters in chicago in july  led to riots before the extensive use of strikebreakers led shea to force his members back to work leading to the collapse of the meat cutters strike in the midst of the strife in  the teamsters convention in cincinnati ohio reelected shea by acclamation on august   under his leadership the union had expanded to nearly  members in  locals in  cities making the teamsters one of the largest unions in the united states in   teamsters struck in support of lockedout tailors at montgomery ward and eventually more than  teamsters manned the picket lines but when local newspapers discovered that shea was living in a local brothel kept a yearold waitress as a mistress and had spent the strike hosting parties public support for the strike collapsed and the strike ended on august   despite the revelations shea won reelection on august   by a vote of  to  shea was reelected again in  and  although significant challenges to his presidency occurred each time sheas first trial on charges stemming from the  montgomery ward strike ended in a mistrial however during the  reelection shea had promised that he would resign the presidency once his trial had ended but he did not and most union members withdrew their support for him daniel j tobin of boston was elected sheas successor by a vote of  to  in august  historic references to early freight transportation in the us refer to teamsters as those who drove teams of horses pulling huge wagons organizing and growth during the great depressionedit tobin was president of the teamsters from  to  although he faced opposition in his reelection races in   and  he never faced opposition again until his retirement in  the teamsters began to expand dramatically and mature organizationally under tobin he pushed for the development of joint councils to which all local unions were forced to affiliate varying in geographical and industrial jurisdiction the joint councils became important incubators for upandcoming leadership and negotiating master agreements which covered all employers in a given industry tobin also actively discouraged strikes in order to bring discipline to the union and encourage employers to sign contracts and founded and edited the union magazine the international teamster under tobin the teamsters also first developed the regional conference system developed by dave beck in seattle which provided stability organizing strength and leadership to the international union tobin undertook long jurisdictional battles with many unions during this period fierce disputes occurred between the teamsters and the gasoline state operators national council an afl federal union of gas station attendants the international longshoremens association the retail clerks international union and the brotherhood of railway clerks the most significant disagreement however was with the united brewery workers over the right to represent beer wagon drivers while the teamsters lost this battle in  when the afl awarded jurisdiction to the brewers they won when the issue came before the afl executive board again in  when the brewers were still recovering from their nearelimination during prohibition the raids and new member organizing in the s led to significant membership increases teamster membership stood at just  in  tobin took advantage of the wave of prounion sentiment engendered by the passage of the national industrial recovery act and by  union membership had increased nearly  percent to  by  tobin had a duespaying membership of —making the teamsters the fastestgrowing labor union in the united states one of the most significant events in union history occurred in  a group of radicals in local  in minneapolis—led by farrell dobbs carl skoglund and the dunne brothers ray miles and grant all members of the trotskyist communist league of america—began successfully organizing coal truck drivers in the winter of  tobin an ardent anticommunist opposed their efforts and refused to support their  strike local  struck again in  leading to several riots over a nineday period in may when the employers association reneged on the agreement local  resumed the strike although it ended again after nine days when martial law was declared by governor floyd b olson although local  won a contract recognizing the union and which broke the back of the antiunion citizens alliance in minneapolis tobin expelled local  from the teamsters member outrage was extensive and in august  he was forced to recharter the local as  within a year the newly formed local  had organized  truckers in the midwest and formed the central conference of teamsters extensive organizing also occurred in the west harry bridges radical leader of the international longshoremens and warehousemens union ilwu was leading the march inland—an attempt to organize warehouse workers away from shipping ports alarmed by bridges radical politics and worried that the ilwu would encroach on teamster jurisdictions dave beck formed a large regional organization the western conference of teamsters to engage in fierce organizing battles and membership raids against the ilwu which led to the establishment of many new locals and the organization of tens of thousands of new members but corruption became even more widespread in the teamsters during the tobin administration by  the union was considered the most corrupt in the united states and the most abusive towards its own members tobin vigorously defended the union against such accusations but also instituted many constitutional and organizational changes and practices which made it easier for union officials to engage in criminal offenses world war ii and the postwar periodedit by the beginning of world war ii the teamsters was one of the most powerful unions in the country and teamster leaders influential in the corridors of power union membership had risen more than  percent between  and  to  in june  president franklin roosevelt appointed ibt president daniel j tobin to be the official white house liaison to organized labor and later that year chair of the labor division of the democratic national committee in  president roosevelt appointed tobin special representative to the united kingdom and charged him with investigating the state of the labor movement there tobin was considered three times for secretary of labor and twice refused the post—in  and  on september   roosevelt gave his famous fala speech while campaigning in the  presidential election because of roosevelts strong relationship with tobin and the unions large membership the president delivered his speech before the teamster convention nonetheless teamsters members were restive dissident members of the union accused the leadership of suppressing democracy in the union a charge president tobin angrily denied over the next year tobin cracked down on dissidents and trusted several large locals led by his political opponents during world war ii the teamsters strongly endorsed the american labor movements nostrike pledge the teamsters agreed to cease raiding other unions and not strike for the duration of the national emergency president tobin even ordered teamsters members to cross picket lines put up by other unions nevertheless the national leadership sanctioned strikes by midwestern truckers in august  southern truckers in october  and brewery workers and milk delivery drivers in january  the teamsters did not however participate in the great postwar wave of labor strikes in the two years following the cessation of hostilities the teamsters struck only three times  truckers in new jersey struck for two weeks workers at ups struck nationwide for three weeks and workers at railway express agency struck for almost a month teamsters leaders strongly opposed enactment of the tafthartley act and repeatedly called for its repeal president tobin however was one of the first labor leaders to sign the noncommunist affidavit required by the law the great wave of organizing which the union engaged in during the great depression and the war significantly boosted the political power of a number of regional teamsters leaders and the leadership of the union engaged in a number of power struggles in the postwar period by  the unions membership had topped one million dave beck elected an international vicepresident in  was increasingly influential in the international union and tobin attempted to check his growing power but failed in  beck successfully overcame tobins opposition and won approval of an amendment to the unions constitution creating the post of executive vicepresident beck then won the  election to fill the position beck also successfully opposed in  a tobinbacked dues increase to fund new organizing the following year beck was able to demand the ouster of the editor of international teamster magazine and install his own man in the job in  beck allied with his longtime rival jimmy hoffa and effectively seized control of the union he announced a raid on the international association of machinists local at boeing although president dan tobin publicly repudiated becks actions beck had more than enough support from hoffa and other members of the executive board to force tobin to back down five months later beck won approval of a plan to dissolve the unions four divisions and replace them with  divisions organized around each of the major job categories in the unions membership in  tom hickey reformist leader of the teamsters in new york city won election to the teamsters executive board tobin needed becks support to prevent hickeys election and beck refused to give it on september   tobin announced he would step down as president of the teamsters at the end of his term at the unions  convention beck was elected general president and pushed through a number of changes intended to make it harder for a challenger to build the necessary majority to unseat a president or reject his policies influence of organized crimeedit beck was elected to the executive council of the afl on august   but his election generated a tremendous political battle between afl president george meany who supported his election and federation vice presidents who felt beck was corrupt and should not be elected to the post beck was the first teamster president to negotiate a nationwide master contract and a national grievance arbitration plan established organizing drives in the deep south and the east and built the current teamsters headquarters the marble palace in washington dc on louisiana avenue nw across a small plaza from the united states senate but his intervention in a construction and a milk strike both centered on new york city and refusal to intervene in a northeastern trucking strike created major political problems for him perceiving beck to be weak jimmy hoffa began challenging beck on various union decisions and policies in  with an eye to unseating him as general president in the regularly scheduled union elections in  infiltration by organized crime dominated the agenda of the teamsters throughout the s the teamsters had suffered from extensive corruption since its formation in  although the more extreme public forms of corruption had been eliminated after general president cornelius shea was removed from office the extent of corruption and control by organized crime increased during general president tobins time in office  to  in  the teamsters and unions in chicago even approached gangster roger touhy and asked for his protection from al capone and his chicago outfit which were seeking to control the areas unions evidence of widespread corruption within the teamsters began emerging shortly after tobin retired in kansas city corrupt teamsters locals spent years seeking bribes embezzling money and engaging in extensive extortion and labor rackets as well as beatings vandalism and even bombings in an attempt to control the construction and trucking industries the problem was so serious that the us house of representatives held hearings on the issue hoffas attempt to challenge beck caused a major national scandal which led to two congressional investigations several indictments for fraud and other crimes against beck and hoffa strict new federal legislation and regulations regarding labor unions and even helped launch the political career of robert f kennedy believing he needed additional votes to unseat beck in october  mobster johnny dio met with hoffa in new york city and the two men conspired to create as many as  paper locals to boost hoffas delegate totals when the paper locals applied for charters from the international union hoffas political foes were outraged a major battle broke out within the teamsters over whether to charter the locals and the media attention led to inquiries by the us department of justice and the permanent subcommittee on investigations of the us senate committee on government operations beck and other teamster leaders challenged the authority of the us senate to investigate the union which caused the senate to establish the select committee on improper activities in labor and management – a new committee with broad subpeona and investigative powers senator john l mcclellan chair of the select committee hired robert f kennedy as the subcommittees chief counsel and investigator the select committee also known as the mcclellan committee after its chairman exposed widespread corruption in the teamsters union dave beck fled the country for a month to avoid its subpoenas before returning four of the paper locals were dissolved to avoid committee scrutiny several teamster staffers were charged with contempt of congress and union records were lost or destroyed allegedly on purpose and wiretaps were played in public before a national television audience in which dio and hoffa discussed the creation of even more paper locals evidence was unearthed of a mobsponsored plot in which oregon teamsters unions would seize control of the state legislature state police and state attorney generals office through bribery extortion and blackmail initially members of the union did not believe the charges and support for beck was strong but after three months of continuous allegations of wrongdoing many rankandfile teamsters withdrew their support and openly called for beck to resign beck initially refused to address the allegations but broke his silence and denounced the committees inquiry on march  but even as the committee conducted its investigation the teamsters chartered even more paper locals in midmarch  jimmy hoffa was arrested for allegedly trying to bribe a senate aide hoffa denied the charges but the arrest triggered additional investigations and more arrests and indictments over the following weeks a week later beck admitted to receiving an interestfree  loan from the teamsters which he had never repaid and senate investigators claimed that loans to beck and other union officials and their businesses had cost the union more than  beck appeared before the select committee for the first time on march   and invoked his fifth amendment right against selfincrimination  times the mcclellan committee turned its focus to hoffa and other teamsters officials and presented testimony and evidence alleging widespread corruption in hoffacontrolled teamster units several historic legal developments came out of the select committees investigation the scandals uncovered by the mcclellan committee which affected not only the teamsters but several other unions led directly to the passage of the labormanagement reporting and disclosure act also known as the landrumgriffin act in  the right of union officials to exercise their fifth amendment rights was upheld and a significant refinement of constitutional law made when the us supreme court reaffirmed the right of union officials to not divulge the location of union records in curcio v united states  us   rankandfile anger over the mcclellan committees revelations eventually led beck to retire from the teamsters and allowed jimmy hoffa to take over immediately after his testimony in late march  beck won approval from the unions executive board to establish a  million fund to defend himself and the union from the committees allegations but member outrage at the expenditure was significant and permission to establish the fund rescinded member anger continued to grow throughout the spring and becks majority support on the executive board vanished beck was called before the mcclellan committee again in early may  and additional interestfree loans and other potentially illegal and unethical financial transactions exposed based on these revelations beck was indicted for tax evasion on may   becks legal troubles led him to retire and hoffa to win election to the union presidency support for beck among the membership evaporated beck announced on may  he would not run for reelection in october the announcement created chaos among the union leadership and despite additional indictments hoffa announced he would seek the presidency on july  rankandfile support for hoffa was strong although there were some attempts to organize an opposition candidate hoffas opponents asked a federal judge to postpone the election but the request was granted only temporarily and hoffa was duly elected general president of the union on october   beck offered to retire early to allow hoffa to take control of the union in december a federal district court barred hoffa from taking power unless he was acquitted in his wiretapping trial the ruling was upheld by a court of appeals but the trial ended in a hung jury on december   and hoffa assumed the presidency on february   the worsening corruption scandal led the aflcio to eject the teamsters aflcio president george meany worried that corruption scandals plaguing a number of unions at the time might lead to harsh regulation of unions or even the withdrawal of federal labor law protection began an anticorruption drive in april  new rules were enacted by the labor federations executive council that provided for the removal of vice presidents engaged in corruption as well as the ejection of unions considered corrupt the mcclellan committees investigation only worsened the dispute between the aflcio and the teamsters in january  the aflcio proposed a new rule which would bar officers of the federation from continuing to hold office if they exercised their fifth amendment rights in a corruption investigation beck opposed the new rule but the ethical practices committee of aflcio instituted rule on january   the teamsters were given  days to reform but beck retaliated by promising more raids on aflcio member unions if the union was ousted becks opposition prompted a successful move by meany to remove beck from aflcio executive council on grounds of corruption after extensive hearings and appeals which lasted from july to september  the aflcio voted on september   to eject the teamsters if the union did not institute reforms within  days beck refused to institute any reforms and the election of jimmy hoffa whom the aflcio considered as corrupt as beck led the labor federation to suspend the teamsters union on october   meany offered to keep the teamsters within the aflcio if hoffa resigned as president but hoffa refused and the formal expulsion occurred on december   the teamsters were not the only corrupt union in the aflcio by any means another was the international longshoremens association ila which represented stevedores in most east coast ports the teamsters had long desired to bring all shipping and transportation workers into the union so that no product could be moved anywhere in the us without it being touched by teamsters hands as the ila came under increasing attack for permitting corruption in its locals president beck sought to bring the ila into the teamsters the afl ousted the ila in september  and formed the international brotherhood of longshoremenafl iblafl to represent longshoremen on the great lakes and east coast the teamsters planned to raid the expelled union and may even have hoped to seize control of the iblafl beck undertook a campaign to bring the ila back into the afl in early  but the election of mob associate anthony tough tony anastasio as an ila vice president forced beck to end the effort but even as beck backed away from any ila deal jimmy hoffa secretly negotiated a major package of financial and staff aid to the ila and then went public with the deal – forcing beck to accept it as a fait accompli or risk embarrassing hoffa the aflcio threatened to expel the teamsters if it aided the ila beck fought hoffa over the ila aid package and won withdrawing the offer to the ila in the spring of  the ila was not the only union the teamsters sought to merge with the union attempted to merge with the mine mill  smelter workers in  but the effort failed the union also sought a merger with the brewery workers but the smaller union rejected the offer when the overture failed the teamsters raided the brewery workers leading to fierce protests by the cio raiding by the teamsters was such a serious issue that it prompted the afl and cio which had attempted to sign a noraid agreement for years to finally negotiate and implement such a pact in december  president beck initially refused to sign the agreement and threatened to take the teamsters out of the afl if forced to adhere to it three months after the pact was signed the teamsters agreed to submit to the terms of the noraid agreement shortly thereafter the afl adopted article  of its constitution which prevented its member unions from raiding one another the unions affection for raiding led it to initially oppose the aflcio merger in january  but it quickly reversed itself rise fall and disappearance of jimmy hoffaedit hoffa achieved his goal of unifying all freight drivers under a single collective bargaining agreement the national master freight agreement in  hoffa used the grievance procedures of the agreement which authorized selective strikes against particular employers to police the agreement or if hoffa thought that it served the unions interest to drive marginal employers out of the industry the union won substantial gains for its members fostering a nostalgic image of the hoffa era as the golden age for teamster drivers hoffa also succeeded where tobin had failed concentrating power at the international level dominating the conferences which beck and dobbs had helped build in addition hoffa was instrumental in using the assets of the teamsters pension plans particularly the central states plan to support mafia projects such as the development of las vegas in the s and s pension funds were loaned to finance las vegas casinos such as the stardust resort  casino the fremont hotel  casino the desert inn the dunes hotel and casino which was controlled by hoffas attorney morris shenker the four queens the aladdin hotel  casino circus circus and caesars palace the pension fund also made a number of loans to associates and relatives of highranking teamster officials a close associate of hoffa during this period was allen dorfman dorfman owned an insurance agency that provided insurance claims processing to the teamsters union and which was the subject of an investigation by the mcclellan committee dorfman also had increasing influence over loans made by the teamsters pension fund and after hoffa went to prison in  dorfman had primary control over the fund dorfman was murdered in january  shortly after his conviction along with teamsters president roy lee williams in a bribery case hoffa was moreover defiantly unwilling to reform the union or limit his own power in response to the attacks from robert f kennedy formerly chief counsel to the mcclellan committee then attorney general kennedys department of justice tried to convict hoffa for a variety of offenses over the s finally succeeding on a witness tampering charge in  with key testimony provided by teamsters business agent edward grady partin of baton rouge louisiana after exhausting his appeals hoffa entered prison in  hoffa installed frank fitzsimmons an associate from his days in local  in detroit to hold his place for him while he served time fitzsimmons however began to enjoy the exercise of power in hoffas absence in addition the organized crime figures around him found that he was more pliant than hoffa had been while president nixons pardon barred hoffa from resuming any role in the teamsters until  hoffa challenged the legality of that condition and planned to run again for presidency of the union but disappeared in  under mysterious circumstances he is presumed dead although his body has never been found decentralization deregulation and driftedit under general president frank fitzsimmons authority within the teamsters was decentralized back into the hands of regional joint council and local leaders while this helped solidify fitzsimmons own political position in the union it also made it more difficult for the union to act decisively on policy issues fitzsimmons also moved the unions political stands slowly to the left supporting universal health care an immediate end to the vietnam war urban renewal and community organizing in  fitzsimmons and united auto workers president walter reuther formed the alliance for labor action a new national trade union center which competed with the aflcio the alliance dissolved in  after reuthers death while the teamsters won rich national master contracts in trucking and package delivery in the s it did little to adapt to the changes occurring in the transportation industry a major jurisdictional battle with the united farm workers ufw broke out in  and did not end until  the teamsters and ufw had both claimed jurisdiction over farm workers for many years and in  had signed an agreement settling their differences but decentralization of power within the union led several teamster leaders in california to repudiate this agreement without fitzsimmons permission and organize large numbers of field workers his hand forced fitzsimmons ordered teamsters contract negotiators to reopen the handful of contracts it had signed with california growers the ufw sued the aflcio condemned the action and many employers negotiated contracts with the teamsters rather than with the ufw the teamsters subsequently signed contracts which many denounced as sweetheart deals with more than  california growers although an agreement giving ufw jurisdiction over field workers and the teamsters jurisdiction over packing and warehouse workers was reached on september   fitzsimmons reneged on the agreement within a month and moved ahead with forming a farm workers regional union in california the organizing battles even became violent at times by  the ufw had won  elections and the teamsters  ufw membership had plummeted to just  from nearly  while the teamsters farmworker division counted  workers the ufw signed an agreement with fitzsimmons in march  in which the ufw agreed to seek to organize only those workers covered by the california agricultural labor relations act while the teamsters retained jurisdiction over some agricultural workers who had been covered by teamsters local union contracts prior to the formation of the ufw in october  fitzsimmons ended the longrunning jurisdictional dispute with the united brewery workers and the brewery workers merged with the teamsters in  congress passed legislation that deregulated the freight industry removing the interstate commerce commissions power to impose detailed regulatory tariffs on interstate carriers the union tried to fight deregulation by attempting to bribe senator howard cannon of nevada that attempt not only failed but resulted in the conviction in  of roy williams the general president who had succeeded fitzsimmons in  williams subsequently resigned in  as a condition of remaining free on bail while his appeal proceeded deregulation had catastrophic effects on the teamsters opening up the industry to competition from nonunion companies who sought to cut costs by avoiding unionization and curbing wages nearly  unionized carriers went out of business in the first few years of deregulation leaving thirty percent of teamsters in the freight division unemployed the remaining unionized carriers demanded concessions in wages work rules and hours williams successor jackie presser was prepared to grant most of these concessions in the form of a special freight relief rider that would cut wages by up to  percent and establish twotier wages teamsters for a democratic union which had grown out of efforts to reject the  freight agreement launched a successful national campaign to defeat the relief rider which was defeated by a vote of  to  the pressure on the freight industry and the national freight agreement continued however by the end of the s the national master freight agreement which had covered  drivers in the late s dropped to fewer than  with numerous local riders weakening it further in some areas internal and external challengesedit the decline in working conditions in the freight industry combined with longsimmering unhappiness among members employed by the united parcel service led to the development of two nationwide dissident groups within the union in the s teamsters for a democratic union tdu an assemblage of a number of local efforts and the professional drivers council better known as prod which began as a public interest group affiliated with ralph nader that was concerned with worker safety the two groups merged in  tdu was able to win some local offices within the union although the international union often attempted to make those victories meaningless by marginalizing the officer or the union tdu acquired greater prominence however with the election reforms forced on the union by the consent decree it had entered into in  on the eve of trial on a suit brought by the federal government under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico the decree required the direct election of international officers by the membership as tdu had been demanding for years leading up to the decree to replace the indirect election by delegates at the unions convention while the delegates at the unions  convention balked at amending the constitution they ultimately capitulated under pressure from the government that consent decree might not have been possible however if it had not been for the testimony of roy williams who described in an affidavit he gave the government in return for a delay of his imprisonment his own dealings with organized crime as the secretarytreasurer of a local union in kansas city and as an officer of the international union the decree also gave the government the power to install an independent review board with the power to expel any member of the union for conduct unbecoming to the union which the irb proceeded to exercise far more aggressively than the teamsters officials who had agreed to the decree had expected while the government was pursuing a civil case against the union as an entity it was also indicting presser who had succeeded williams as general president for embezzling from two different local unions in cleveland prior to his election as president presser resigned in  but died before his trial was scheduled to begin he was succeeded by william j mccarthy who came from the same local that dan tobin had led eighty years earlier the independent review board irb is a threemember panel established to investigate and take appropriate action with respect to any allegations of corruption any allegations of domination or control or influence of any part of the union by organized crime and any failure to cooperate fully with the irb recent historyedit a teamsters gathering at the yearlykos

president in the unions history defeating two old guard candidates rv durham and walter shea careys slate supported by tdu also won nearly all of the seats on the international executive board carey acquired a fair amount of influence within the aflcio which had readmitted the teamsters in  carey was close with the new leadership elected in  particularly richard trumka of the united mine workers of america who became secretarytreasurer of the aflcio under john sweeney carey had also swung the teamsters support behind the democratic party a change from past administrations that had supported the republican party the new administration set out to break from the past in other ways making energetic efforts to head off a vote to oust the union as representative of northwest airlines flight attendants negotiating a breakthrough agreement covering carhaulers and supporting local strikes such as the one against diamond walnut to restore the unions strength the carey administration did not on the other hand have much power in the lower reaches of the teamster hierarchy all of the large regional conferences were run by old guard officers as were most of the locals disagreements between those two camps led the old guard to campaign against the carey administrations proposed dues increase the carey administration retaliated by dissolving the regional conferences calling them expensive redundancies and fiefdoms for old guard union officers and rearranging the boundaries of some joint councils that had fought against the dues increase the opposition responded by uniting around a single candidate james p hoffa son of james r hoffa to run against carey in  hoffa ran a strong campaign trading on the mystique still attached to his late fathers name and promising to restore those days of glory carey appeared however to have won a close election shortly afterward in  the union initiated a large and successful strike against ups the parcel services department by that time had become the largest division in the union carey was removed from the unions leadership by the irb shortly thereafter when evidence that individuals in his office had arranged for transfer of several thousand dollars to an outside contractor which then arranged for another entity to make an equivalent contribution to the carey campaign carey was indicted for lying to investigators about his campaign funding but was acquitted of all charges in a  trial in the  election to succeed carey james p hoffa was elected handily he became president of the teamsters on march   and took the union in a more moderate direction tempering the unions support for democrats and attempting to come to terms with powerful republicans in congress the union has merged in recent years with a number of unions from other industries including the graphic communications international union a printing industry union and the brotherhood of maintenance of way employes and brotherhood of locomotive engineers both

challengers for office ran on their personal appeal and individual power base rather than on caucus or party platforms and such challenges were infrequent the teamster leadership was wellestablished and somewhat selfperpetuating and challengers only rarely achieved victories at the local and even less frequently regional levels this changed in the s a national wildcat strike challenged president frank fitzsimmons control over the union but failed after the strike a reform movement known as teamsters united rank and file turf formed to continue to challenge against the unions national leadership but turf collapsed after a few years due to internal dissent in  two new caucuses formed teamsters for a decent contract tdc and upsurge both groups pushed the national leadership for a vastly improved contract at the ups freight and shipping company in  a new formal caucus teamsters for a democratic union tdu formed when tdc and upsurge merged the new caucus goal was to make internal teamster governance more transparent and democratic which included giving rankandfile more of a say in the terms and approval of contracts in the s tdu occasionally won elections for positions on local councils but it was not until —when the tdu forced president jackie presser to withdraw and make changes to a concessionladen national master freight agreement—that tdu had a national impact tdu publicized the very centralized and not very transparent national union decisionmaking process criticized what it said was lack of member input into these decisions and published contract salary membership and other data critical of the national union leadership these criticisms led to another success for tdu with many tdu proposals finding their way into the  court decree in which the federal government took over of the teamsters although the tdu has never won the presidency of the national union as of mid it strongly supported ron carey for the presidency in  carey in turn adopted many of tdus reform proposals as part of his platform carey ran with nearly a full slate which included a candidate for secretarytreasurer and  vice presidencies rv durham leader of the teamsters in north carolina was considered the establishment candidate and frontrunner in the campaign he had the backing of a majority of the unions executive board a second candidate in the race walter shea was a veteran union staffer from washington dc carey won with  percent of the vote to durhams  percent and sheas  percent turnout was low only about  percent of the unions total membership careys election sociologist charlotte ryan says was another success for tdu even though carey was not a tdu candidate carey won reelection in  in a corrupt election defeating james p hoffa son of the former union president prior to entering the race hoffa formed a caucus of his own the hoffa unity slate to counter the grassroots organizing of tdu and carey carey was later ousted as union president

teamsters since  in november  the afl organized the team drivers international union tdiu in  a group of teamsters in chicago illinois broke from the tdiu and formed the teamsters national union unlike the tdiu which permitted large employers to be members the new teamsters national union permitted only employees teamster helpers and owneroperators owning only a single team to join and advocated higher wages and shorter hours more aggressively than the tdiu claiming more than  members in  locals its president albert young applied for membership in the afl the afl asked the tdiu to merge with youngs union to form a new aflaffiliated union and the two groups did so in  forming the international brotherhood of teamsters ibt and electing cornelius shea as the new unions first president the election process proved tumultuous shea effectively controlled the convention because the chicago locals—representing nearly half the ibts membership—supported for his candidacy en bloc shea was opposed by john sheridan president of the ice drivers union of chicago sheridan and george innes president of the tdiu accused shea of embezzlement in an attempt to prevent his election shea won the election on august   by a vote of  to  the new grouping elected edward l turley of chicago as secretarytreasurer and albert young as general organizer the union like most unions within the american federation of labor afl at the time had a largely decentralized structure with a number of local unions that governed themselves autonomously and tended to look only after their own interests in the geographical jurisdiction in which they operated the teamsters were vitally important to the labor movement for a strike or sympathy strike by the teamsters could paralyze the movement of goods throughout a city and bring a strike into nearly every neighborhood it also meant that teamsters leaders were able to demand bribes in order to avoid strikes and control of a teamsters local could bring organized crime significant revenues during sheas presidency the entire teamsters union was notoriously corrupt noted labor historian john r commons famously concluded that during this time the teamsters were less a union and more a criminal organization informal portrait of left to right cornelius p shea john miller fred mader and tim murphy sitting in a row in a courtroom in chicago illinois during a labor trial murphy was a politician union organizer and reputed gangster and he was murdered in  several major strikes occupied the union in its first three years in november  teamsters employed by the chicago city railway went out on strike shea attempted to stop sympathy strikes by other teamster locals but three locals walked out and eventually disaffiliated over the sympathystrike issue a sympathy strike in support of  striking meat cutters in chicago in july  led to riots before the extensive use of strikebreakers led shea to force his members back to work leading to the collapse of the meat cutters strike in the midst of the strife in  the teamsters convention in cincinnati ohio reelected shea by acclamation on august   under his leadership the union had expanded to nearly  members in  locals in  cities making the teamsters one of the largest unions in the united states in   teamsters struck in support of lockedout tailors at montgomery ward and eventually more than  teamsters manned the picket lines but when local newspapers discovered that shea was living in a local brothel kept a yearold waitress as a mistress and had spent the strike hosting parties public support for the strike collapsed and the strike ended on august   despite the revelations shea won reelection on august   by a vote of  to  shea was reelected again in  and  although significant challenges to his presidency occurred each time sheas first trial on charges stemming from the  montgomery ward strike ended in a mistrial however during the  reelection shea had promised that he would resign the presidency once his trial had ended but he did not and most union members withdrew their support for him daniel j tobin of boston was elected sheas successor by a vote of  to  in august  historic references to early freight transportation in the us refer to teamsters as those who drove teams of horses pulling huge wagons organizing and growth during the great depressionedit tobin was president of the teamsters from  to  although he faced opposition in his reelection races in   and  he never faced opposition again until his retirement in  the teamsters began to expand dramatically and mature organizationally under tobin he pushed for the development of joint councils to which all local unions were forced to affiliate varying in geographical and industrial jurisdiction the joint councils became important incubators for upandcoming leadership and negotiating master agreements which covered all employers in a given industry tobin also actively discouraged strikes in order to bring discipline to the union and encourage employers to sign contracts and founded and edited the union magazine the international teamster under tobin the teamsters also first developed the regional conference system developed by dave beck in seattle which provided stability organizing strength and leadership to the international union tobin undertook long jurisdictional battles with many unions during this period fierce disputes occurred between the teamsters and the gasoline state operators national council an afl federal union of gas station attendants the international longshoremens association the retail clerks international union and the brotherhood of railway clerks the most significant disagreement however was with the united brewery workers over the right to represent beer wagon drivers while the teamsters lost this battle in  when the afl awarded jurisdiction to the brewers they won when the issue came before the afl executive board again in  when the brewers were still recovering from their nearelimination during prohibition the raids and new member organizing in the s led to significant membership increases teamster membership stood at just  in  tobin took advantage of the wave of prounion sentiment engendered by the passage of the national industrial recovery act and by  union membership had increased nearly  percent to  by  tobin had a duespaying membership of —making the teamsters the fastestgrowing labor union in the united states one of the most significant events in union history occurred in  a group of radicals in local  in minneapolis—led by farrell dobbs carl skoglund and the dunne brothers ray miles and grant all members of the trotskyist communist league of america—began successfully organizing coal truck drivers in the winter of  tobin an ardent anticommunist opposed their efforts and refused to support their  strike local  struck again in  leading to several riots over a nineday period in may when the employers association reneged on the agreement local  resumed the strike although it ended again after nine days when martial law was declared by governor floyd b olson although local  won a contract recognizing the union and which broke the back of the antiunion citizens alliance in minneapolis tobin expelled local  from the teamsters member outrage was extensive and in august  he was forced to recharter the local as  within a year the newly formed local  had organized  truckers in the midwest and formed the central conference of teamsters extensive organizing also occurred in the west harry bridges radical leader of the international longshoremens and warehousemens union ilwu was leading the march inland—an attempt to organize warehouse workers away from shipping ports alarmed by bridges radical politics and worried that the ilwu would encroach on teamster jurisdictions dave beck formed a large regional organization the western conference of teamsters to engage in fierce organizing battles and membership raids against the ilwu which led to the establishment of many new locals and the organization of tens of thousands of new members but corruption became even more widespread in the teamsters during the tobin administration by  the union was considered the most corrupt in the united states and the most abusive towards its own members tobin vigorously defended the union against such accusations but also instituted many constitutional and organizational changes and practices which made it easier for union officials to engage in criminal offenses world war ii and the postwar periodedit by the beginning of world war ii the teamsters was one of the most powerful unions in the country and teamster leaders influential in the corridors of power union membership had risen more than  percent between  and  to  in june  president franklin roosevelt appointed ibt president daniel j tobin to be the official white house liaison to organized labor and later that year chair of the labor division of the democratic national committee in  president roosevelt appointed tobin special representative to the united kingdom and charged him with investigating the state of the labor movement there tobin was considered three times for secretary of labor and twice refused the post—in  and  on september   roosevelt gave his famous fala speech while campaigning in the  presidential election because of roosevelts strong relationship with tobin and the unions large membership the president delivered his speech before the teamster convention nonetheless teamsters members were restive dissident members of the union accused the leadership of suppressing democracy in the union a charge president tobin angrily denied over the next year tobin cracked down on dissidents and trusted several large locals led by his political opponents during world war ii the teamsters strongly endorsed the american labor movements nostrike pledge the teamsters agreed to cease raiding other unions and not strike for the duration of the national emergency president tobin even ordered teamsters members to cross picket lines put up by other unions nevertheless the national leadership sanctioned strikes by midwestern truckers in august  southern truckers in october  and brewery workers and milk delivery drivers in january  the teamsters did not however participate in the great postwar wave of labor strikes in the two years following the cessation of hostilities the teamsters struck only three times  truckers in new jersey struck for two weeks workers at ups struck nationwide for three weeks and workers at railway express agency struck for almost a month teamsters leaders strongly opposed enactment of the tafthartley act and repeatedly called for its repeal president tobin however was one of the first labor leaders to sign the noncommunist affidavit required by the law the great wave of organizing which the union engaged in during the great depression and the war significantly boosted the political power of a number of regional teamsters leaders and the leadership of the union engaged in a number of power struggles in the postwar period by  the unions membership had topped one million dave beck elected an international vicepresident in  was increasingly influential in the international union and tobin attempted to check his growing power but failed in  beck successfully overcame tobins opposition and won approval of an amendment to the unions constitution creating the post of executive vicepresident beck then won the  election to fill the position beck also successfully opposed in  a tobinbacked dues increase to fund new organizing the following year beck was able to demand the ouster of the editor of international teamster magazine and install his own man in the job in  beck allied with his longtime rival jimmy hoffa and effectively seized control of the union he announced a raid on the international association of machinists local at boeing although president dan tobin publicly repudiated becks actions beck had more than enough support from hoffa and other members of the executive board to force tobin to back down five months later beck won approval of a plan to dissolve the unions four divisions and replace them with  divisions organized around each of the major job categories in the unions membership in  tom hickey reformist leader of the teamsters in new york city won election to the teamsters executive board tobin needed becks support to prevent hickeys election and beck refused to give it on september   tobin announced he would step down as president of the teamsters at the end of his term at the unions  convention beck was elected general president and pushed through a number of changes intended to make it harder for a challenger to build the necessary majority to unseat a president or reject his policies influence of organized crimeedit beck was elected to the executive council of the afl on august   but his election generated a tremendous political battle between afl president george meany who supported his election and federation vice presidents who felt beck was corrupt and should not be elected to the post beck was the first teamster president to negotiate a nationwide master contract and a national grievance arbitration plan established organizing drives in the deep south and the east and built the current teamsters headquarters the marble palace in washington dc on louisiana avenue nw across a small plaza from the united states senate but his intervention in a construction and a milk strike both centered on new york city and refusal to intervene in a northeastern trucking strike created major political problems for him perceiving beck to be weak jimmy hoffa began challenging beck on various union decisions and policies in  with an eye to unseating him as general president in the regularly scheduled union elections in  infiltration by organized crime dominated the agenda of the teamsters throughout the s the teamsters had suffered from extensive corruption since its formation in  although the more extreme public forms of corruption had been eliminated after general president cornelius shea was removed from office the extent of corruption and control by organized crime increased during general president tobins time in office  to  in  the teamsters and unions in chicago even approached gangster roger touhy and asked for his protection from al capone and his chicago outfit which were seeking to control the areas unions evidence of widespread corruption within the teamsters began emerging shortly after tobin retired in kansas city corrupt teamsters locals spent years seeking bribes embezzling money and engaging in extensive extortion and labor rackets as well as beatings vandalism and even bombings in an attempt to control the construction and trucking industries the problem was so serious that the us house of representatives held hearings on the issue hoffas attempt to challenge beck caused a major national scandal which led to two congressional investigations several indictments for fraud and other crimes against beck and hoffa strict new federal legislation and regulations regarding labor unions and even helped launch the political career of robert f kennedy believing he needed additional votes to unseat beck in october  mobster johnny dio met with hoffa in new york city and the two men conspired to create as many as  paper locals to boost hoffas delegate totals when the paper locals applied for charters from the international union hoffas political foes were outraged a major battle broke out within the teamsters over whether to charter the locals and the media attention led to inquiries by the us department of justice and the permanent subcommittee on investigations of the us senate committee on government operations beck and other teamster leaders challenged the authority of the us senate to investigate the union which caused the senate to establish the select committee on improper activities in labor and management – a new committee with broad subpeona and investigative powers senator john l mcclellan chair of the select committee hired robert f kennedy as the subcommittees chief counsel and investigator the select committee also known as the mcclellan committee after its chairman exposed widespread corruption in the teamsters union dave beck fled the country for a month to avoid its subpoenas before returning four of the paper locals were dissolved to avoid committee scrutiny several teamster staffers were charged with contempt of congress and union records were lost or destroyed allegedly on purpose and wiretaps were played in public before a national television audience in which dio and hoffa discussed the creation of even more paper locals evidence was unearthed of a mobsponsored plot in which oregon teamsters unions would seize control of the state legislature state police and state attorney generals office through bribery extortion and blackmail initially members of the union did not believe the charges and support for beck was strong but after three months of continuous allegations of wrongdoing many rankandfile teamsters withdrew their support and openly called for beck to resign beck initially refused to address the allegations but broke his silence and denounced the committees inquiry on march  but even as the committee conducted its investigation the teamsters chartered even more paper locals in midmarch  jimmy hoffa was arrested for allegedly trying to bribe a senate aide hoffa denied the charges but the arrest triggered additional investigations and more arrests and indictments over the following weeks a week later beck admitted to receiving an interestfree  loan from the teamsters which he had never repaid and senate investigators claimed that loans to beck and other union officials and their businesses had cost the union more than  beck appeared before the select committee for the first time on march   and invoked his fifth amendment right against selfincrimination  times the mcclellan committee turned its focus to hoffa and other teamsters officials and presented testimony and evidence alleging widespread corruption in hoffacontrolled teamster units several historic legal developments came out of the select committees investigation the scandals uncovered by the mcclellan committee which affected not only the teamsters but several other unions led directly to the passage of the labormanagement reporting and disclosure act also known as the landrumgriffin act in  the right of union officials to exercise their fifth amendment rights was upheld and a significant refinement of constitutional law made when the us supreme court reaffirmed the right of union officials to not divulge the location of union records in curcio v united states  us   rankandfile anger over the mcclellan committees revelations eventually led beck to retire from the teamsters and allowed jimmy hoffa to take over immediately after his testimony in late march  beck won approval from the unions executive board to establish a  million fund to defend himself and the union from the committees allegations but member outrage at the expenditure was significant and permission to establish the fund rescinded member anger continued to grow throughout the spring and becks majority support on the executive board vanished beck was called before the mcclellan committee again in early may  and additional interestfree loans and other potentially illegal and unethical financial transactions exposed based on these revelations beck was indicted for tax evasion on may   becks legal troubles led him to retire and hoffa to win election to the union presidency support for beck among the membership evaporated beck announced on may  he would not run for reelection in october the announcement created chaos among the union leadership and despite additional indictments hoffa announced he would seek the presidency on july  rankandfile support for hoffa was strong although there were some attempts to organize an opposition candidate hoffas opponents asked a federal judge to postpone the election but the request was granted only temporarily and hoffa was duly elected general president of the union on october   beck offered to retire early to allow hoffa to take control of the union in december a federal district court barred hoffa from taking power unless he was acquitted in his wiretapping trial the ruling was upheld by a court of appeals but the trial ended in a hung jury on december   and hoffa assumed the presidency on february   the worsening corruption scandal led the aflcio to eject the teamsters aflcio president george meany worried that corruption scandals plaguing a number of unions at the time might lead to harsh regulation of unions or even the withdrawal of federal labor law protection began an anticorruption drive in april  new rules were enacted by the labor federations executive council that provided for the removal of vice presidents engaged in corruption as well as the ejection of unions considered corrupt the mcclellan committees investigation only worsened the dispute between the aflcio and the teamsters in january  the aflcio proposed a new rule which would bar officers of the federation from continuing to hold office if they exercised their fifth amendment rights in a corruption investigation beck opposed the new rule but the ethical practices committee of aflcio instituted rule on january   the teamsters were given  days to reform but beck retaliated by promising more raids on aflcio member unions if the union was ousted becks opposition prompted a successful move by meany to remove beck from aflcio executive council on grounds of corruption after extensive hearings and appeals which lasted from july to september  the aflcio voted on september   to eject the teamsters if the union did not institute reforms within  days beck refused to institute any reforms and the election of jimmy hoffa whom the aflcio considered as corrupt as beck led the labor federation to suspend the teamsters union on october   meany offered to keep the teamsters within the aflcio if hoffa resigned as president but hoffa refused and the formal expulsion occurred on december   the teamsters were not the only corrupt union in the aflcio by any means another was the international longshoremens association ila which represented stevedores in most east coast ports the teamsters had long desired to bring all shipping and transportation workers into the union so that no product could be moved anywhere in the us without it being touched by teamsters hands as the ila came under increasing attack for permitting corruption in its locals president beck sought to bring the ila into the teamsters the afl ousted the ila in september  and formed the international brotherhood of longshoremenafl iblafl to represent longshoremen on the great lakes and east coast the teamsters planned to raid the expelled union and may even have hoped to seize control of the iblafl beck undertook a campaign to bring the ila back into the afl in early  but the election of mob associate anthony tough tony anastasio as an ila vice president forced beck to end the effort but even as beck backed away from any ila deal jimmy hoffa secretly negotiated a major package of financial and staff aid to the ila and then went public with the deal – forcing beck to accept it as a fait accompli or risk embarrassing hoffa the aflcio threatened to expel the teamsters if it aided the ila beck fought hoffa over the ila aid package and won withdrawing the offer to the ila in the spring of  the ila was not the only union the teamsters sought to merge with the union attempted to merge with the mine mill  smelter workers in  but the effort failed the union also sought a merger with the brewery workers but the smaller union rejected the offer when the overture failed the teamsters raided the brewery workers leading to fierce protests by the cio raiding by the teamsters was such a serious issue that it prompted the afl and cio which had attempted to sign a noraid agreement for years to finally negotiate and implement such a pact in december  president beck initially refused to sign the agreement and threatened to take the teamsters out of the afl if forced to adhere to it three months after the pact was signed the teamsters agreed to submit to the terms of the noraid agreement shortly thereafter the afl adopted article  of its constitution which prevented its member unions from raiding one another the unions affection for raiding led it to initially oppose the aflcio merger in january  but it quickly reversed itself rise fall and disappearance of jimmy hoffaedit hoffa achieved his goal of unifying all freight drivers under a single collective bargaining agreement the national master freight agreement in  hoffa used the grievance procedures of the agreement which authorized selective strikes against particular employers to police the agreement or if hoffa thought that it served the unions interest to drive marginal employers out of the industry the union won substantial gains for its members fostering a nostalgic image of the hoffa era as the golden age for teamster drivers hoffa also succeeded where tobin had failed concentrating power at the international level dominating the conferences which beck and dobbs had helped build in addition hoffa was instrumental in using the assets of the teamsters pension plans particularly the central states plan to support mafia projects such as the development of las vegas in the s and s pension funds were loaned to finance las vegas casinos such as the stardust resort  casino the fremont hotel  casino the desert inn the dunes hotel and casino which was controlled by hoffas attorney morris shenker the four queens the aladdin hotel  casino circus circus and caesars palace the pension fund also made a number of loans to associates and relatives of highranking teamster officials a close associate of hoffa during this period was allen dorfman dorfman owned an insurance agency that provided insurance claims processing to the teamsters union and which was the subject of an investigation by the mcclellan committee dorfman also had increasing influence over loans made by the teamsters pension fund and after hoffa went to prison in  dorfman had primary control over the fund dorfman was murdered in january  shortly after his conviction along with teamsters president roy lee williams in a bribery case hoffa was moreover defiantly unwilling to reform the union or limit his own power in response to the attacks from robert f kennedy formerly chief counsel to the mcclellan committee then attorney general kennedys department of justice tried to convict hoffa for a variety of offenses over the s finally succeeding on a witness tampering charge in  with key testimony provided by teamsters business agent edward grady partin of baton rouge louisiana after exhausting his appeals hoffa entered prison in  hoffa installed frank fitzsimmons an associate from his days in local  in detroit to hold his place for him while he served time fitzsimmons however began to enjoy the exercise of power in hoffas absence in addition the organized crime figures around him found that he was more pliant than hoffa had been while president nixons pardon barred hoffa from resuming any role in the teamsters until  hoffa challenged the legality of that condition and planned to run again for presidency of the union but disappeared in  under mysterious circumstances he is presumed dead although his body has never been found decentralization deregulation and driftedit under general president frank fitzsimmons authority within the teamsters was decentralized back into the hands of regional joint council and local leaders while this helped solidify fitzsimmons own political position in the union it also made it more difficult for the union to act decisively on policy issues fitzsimmons also moved the unions political stands slowly to the left supporting universal health care an immediate end to the vietnam war urban renewal and community organizing in  fitzsimmons and united auto workers president walter reuther formed the alliance for labor action a new national trade union center which competed with the aflcio the alliance dissolved in  after reuthers death while the teamsters won rich national master contracts in trucking and package delivery in the s it did little to adapt to the changes occurring in the transportation industry a major jurisdictional battle with the united farm workers ufw broke out in  and did not end until  the teamsters and ufw had both claimed jurisdiction over farm workers for many years and in  had signed an agreement settling their differences but decentralization of power within the union led several teamster leaders in california to repudiate this agreement without fitzsimmons permission and organize large numbers of field workers his hand forced fitzsimmons ordered teamsters contract negotiators to reopen the handful of contracts it had signed with california growers the ufw sued the aflcio condemned the action and many employers negotiated contracts with the teamsters rather than with the ufw the teamsters subsequently signed contracts which many denounced as sweetheart deals with more than  california growers although an agreement giving ufw jurisdiction over field workers and the teamsters jurisdiction over packing and warehouse workers was reached on september   fitzsimmons reneged on the agreement within a month and moved ahead with forming a farm workers regional union in california the organizing battles even became violent at times by  the ufw had won  elections and the teamsters  ufw membership had plummeted to just  from nearly  while the teamsters farmworker division counted  workers the ufw signed an agreement with fitzsimmons in march  in which the ufw agreed to seek to organize only those workers covered by the california agricultural labor relations act while the teamsters retained jurisdiction over some agricultural workers who had been covered by teamsters local union contracts prior to the formation of the ufw in october  fitzsimmons ended the longrunning jurisdictional dispute with the united brewery workers and the brewery workers merged with the teamsters in  congress passed legislation that deregulated the freight industry removing the interstate commerce commissions power to impose detailed regulatory tariffs on interstate carriers the union tried to fight deregulation by attempting to bribe senator howard cannon of nevada that attempt not only failed but resulted in the conviction in  of roy williams the general president who had succeeded fitzsimmons in  williams subsequently resigned in  as a condition of remaining free on bail while his appeal proceeded deregulation had catastrophic effects on the teamsters opening up the industry to competition from nonunion companies who sought to cut costs by avoiding unionization and curbing wages nearly  unionized carriers went out of business in the first few years of deregulation leaving thirty percent of teamsters in the freight division unemployed the remaining unionized carriers demanded concessions in wages work rules and hours williams successor jackie presser was prepared to grant most of these concessions in the form of a special freight relief rider that would cut wages by up to  percent and establish twotier wages teamsters for a democratic union which had grown out of efforts to reject the  freight agreement launched a successful national campaign to defeat the relief rider which was defeated by a vote of  to  the pressure on the freight industry and the national freight agreement continued however by the end of the s the national master freight agreement which had covered  drivers in the late s dropped to fewer than  with numerous local riders weakening it further in some areas internal and external challengesedit the decline in working conditions in the freight industry combined with longsimmering unhappiness among members employed by the united parcel service led to the development of two nationwide dissident groups within the union in the s teamsters for a democratic union tdu an assemblage of a number of local efforts and the professional drivers council better known as prod which began as a public interest group affiliated with ralph nader that was concerned with worker safety the two groups merged in  tdu was able to win some local offices within the union although the international union often attempted to make those victories meaningless by marginalizing the officer or the union tdu acquired greater prominence however with the election reforms forced on the union by the consent decree it had entered into in  on the eve of trial on a suit brought by the federal government under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico the decree required the direct election of international officers by the membership as tdu had been demanding for years leading up to the decree to replace the indirect election by delegates at the unions convention while the delegates at the unions  convention balked at amending the constitution they ultimately capitulated under pressure from the government that consent decree might not have been possible however if it had not been for the testimony of roy williams who described in an affidavit he gave the government in return for a delay of his imprisonment his own dealings with organized crime as the secretarytreasurer of a local union in kansas city and as an officer of the international union the decree also gave the government the power to install an independent review board with the power to expel any member of the union for conduct unbecoming to the union which the irb proceeded to exercise far more aggressively than the teamsters officials who had agreed to the decree had expected while the government was pursuing a civil case against the union as an entity it was also indicting presser who had succeeded williams as general president for embezzling from two different local unions in cleveland prior to his election as president presser resigned in  but died before his trial was scheduled to begin he was succeeded by william j mccarthy who came from the same local that dan tobin had led eighty years earlier the independent review board irb is a threemember panel established to investigate and take appropriate action with respect to any allegations of corruption any allegations of domination or control or influence of any part of the union by

durham and walter shea careys slate supported by tdu also won nearly all of the seats on the international executive board carey acquired a fair amount of influence within the aflcio which had readmitted the teamsters in  carey was close with the new leadership elected in  particularly richard trumka of the united mine workers of america who became secretarytreasurer of the aflcio under john sweeney carey had also swung the teamsters support behind the democratic party a change from past administrations that had supported the republican party the new administration set out to break from the past in other ways making energetic efforts to head off a vote to oust the union as representative of northwest airlines flight attendants negotiating a breakthrough agreement covering carhaulers and supporting local strikes such as the one against diamond walnut to restore the unions strength the carey administration did not on the other hand have much power in the lower reaches of the teamster hierarchy all of the large regional conferences were run by old guard officers as were most of the locals disagreements between those two camps led the old guard to campaign against the carey administrations proposed dues increase the carey administration retaliated by dissolving the regional conferences calling them expensive redundancies and fiefdoms for old guard union officers and rearranging the boundaries of some joint councils that had fought against the dues increase the opposition responded by uniting around a single candidate james p hoffa son of james r hoffa to run against carey in  hoffa ran a strong campaign trading on the mystique still attached to his late fathers name and promising to restore those days of glory carey appeared however to have won a close election shortly afterward in  the union initiated a large and successful strike against ups the parcel services department by that time had become the largest division in the union carey was removed from the unions leadership by the irb shortly thereafter when evidence that individuals in his office had arranged for transfer of several thousand dollars to an outside contractor which then arranged for another entity to make an equivalent contribution to the carey campaign carey was indicted for lying to investigators about his campaign funding but was acquitted of all charges in a  trial in the  election to succeed carey james p hoffa was elected handily he became president of the teamsters on march   and took the union in a more moderate direction tempering the unions support for democrats and attempting to come to terms with powerful republicans in congress the union has merged in recent years with a number of unions from other industries including the graphic communications international union a printing industry union and the brotherhood of maintenance of way employes and brotherhood of locomotive engineers both from the railway industry on july   the teamsters

teamsters called stop the brown bailout internal teamsters politicsedit prior to the s no longlived caucuses existed within the teamsters union challengers for office ran on their personal appeal and individual power base rather than on caucus or party platforms and such challenges were infrequent the teamster leadership was wellestablished and somewhat selfperpetuating and challengers only rarely achieved victories at the local and even less frequently regional levels this changed in the s a national wildcat strike challenged president frank fitzsimmons control over the union but failed after the strike a reform movement known as teamsters united rank and file turf formed to continue to challenge against the unions national leadership but turf collapsed after a few years due to internal dissent in  two new caucuses formed teamsters for a decent contract tdc and upsurge both groups pushed the national leadership for a vastly improved contract at the ups freight and shipping company in  a new formal caucus teamsters for a democratic union tdu formed when tdc and upsurge merged the new caucus goal was to make internal teamster governance more transparent and democratic which included giving rankandfile more of a say in the terms and approval of contracts in the s tdu occasionally won elections for positions on local councils but it was not until —when the tdu forced president jackie presser to withdraw and make changes to a concessionladen national master freight agreement—that tdu had a national impact tdu publicized the very centralized and not very transparent national union decisionmaking process criticized what it said was lack of member input into these decisions and published contract salary membership and other data critical of the national union leadership these criticisms led to another success for tdu with many tdu proposals finding their way into the  court decree in which the federal government took over of the teamsters although the tdu has never won the presidency of the national union as of mid it strongly supported ron carey for the presidency in  carey in turn adopted many of tdus reform proposals as part of his platform carey ran with nearly a full slate which included a candidate for secretarytreasurer and  vice presidencies rv durham leader of the teamsters in north carolina was considered the establishment candidate and frontrunner in the campaign he had the backing of a majority of the unions executive board a second candidate in the race walter shea was a veteran union staffer from washington dc carey won with  percent of the vote to durhams  percent and sheas  percent turnout was low only about  percent of the unions total membership careys election sociologist charlotte ryan says was another success for tdu even though carey was not a tdu candidate carey won reelection in  in a corrupt election defeating james p hoffa son of the former union president prior to entering the race hoffa formed a caucus of his own the hoffa unity slate to counter the grassroots organizing of tdu and carey carey was later ousted as union president by us government officials a rerun election in  saw hoffa and the unity slate easily defeat tdu candidate tom leedham  percent to  percent with  percent turnout hoffa was reelected over leedham again running on the tdu platform in   percent to  percent leedham challenged

teamsters since  in november  the afl organized the team drivers international union tdiu in  a group of teamsters in chicago illinois broke from the tdiu and formed the teamsters national union unlike the tdiu which permitted large employers to be members the new teamsters national union permitted only employees teamster helpers and owneroperators owning only a single team to join and advocated higher wages and shorter hours more aggressively than the tdiu claiming more than  members in  locals its president albert young applied for membership in the afl the afl asked the tdiu to merge with youngs union to form a new aflaffiliated union and the two groups did so in  forming the international brotherhood of teamsters ibt and electing cornelius shea as the new unions first president the election process proved tumultuous shea effectively controlled the convention because the chicago locals—representing nearly half the ibts membership—supported for his candidacy en bloc shea was opposed by john sheridan president of the ice drivers union of chicago sheridan and george innes president of the tdiu accused shea of embezzlement in an attempt to prevent his election shea won the election on august   by a vote of  to  the new grouping elected edward l turley of chicago as secretarytreasurer and albert young as general organizer the union like most unions within the american federation of labor afl at the time had a largely decentralized structure with a number of local unions that governed themselves autonomously and tended to look only after their own interests in the geographical jurisdiction in which they operated the teamsters were vitally important to the labor movement for a strike or sympathy strike by the teamsters could paralyze the movement of goods throughout a city and bring a strike into nearly every neighborhood it also meant that teamsters leaders were able to demand bribes in order to avoid strikes and control of a teamsters local could bring organized crime significant revenues during sheas presidency the entire teamsters union was notoriously corrupt noted labor historian john r commons famously concluded that during this time the teamsters were less a union and more a criminal organization informal portrait of left to right cornelius p shea john miller fred mader and tim murphy sitting in a row in a courtroom in chicago illinois during a labor trial murphy was a politician union organizer and reputed gangster and he was murdered in  several major strikes occupied the union in its first three years in november  teamsters employed by the chicago city railway went out on strike shea attempted to stop sympathy strikes by other teamster locals but three locals walked out and eventually disaffiliated over the sympathystrike issue a sympathy strike in support of  striking meat cutters in chicago in july  led to riots before the extensive use of strikebreakers led shea to force his members back to work leading to the collapse of the meat cutters strike in the midst of the strife in  the teamsters convention in cincinnati ohio reelected shea by acclamation on august   under his leadership the union had expanded to nearly  members in  locals in  cities making the teamsters one of the largest unions in the united states in   teamsters struck in support of lockedout tailors at montgomery ward and eventually more than  teamsters manned the picket lines but when local newspapers discovered that shea was living in a local brothel kept a yearold waitress as a mistress and had spent the strike hosting parties public support for the strike collapsed and the strike ended on august   despite the revelations shea won reelection on august   by a vote of  to  shea was reelected again in  and  although significant challenges to his presidency occurred each time sheas first trial on charges stemming from the  montgomery ward strike ended in a mistrial however during the  reelection shea had promised that he would resign the presidency once his trial had ended but he did not and most union members withdrew their support for him daniel j tobin of boston was elected sheas successor by a vote of  to  in august  historic references to early freight transportation in the us refer to teamsters as those who drove teams of horses pulling huge wagons organizing and growth during the great depressionedit tobin was president of the teamsters from  to  although he faced opposition in his reelection races in   and  he never faced opposition again until his retirement in  the teamsters began to expand dramatically and mature organizationally under tobin he pushed for the development of joint councils to which all local unions were forced to affiliate varying in geographical and industrial jurisdiction the joint councils became important incubators for upandcoming leadership and negotiating master agreements which covered all employers in a given industry tobin also actively discouraged strikes in order to bring discipline to the union and encourage employers to sign contracts and founded and edited the union magazine the international teamster under tobin the teamsters also first developed the regional conference system developed by dave beck in seattle which provided stability organizing strength and leadership to the international union tobin undertook long jurisdictional battles with many unions during this period fierce disputes occurred between the teamsters and the gasoline state operators national council an afl federal union of gas station attendants the international longshoremens association the retail clerks international union and the brotherhood of railway clerks the most significant disagreement however was with the united brewery workers over the right to represent beer wagon drivers while the teamsters lost this battle in  when the afl awarded jurisdiction to the brewers they won when the issue came before the afl executive board again in  when the brewers were still recovering from their nearelimination during prohibition the raids and new member organizing in the s led to significant membership increases teamster membership stood at just  in  tobin took advantage of the wave of prounion sentiment engendered by the passage of the national industrial recovery act and by  union membership had increased nearly  percent to  by  tobin had a duespaying membership of —making the teamsters the fastestgrowing labor union in the united states one of the most significant events in union history occurred in  a group of radicals in local  in minneapolis—led by farrell dobbs carl skoglund and the dunne brothers ray miles and grant all members of the trotskyist communist league of america—began successfully organizing coal truck drivers in the winter of  tobin an ardent anticommunist opposed their efforts and refused to support their  strike local  struck again in  leading to several riots over a nineday period in may when the employers association reneged on the agreement local  resumed the strike although it ended again after nine days when martial law was declared by governor floyd b olson although local  won a contract recognizing the union and which broke the back of the antiunion citizens alliance in minneapolis tobin expelled local  from the teamsters member outrage was extensive and in august  he was forced to recharter the local as  within a year the newly formed local  had organized  truckers in the midwest and formed the central conference of teamsters extensive organizing also occurred in the west harry bridges radical leader of the international longshoremens and warehousemens union ilwu was leading the march inland—an attempt to organize warehouse workers away from shipping ports alarmed by bridges radical politics and worried that the ilwu would encroach on teamster jurisdictions dave beck formed a large regional organization the western conference of teamsters to engage in fierce organizing battles and membership raids against the ilwu which led to the establishment of many new locals and the organization of tens of thousands of new members but corruption became even more widespread in the teamsters during the tobin administration by  the union was considered the most corrupt in the united states and the most abusive towards its own members tobin vigorously defended the union against such accusations but also instituted many constitutional and organizational changes and practices which made it easier for union officials to engage in criminal offenses world war ii and the postwar periodedit by the beginning of world war ii the teamsters was one of the most powerful unions in the country and teamster leaders influential in the corridors of power union membership had risen more than  percent between  and  to  in june  president franklin roosevelt appointed ibt president daniel j tobin to be the official white house liaison to organized labor and later that year chair of the labor division of the democratic national committee in  president roosevelt appointed tobin special representative to the united kingdom and charged him with investigating the state of the labor movement there tobin was considered three times for secretary of labor and twice refused the post—in  and  on september   roosevelt gave his famous fala speech while campaigning in the  presidential election because of roosevelts strong relationship with tobin and the unions large membership the president delivered his speech before the teamster convention nonetheless teamsters members were restive dissident members of the union accused the leadership of suppressing democracy in the union a charge president tobin angrily denied over the next year tobin cracked down on dissidents and trusted several large locals led by his political opponents during world war ii the teamsters strongly endorsed the american labor movements nostrike pledge the teamsters agreed to cease raiding other unions and not strike for the duration of the national emergency president tobin even ordered teamsters members to cross picket lines put up by other unions nevertheless the national leadership sanctioned strikes by midwestern truckers in august  southern truckers in october  and brewery workers and milk delivery drivers in january  the teamsters did not however participate in the great postwar wave of labor strikes in the two years following the cessation of hostilities the teamsters struck only three times  truckers in new jersey struck for two weeks workers at ups struck nationwide for three weeks and workers at railway express agency struck for almost a month teamsters leaders strongly opposed enactment of the tafthartley act and repeatedly called for its repeal president tobin however was one of the first labor leaders to sign the noncommunist affidavit required by the law the great wave of organizing which the union engaged in during the great depression and the war significantly boosted the political power of a number of regional teamsters leaders and the leadership of the union engaged in a number of power struggles in the postwar period by  the unions membership had topped one million dave beck elected an international vicepresident in  was increasingly influential in the international union and tobin attempted to check his growing power but failed in  beck successfully overcame tobins opposition and won approval of an amendment to the unions constitution creating the post of executive vicepresident beck then won the  election to fill the position beck also successfully opposed in  a tobinbacked dues increase to fund new organizing the following year beck was able to demand the ouster of the editor of international teamster magazine and install his own man in the job in  beck allied with his longtime rival jimmy hoffa and effectively seized control of the union he announced a raid on the international association of machinists local at boeing although president dan tobin publicly repudiated becks actions beck had more than enough support from hoffa and other members of the executive board to force tobin to back down five months later beck won approval of a plan to dissolve the unions four divisions and replace them with  divisions organized around each of the major job categories in the unions membership in  tom hickey reformist leader of the teamsters in new york city won election to the teamsters executive board tobin needed becks support to prevent hickeys election and beck refused to give it on september   tobin announced he would step down as president of the teamsters at the end of his term at the unions  convention beck was elected general president and pushed through a number of changes intended to make it harder for a challenger to build the necessary majority to unseat a president or reject his policies influence of organized crimeedit beck was elected to the executive council of the afl on august   but his election generated a tremendous political battle between afl president george meany who supported his election and federation vice presidents who felt beck was corrupt and should not be elected to the post beck was the first teamster president to negotiate a nationwide master contract and a national grievance arbitration plan established organizing drives in the deep south and the east and built the current teamsters headquarters the marble palace in washington dc on louisiana avenue nw across a small plaza from the united states senate but his intervention in a construction and a milk strike both centered on new york city and refusal to intervene in a northeastern trucking strike created major political problems for him perceiving beck to be weak jimmy hoffa began challenging beck on various union decisions and policies in  with an eye to unseating him as general president in the regularly scheduled union elections in  infiltration by organized crime dominated the agenda of the teamsters throughout the s the teamsters had suffered from extensive corruption since its formation in  although the more extreme public forms of corruption had been eliminated after general president cornelius shea was removed from office the extent of corruption and control by organized crime increased during general president tobins time in office  to  in  the teamsters and unions in chicago even approached gangster roger touhy and asked for his protection from al capone and his chicago outfit which were seeking to control the areas unions evidence of widespread corruption within the teamsters began emerging shortly after tobin retired in kansas city corrupt teamsters locals spent years seeking bribes embezzling money and engaging in extensive extortion and labor rackets as well as beatings vandalism and even bombings in an attempt to control the construction and trucking industries the problem was so serious that the us house of representatives held hearings on the issue hoffas attempt to challenge beck caused a major national scandal which led to two congressional investigations several indictments for fraud and other crimes against beck and hoffa strict new federal legislation and regulations regarding labor unions and even helped launch the political career of robert f kennedy believing he needed additional votes to unseat beck in october  mobster johnny dio met with hoffa in new york city and the two men conspired to create as many as  paper locals to boost hoffas delegate totals when the paper locals applied for charters from the international union hoffas political foes were outraged a major battle broke out within the teamsters over whether to charter the locals and the media attention led to inquiries by the us department of justice and the permanent subcommittee on investigations of the us senate committee on government operations beck and other teamster leaders challenged the authority of the us senate to investigate the union which caused the senate to establish the select committee on improper activities in labor and management – a new committee with broad subpeona and investigative powers senator john l mcclellan chair of the select committee hired robert f kennedy as the subcommittees chief counsel and investigator the select committee also known as the mcclellan committee after its chairman exposed widespread corruption in the teamsters union dave beck fled the country for a month to avoid its subpoenas before returning four of the paper locals were dissolved to avoid committee scrutiny several teamster staffers were charged with contempt of congress and union records were lost or destroyed allegedly on purpose and wiretaps were played in public before a national television audience in which dio and hoffa discussed the creation of even more paper locals evidence was unearthed of a mobsponsored plot in which oregon teamsters unions would seize control of the state legislature state police and state attorney generals office through bribery extortion and blackmail initially members of the union did not believe the charges and support for beck was strong but after three months of continuous allegations of wrongdoing many rankandfile teamsters withdrew their support and openly called for beck to resign beck initially refused to address the allegations but broke his silence and denounced the committees inquiry on march  but even as the committee conducted its investigation the teamsters chartered even more paper locals in midmarch  jimmy hoffa was arrested for allegedly trying to bribe a senate aide hoffa denied the charges but the arrest triggered additional investigations and more arrests and indictments over the following weeks a week later beck admitted to receiving an interestfree  loan from the teamsters which he had never repaid and senate investigators claimed that loans to beck and other union officials and their businesses had cost the union more than  beck appeared before the select committee for the first time on march   and invoked his fifth amendment right against selfincrimination  times the mcclellan committee turned its focus to hoffa and other teamsters officials and presented testimony and evidence alleging widespread corruption in hoffacontrolled teamster units several historic legal developments came out of the select committees investigation the scandals uncovered by the mcclellan committee which affected not only the teamsters but several other unions led directly to the passage of the labormanagement reporting and disclosure act also known as the landrumgriffin act in  the right of union officials to exercise their fifth amendment rights was upheld and a significant refinement of constitutional law made when the us supreme court reaffirmed the right of union officials to not divulge the location of union records in curcio v united states  us   rankandfile anger over the mcclellan committees revelations eventually led beck to retire from the teamsters and allowed jimmy hoffa to take over immediately after his testimony in late march  beck won approval from the unions executive board to establish a  million fund to defend himself and the union from the committees allegations but member outrage at the expenditure was significant and permission to establish the fund rescinded member anger continued to grow throughout the spring and becks majority support on the executive board vanished beck was called before the mcclellan committee again in early may  and additional interestfree loans and other potentially illegal and unethical financial transactions exposed based on these revelations beck was indicted for tax evasion on may   becks legal troubles led him to retire and hoffa to win election to the union presidency support for beck among the membership evaporated beck announced on may  he would not run for reelection in october the announcement created chaos among the union leadership and despite additional indictments hoffa announced he would seek the presidency on july  rankandfile support for hoffa was strong although there were some attempts to organize an opposition candidate hoffas opponents asked a federal judge to postpone the election but the request was granted only temporarily and hoffa was duly elected general president of the union on october   beck offered to retire early to allow hoffa to take control of the union in december a federal district court barred hoffa from taking power unless he was acquitted in his wiretapping trial the ruling was upheld by a court of appeals but the trial ended in a hung jury on december   and hoffa assumed the presidency on february   the worsening corruption scandal led the aflcio to eject the teamsters aflcio president george meany worried that corruption scandals plaguing a number of unions at the time might lead to harsh regulation of unions or even the withdrawal of federal labor law protection began an anticorruption drive in april  new rules were enacted by the labor federations executive council that provided for the removal of vice presidents engaged in corruption as well as the ejection of unions considered corrupt the mcclellan committees investigation only worsened the dispute between the aflcio and the teamsters in january  the aflcio proposed a new rule which would bar officers of the federation from continuing to hold office if they exercised their fifth amendment rights in a corruption investigation beck opposed the new rule but the ethical practices committee of aflcio instituted rule on january   the teamsters were given  days to reform but beck retaliated by promising more raids on aflcio member unions if the union was ousted becks opposition prompted a successful move by meany to remove beck from aflcio executive council on grounds of corruption after extensive hearings and appeals which lasted from july to september  the aflcio voted on september   to eject the teamsters if the union did not institute reforms within  days beck refused to institute any reforms and the election of jimmy hoffa whom the aflcio considered as corrupt as beck led the labor federation to suspend the teamsters union on october   meany offered to keep the teamsters within the aflcio if hoffa resigned as president but hoffa refused and the formal expulsion occurred on december   the teamsters were not the only corrupt union in the aflcio by any means another was the international longshoremens association ila which represented stevedores in most east coast ports the teamsters had long desired to bring all shipping and transportation workers into the union so that no product could be moved anywhere in the us without it being touched by teamsters hands as the ila came under increasing attack for permitting corruption in its locals president beck sought to bring the ila into the teamsters the afl ousted the ila in september  and formed the international brotherhood of longshoremenafl iblafl to represent longshoremen on the great lakes and east coast the teamsters planned to raid the expelled union and may even have hoped to seize control of the iblafl beck undertook a campaign to bring the ila back into the afl in early  but the election of mob associate anthony tough tony anastasio as an ila vice president forced beck to end the effort but even as beck backed away from any ila deal jimmy hoffa secretly negotiated a major package of financial and staff aid to the ila and then went public with the deal – forcing beck to accept it as a fait accompli or risk embarrassing hoffa the aflcio threatened to expel the teamsters if it aided the ila beck fought hoffa over the ila aid package and won withdrawing the offer to the ila in the spring of  the ila was not the only union the teamsters sought to merge with the union attempted to merge with the mine mill  smelter workers in  but the effort failed the union also sought a merger with the brewery workers but the smaller union rejected the offer when the overture failed the teamsters raided the brewery workers leading to fierce protests by the cio raiding by the teamsters was such a serious issue that it prompted the afl and cio which had attempted to sign a noraid agreement for years to finally negotiate and implement such a pact in december  president beck initially refused to sign the agreement and threatened to take the teamsters out of the afl if forced to adhere to it three months after the pact was signed the teamsters agreed to submit to the terms of the noraid agreement shortly thereafter the afl adopted article  of its constitution which prevented its member unions from raiding one another the unions affection for raiding led it to initially oppose the aflcio merger in january  but it quickly reversed itself rise fall and disappearance of jimmy hoffaedit hoffa achieved his goal of unifying all freight drivers under a single collective bargaining agreement the national master freight agreement in  hoffa used the grievance procedures of the agreement which authorized selective strikes against particular employers to police the agreement or if hoffa thought that it served the unions interest to drive marginal employers out of the industry the union won substantial gains for its members fostering a nostalgic image of the hoffa era as the golden age for teamster drivers hoffa also succeeded where tobin had failed concentrating power at the international level dominating the conferences which beck and dobbs had helped build in addition hoffa was instrumental in using the assets of the teamsters pension plans particularly the central states plan to support mafia projects such as the development of las vegas in the s and s pension funds were loaned to finance las vegas casinos such as the stardust resort  casino the fremont hotel  casino the desert inn the dunes hotel and casino which was controlled by hoffas attorney morris shenker the four queens the aladdin hotel  casino circus circus and caesars palace the pension fund also made a number of loans to associates and relatives of highranking teamster officials a close associate of hoffa during this period was allen dorfman dorfman owned an insurance agency that provided insurance claims processing to the teamsters union and which was the subject of an investigation by the mcclellan committee dorfman also had increasing influence over loans made by the teamsters pension fund and after hoffa went to prison in  dorfman had primary control over the fund dorfman was murdered in january  shortly after his conviction along with teamsters president roy lee williams in a bribery case hoffa was moreover defiantly unwilling to reform the union or limit his own power in response to the attacks from robert f kennedy formerly chief counsel to the mcclellan committee then attorney general kennedys department of justice tried to convict hoffa for a variety of offenses over the s finally succeeding on a witness tampering charge in  with key testimony provided by teamsters business agent edward grady partin of baton rouge louisiana after exhausting his appeals hoffa entered prison in  hoffa installed frank fitzsimmons an associate from his days in local  in detroit to hold his place for him while he served time fitzsimmons however began to enjoy the exercise of power in hoffas absence in addition the organized crime figures around him found that he was more pliant than hoffa had been while president nixons pardon barred hoffa from resuming any role in the teamsters until  hoffa challenged the legality of that condition and planned to run again for presidency of the union but disappeared in  under mysterious circumstances he is presumed dead although his body has never been found decentralization deregulation and driftedit under general president frank fitzsimmons authority within the teamsters was decentralized back into the hands of regional joint council and local leaders while this helped solidify fitzsimmons own political position in the union it also made it more difficult for the union to act decisively on policy issues fitzsimmons also moved the unions political stands slowly to the left supporting universal health care an immediate end to the vietnam war urban renewal and community organizing in  fitzsimmons and united auto workers president walter reuther formed the alliance for labor action a new national trade union center which competed with the aflcio the alliance dissolved in  after reuthers death while the teamsters won rich national master contracts in trucking and package delivery in the s it did little to adapt to the changes occurring in the transportation industry a major jurisdictional battle with the united farm workers ufw broke out in  and did not end until  the teamsters and ufw had both claimed jurisdiction over farm workers for many years and in  had signed an agreement settling their differences but decentralization of power within the union led several teamster leaders in california to repudiate this agreement without fitzsimmons permission and organize large numbers of field workers his hand forced fitzsimmons ordered teamsters contract negotiators to reopen the handful of contracts it had signed with california growers the ufw sued the aflcio condemned the action and many employers negotiated contracts with the teamsters rather than with the ufw the teamsters subsequently signed contracts which many denounced as sweetheart deals with more than  california growers although an agreement giving ufw jurisdiction over field workers and the teamsters jurisdiction over packing and warehouse workers was reached on september   fitzsimmons reneged on the agreement within a month and moved ahead with forming a farm workers regional union in california the organizing battles even became violent at times by  the ufw had won  elections and the teamsters  ufw membership had plummeted to just  from nearly  while the teamsters farmworker division counted  workers the ufw signed an agreement with fitzsimmons in march  in which the ufw agreed to seek to organize only those workers covered by the california agricultural labor relations act while the teamsters retained jurisdiction over some agricultural workers who had been covered by teamsters local union contracts prior to the formation of the ufw in october  fitzsimmons ended the longrunning jurisdictional dispute with the united brewery workers and the brewery workers merged with the teamsters in  congress passed legislation that deregulated the freight industry removing the interstate commerce commissions power to impose detailed regulatory tariffs on interstate carriers the union tried to fight deregulation by attempting to bribe senator howard cannon of nevada that attempt not only failed but resulted in the conviction in  of roy williams the general president who had succeeded fitzsimmons in  williams subsequently resigned in  as a condition of remaining free on bail while his appeal proceeded deregulation had catastrophic effects on the teamsters opening up the industry to competition from nonunion companies who sought to cut costs by avoiding unionization and curbing wages nearly  unionized carriers went out of business in the first few years of deregulation leaving thirty percent of teamsters in the freight division unemployed the remaining unionized carriers demanded concessions in wages work rules and hours williams successor jackie presser was prepared to grant most of these concessions in the form of a special freight relief rider that would cut wages by up to  percent and establish twotier wages teamsters for a democratic union which had grown out of efforts to reject the  freight agreement launched a successful national campaign to defeat the relief rider which was defeated by a vote of  to  the pressure on the freight industry and the national freight agreement continued however by the end of the s the national master freight agreement which had covered  drivers in the late s dropped to fewer than  with numerous local riders weakening it further in some areas internal and external challengesedit the decline in working conditions in the freight industry combined with longsimmering unhappiness among members employed by the united parcel service led to the development of two nationwide dissident groups within the union in the s teamsters for a democratic union tdu an assemblage of a number of local efforts and the professional drivers council better known as prod which began as a public interest group affiliated with ralph nader that was concerned with worker safety the two groups merged in  tdu was able to win some local offices within the union although the international union often attempted to make those victories meaningless by marginalizing the officer or the union tdu acquired greater prominence however with the election reforms forced on the union by the consent decree it had entered into in  on the eve of trial on a suit brought by the federal government under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico the decree required the direct election of international officers by the membership as tdu had been demanding for years leading up to the decree to replace the indirect election by delegates at the unions convention while the delegates at the unions  convention balked at amending the constitution they ultimately capitulated under pressure from the government that consent decree might not have been possible however if it had not been for the testimony of roy williams who described in an affidavit he gave the government in return for a delay of his imprisonment his own dealings with organized crime as the secretarytreasurer of a local union in kansas city and as an officer of the international union the decree also gave the government the power to install an independent review board with the power to expel any member of the union for conduct unbecoming to the union which the irb proceeded to exercise far more aggressively than the teamsters officials who had agreed to the decree had expected while the government was pursuing a civil case against the union as an entity it was also indicting presser who had succeeded williams as general president for embezzling from two different local unions in cleveland prior to his election as president presser resigned in  but died before his trial was scheduled to begin he was succeeded by william j mccarthy who came from the same local that dan tobin had led eighty years earlier the independent review board irb is a threemember panel established to investigate and take appropriate action with respect to any allegations of corruption any allegations of domination or control or influence of any part of the union by organized crime and any failure to cooperate fully with the irb recent historyedit a teamsters gathering at the yearlykos  convention membership us records × finances us records ×      assets

durham and walter shea careys slate supported by tdu also won nearly all of the seats on the international executive board carey acquired a fair amount of influence within the aflcio which had readmitted the teamsters in  carey was close with the new leadership elected in  particularly richard trumka of the united mine workers of america who became secretarytreasurer of the aflcio under john sweeney carey had also swung the teamsters support behind the democratic party a change from past administrations that had supported the republican party the new administration set out to break from the past in other ways making energetic efforts to head off a vote to oust the union as representative of northwest airlines flight attendants negotiating a breakthrough agreement covering carhaulers and supporting local strikes such as the one against diamond walnut to restore the unions strength the carey administration did not on the other hand have much power in the lower reaches of the teamster hierarchy all of the large regional conferences were run by old guard officers as were most of the locals disagreements between those two camps led the old guard to campaign against the carey administrations proposed dues increase the carey administration retaliated by dissolving the regional conferences calling them expensive redundancies and fiefdoms for old guard union officers and rearranging the boundaries of some joint councils that had fought against the dues increase the opposition responded by uniting around a single candidate james p hoffa son of james r hoffa to run against carey in  hoffa ran a strong campaign trading on the mystique still attached to his late fathers name and promising to restore those days of glory carey appeared however to have won a close election shortly afterward in  the union initiated a large and successful strike against ups the parcel services department by that time had become the largest division in the union carey was removed from the unions leadership by the irb shortly thereafter when evidence that individuals in his office had arranged for transfer of several thousand dollars to an outside contractor which then arranged for another entity to make an equivalent contribution to the carey campaign carey was indicted for lying to investigators about his campaign funding but was acquitted of all charges in a  trial in the  election to succeed carey james p hoffa was elected handily he became president of the teamsters on march   and took the union in a more moderate direction tempering the unions support for democrats and attempting to come to terms with powerful republicans in congress the union has merged in recent years with a number of unions from other industries including the graphic communications international union a printing industry union and the brotherhood of maintenance of way employes and brotherhood of locomotive engineers both from the railway industry on july   the teamsters disaffiliated from the aflcio and became a founding member of the new national trade union center the change to win federation in  ups many employees of which are members of the teamsters lobbied to have language added to the faa reauthorization act of  hr  to change how ups and fedex compete with one another in response fedex launched a large online advertising campaign aimed at ups and the teamsters called stop the brown bailout internal teamsters politicsedit prior to the s no longlived caucuses existed within the teamsters union challengers for office ran on their personal appeal and individual power base rather than on caucus or party platforms and such challenges were infrequent the teamster leadership was wellestablished and somewhat selfperpetuating and challengers only rarely achieved victories at the local and even less frequently regional levels this changed in the s a national wildcat strike challenged president frank fitzsimmons control over the union but failed after the strike a reform movement known as teamsters united rank and file turf formed to continue to challenge against the unions national leadership but turf collapsed after a few years due to internal dissent in  two new caucuses formed teamsters for a decent contract tdc and upsurge both groups pushed the national leadership for a vastly improved contract at the ups freight and shipping company in  a new formal caucus teamsters for a democratic union tdu formed when tdc and upsurge merged the new caucus goal was to make internal teamster governance more transparent and democratic which included giving rankandfile more of a say in the terms and approval of contracts in the s tdu occasionally won elections for positions on local councils but it was not until —when the tdu forced president jackie presser to withdraw and make changes to a concessionladen national master freight agreement—that tdu had a national impact tdu publicized the very centralized and not very transparent national union decisionmaking process criticized what it said was lack of member input into these decisions and published contract salary membership and other data critical of the national union leadership these criticisms led to another success for tdu with many tdu proposals finding their way into the  court decree in which the federal government took over of the teamsters although the tdu has never won the presidency of the national union as of mid it strongly supported ron carey for the presidency in  carey in turn adopted many of tdus reform proposals as part of his platform carey ran with nearly a full slate which included a candidate for secretarytreasurer and  vice presidencies rv durham leader of the teamsters in north carolina was considered the establishment candidate and

teamsters since  in november  the afl organized the team drivers international union tdiu in  a group of teamsters in chicago illinois broke from the tdiu and formed the teamsters national union unlike the tdiu which permitted large employers to be members the new teamsters national union permitted only employees teamster helpers and owneroperators owning only a single team to join and advocated higher wages and shorter hours more aggressively than the tdiu claiming more than  members in  locals its president albert young applied for membership in the afl the afl asked the tdiu to merge with youngs union to form a new aflaffiliated union and the two groups did so in  forming the international brotherhood of teamsters ibt and electing cornelius shea as the new unions first president the election process proved tumultuous shea effectively controlled the convention because the chicago locals—representing nearly half the ibts membership—supported for his candidacy en bloc shea was opposed by john sheridan president of the ice drivers union of chicago sheridan and george innes president of the tdiu accused shea of embezzlement in an attempt to prevent his election shea won the election on august   by a vote of  to  the new grouping elected edward l turley of chicago as secretarytreasurer and albert young as general organizer the union like most unions within the american federation of labor afl at the time had a largely decentralized structure with a number of local unions that governed themselves autonomously and tended to look only after their own interests in the geographical jurisdiction in which they operated the teamsters were vitally important to the labor movement for a strike or sympathy strike by the teamsters could paralyze the movement of goods throughout a city and bring a strike into nearly every neighborhood it also meant that teamsters leaders were able to demand bribes in order to avoid strikes and control of a teamsters local could bring organized crime significant revenues during sheas presidency the entire teamsters union was notoriously corrupt noted labor historian john r commons famously concluded that during this time the teamsters were less a union and more a criminal organization informal portrait of left to right cornelius p shea john miller fred mader and tim murphy sitting in a row in a courtroom in chicago illinois during a labor trial murphy was a politician union organizer and reputed gangster and he was murdered in  several major strikes occupied the union in its first three years in november  teamsters employed by the chicago city railway went out on strike shea attempted to stop sympathy strikes by other teamster locals but three locals walked out and eventually disaffiliated over the sympathystrike issue a sympathy strike in support of  striking meat cutters in chicago in july  led to riots before the extensive use of strikebreakers led shea to force his members back to work leading to the collapse of the meat cutters strike in the midst of the strife in  the teamsters convention in cincinnati ohio reelected shea by acclamation on august   under his leadership the union had expanded to nearly  members in  locals in  cities making the teamsters one of the largest unions in the united states in   teamsters struck in support of lockedout tailors at montgomery ward and eventually more than  teamsters manned the picket lines but when local newspapers discovered that shea was living in a local brothel kept a yearold waitress as a mistress and had spent the strike hosting parties public support for the strike collapsed and the strike ended on august   despite the revelations shea won reelection on august   by a vote of  to  shea was reelected again in  and  although significant challenges to his presidency occurred each time sheas first trial on charges stemming from the  montgomery ward strike ended in a mistrial however during the  reelection shea had promised that he would resign the presidency once his trial had ended but he did not and most union members withdrew their support for him daniel j tobin of boston was elected sheas successor by a vote of  to  in august  historic references to early freight transportation in the us refer to teamsters as those who drove teams of horses pulling huge wagons organizing and growth during the great depressionedit tobin was president of the teamsters from  to  although he faced opposition in his reelection races in   and  he never faced opposition again until his retirement in  the teamsters began to expand dramatically and mature organizationally under tobin he pushed for the development of joint councils to which all local unions were forced to affiliate varying in geographical and industrial jurisdiction the joint councils became important incubators for upandcoming leadership and negotiating master agreements which covered all employers in a given industry tobin also actively discouraged strikes in order to bring discipline to the union and encourage employers to sign contracts and founded and edited the union magazine the international teamster under tobin the teamsters also first developed the regional conference system developed by dave beck in seattle which provided stability organizing strength and leadership to the international union tobin undertook long jurisdictional battles with many unions during this period fierce disputes occurred between the teamsters and the gasoline state operators national council an afl federal union of gas station attendants the international longshoremens association the retail clerks international union and the brotherhood of railway clerks the most significant disagreement however was with the united brewery workers over the right to represent beer wagon drivers while the teamsters lost this battle in  when the afl awarded jurisdiction to the brewers they won when the issue came before the afl executive board again in  when the brewers were still recovering from their nearelimination during prohibition the raids and new member organizing in the s led to significant membership increases teamster membership stood at just  in  tobin took advantage of the wave of prounion sentiment engendered by the passage of the national industrial recovery act and by  union membership had increased nearly  percent to  by  tobin had a duespaying membership of —making the teamsters the fastestgrowing labor union in the united states one of the most significant events in union history occurred in  a group of radicals in local  in minneapolis—led by farrell dobbs carl skoglund and the dunne brothers ray miles and grant all members of the trotskyist communist league of america—began successfully organizing coal truck drivers in the winter of  tobin an ardent anticommunist opposed their efforts and refused to support their  strike local  struck again in  leading to several riots over a nineday period in may when the employers association reneged on the agreement local  resumed the strike although it ended again after nine days when martial law was declared by governor floyd b olson although local  won a contract recognizing the union and which broke the back of the antiunion citizens alliance in minneapolis tobin expelled local  from the teamsters member outrage was extensive and in august  he was forced to recharter the local as  within a year the newly formed local  had organized  truckers in the midwest and formed the central conference of teamsters extensive organizing also occurred in the west harry bridges radical leader of the international longshoremens and warehousemens union ilwu was leading the march inland—an attempt to organize warehouse workers away from shipping ports alarmed by bridges radical politics and worried that the ilwu would encroach on teamster jurisdictions dave beck formed a large regional organization the western conference of teamsters to engage in fierce organizing battles and membership raids against the ilwu which led to the establishment of many new locals and the organization of tens of thousands of new members but corruption became even more widespread in the teamsters during the tobin administration by  the union was considered the most corrupt in the united states and the most abusive towards its own members tobin vigorously defended the union against such accusations but also instituted many constitutional and organizational changes and practices which made it easier for union officials to engage in criminal offenses world war ii and the postwar periodedit by the beginning of world war ii the teamsters was one of the most powerful unions in the country and teamster leaders influential in the corridors of power union membership had risen more than  percent between  and  to  in june  president franklin roosevelt appointed ibt president daniel j tobin to be the official white house liaison to organized labor and later that year chair of the labor division of the democratic national committee in  president roosevelt appointed tobin special representative to the united kingdom and charged him with investigating the state of the labor movement there tobin was considered three times for secretary of labor and twice refused the post—in  and  on september   roosevelt gave his famous fala speech while campaigning in the  presidential election because of roosevelts strong relationship with tobin and the unions large membership the president delivered his speech before the teamster convention nonetheless teamsters members were restive dissident members of the union accused the leadership of suppressing democracy in the union a charge president tobin angrily denied over the next year tobin cracked down on dissidents and trusted several large locals led by his political opponents during world war ii the teamsters strongly endorsed the american labor movements nostrike pledge the teamsters agreed to cease raiding other unions and not strike for the duration of the national emergency president tobin even ordered teamsters members to cross picket lines put up by other unions nevertheless the national leadership sanctioned strikes by midwestern truckers in august  southern truckers in october  and brewery workers and milk delivery drivers in january  the teamsters did not however participate in the great postwar wave of labor strikes in the two years following the cessation of hostilities the teamsters struck only three times  truckers in new jersey struck for two weeks workers at ups struck nationwide for three weeks and workers at railway express agency struck for almost a month teamsters leaders strongly opposed enactment of the tafthartley act and repeatedly called for its repeal president tobin however was one of the first labor leaders to sign the noncommunist affidavit required by the law the great wave of organizing which the union engaged in during the great depression and the war significantly boosted the political power of a number of regional teamsters leaders and the leadership of the union engaged in a number of power struggles in the postwar period by  the unions membership had topped one million dave beck elected an international vicepresident in  was increasingly influential in the international union and tobin attempted to check his growing power but failed in  beck successfully overcame tobins opposition and won approval of an amendment to the unions constitution creating the post of executive vicepresident beck then won the  election to fill the position beck also successfully opposed in  a tobinbacked dues increase to fund new organizing the following year beck was able to demand the ouster of the editor of international teamster magazine and install his own man in the job in  beck allied with his longtime rival jimmy hoffa and effectively seized control of the union he announced a raid on the international association of machinists local at boeing although president dan tobin publicly repudiated becks actions beck had more than enough support from hoffa and other members of the executive board to force tobin to back down five months later beck won approval of a plan to dissolve the unions four divisions and replace them with  divisions organized around each of the major job categories in the unions membership in  tom hickey reformist leader of the teamsters in new york city won election to the teamsters executive board tobin needed becks support to prevent hickeys election and beck refused to give it on september   tobin announced he would step down as president of the teamsters at the end of his term at the unions  convention beck was elected general president and pushed through a number of changes intended to make it harder for a challenger to build the necessary majority to unseat a president or reject his policies influence of organized crimeedit beck was elected to the executive council of the afl on august   but his election generated a tremendous political battle between afl president george meany who supported his election and federation vice presidents who felt beck was corrupt and should not be elected to the post beck was the first teamster president to negotiate a nationwide master contract and a national grievance arbitration plan established organizing drives in the deep south and the east and built the current teamsters headquarters the marble palace in washington dc on louisiana avenue nw across a small plaza from the united states senate but his intervention in a construction and a milk strike both centered on new york city and refusal to intervene in a northeastern trucking strike created major political problems for him perceiving beck to be weak jimmy hoffa began challenging beck on various union decisions and policies in  with an eye to unseating him as general president in the regularly scheduled union elections in  infiltration by organized crime dominated the agenda of the teamsters throughout the s the teamsters had suffered from extensive corruption since its formation in  although the more extreme public forms of corruption had been eliminated after general president cornelius shea was removed from office the extent of corruption and control by organized crime increased during general president tobins time in office  to  in  the teamsters and unions in chicago even approached gangster roger touhy and asked for his protection from al capone and his chicago outfit which were seeking to control the areas unions evidence of widespread corruption within the teamsters began emerging shortly after tobin retired in kansas city corrupt teamsters locals spent years seeking bribes embezzling money and engaging in extensive extortion and labor rackets as well as beatings vandalism and even bombings in an attempt to control the construction and trucking industries the problem was so serious that the us house of representatives held hearings on the issue hoffas attempt to challenge beck caused a major national scandal which led to two congressional investigations several indictments for fraud and other crimes against beck and hoffa strict new federal legislation and regulations regarding labor unions and even helped launch the political career of robert f kennedy believing he needed additional votes to unseat beck in october  mobster johnny dio met with hoffa in new york city and the two men conspired to create as many as  paper locals to boost hoffas delegate totals when the paper locals applied for charters from the international union hoffas political foes were outraged a major battle broke out within the teamsters over whether to charter the locals and the media attention led to inquiries by the us department of justice and the permanent subcommittee on investigations of the us senate committee on government operations beck and other teamster leaders challenged the authority of the us senate to investigate the union which caused the senate to establish the select committee on improper activities in labor and management – a new committee with broad subpeona and investigative powers senator john l mcclellan chair of the select committee hired robert f kennedy as the subcommittees chief counsel and investigator the select committee also known as the mcclellan committee after its chairman exposed widespread corruption in the teamsters union dave beck fled the country for a month to avoid its subpoenas before returning four of the paper locals were dissolved to avoid committee scrutiny several teamster staffers were charged with contempt of congress and union records were lost or destroyed allegedly on purpose and wiretaps were played in public before a national television audience in which dio and hoffa discussed the creation of even more paper locals evidence was unearthed of a mobsponsored plot in which oregon teamsters unions would seize control of the state legislature state police and state attorney generals office through bribery extortion and blackmail initially members of the union did not believe the charges and support for beck was strong but after three months of continuous allegations of wrongdoing many rankandfile teamsters withdrew their support and openly called for beck to resign beck initially refused to address the allegations but broke his silence and denounced the committees inquiry on march  but even as the committee conducted its investigation the teamsters chartered even more paper locals in midmarch  jimmy hoffa was arrested for allegedly trying to bribe a senate aide hoffa denied the charges but the arrest triggered additional investigations and more arrests and indictments over the following weeks a week later beck admitted to receiving an interestfree  loan from the teamsters which he had never repaid and senate investigators claimed that loans to beck and other union officials and their businesses had cost the union more than  beck appeared before the select committee for the first time on march   and invoked his fifth amendment right against selfincrimination  times the mcclellan committee turned its focus to hoffa and other teamsters officials and presented testimony and evidence alleging widespread corruption in hoffacontrolled teamster units several historic legal developments came out of the select committees investigation the scandals uncovered by the mcclellan committee which affected not only the teamsters but several other unions led directly to the passage of the labormanagement reporting and disclosure act also known as the landrumgriffin act in  the right of union officials to exercise their fifth amendment rights was upheld and a significant refinement of constitutional law made when the us supreme court reaffirmed the right of union officials to not divulge the location of union records in curcio v united states  us   rankandfile anger over the mcclellan committees revelations eventually led beck to retire from the teamsters and allowed jimmy hoffa to take over immediately after his testimony in late march  beck won approval from the unions executive board to establish a  million fund to defend himself and the union from the committees allegations but member outrage at the expenditure was significant and permission to establish the fund rescinded member anger continued to grow throughout the spring and becks majority support on the executive board vanished beck was called before the mcclellan committee again in early may  and additional interestfree loans and other potentially illegal and unethical financial transactions exposed based on these revelations beck was indicted for tax evasion on may   becks legal troubles led him to retire and hoffa to win election to the union presidency support for beck among the membership evaporated beck announced on may  he would not run for reelection in october the announcement created chaos among the union leadership and despite additional indictments hoffa announced he would seek the presidency on july  rankandfile support for hoffa was strong although there were some attempts to organize an opposition candidate hoffas opponents asked a federal judge to postpone the election but the request was granted only temporarily and hoffa was duly elected general president of the union on october   beck offered to retire early to allow hoffa to take control of the union in december a federal district court barred hoffa from taking power unless he was acquitted in his wiretapping trial the ruling was upheld by a court of appeals but the trial ended in a hung jury on december   and hoffa assumed the presidency on february   the worsening corruption scandal led the aflcio to eject the teamsters aflcio president george meany worried that corruption scandals plaguing a number of unions at the time might lead to harsh regulation of unions or even the withdrawal of federal labor law protection began an anticorruption drive in april  new rules were enacted by the labor federations executive council that provided for the removal of vice presidents engaged in corruption as well as the ejection of unions considered corrupt the mcclellan committees investigation only worsened the dispute between the aflcio and the teamsters in january  the aflcio proposed a new rule which would bar officers of the federation from continuing to hold office if they exercised their fifth amendment rights in a corruption investigation beck opposed the new rule but the ethical practices committee of aflcio instituted rule on january   the teamsters were given  days to reform but beck retaliated by promising more raids on aflcio member unions if the union was ousted becks opposition prompted a successful move by meany to remove beck from aflcio executive council on grounds of corruption after extensive hearings and appeals which lasted from july to september  the aflcio voted on september   to eject the teamsters if the union did not institute reforms within  days beck refused to institute any reforms and the election of jimmy hoffa whom the aflcio considered as corrupt as beck led the labor federation to suspend the teamsters union on october   meany offered to keep the teamsters within the aflcio if hoffa resigned as president but hoffa refused and the formal expulsion occurred on december   the teamsters were not the only corrupt union in the aflcio by any means another was the international longshoremens association ila which represented stevedores in most east coast ports the teamsters had long desired to bring all shipping and transportation workers into the union so that no product could be moved anywhere in the us without it being touched by teamsters hands as the ila came under increasing attack for permitting corruption in its locals president beck sought to bring the ila into the teamsters the afl ousted the ila in september  and formed the international brotherhood of longshoremenafl iblafl to represent longshoremen on the great lakes and east coast the teamsters planned to raid the expelled union and may even have hoped to seize control of the iblafl beck undertook a campaign to bring the ila back into the afl in early  but the election of mob associate anthony tough tony anastasio as an ila vice president forced beck to end the effort but even as beck backed away from any ila deal jimmy hoffa secretly negotiated a major package of financial and staff aid to the ila and then went public with the deal – forcing beck to accept it as a fait accompli or risk embarrassing hoffa the aflcio threatened to expel the teamsters if it aided the ila beck fought hoffa over the ila aid package and won withdrawing the offer to the ila in the spring of  the ila was not the only union the teamsters sought to merge with the union attempted to merge with the mine mill  smelter workers in  but the effort failed the union also sought a merger with the brewery workers but the smaller union rejected the offer when the overture failed the teamsters raided the brewery workers leading to fierce protests by the cio raiding by the teamsters was such a serious issue that it prompted the afl and cio which had attempted to sign a noraid agreement for years to finally negotiate and implement such a pact in december  president beck initially refused to sign the agreement and threatened to take the teamsters out of the afl if forced to adhere to it three months after the pact was signed the teamsters agreed to submit to the terms of the noraid agreement shortly thereafter the afl adopted article  of its constitution which prevented its member unions from raiding one another the unions affection for raiding led it to initially oppose the aflcio merger in january  but it quickly reversed itself rise fall and disappearance of jimmy hoffaedit hoffa achieved his goal of unifying all freight drivers under a single collective bargaining agreement the national master freight agreement in  hoffa used the grievance procedures of the agreement which authorized selective strikes against particular employers to police the agreement or if hoffa thought that it served the unions interest to drive marginal employers out of the industry the union won substantial gains for its members fostering a nostalgic image of the hoffa era as the golden age for teamster drivers hoffa also succeeded where tobin had failed concentrating power at the international level dominating the conferences which beck and dobbs had helped build in addition hoffa was instrumental in using the assets of the teamsters pension plans particularly the central states plan to support mafia projects such as the development of las vegas in the s and s pension funds were loaned to finance las vegas casinos such as the stardust resort  casino the fremont hotel  casino the desert inn the dunes hotel and casino which was controlled by hoffas attorney morris shenker the four queens the aladdin hotel  casino circus circus and caesars palace the pension fund also made a number of loans to associates and relatives of highranking teamster officials a close associate of hoffa during this period was allen dorfman dorfman owned an insurance agency that provided insurance claims processing to the teamsters union and which was the subject of an investigation by the mcclellan committee dorfman also had increasing influence over loans made by the teamsters pension fund and after hoffa went to prison in  dorfman had primary control over the fund dorfman was murdered in january  shortly after his conviction along with teamsters president roy lee williams in a bribery case hoffa was moreover defiantly unwilling to reform the union or limit his own power in response to the attacks from robert f kennedy formerly chief counsel to the mcclellan committee then attorney general kennedys department of justice tried to convict hoffa for a variety of offenses over the s finally succeeding on a witness tampering charge in  with key testimony provided by teamsters business agent edward grady partin of baton rouge louisiana after exhausting his appeals hoffa entered prison in  hoffa installed frank fitzsimmons an associate from his days in local  in detroit to hold his place for him while he served time fitzsimmons however began to enjoy the exercise of power in hoffas absence in addition the organized crime figures around him found that he was more pliant than hoffa had been while president nixons pardon barred hoffa from resuming any role in the teamsters until  hoffa challenged the legality of that condition and planned to run again for presidency of the union but disappeared in  under mysterious circumstances he is presumed dead although his body has never been found decentralization deregulation and driftedit under general president frank fitzsimmons authority within the teamsters was decentralized back into the hands of regional joint council and local leaders while this helped solidify fitzsimmons own political position in the union it also made it more difficult for the union to act decisively on policy issues fitzsimmons also moved the unions political stands slowly to the left supporting universal health care an immediate end to the vietnam war urban renewal and community organizing in  fitzsimmons and united auto workers president walter reuther formed the alliance for labor action a new national trade union center which competed with the aflcio the alliance dissolved in  after reuthers death while the teamsters won rich national master contracts in trucking and package delivery in the s it did little to adapt to the changes occurring in the transportation industry a major jurisdictional battle with the united farm workers ufw broke out in  and did not end until  the teamsters and ufw had both claimed jurisdiction over farm workers for many years and in  had signed an agreement settling their differences but decentralization of power within the union led several teamster leaders in california to repudiate this agreement without fitzsimmons permission and organize large numbers of field workers his hand forced fitzsimmons ordered teamsters contract negotiators to reopen the handful of contracts it had signed with california growers the ufw sued the aflcio condemned the action and many employers negotiated contracts with the teamsters rather than with the ufw the teamsters subsequently signed contracts which many denounced as sweetheart deals with more than  california growers although an agreement giving ufw jurisdiction over field workers and the teamsters jurisdiction over packing and warehouse workers was reached on september   fitzsimmons reneged on the agreement within a month and moved ahead with forming a farm workers regional union in california the organizing battles even became violent at times by  the ufw had won  elections and the teamsters  ufw membership had plummeted to just  from nearly  while the teamsters farmworker division counted  workers the ufw signed an agreement with fitzsimmons in march  in which the ufw agreed to seek to organize only those workers covered by the california agricultural labor relations act while the teamsters retained jurisdiction over some agricultural workers who had been covered by teamsters local union contracts prior to the formation of the ufw in october  fitzsimmons ended the longrunning jurisdictional dispute with the united brewery workers and the brewery workers merged with the teamsters in  congress passed legislation that deregulated the freight industry removing the interstate commerce commissions power to impose detailed regulatory tariffs on interstate carriers the union tried to fight deregulation by attempting to bribe senator howard cannon of nevada that attempt not only failed but resulted in the conviction in  of roy williams the general president who had succeeded fitzsimmons in  williams subsequently resigned in  as a condition of remaining free on bail while his appeal proceeded deregulation had catastrophic effects on the teamsters opening up the industry to competition from nonunion companies who sought to cut costs by avoiding unionization and curbing wages nearly  unionized carriers went out of business in the first few years of deregulation leaving thirty percent of teamsters in the freight division unemployed the remaining unionized carriers demanded concessions in wages work rules and hours williams successor jackie presser was prepared to grant most of these concessions in the form of a special freight relief rider that would cut wages by up to  percent and establish twotier wages teamsters for a democratic union which had grown out of efforts to reject the  freight agreement launched a successful national campaign to defeat the relief rider which was defeated by a vote of  to  the pressure on the freight industry and the national freight agreement continued however by the end of the s the national master freight agreement which had covered  drivers in the late s dropped to fewer than  with numerous local riders weakening it further in some areas internal and external challengesedit the decline in working conditions in the freight industry combined with longsimmering unhappiness among members employed by the united parcel service led to the development of two nationwide dissident groups within the union in the s teamsters for a democratic union tdu an assemblage of a number of local efforts and the professional drivers council better known as prod which began as a public interest group affiliated with ralph nader that was concerned with worker safety the two groups merged in  tdu was able to win some local offices within the union although the international union often attempted to make those victories meaningless by marginalizing the officer or the union tdu acquired greater prominence however with the election reforms forced on the union by the consent decree it had entered into in  on the eve of trial on a suit brought by the federal government under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico the decree required the direct election of international officers by the membership as tdu had been demanding for years leading up to the decree to replace the indirect election by delegates at the unions convention while the delegates at the unions  convention balked at amending the constitution they ultimately capitulated under pressure from the government that consent decree might not have been possible however if it had not been for the testimony of roy williams who described in an affidavit he gave the government in return for a delay of his imprisonment his own dealings with organized crime as the secretarytreasurer of a local union in kansas city and as an officer of the international union the decree also gave the government the power to install an independent review board with the power to expel any member of the union for conduct unbecoming to the union which the irb proceeded to exercise far more aggressively than the teamsters officials who had agreed to the decree had expected while the government was pursuing a civil case against the union as an entity it was also indicting presser who had succeeded williams as general president for embezzling from two different local unions in cleveland prior to his election as president presser resigned in  but died before his trial was scheduled to begin he was succeeded by william j mccarthy who came from the same local that dan tobin had led eighty years earlier the independent review board irb is a threemember panel established to investigate and take appropriate action with respect to any allegations of corruption any allegations of domination or control or influence of any part of the union by organized crime and any failure to cooperate fully with the irb recent historyedit a teamsters gathering at the yearlykos  convention membership us records × finances us records ×      assets

durham and walter shea careys slate supported by tdu also won nearly all of the seats on the international executive board carey acquired a fair amount of influence within the aflcio which had readmitted the teamsters in  carey was close with the new leadership elected in  particularly richard trumka of the united mine workers of america who became secretarytreasurer of the aflcio under john sweeney carey had also swung the teamsters support behind the democratic party a change from past administrations that had supported the republican party the new administration set out to break from the past in other ways making energetic efforts to head off a vote to oust the union as representative of northwest airlines flight attendants negotiating a breakthrough agreement covering carhaulers and supporting local strikes such as the one against diamond walnut to restore the unions strength the carey administration did not on the other hand have much power in the lower reaches of the teamster hierarchy all of the large regional conferences were run by old guard officers as were most of the locals disagreements between those two camps led the old guard to campaign against the carey administrations proposed dues increase the carey administration retaliated by dissolving the regional conferences calling them expensive redundancies and fiefdoms for old guard union officers and rearranging the boundaries of some joint councils that had fought against the dues increase the opposition responded by uniting around a single candidate james p hoffa son of james r hoffa to run against carey in  hoffa ran a strong campaign trading on the mystique still attached to his late fathers name and promising to restore those days of glory carey appeared however to have won a close election shortly afterward in  the union initiated a large and successful strike against ups the parcel services department by that time had become the largest division in the union carey was removed from the unions leadership by the irb shortly thereafter when evidence that individuals in his office had arranged for transfer of several thousand dollars to an outside contractor which then arranged for another entity to make an equivalent contribution to the carey campaign carey was indicted for lying to investigators about his campaign funding but was acquitted of all charges in a  trial in the  election to succeed carey james p hoffa was elected handily he became president of the teamsters on march   and took the union in a more moderate direction tempering the unions support for democrats and attempting to come to terms with powerful republicans in congress the union has merged in recent years with a number of unions from other industries including the graphic communications international union a printing industry union and the brotherhood of maintenance of way employes and brotherhood of locomotive engineers both from the railway industry on july   the teamsters

have language added to the faa reauthorization act of  hr  to change how ups and fedex compete with one another in response fedex launched a large online advertising campaign aimed at ups and the teamsters called stop the brown bailout internal teamsters politicsedit prior to the s no longlived caucuses existed within the teamsters union challengers for office ran on their personal appeal and individual power base rather than on caucus or party platforms and such challenges were infrequent the teamster leadership was wellestablished and somewhat selfperpetuating and challengers only rarely achieved victories at the local and even less frequently regional levels this changed in the s a national wildcat strike challenged president frank fitzsimmons control over the union but failed after the strike a reform movement known as teamsters united rank and file turf formed to continue to challenge against the unions national leadership but turf collapsed after a few years due to internal dissent in  two new caucuses formed teamsters for a decent contract tdc and upsurge both groups pushed the national leadership for a vastly improved contract at the ups freight and shipping company in  a new formal caucus teamsters for a democratic union tdu formed when tdc and upsurge merged the new caucus goal was to make internal teamster governance more transparent and democratic which included giving rankandfile more of a say in the terms and approval of contracts in the s tdu occasionally won elections for positions on local councils but it was not until —when the tdu forced president jackie presser to withdraw and make changes to a concessionladen national master freight agreement—that tdu had a national impact tdu publicized the very centralized and not very transparent national union decisionmaking process criticized what it said was lack of member input into these decisions and published contract salary membership and other data critical of the national union leadership these criticisms led to another success for tdu with many tdu proposals finding their way into the  court decree in which the federal government took over of the teamsters although the tdu has never won the presidency of the national union as of mid it strongly supported ron carey for the presidency in  carey in turn adopted many of tdus reform proposals as part of his platform carey ran with nearly a full slate which included a candidate for secretarytreasurer and  vice presidencies rv durham leader of the teamsters in north carolina was considered the establishment candidate and frontrunner in the campaign he had the backing of a majority of the unions executive board a second candidate in the race walter shea was a veteran union staffer from washington dc carey won with  percent of the vote to durhams  percent and sheas  percent turnout was low only about  percent of the unions total membership careys election sociologist charlotte ryan says was another success for tdu even though carey was not a tdu candidate carey won reelection in  in a corrupt election defeating james p hoffa son of the former union president prior to entering the race hoffa formed a caucus of his own the hoffa unity slate to counter the grassroots organizing of tdu and carey carey was later ousted as union president by us government officials a rerun election in  saw hoffa and the unity slate easily defeat tdu candidate tom leedham  percent to  percent with  percent turnout hoffa was reelected over leedham again running on the tdu platform in   percent to  percent leedham challenged hoffa and the hoffa unity slate a third time in  losing  percent to  percent with  percent turnout hoffa faced tdu candidate sandy pope a local union president in  also running with a full slate of

and popes  percent the hoffa unity slate also won all five regional vice presidencies although the slates support declined across the board hoffa won reelection once more in  this time against
