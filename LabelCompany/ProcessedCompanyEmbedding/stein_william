policy about this textbook the systematic study of number theory was initiated around bc when euclid proved that there are infinitely many prime numbers at the same time he also cleverly deduced the fundamental theorem of arithmetic which asserts that every positive integer factors uniquely as a product of primes over  years later around ad arab mathematicians formulated the congruent number problem that asks for a way to decide whether or not a given positive integer n is the area of a right triangle all three of whose sides are rational numbers then another  years later in  diffie and hellman introduced the first ever publickey cryptosystem which enabled two people to communicate secretly over a public communications channel with no predetermined secret this invention and the ones that followed it revolutionized the world of digital communication in the s and s elliptic curves revolutionized number theory providing striking new insights into the congruent number problem primality testing publickey cryptography attacks on publickey systems and playing a central role in andrew wiles resolution of fermats last theorem   today pure and applied number theory is an exciting mix of simultaneously broad and deep theory which is constantly informed and motivated by algorithms and explicit computation active research is underway that promises to resolve the congruent number problem deepen our understanding into the structure of prime numbers and both challenge and improve our ability to communicate securely the goal of this book is to bring the reader closer to this world each chapter contains exercises and throughout the text there are examples of calculations done using the powerful free open source mathematical software system sage the reader should know how to read and write mathematical proofs and must know the basics of groups rings and fields thus the prerequisites for this book are more than the prerequisites for most elementary number theory books while still being aimed at undergraduates   william stein is an associate professor of mathematics at the university of washington he is also the author of modular forms a computational approach ams  and the lead developer of the open source software sage show all reviews from the reviews this one treats topics that have become standard in recent years … and it has exercises with selected solutions … it gives the students a tool to do calculations that illustrate even the most abstract concepts and simultaneously introduces them to an open source software that can later be applied profitably for studying research problems … introducing the reader to a powerful software system franz lemmermeyer zentralblatt math vol   the cliché that number theory ever the purest mathematics now yields very practical applications barely tells the story teach undergraduate number theory today and students demand to hear about publickey cryptography and related technologies … stein univ of washington serves undergraduates well by … opening the way by intimating their power … he frames the sophisticated birch and swinnertondyer conjecture as the new canonical challenge for the future summing up recommended all undergraduates students professionals and general readers d v feldman choice vol   october  this book is an introduction to elementary number theory with a computational flavor … many numerical examples are given throughout the book using the sage mathematical software the text is aimed at an undergraduate student with a basic knowledge of groups

more douglasfir seedlings survived than did western hemlock seedlings  vs  percent averaged much taller  vs  cm and larger in diameter  vs  cm survival of tubed seedlings averaged  percent untubed

measured along linear transects stem density and height on milacre plots and live biomass by destructive sampling live vegetative cover averaged  percent before site preparation rapid establishment of pioneering herbaceous species after site preparation soon erased temporary reductions in total cover the woody shrub component of total cover was reduced from  to  percent by broadcast burning and from  to  percent by preburn spraying and broadcast burning by the third examination woody shrub cover was double as much in control areas as in the sprayandburn treatments  vs  percent spraying herbicide for release caused only a minor reduction in woody shrub cover by the th year woody shrub cover averaged  percent in the control but only  percent in the sprayandburn treatment more tree cover after sprayandburn than for other site preparation treatments appears attributable to lower competition of woody shrubs throughout the decade red alder alnus rubra bong and salmonberry rubus
