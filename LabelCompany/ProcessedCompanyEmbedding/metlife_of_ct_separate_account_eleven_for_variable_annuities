proposed substitutions  applicants represent that the contracts permit the applicable insurance company subject to compliance with applicable law to substitute shares of another investment company for shares of an investment company held by a subaccount of the separate accounts the prospectuses for the contracts and the separate accounts contain appropriate disclosure of this right  by a supplement to the prospectuses for the contracts and the separate accounts each insurance company has notified all owners of the contracts of its intention to take the necessary actions including seeking the order requested by this application to substitute shares of the funds as described herein the supplement has advised contract owners that from the date of the supplement until the date of the proposed substitution owners are permitted to make one transfer of contract value or annuity unit exchange out of the existing fund subaccount to one or more other subaccounts without the transfer or exchange being treated as one of a limited number of permitted transfers or exchanges or a limited number of transfers or exchanges permitted without a transfer charge the start printed page supplement also has informed contract owners that the insurance company will not exercise any rights reserved under any contract to impose additional restrictions on transfers until at least  days after the proposed substitutions the supplement has also advised contract owners that for at least  days following the proposed substitutions the insurance companies will permit contract owners affected by the substitutions to make one transfer of contract value or annuity unit exchange out of the replacement fund subaccount to one or more other subaccounts without the transfer or exchange being treated as one of a limited number of permitted transfers or exchanges or a limited number of transfers or exchanges permitted without a transfer charge  the proposed substitutions will take place at relative net asset value with no change in the amount of any contract owners contract value cash value or death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investment in the separate accounts  the process for accomplishing the transfer of assets from each existing fund to its corresponding replacement fund will be determined on a casebycase basis in most cases it is expected that the substitutions will be effected by redeeming shares of an existing fund for cash and using the cash to purchase shares of the replacement fund in certain other cases it is expected that the substitutions will be effected by redeeming the shares of an existing fund inkind those assets will then be contributed inkind to the corresponding replacement fund to purchase shares of that fund all inkind redemptions from an existing fund of which any of the substitution applicants is an affiliated person will be effected in accordance with the conditions set forth in the commissions noaction letter issued to signature financial group inc available december    contract owners will not incur any fees or charges as a result of the proposed substitutions nor will their rights or an insurance companys obligations under the contracts be altered in any way all expenses incurred in connection with the proposed substitutions including brokerage legal accounting and other fees and expenses will be paid by the insurance companies in addition the proposed substitutions will not impose any tax liability on contract owners the proposed substitutions will not cause the contract fees and charges currently being paid by existing contract owners to be greater after the proposed substitutions than before the proposed substitutions no fees will be charged on the transfers made at the time of the proposed substitutions because the proposed substitutions will not be treated as a transfer for the purpose of assessing transfer charges or for determining the number of remaining permissible transfers in a contract year  in addition to the prospectus supplements distributed to owners of contracts within five business days after the proposed substitutions are completed contract owners will be sent a written notice informing them that the substitutions were carried out and that they may make one transfer of all contract value or cash value under a contract invested in any one of the subaccounts on the date of the notice to one or more other subaccounts available under their contract at no cost and without regard to the usual limit on the frequency of transfers among subaccounts or from the variable account options to the fixed account options the notice will also reiterate that other than with respect to “market timing” activity the insurance company will not exercise any rights reserved by it under the contracts to impose additional restrictions on transfers or to impose any charges on transfers until at least  days after the proposed substitutions the insurance companies will also send each contract owner current prospectuses for the replacement funds involved to the extent that they have not previously received a copy  each insurance company also is seeking approval of the proposed substitutions from any state insurance regulators whose approval may be necessary or appropriate  the substitution applicants agree that for those who were contract owners on the date of the proposed substitutions the insurance companies will reimburse on the last business day of each fiscal period not to exceed a fiscal quarter during the twentyfour months following the date of the proposed substitutions those contract owners whose subaccount invests in the replacement fund such that the sum of the replacement funds net operating expenses taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements and subaccount expenses assetbased fees and charges deducted on a daily basis from subaccount assets and reflected in the calculation of subaccount unit values for such period will not

of the proposed substitutions  in each case the applicable insurance companies believe that it is in the best interests of the contract owners to substitute the replacement fund for the existing fund the insurance companies believe that in cases where the replacement fund has a new subadviser the new subadviser will over the long term be positioned to provide at least comparable performance to that of the existing funds subadviser  the substitution applicants anticipate that contract owners will be better off with the array of subaccounts offered after the proposed substitutions than they have been with the array of subaccounts offered prior to the substitutions  the substitution applicants submit that none of the proposed substitutions is of the type that section c was designed to prevent  the substitution applicants request an order of the commission pursuant to section c of the act approving the proposed substitutions by the insurance companies  the section  applicants request an order under section b exempting them from the provisions of section a to the extent necessary to permit the insurance companies to carry out each of the proposed substitutions  section a of the act in relevant part prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company or any affiliated person of such person acting as principal from knowingly selling any security or other property to that company section a of the act generally prohibits the persons described above acting as principals from knowingly purchasing any security or other property from the registered company  because shares held by a separate account of an insurance company are legally owned by the insurance company the insurance companies and their affiliates collectively own of record substantially all of the shares of mist and met series fund therefore mist and met series fund and their respective funds are arguably under the control of the insurance companies notwithstanding the fact that contract owners may be considered the beneficial owners of those shares held in the separate accounts if mist and met series fund and their respective funds are under the control of the insurance companies then each insurance company is an affiliated person or an affiliated person of an affiliated person of mist and met series fund and their respective funds if mist and met series fund and their respective funds are under the control of the insurance companies then mist and met series fund and their respective funds are affiliated persons of the insurance companies  regardless of whether or not the insurance companies can be considered to control mist and met series fund and their respective funds because the insurance companies own of record more than  of the shares of each of them and are under common control with each replacement funds investment adviser the insurance companies are affiliated persons of both mist and met series fund and their respective funds likewise their respective funds are each an affiliated person of the insurance companies  the insurance companies through their separate accounts in the aggregate own more than  of the outstanding shares of the following existing funds janus aspen global technology portfolio legg mason clearbridge variable capital portfolio legg mason global currents variable international all cap opportunity portfolio legg mason western asset variable diversified strategic income portfolio legg mason western asset variable strategic bond portfolio pioneer bond vct portfolio and pioneer fund vct portfolio therefore each insurance company is an affiliated person of those funds  because the substitutions may be effected in whole or in part by means of inkind redemptions and purchases the substitutions may be deemed to involve one or more purchases or sales of securities or property between affiliated persons the proposed transactions may involve a transfer of portfolio securities by the existing funds to the insurance companies immediately thereafter the insurance companies would purchase shares of the replacement funds with the portfolio securities received from the existing funds accordingly as the insurance companies and certain of the existing funds listed above and the insurance companies and the replacement funds could be viewed as affiliated persons of one another under section a of the act it is conceivable that this aspect of the substitutions could be viewed as being prohibited by section a  section b of the act provides that the commission may upon application grant an order exempting any transaction from the prohibitions of section a if the evidence establishes that a the terms of the proposed transaction including the consideration to be paid or received are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned b the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned as recited in its registration statement and records filed under the act and c the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the act  the section  applicants submit that for all the reasons stated above the terms of the proposed inkind purchases of shares of the replacement funds by the insurance companies including the consideration to be paid and received as described in this application are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned the section  applicants also submit that the proposed inkind purchases by the insurance companies are consistent with the policies of a mist and of its third avenue small cap value rcm technology mettempleton growth mfs research international pimco total return and pioneer fund portfolios and b met series fund and of its davis venture value western asset management strategic bond opportunities and van eck global natural resources portfolios start printed page as recited in the current registration statements and reports filed by each under the act finally the section  applicants submit that the proposed substitutions are consistent with the general purposes of the act  to the extent that the inkind purchases by the insurance company of the replacement funds shares are deemed to involve principal transactions among affiliated persons the procedures described below should be sufficient to assure that the terms of the proposed transactions are reasonable and fair to all participants the section  applicants maintain that the terms of the proposed inkind purchase transactions including the consideration to be paid and received by each fund involved are reasonable fair and do not involve overreaching principally because the transactions will conform with all but one of the conditions enumerated in rule a the proposed transactions will take place at relative net asset value in conformity with the requirements of section c of the act and rule c thereunder with no change in the amount of any contract owners contract value or death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investment in any of the separate accounts contract owners will not suffer any adverse tax consequences as a result of the substitutions the fees and charges under the contracts will not increase because of the substitutions even though the separate accounts the insurance companies mist and met series fund may not rely on rule a the section  applicants believe that the rules conditions outline the type of safeguards that result in transactions that are fair and reasonable to registered investment company participants and preclude overreaching in connection with an investment company by its affiliated persons in addition as stated above the inkind redemptions will only be made in accordance with the conditions set out in the signature financial group noaction letter december    the boards of mist and met series fund have adopted procedures as required by paragraph e of rule a pursuant to which the series of each may purchase and sell securities to and from their affiliates the section  applicants will carry out the proposed insurance company inkind purchases in conformity with all of the conditions of rule a and each series procedures thereunder except that the consideration paid for the securities being purchased or sold may not be entirely cash nevertheless the circumstances surrounding the proposed substitutions will be such as to offer the same degree of protection to each replacement fund from overreaching that rule a provides to them generally in connection with their purchase and sale of securities under that rule in the ordinary course of their business in particular the insurance companies or any of their affiliates cannot effect the proposed transactions at a price that is disadvantageous to any of the replacement funds although the transactions may not be entirely for cash each will be effected based upon  the independent market
