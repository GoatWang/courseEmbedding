deals made by the hong merchants who in their turn passed the tax burden to the foreign traders the limited trading ports and the exorbitant fees paid to the customs officer via hong merchants were the main grievances expressed by the company traders seeking ways of bypassing the restrictions imposed by the local officials at canton the court of directors of the east india company proposed sending a royal envoy to the imperial court at peking to negotiate a preferential treatythe first british ambassador to china lord george macartney   0 a distinguished diplomat and colonial administrator set sail for china in september  and the voyage lasted nearly a year  portrait of george macartney by walexander  wd  f enlarge he was accompanied by his secretary sir george staunton 0 and his elevenyearold son a linguistic genius who had learned to speak and write chinese other distinguished personalities in his entourage include william alexander  a painter who recorded the entire event in watercolour sketches and three craftsmen specialized in metallurgy weaving and pottery who were ordered to observe the technological developments made by the chinese on board the ship macartney carried £ worth of presents from the east india company the highlight of which was a planetarium with the latest astronomical technology from europe to be presented to the emperor of china planetarium present to the emperor of china  by william alexander wd  fv enlarge in september  macartney was finally granted an audience with emperor qianlong to whom he presented the valuable gifts and a letter from george iii in which the king of england requested permission from the emperor to establish a british resident minister in peking in charge of overseeing trading affairs during the interview the child staunton was an instant star who delighted the elderly emperor with his fluent spoken chinese macartneys first meeting with qianlong the boy on the right is the elevenyearold george staunton who impressed the emperor with his spoken chinese by william alexanderwd  f enlarge a few days later macartney and his entourage were invited to the emperors eightieth birthday party but to macartneys disappointment the emperor himself did not show up on  october he received a reply from emperor qianlong in a formal ceremony in the palace the reply confirmed his worst fear that the request for a resident minister in peking was not granted knowing that it would be futile to insist on his first request macartney sought the approval of the emperor to lift some of the trading restrictions to the english traders the second letter was again unconditionally rejected the first british envoy to china was thus dismissed portrait of emperor qianlong by william alexander wd  f enlarge a second mission led by lord amherst went to china in  and like its predecessor returned without any agreement with the chinese governmentmeanwhile the china trade flourished despite the failure of governmental efforts to remove the administrative restrictions in the th century the company traded british woollens and indian cottons for chinese tea porcelain and silk tea imports soon became the largest single item in britains trading account conversely the export to china of british and indian goods began to decline and trade imbalance between britain and china occurred as a result the shortage of silver to pay for the tea imports forced the british to seek other commodities to compensate for the loss and to bring in profit they discovered opium a highly lucrative commodity although never directly involved in the sale of opium which was banned in china by imperial edict of  as an illegal drug the east india company was responsible for most of its production in india mainly for its medicinal value the actual business of selling opium was conducted through private agencies india house the sale room p enlarge in  the jealouslyprotected monopoly of the east india company was finally abolished and the china trade was opened to the competition of dozens of british companies who had been petitioning the government and lobbying members of parliament for free trade for yearsnot long after the end of monopoly of the east india company it became evident that opium traffic had turned into the sole profitable business for some british companies in southern china by s opium flooded the entire black market in china and inevitably became a major cause of concern for the chinese government a chinese official in canton commissioner lin ordered the confiscation of some  chests of opium from english ships and refused to pay indemnity to the british traders this incident outraged the british and triggered the first opium war in 0 this lasted two years and resulted in a treaty which caused hong kong to be ceded to the british crown for 0 years and five chinese ports canton amoy foochow ningpo and shanghai to be opened to foreign
