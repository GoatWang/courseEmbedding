watch in times video » embed omaha — “the tax system is not crippling our business around the world”that was warren e buffett the chairman and chief executive of berkshire hathaway over the weekend at the company’s annual meeting known as “woodstock for capitalists”mr buffett in a remarkably blunt and pointed remark implicitly rebuked his fellow chief executives who have been lobbying the trump administration and washington lawmakers to lower corporate taxesin truth mr buffett said a specter much more sinister than corporate taxes is looming over american businesses health care costs and chief executives who have been maniacally focused on seeking relief from their tax bills would be smart to shift their attention to these costs which are swelling and swallowing their profitsit was clarifying to hear mr buffett frame things this way the need for corporate tax relief has become the lodestar of the corner office with ceos rhapsodizing over president trump’s plan to try to stimulate growth by cutting tax rates for businesses advertisement continue reading the main story but as mr buffett pointed out these chief executives are missing the bigger issue — the one that should be their holy grail as a percentage of our gross domestic product the cost of maintaining our american health care system — hospitals hmos doctor visits prescription drugs medical devices insurance companies medicare — is rising at an alarming rate and corporate america pays a big and growing chunk of the bill continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story we’re not talking about the cost of health insurance which is a fraction of the overall costtoday’s corporate tax rates mr buffett seemed to suggest are a distraction not a true impediment to growth“if you go back to  or thereabouts corporate taxes were about  percent of gdp” mr buffett said “i mean they bounced around some and now they’re about  percent of gdp”by contrast he said while tax rates have fallen as a share of gross domestic product health care costs have ballooned about  years ago he said “health care was  percent of gdp and now it’s about  percent”his is one of the most cogent arguments for renewing attention on the underlying costs of our health care system — an issue far beyond the debate around the affordable care act and what it is going to look like if it is repealed and replacedmr buffett said our global competitiveness had fallen largely because our businesses were paying far more for health care — a tax by another name — than those in other countries corporate tax rates are falling worldwide the united states has the highest corporate tax rate among the world’s industrialized nations several of which have recently cut their rates

people to omaha he gave a virtual seminar on the economics of health care that chief executives and lawmakers would be helped by hearing he demonstrated in stark terms that the constant refrain from the business community about taxes should probably be redirected toward trying to bend the cost curve of health care“when american business talks about strangling our competitiveness or that sort of thing they’re talking about something that as a percentage of gdp has gone down” mr buffett said “while medical costs which are borne to a great extent by business” have swelled photo warren e buffett on saturday at berkshire hathaway’s shareholders meeting in omaha where he repeated his argument that “medical costs are the tapeworm of american economic competitiveness” credit rick wilkingreuters he is right in  corporate taxes in the united states were about  percent of gdp which is probably the best way to measure the burden on businesses then the percentage fell steadily reaching its bottom in  before rising slightly over the last several decades today it is  percent advertisement continue reading the main story in the meantime health care costs as a percent of gdp have skyrocketed

and it harms american companies in particular since they bear such a big share of those costs corporations spend  on average for coverage of a family of four up  percent since  according to a study by the kaiser family foundation“medical costs are the tapeworm of american economic competitiveness” mr buffett said using a metaphor he has employed in the past to describe the insidious and parasitic costs of our health care systemmr buffett is a democrat but his business partner charles t munger is a republican — and a rare one who has advocated a singlepayer health care system under his plan which mr buffett agrees with the united states would enact a sort of universal type of coverage for all citizens — perhaps along the lines of the medicaid system — with an optout provision that would allow the wealthy to still get concierge medicineour bloated health care system mr buffett asserted is the true barrier to america’s world competitiveness as well as “the single biggest variable where we keep getting more and more out of whack with the rest of the world”but people don’t talk about it enough “it’s very tough for political parties to attack it but it’s basically a political subject” mr buffett said in reply to a question i had posed i was one of three journalists and three analysts who along with shareholders peppered mr buffett and mr munger with questions during the meetingthat’s not to say corporate tax reform won’t help but it is tiny relative to fixing health care advertisement continue reading the main story indeed mr buffett said even if washington put in place a tax credit for capital investment he did not think that bnsf — the railroad company he owns which spends billions on fixing rail tracks — would do its job faster or better because of the potential tax credit“i can’t recall sending anything out to our managers saying ‘let’s do this because the tax law is going to change’” mr buffett saidmr munger the vice chairman of berkshire hathaway added “we’re not going to change anything at the railroad just for some little tax jiggle”neither man however is expecting the bigger tax — health care — to be fixed anytime soon“on this issue both parties hate each other so much that neither one can think rationally and i don’t think that helps either” mr munger said continue reading the main story we’re interested in your feedback on this page

buffett said i have been audited by the irs multiple times and am currently being audited i have no problem in releasing my tax information while under audit neither would mr trump  at least he would

life  months in a coma or something then the us is probably the best but he also said that other countries spend much less and receive much more in health care value visits hospital beds doctors and nurses per capita buffett faults the incentives in the united states medical industry that payers reimburse doctors for procedures feeforservice leading to unnecessary care overutilization instead of paying for results he cited atul gawandes  article in the new yorker as a useful consideration of us health care with its documentation of unwarranted variation in medicare expenditures between mcallen texas and el paso texas buffett raised the problem of lobbying by the medical industry saying that they are very focused on maintaining their income play media president obama announcing the buffett rule taxes see also buffett rule buffett stated that he only paid  of his income for   million in total federal taxes due to their source as dividends and capital gains although the figure

choosing the  olympic team by picking the eldest sons of the goldmedal winners in the  olympics in  buffett testified before the senate and urged them to preserve the estate tax so as to avoid a plutocracy some critics argued that buffett through berkshire hathaway has a personal interest in the continuation of the estate tax since berkshire hathaway benefited from the estate tax in past business dealings and had developed and marketed insurance policies to protect policy holders against future estate tax payments buffett believes government should not be in the business of gambling or legalizing casinos calling it a tax on ignorance trade deficit buffett viewed the united states expanding trade deficit as a trend that will devalue the us dollar and us assets he predicted that the us dollar will lose value in the long run as a result of putting a larger portion of ownership of us assets in the hands of foreigners in his letter to shareholders in march  he predicted that in another ten years time the net ownership of the us by outsiders would amount to  trillion americans  would chafe at the idea of perpetually paying tribute to their creditors and owners abroad a country that is now aspiring to an ownership society will not find happiness in – and ill use hyperbole here for emphasis – a sharecropping society’ dollar and gold the trade deficit induced buffett to enter the foreign currency market for the first time in  he substantially reduced his stake in  as changing interest rates increased the costs of holding currency contracts buffett remained bearish on the dollar stating that he was looking to acquire companies with substantial foreign revenues buffett emphasized the nonproductive aspect of a gold standard for the united states dollar in  at harvard it gets dug out of the ground in africa or someplace then we melt it down dig another hole bury it again and pay people to stand around guarding it it has no utility anyone watching from mars would be scratching their head in  about stocks gold farmland and inflation he stated stocks are probably still the best of all the poor alternatives in an era of inflation – at least they are if you buy in at appropriate prices china buffett invested in petrochina company limited and in a rare move posted a commentary on berkshire hathaways website stating why he would not divest over its connection with the sudanese civil war that caused harvard to divest he sold this stake soon afterwards sparing him the billions of dollars he would have lost had he held on to the company in the midst of the steep drop in oil prices beginning in the summer of  in october  buffett invested  million for  of battery maker byd company sehk  which runs a subsidiary of electric automobile manufacturer byd auto in less than one year the investment reaped over  return tobacco during the rjr nabisco inc hostile takeover fight in  buffett was quoted as telling john gutfreund ill tell you why i like the cigarette business it costs a penny to make sell it for a dollar its addictive and theres fantastic brand loyalty — buffett quoted in barbarians at the gate the fall of rjr nabisco speaking at berkshire hathaway incs  annual meeting buffett said investments in tobacco are fraught with questions that relate to societal attitudes and those of the present administration i would not like to have a significant percentage of my net worth invested in tobacco businesses the economy of the business may be fine but that doesnt mean it has a bright future — buffett berkshire hathaway annual meeting coal in  buffetts pacificorp a subsidiary of his midamerican energy company canceled six proposed coalfired power plants these included utahs intermountain power project unit  jim

billion plant in arizona his first investments in solar power he already owned wind farms expensing of stock options he has been a strong proponent of stock option expensing on corporate income statements at the  annual meeting he lambasted a bill before the united states congress that would consider only some companyissued stock options compensation as an expense likening the bill to one that was almost passed by the indiana house of representatives to change the value of pi from  to  through legislative fiat when a company gives something of value to its employees in return for their services it is clearly a compensation expense and if expenses dont belong in the earnings statement where in the world do they belong technology in may  buffett said he had avoided buying stock in new social media companies such as facebook and google because it is hard to estimate future value he also stated that initial public offering ipo of stock are almost always bad investments investors

the united states medical industry that payers reimburse doctors for procedures feeforservice leading to unnecessary care overutilization instead of paying for results he cited atul gawandes  article in the new yorker as a useful consideration of us health care with its documentation of unwarranted variation in medicare expenditures between mcallen texas and el paso texas buffett raised the problem of lobbying by the medical industry saying that they are very focused on maintaining their income play media president obama announcing the buffett rule taxes see also buffett rule buffett stated that he only paid  of his income for   million in total federal taxes due to their source as dividends and capital gains although the figure excluded the taxes on that income paid by the

sons of the goldmedal winners in the  olympics in  buffett testified before the senate and urged them to preserve the estate tax so as to avoid a plutocracy some critics argued that buffett through

insurance policies to protect policy holders against future estate tax payments buffett believes government should not be in the business of gambling or legalizing casinos calling it a tax on ignorance trade deficit buffett viewed the united states expanding trade deficit as a trend that will devalue the us dollar and us assets he predicted that the us dollar will lose value in the long run as a result of putting a larger portion of ownership of us assets in the hands of foreigners in his letter to shareholders in march  he predicted that in another ten years time the net ownership of the us by outsiders would amount to  trillion americans  would chafe at the idea of perpetually paying tribute to their creditors and owners abroad a country that is now aspiring to an ownership society will not find happiness in – and ill use hyperbole here for emphasis – a sharecropping society’ dollar and gold the trade deficit induced buffett to enter the foreign currency market for the first time in  he substantially reduced his stake in  as changing interest rates increased the costs of holding currency contracts buffett remained bearish on the dollar stating that he was looking to acquire companies with substantial foreign revenues buffett emphasized the nonproductive aspect of a gold standard for the united states dollar in  at harvard it gets dug out of the ground in africa or someplace then we melt it down dig another hole bury it again and pay people to stand around guarding it it has no utility anyone watching from mars would be scratching their head in  about stocks gold farmland and inflation he stated stocks are probably still the best of all the poor alternatives in an era of inflation – at least they are if you buy in at appropriate prices china buffett invested in petrochina company limited and in a rare move posted a commentary on berkshire hathaways website stating why he would not divest over its connection with the sudanese civil war that caused harvard to divest he sold this stake soon afterwards sparing him the billions of dollars he would have lost had he held on to the company in the midst of the steep drop in oil prices beginning in the summer of  in october  buffett invested  million for  of battery maker byd company sehk  which runs a subsidiary of electric automobile manufacturer byd auto in less than one year the investment reaped over  return tobacco during the rjr nabisco inc hostile takeover fight in  buffett was quoted as telling john gutfreund ill tell you why i like the cigarette business it costs a penny to make sell it for a dollar its addictive and theres fantastic brand loyalty — buffett quoted in barbarians at the gate the fall of rjr nabisco speaking at berkshire hathaway incs  annual meeting buffett said investments in tobacco are fraught with questions that relate to societal attitudes and those of the present administration i would not like to have a significant percentage of my net worth invested in tobacco businesses the economy of the business may be fine but that doesnt mean it has a bright future — buffett berkshire hathaway annual meeting coal in  buffetts pacificorp a subsidiary

buffetts midamerican energy holdings agreed to buy a  billion solar energy project under development in california and a  percent stake in a  billion plant in arizona his first investments in solar power he already owned wind farms expensing of stock options he has been a strong proponent of stock option expensing on corporate income statements at the  annual meeting he lambasted a bill before the united states congress that would consider only some companyissued stock options compensation as an expense likening the bill to one that was almost passed by the indiana house of representatives to change the value of pi from  to  through legislative fiat when a company gives something of value to its employees in return for their services it is clearly a compensation expense and if expenses dont belong in the earnings statement where in the world do they belong technology in may  buffett said he had avoided buying stock in new social media companies such as facebook and google because it is hard to estimate future value he also stated that initial public offering ipo of stock are almost always bad investments investors should be looking to companies that will have good value in ten

near their peak i in no way anticipated the dramatic fall in energy prices that occurred in the last half of the year i still believe the odds are good that oil sells far higher in the future than the current – price but so far i have been dead wrong even if prices should rise moreover the terrible timing of my purchase has cost berkshire several billion dollars the merger with the burlington

devastating tax than anything that has been enacted by our legislatures the inflation tax has a fantastic ability to simply consume capital it makes no difference to a widow with her savings in a  percent passbook account whether she pays  percent income tax on her interest income during a period of zero inflation or pays no income taxes during years of  percent inflation — buffett fortune  in

expectations let me summarize what ive been saying about the stock market i think its very hard to come up with a persuasive case that equities will over the next  years perform anything like—anything like—theyve performed in the past  if i had to pick the most probable return from appreciation and dividends combined that investors in aggregate—repeat aggregate—would earn in a world of constant interest rates  inflation and those ever hurtful frictional costs it would be  — buffett fortune  index funds and active management towards his later life particularly following the global financial

to shareholders that when trillions of dollars are managed by wall streeters charging high fees it will usually be the managers who reap outsized profits not the clients in  buffett made a bet with

the united states medical industry that payers reimburse doctors for procedures feeforservice leading to unnecessary care overutilization instead of paying for results he cited atul gawandes  article in the new yorker as a useful consideration of us health care with its documentation of unwarranted variation in medicare expenditures between mcallen texas and el paso texas buffett raised the problem of lobbying by the medical industry saying that they are very focused on maintaining their income play media president obama announcing the buffett rule taxes see also buffett rule buffett stated that he only paid  of his income for   million in total federal taxes due to their source as dividends and capital gains although the figure excluded the taxes on that income paid by the

sons of the goldmedal winners in the  olympics in  buffett testified before the senate and urged them to preserve the estate tax so as to avoid a plutocracy some critics argued that buffett through berkshire hathaway has a personal interest in the continuation of the estate tax since berkshire hathaway benefited from the estate tax in past business dealings and had developed and marketed insurance policies to protect policy holders against future estate tax payments buffett believes government should not be in the business of gambling or legalizing casinos calling it a tax on ignorance trade deficit buffett viewed the united states expanding trade deficit as a trend that will devalue the us dollar and us assets he predicted that the us dollar will lose value in the long run as a result of putting a larger portion of ownership of us assets in the hands of foreigners in his letter to shareholders in march  he predicted that in another ten years time the net ownership of the us by outsiders would amount to  trillion americans  would chafe at the idea of perpetually paying tribute to their creditors and owners abroad a country that is now aspiring to an ownership society will not find happiness in – and ill use hyperbole here for emphasis – a sharecropping society’ dollar and gold the trade deficit induced buffett to enter the foreign currency market for the first time in  he substantially reduced his stake in  as changing interest rates increased the costs of holding currency contracts buffett remained bearish on the dollar stating that he was looking to acquire companies with substantial foreign revenues buffett emphasized the nonproductive aspect of a gold standard for the united states dollar in  at harvard it gets dug out of the ground in africa or someplace then we melt it down dig another hole bury it again and pay people to stand around guarding it it has no utility anyone watching from mars would be scratching their head in  about stocks gold farmland and inflation he stated stocks are probably still the best of all the poor alternatives in an era of inflation – at least they are if you buy in at appropriate prices china buffett invested in petrochina company limited and in a rare move posted a commentary on berkshire hathaways website stating why he would not divest over its connection with the sudanese civil war that caused harvard to divest he sold this stake soon afterwards sparing him the billions of dollars he would have lost had he held on to the company in the midst of the steep drop in oil prices beginning in the summer of  in october  buffett invested  million for  of battery maker byd company sehk  which runs a subsidiary of electric automobile manufacturer byd auto in less than one year the investment reaped over  return tobacco during the rjr nabisco inc hostile takeover fight in  buffett was quoted as telling john gutfreund ill tell you why i like the cigarette business it costs a penny to make sell it for a dollar its addictive and theres fantastic brand loyalty — buffett quoted in barbarians at the gate the fall of rjr nabisco speaking at berkshire hathaway incs  annual meeting buffett said investments in tobacco are fraught with questions that relate to societal attitudes and those of the present administration i would not like to have a significant percentage of my net worth invested in tobacco businesses the economy of the business may be fine but that doesnt mean it has a bright future — buffett berkshire hathaway annual meeting coal in  buffetts pacificorp a subsidiary

buffetts midamerican energy holdings agreed to buy a  billion solar energy project under development in california and a  percent stake in a  billion plant in arizona his first investments in solar power he already owned wind farms expensing of stock options he has been a strong proponent of stock option expensing on corporate income statements at the  annual meeting he lambasted a bill before the united states congress that would consider only some companyissued stock options compensation as an expense likening the bill to one that was almost passed by the indiana house of representatives to change the value of pi from  to  through legislative fiat when a company gives something of value to its employees in return for their services it is clearly a compensation expense and if expenses dont belong in the earnings statement where in the world do they belong technology in may  buffett said he had avoided buying stock in new social media companies such as facebook and google because it is hard to estimate future value he also stated that initial public offering ipo of stock are almost always bad investments investors should be looking to companies that will have good value in ten

near their peak i in no way anticipated the dramatic fall in energy prices that occurred in the last half of the year i still believe the odds are good that oil sells far higher in the future than the current – price but so far i have been dead wrong even if prices should rise moreover the terrible timing of my purchase has cost berkshire several billion dollars the merger with the burlington

billion in net profit the most it had ever made in a threemonth period investment philosophy warren buffetts writings include his annual reports and various articles buffett is recognized by communicators as a great storyteller as evidenced by his annual letters to shareholders he warned about the pernicious effects of inflation the arithmetic makes it plain that inflation is a far more devastating tax than anything that has been enacted by our legislatures the inflation tax has a fantastic ability to simply consume capital it makes no difference to a widow with her savings in a  percent passbook account whether she pays  percent income tax on her interest income during a period of zero inflation or pays no income taxes during years of  percent inflation — buffett fortune  in

munger buffetts own business partner at berkshire rick guerin pacific partners ltd and stan perlmeter perlmeter investments in his november  fortune article he warned of investors unrealistic expectations let me summarize what ive been saying about the stock market i think its very hard to come up with a persuasive case that equities will over the next  years perform anything like—anything like—theyve performed in the past  if i had to pick the most probable return from appreciation and dividends combined that investors in aggregate—repeat aggregate—would earn in a world of constant interest rates  inflation and those ever hurtful frictional costs it would be  — buffett fortune  index funds and active management towards his later life particularly following the global financial

the long run and has advised both individual and institutional investors to move their money to lowcost index funds that track broad diversified stock market indices buffett said in one of his letters to shareholders that when trillions of dollars are managed by wall streeters charging high fees it will usually be the managers who reap outsized profits not the clients in  buffett made a bet with

million meaning he had an effective federal income tax rate of around  percent buffett also said he had made more than  billion worth of donations last year buffett said i have been audited by the irs multiple times and am currently being audited i have no problem in releasing my tax information while under audit neither would mr trump  at least he would have no legal problem this was a measured response to trump saying he was unable to release his tax information due to being under audit health care buffett described the health care reform under president barack obama as insufficient to deal

probably the best but he also said that other countries spend much less and receive much more in health care value visits hospital beds doctors and nurses per capita buffett faults the incentives in the united states medical industry that payers reimburse doctors for procedures feeforservice leading to unnecessary care overutilization instead of paying for results he cited atul gawandes  article in the new yorker as a useful consideration of us health care with its documentation of unwarranted variation in medicare expenditures between mcallen texas and el paso texas buffett raised the problem of lobbying by the medical industry saying that they are very focused on maintaining their income play media president obama announcing the buffett rule taxes see also buffett rule buffett stated that he only paid  of his income for   million in total federal taxes due to their source as dividends and capital gains although the figure excluded the taxes on that income paid by the

sons of the goldmedal winners in the  olympics in  buffett testified before the senate and urged them to preserve the estate tax so as to avoid a plutocracy some critics argued that buffett through berkshire hathaway has a personal interest in the continuation of the estate tax since berkshire hathaway benefited from the estate tax in past business dealings and had developed and marketed insurance policies to protect policy holders against future estate tax payments buffett believes government should not be in the business of gambling or legalizing casinos calling it a tax on ignorance trade deficit buffett viewed the united states expanding trade deficit as a trend that will devalue the us dollar and us assets he predicted that the us dollar will lose value in the long run as a result of putting a larger portion of ownership of us assets in the hands of foreigners in his letter to shareholders in march  he predicted that in another ten years time the net ownership of the us by outsiders would amount to  trillion americans  would chafe at the idea of perpetually paying tribute to their creditors and owners abroad a country that is now aspiring to an ownership society will not find happiness in – and ill use hyperbole here for emphasis – a sharecropping society’ dollar and gold the trade deficit induced buffett to enter the foreign currency market for the first time in  he substantially reduced his stake in  as changing interest rates increased the costs of holding currency contracts buffett remained bearish on the dollar stating that he was looking to acquire companies with substantial foreign revenues buffett emphasized the nonproductive aspect of a gold standard for the united states dollar in  at harvard it gets dug out of the ground in africa or someplace then we melt it down dig another hole bury it again and pay people to stand around guarding it it has no utility anyone watching from mars would be scratching their head in  about stocks gold farmland and inflation he stated stocks are probably still the best of all the poor alternatives in an era of inflation – at least they are if you buy in at appropriate prices china buffett invested in petrochina company limited and in a rare move posted a commentary on berkshire hathaways website stating why he would not divest over its connection with the sudanese civil war that caused harvard to divest he sold this stake soon afterwards sparing him the billions of dollars he would have lost had he held on to the company in the midst of the steep drop in oil prices beginning in the summer of  in october  buffett invested  million for  of battery maker byd company sehk  which runs a subsidiary of electric automobile manufacturer byd auto in less than one year the investment reaped over  return tobacco during the rjr nabisco inc hostile takeover fight in  buffett was quoted as telling john gutfreund ill tell you why i like the cigarette business it costs a penny to make sell it for a dollar its addictive and theres fantastic brand loyalty — buffett quoted in barbarians at the gate the fall of rjr nabisco speaking at berkshire hathaway incs  annual meeting buffett said investments in tobacco are fraught with questions that relate to societal attitudes and those of the present administration i would not like to have a significant percentage of my net worth invested in tobacco businesses the economy of the business may be fine but that doesnt mean it has a bright future — buffett berkshire hathaway annual meeting coal in  buffetts pacificorp a subsidiary

buffetts midamerican energy holdings agreed to buy a  billion solar energy project under development in california and a  percent stake in a  billion plant in arizona his first investments in solar power he already owned wind farms expensing of stock options he has been a strong proponent of stock option expensing on corporate income statements at the  annual meeting he lambasted a bill before the united states congress that would consider only some companyissued stock options compensation as an expense likening the bill to one that was almost passed by the indiana house of representatives to change the value of pi from  to  through legislative fiat when a company gives something of value to its employees in return for their services it is clearly a compensation expense and if expenses dont belong in the earnings statement where in the world do they belong technology in may  buffett said he had avoided buying stock in new social media companies such as facebook and google because it is hard to estimate future value he also stated that initial public offering ipo of stock are almost always bad investments investors should be looking to companies that will have good value in ten

aspect of a gold standard for the united states dollar in  at harvard it gets dug out of the ground in africa or someplace then we melt it down dig another hole bury it again and pay people to stand

alternatives in an era of inflation – at least they are if you buy in at appropriate prices china buffett invested in petrochina company limited and in a rare move posted a commentary on berkshire hathaways website stating why he would not divest over its connection with the sudanese civil war that caused harvard to divest he sold this stake soon afterwards sparing him the billions of dollars

compensation as an expense likening the bill to one that was almost passed by the indiana house of representatives to change the value of pi from  to  through legislative fiat when a company gives something of value to its employees in return for their services it is clearly a compensation expense and if expenses dont belong in the earnings statement where in the world do they belong technology

of the us by outsiders would amount to  trillion americans  would chafe at the idea of perpetually paying tribute to their creditors and owners abroad a country that is now aspiring to an ownership society will not find happiness in – and ill use hyperbole here for emphasis – a sharecropping society’ dollar and gold the trade deficit induced buffett to enter the foreign currency market for the first time in  he substantially reduced his stake in  as changing interest rates increased the costs of holding currency contracts buffett remained bearish on the dollar stating that he was looking to acquire companies with substantial foreign revenues buffett emphasized the nonproductive aspect of a gold standard for the united states dollar in  at harvard it gets dug out of the ground in africa or someplace then we melt it down dig another hole bury it again and pay people to stand around guarding it it has no utility anyone watching from mars would be scratching their head in  about stocks gold farmland and inflation he stated stocks are probably still the best of all the poor alternatives in an era of inflation – at least they are if you buy in at appropriate prices china buffett invested in petrochina company limited and in a rare move posted a commentary on berkshire hathaways website stating why he would not divest over its connection with the sudanese civil war that caused harvard to divest he sold this stake soon afterwards sparing him the billions of dollars he would have lost had he held on to the company in the midst of the steep drop in oil prices beginning in the summer of  in october  buffett invested  million for  of battery maker byd company sehk  which runs a subsidiary of electric automobile manufacturer byd auto in less than one year the investment reaped over  return tobacco during the rjr nabisco inc hostile takeover fight in  buffett was quoted as telling john gutfreund ill tell you why i like the cigarette business it costs a penny to make

buffetts midamerican energy holdings agreed to buy a  billion solar energy project under development in california and a  percent stake in a  billion plant in arizona his first investments in solar power he already owned wind farms expensing of stock options he has been a strong proponent of stock option expensing on corporate income statements at the  annual meeting he lambasted a bill before the united states congress that would consider only some companyissued stock options compensation as an expense likening the bill to one that was almost passed by the indiana house of representatives to change the value of pi from  to  through legislative fiat when a company gives something of value to its employees in return for their services it is clearly a compensation expense and if expenses dont belong in the earnings statement where in the world do they belong technology in may  buffett said he had avoided buying stock in new social media companies such as facebook and google because it is hard to estimate future value he also stated that initial public offering ipo of stock are almost always bad investments investors should be looking to companies that will have good value in ten
