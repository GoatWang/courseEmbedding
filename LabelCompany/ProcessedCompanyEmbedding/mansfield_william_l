with always attention to details oppositions paradoxes that come together to create a unique product william l  was founded by guillaume laidet a young timepieces aficionado who use to work in the swiss watch industry after several years at the service of some of the most prestigious watchmaking companies he decided to start his own brand aiming at offering meaningful collections inspired by a s vintage chronograph that he inherited from his grandgranduncle this family jewel once restored quickly caught the eyes of his friends but the price for most of them was a real deal breaker this is exactly why william l  was born to offer quality timepieces with classic designs for a very attractive price point for nearly a year and thanks to his many contacts within the watchmaking industry guillaume developed a modern and affordable version of his vintage chronograph no pretending here the brand does not hide its chinese production each piece is conceived in paris and manufactured in shenzhen enabling william l  to compete in this price range to initiate his project guillaume naturally chose the crowdfunding option and rapidly got very positive feedbacks and more importantly a
