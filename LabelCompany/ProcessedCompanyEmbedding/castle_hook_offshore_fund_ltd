newswire jul    am edt new york july   prnewswire  castle harlan the new york private equity investment firm said it and its equity partners champ private equity and lime rock partners supported shelf drilling ltd in purchasing three premium jackup rigs located in the middle east the acquisition of the rigs is a continuation of shelf drillings fitforpurpose strategy of solely focusing on shallow water drilling and further expands shelf drillings leading market presence in one of its key operating regions  shelf drilling is a leading international shallowwater offshore drilling contractor engaged in the provision of equipment and services for the drilling completion and workover of offshore oil and natural gas wells shelf drilling completed the purchase and delivery in may of two of the three rigs  the west resolute and the west triton the rigs have been renamed shelf drilling resourceful and shelf drilling tenacious respectively the third jackup rig  the west mischief  is expected to be delivered to the company during q  upon completion of its current contract  following the purchase and delivery of all three rigs shelf drillings fleet will increase from  to  rigs shelf drilling financed the purchase through a us million equity issuance listed on the norwegian otc list and began trading under the ticker shlf as of may   we are continuing to enhance the value of

savings concerns over safety of pc savings bond bestbuy bonds offered by castle trust pay much more than rivals – but is your capital protected castle trusts fortress bond is claimed to have protection from the fscs photo getty by richard evans am bst  aug  follow comments savers are being warned that bestbuy fixedterm bonds that pay much better rates than their nearest rivals may not be all that they seem the bonds are offered by castle trust and pay pc for a oneyear term and pc if you tie your money up for two years these rates are much higher than the best available elsewhere – pc over one year and pc over two from punjab national bank and investec respectively but although castle trust describes its products as fixedrate bonds in its advertising they are actually very different from what most savers understand by the term – and carry much less protection from the official compensation scheme if things go wrong in fact some experts question whether savers would be compensated at all if castle trust were to go bust despite the companys claim that the bonds which are called fortress bonds are covered by the statutory safety net what is different about the castle trust bonds related articles how to use an isa to invest in property  mar  a buytolet income without being a landlord  mar  how to profit from a housing boom  aug  welsh farmers build swedish property empire  mar  castle trust is not a bank and the fortress bonds are not deposits this means that they do not qualify for the normal £ protection offered by the financial services compensation scheme fscs the statebacked safety net instead by buying its bonds you are lending money to castle trust to help it fund its business normally this type of bond is regarded as an investment and as a result your money is at risk and there is no recourse to the fscs however castle trust has adopted a refinement to this means of borrowing money that it claims does confer fscs cover specifically the company has devised a complicated twotier structure that involves an inhouse fund manager it is this subsidiary that is selling bonds to the public – and this type of company castle trust says does qualify for fscs protection although at the reduced level of £ applicable to investments as opposed to deposits so if castle trust itself goes bust it cannot repay the fund management business which is therefore unable to repay investors the fund management business is then in default and savers will be able to claim redress from the fscs castle trust said why should savers be wary there are two potential problems first savers must remember that the normal £ fscs limit for savings bonds does not apply and the most they will get back in the event of default is £ second several bond experts in the city of london cast doubt on whether the fscs would pay out at all this is blatantly a violation of the intention behind the fscs – and it wont work said one in my opinion if the company goes bust the fscs wont pay out the fscs said claims were dealt with on a casebycase basis and the outcome would depend on the specific terms and conditions of the product what does castle trust say the company said it had sought legal advice that its bonds did qualify for fscs protection sean oldfield the head of castle trust said we appreciate that the structure of our fixedrate bonds is different to the conventional savings products offered by deposit takers such as banks and building societies that said each customer has £ of protection from the fscs when our products reach maturity we will pay back the original principal invested plus the fixedrate return in exactly the same way a conventional savings product would have done richardevanstelegraphcouk • investment tips every week by email – sign
