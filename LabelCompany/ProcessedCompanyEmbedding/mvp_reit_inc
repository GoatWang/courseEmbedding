company’s prospectus to read about the more significant risks you should consider before buying shares of our common stock these risks include the following we have a limited operating history having commenced operations in december  although we have acquired several properties and identified others we intend to acquire we are effectively a “blind pool” because we have not identified and you will not be able to evaluate any additional investments we will make with proceeds from this offering this is a “best efforts” offering and if we are unable to raise substantial funds then we may not be able to accomplish our business objectives and the poor performance of a single investment may materially adversly affect our overall investment performance because a predominant focus for our investments will be parking and selfstorage facilities our revenues will be significantly influenced by demand for such properties gernerally and a decrease in such demand would likely have a greater adverse effect on our revenues than if we owned a more diversified real estate portfolio we depend upon our advisor and its affiliates to conduct our operations there is no public trading market for the shares and we are not required to list or liquidate by a certain date or at all accordingly the common shares lack liquidity and you may have to hold the investment indefinitley there are restrictions on your ability to have your shares repurchased under our share repurchase program there are substantial conflicts of interest between us and our advisor and its affiliates we may not be able to make distributions on a monthly basis we currently pay distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations and may continue to pay from sources other than cash flow from operations which includes the sale of assets borrowings or offering proceeds we have no limits on the amounts we may pay from such sources if we pay distributions from sources other than our cash flow from operations the funds available to us for investments would be reduced and your share value may be diluted we may incur substantial debt which will increase our risk and may reduce our distributions failure to qualify as a reit would adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders see “risk factors” in the company’s prospectus to read about the more significant risks you should consider before buying shares of our common stock our business strategy involves substantial risk as many of our investments are expected to be in real estate markets that have suffered significant declines in values over the last several years and we may seek to acquire loans made to higher risk borrowers as with all investments in securities there is risk of loss of capital this is

provide greater balance mvp reit invests in both direct real estate and real estatesecured loans providing it with multiple sources of revenue real estate returns vs inflation whether their portfolio can keep pace with the rate of inflation is a common concern among investors real estate has long been considered by many to be an effective hedge against inflation as returns for both public and private real estate generally outpace inflation while no one can predict when or if significant inflation will strike wellbalanced investment portfolios typically include assets that serve as
