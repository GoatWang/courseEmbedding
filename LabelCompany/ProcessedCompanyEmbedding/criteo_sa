shareholders unite smallcap macro value momentumshareholdersunitesummarycriteo is one of those stocks you buy and then can almost forget aboutsince going public the company has managed to exceed revenue extac and adjusted ebitda guidance for  consecutive quarterswe see little in the way of clouds on the horizon at least for nowcriteo nasdaqcrto is the french innovative advertising technology company or performance marketing company as it prefers we first introduced early january the share price has performed pretty well since then up by a good  since this article tries to find out whether more gains are in store criteo published q figures that were quite well received some highlights from the company pr and qcc revenue excluding traffic acquisition costs or revenue extac grew  or  at constant currency to  million or  of revenue adjusted ebitda grew  or  at constant currency to  million or  of revenue extac cash flow from operating activities increased  to  million free cash flow increased  to  million net income decreased  to  million driven by the accounting impact of the hooklogic acquisition adjusted net income per diluted share increased  to  same client revenue extac grew  at constant currency criteo added  net clients a  increase from q  the company now has over  ecommerce clients retaining  of them average revenue per user arpu was down  but this is because of the strong growth  of the midmarket segment  which is somewhat less profitable top line growth is still very good but net income decreased considerably although it still beat expectations by  cents the reason for that is mostly the acquisition of hooklogic a onetime equity grant a  million intangible depreciation expense relating to the hooklogic acquisition if one excludes the noncash accounting effects of the hooklogic acquisition net income would have increased  to  million so these hooklogicrelated effects caused a onetime  million negative for earnings thats not all though some expense categories are growing faster than underlying extac revenue growth other cost of revenue hosting cost increased by  to  million operating expenses increased  to  million rd expenses grew by  to  million capex increased by  to  million while the increases in cash flow from operations and free cash flow look really impressive we wouldnt pay too much attention to them as they contain specific and volatile items like a decreaseincrease in trade receivables and trade payables see the q the increase in operating expenses was driven in large part  million to the introduction of sponsored products much of which is noncash and oneoff guidance q revenue extac will be between  million and  million q adjusted ebitda to be between  million and  million fy  revenue extac growth will be between  and  at constant currency adjusted ebitda margin as a percentage of revenue extac will increase between  basis points and  basis points on  margin of  the tac margin was  in q and the company expects that to be in the mids for the year a little intro the essence of what criteo does in big lines isnt hard to understand even if how it does it is much harder and much of that isnt explicit the company offers technologies that enable peoplecentric datadriven advertising which is tied to performance metrics this is of course the general direction in which advertising moves anyway collecting as much information about people so that they can be targeted ever more precisely and keeping track of what ads drive sales for the latter criteos  million acquisition of hooklogic provided additional technology and clients much of criteos competitive advantage is based on the engine which is simply a set of algorithms to handle the full chain from collecting the data to serving the ad in real time and predicting the right value for an ad the engine went from click optimization to conversion rate optimization and its now moving towards being a value optimizer the algorithm that drives these are constantly improved by machine learning and everincreasing data here is roughly how it works from the companys investor day presentation for every user that we see let us say a user comes up on cnncom cnn tells us hey are you interested in this user we take for that user all the advertisers that apply that user might have gone to five ecommerce sites or travel sites or classified sites for every one of those sites we calculate what is the best product recommendation for that user what would be the best personalized creative and the combination of those two plus a prediction that we do we calculate what is the prediction value what is the value that we will get from this user a user that has come on cnncom might have a value of  for one advertiser  for the other one  for the other one  for the other one and then  we run an internal auction to figure out which one of those values is the highest one one of them is going to be the highest one once we have that internal auction we bid on the publisher platform it could be on facebook it could be on cnn it could be on our rtb platform by the way every platform has a different configuration and you need to have a different bid strategy there is an engine that does this then once we have gotten the go ahead yes you won the ad or the space serve the ad we custom serve an ad of course it is a custom ad because it is the creative setup for that person it all depends on massive amounts of data the company has access to half a trillion by mid last year of purchases on its client websites then there is the data from publishers that ads are served on by the middle of last year it had a stack of  terabytes and  processing cores the largest hadoop cluster in europe and theres  terabytes of additional data the company has  terabytes of data about shopping intent on  billion products also by mid last year the criteo engine driven by machine learning is able to translate that data into ads that people click on and then purchase from this hardly begins to tell what the company does and how it does it besides it does many more things like the crossdevice graph where it integrates data from different devices a real problem for marketing as  of transactions are across devices which are much harder to track but criteo has come up with some innovative solutions here innovation the rd really is the heart of the competitive advantage of criteo the company spends  of nontac revenue on rd which has a headcount of over  just in the first half of  it ran  tests to optimize the engine and the amount of testing is increasing rapidly the amount of innovation that is going on at the platform is quite impressive this is a company that doesnt sit still by any means for anyone that wants to do a deep dive the investor day presentations are probably a good place to start for the purpose of this article we dont really need to go into all the technical details of the different technologies suffice to say that these are still evolving some recent innovations and improvements are as follows engine improvements like kinetic design and adaptive revenue optimizer the first now reaches  of its ads and produces a  lift in revenues extac the latter allows clients to bid directly on a cost of sales targets instead of a cost per click and produces a  increase in sales for clients user graph following users across devices launched as a service in q predictive search sponsored products header bidding the criteo user graph matches data from the mapping of user identities across multiple digital devices and leveraging anonymized crm data provided by advertisers which a whopping  of customers share with criteo per qcc the company was the first to create an applecompliant solution to be able to track information about users on apple devices predictive search from criteo pr criteo predictive search available immediately in the us offers an automated endtoend solution based on powerful machinelearning that eliminates guesswork and systematically improves results from google shopping using precise predictive optimization across every aspect of the campaign early adopters of the new solution who have taken part in beta tests have seen as much as a  percent lift in revenue at constant cost these clients include  of the leading us retailers such as revolve clothing teleflora and camping world see here for a description of this solution sponsored products from criteo sponsored products appear as native product listings in defined locations throughout the purchase path of retailer site and apps shoppers who click on the ads stay within your ecommerce environment promoting conversion while paying you for every click one has factor in that sponsored products is highly seasonal but its expected to increase revenues extac by midsingle digits this year even if it has a slight negative impact on ebitda as a result of introduction cost so its far from an inconsequential product criteo initially experienced some headwinds with header bidding see here for an explanation and alternative solutions but after testing it with some  clients this is turning around and management argued it could become a significant tailwind for the company it is also opening up new marketing channels like email search video and offline this stuff is only really for illustrative purposes as the heart of what the company does and on what its competitive advantage rests is rather complicated much of it isnt explicit  these are trade secrets like the algorithm driving the engine even more complicated is to compare the criteo engine to those of competitors but basically we dont have to know whats in the box as long as that box keeps performing and that performance is visible in the financial results there are a couple of other metrics that the company shows to demonstrate its growth potential from the  investor day transcript from when it went public in  to mid criteo has been able to quadruple the amount of sales for clients revenue extac increased by  in   in   in  and in  plus   investor day transcript criteo is the secondlargest global user network in terms of ads served and by mid the company had  advertisers and  publishers as clients so far criteo seems to have a point the company has exceeded revenue extac and adjusted ebitda guidance for  consecutive quarters since it was listed drivers of growth apart from the innovations mentioned above the following points were nicely summarized by the ceo on the investor day last year the crossdevice graph new marketing channels email search video and offline pooling data driving app installs verticals like manufacturing acquisition marketing china where the company is experimenting as its largely an inapp market but not with much success so far advertisers are actually skeptical of having us see the sales that are generated from our campaigns ceo eichman during the qcc on average criteo drives between  and  of the sales of its clients the company believes it can get that up to  with further optimization of the engine and data pooling in search management believes that the company can capture between  and  of the ad spend by clients a  billion market opportunity acquisition marketing is another  billion market opportunity management believes it is confronted with a total of  billion in new market opportunities extac now before you get excited and press the buy button this is loosely equivalent to a total addressable market and there is no guarantee that the company will capture all or even a major part of it what it does show is that criteo still has plenty of opportunity to grow and as commerce increasingly moves online the market and the opportunity themselves are growing risks with the ongoing expansion a  retention rate and the settlement with steelhouse we think the short thesis discussed in our previous article where a competitor accused criteo of click fraud is now well and truly behind us given the growth rate its not obvious that performance receives much hindrance from adblockers either although it remains to be seen what the new version of googles web browser which has an inbuilt adblocker will do while the technology is inherently creepy as it is based on collecting as much information about people as possible criteo has solid privacy policies in place the company ensures that there is no pii personally identifiable information data it provides transparency to users there is a little triangle in the criteopowered ads that explains to users why they are seeing these ads and allows them to opt out from the campaign or even from criteo entirely valuation analyst on average expect an eps of  this year rising to  in  but these estimates have come down a bit after the q results on this basis the shares are not overly expensive given the growth and a solid balance sheet  million in cash and just  million in debt conclusion while the shares arent cheap though they are lower these days we think they are still a buy the company has a proven track record of solid growth over all its important metrics and there are still plenty of opportunities for improvement and further growth left disclosure i amwe are long crto i wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions i am not receiving compensation for it other than from seeking alpha i
