funding from bii scotlands annual awards if brewdog was to be named winner of the best bar operator award diageo was forced to issue an apology in  diageo offended survivors of rape and sexual abuse with an advertising campaign showing a young girl crying with her makeup smeared as her sister looks at her from the doorway and the caption whos following in your footsteps out of control drinking has consequences the director of rape crisis network ireland said diageo blames victims of sexual violence for the crimes that have been committed against them the belief that drunk girls are ‘asking for it’ is one that needs to be strongly challenged as it is one that we know perpetrators use to select and target their victims knowing this cultural attitude will mean they get away with it  this is a harmful regressive and hurtful message which targets the vulnerable survivors of sexual violence should never be used in this manner this latest ad builds on the shaming of women theme that can be seen in much drink related campaigning the outofcontrol campaign which started by asking women if they were ‘embarrassed’ while they were being photographed without their consent in a potentially compromising position has now progressed to blaming victims of rape for their own rape in november  diageo announced its intention of selling at auction sir edwin landseers iconic  painting the

advertising campaign showing a young girl crying with her makeup smeared as her sister looks at her from the doorway and the caption whos following in your footsteps out of control drinking has consequences the director of rape crisis network ireland said diageo blames victims of sexual violence for the crimes that have been committed against them the belief that drunk girls are ‘asking for it’ is one that needs to be strongly challenged as it is one that we know perpetrators use to select and target their victims knowing this cultural attitude will mean they get away with it  this is a harmful regressive and hurtful message which targets the vulnerable survivors of sexual violence should never be used in this manner this latest ad builds on the shaming of women theme that can be seen in much drink related campaigning the outofcontrol campaign which started by asking women if they were ‘embarrassed’ while they were being photographed without their consent in a potentially compromising position has now progressed to blaming victims of rape for their own rape in november  diageo announced its intention of selling at auction sir edwin landseers iconic  painting the

puerto rican coalition planned to run a series of ads in new york city and puerto rico urging a boycott of diageoowned alcoholic drinks to protest the corporation’s production move of its captain morgan rum from puerto rico to the us virgin islands which will provide it with  billion in tax benefits over  years in  diageo agreed to pay more than  million to settle us civil regulatory charges that it made improper payments to foreign officials regulators accused the british company of violating the us foreign corrupt practices act through its subsidiaries to obtain lucrative sales and tax benefits for its johnnie walker and windsor scotch whiskeys and other brands the sec said that from  to  diageo paid  million to foreign officials in india thailand and south korea through its subsidiaries the settlement includes  million in disgorgement of profits plus  million in interest and a  million penalty for years diageos subsidiaries made hundreds of illicit payments to foreign government officials sec associate director of enforcement scott friestad said in a statement as a result of diageos lax oversight and deficient controls the subsidiaries routinely used third parties inflated invoices and other deceptive devices to disguise the true nature of the payments on  may  scottish craft brewery brewdog revealed that diageo had threatened to withdraw funding from bii scotlands annual awards if brewdog was to be named winner of the best bar operator award diageo was forced to issue an apology in  diageo offended survivors of rape and sexual abuse with an advertising campaign showing a young girl crying with her makeup smeared as her sister looks at her from the doorway and the caption whos following in your footsteps out of control drinking has consequences the director of rape crisis network ireland said diageo blames victims of sexual violence for the crimes that have been committed against them the belief that drunk girls are ‘asking for it’ is one that needs to be strongly challenged as it is one that we know perpetrators use to select and target their victims knowing this cultural attitude will mean they get away with it  this is a harmful regressive and hurtful message which targets the vulnerable survivors of sexual violence should never be used in this manner this latest ad builds on the shaming of women theme that can be seen in much drink related campaigning the outofcontrol campaign which started by asking women if they were ‘embarrassed’ while they were being photographed without their consent in a potentially compromising position has now progressed to blaming victims of rape for their own rape in november  diageo announced its intention of selling at auction sir edwin landseers iconic  painting the monarch of the glen – which the company owns but which has been on loan to the national museum of scotland in edinburgh since  – as it has no direct link to our business or brands the sale is expected to raise over £ million ian jack writing in the guardian compared the proposed sale to feeding old masters into the boilers of luxury liners to keep the steam up and stated that any business with a sense of history would give the picture to a public gallery in scotland the place without which both the business and the picture would be nothing it would be the decent thing in july  diageo was accused of using its huge influence over irish publicans to pressure some based in cork city into swapping out craft beer taps offering irishproduced craft beer for diageo beer brands after several

provoked controversy over its decision to change its cardhu brand scotch whisky from a single malt to a vatted blended malt whilst retaining the original name and bottle style diageo took this action because it did not have sufficient reserves to meet demand in the spanish market where cardhu had been successful after a meeting of producers diageo agreed to make changes on  february  diageo restated last fiscal years earnings under us accounting rules reducing net income by  million pounds or  million in  the cardhu brand quietly changed back to being a single malt in july  diageo announced that after nearly  years of association with the town of kilmarnock scotland they would be closing the johnnie walker blending and bottling plant as part of restructuring to the business

forced to issue an apology in  diageo offended survivors of rape and sexual abuse with an advertising campaign showing a young girl crying with her makeup smeared as her sister looks at her from the doorway and the caption whos following in your footsteps out of control drinking has consequences the director of rape crisis network ireland said diageo blames victims of sexual violence for the crimes that have been committed against them the belief that drunk girls are ‘asking for it’ is one that needs to be strongly challenged as it is one that we know perpetrators use to select and target their victims knowing this cultural attitude will mean they get away with it  this is a harmful regressive and hurtful message which targets the vulnerable survivors of sexual violence should never be used in this manner this latest ad builds on the shaming of women theme that can be seen in much drink related campaigning the outofcontrol campaign which started by asking women if they were ‘embarrassed’ while they were being photographed without their consent in a potentially compromising position has now progressed to blaming victims of rape for their own rape in november  diageo

decision to close johnnie walker production in kilmarnock scotland the birthplace of the brands founder and production hub since  in december  diageo provoked controversy over its decision to change its cardhu brand scotch whisky from a single malt to a vatted blended malt whilst retaining the original name and bottle style diageo took this action because it did not have sufficient reserves to meet demand in the spanish market where cardhu had been successful after a meeting of producers diageo agreed to make changes on  february  diageo restated last fiscal years earnings under us accounting rules reducing net income by  million pounds or  million in  the cardhu brand quietly changed back to being a single malt in july  diageo announced that after nearly  years of association with the town of kilmarnock scotland they would be closing the johnnie walker blending and bottling plant as part of restructuring to the business this would make  workers unemployed and caused outrage from press local people and politicians a campaign against this decision was launched by the local snp msp willie coffey and labour mp des browne a petition was drawn up against the diageo plans which also involves the closure of the historic port dundas grain distillery in glasgow part of the johnnie walker operation will be moved to a diageo site at leven fife with the creation of

to foreign officials in india thailand and south korea through its subsidiaries the settlement includes  million in disgorgement of profits plus  million in interest and a  million penalty for years diageos subsidiaries made hundreds of illicit payments to foreign government officials sec associate director of enforcement scott friestad said in a statement as a result of diageos lax oversight and deficient controls the subsidiaries routinely used third parties inflated invoices and other deceptive devices to disguise the true nature of the payments on  may  scottish craft brewery brewdog revealed that diageo had threatened to withdraw funding from bii scotlands annual awards if brewdog was to be named winner of the best bar operator award diageo was forced to issue an apology in  diageo offended survivors of rape and sexual abuse with an advertising campaign showing a young girl crying with her makeup smeared as her sister looks at her from the doorway and the caption whos following in your footsteps out of control drinking has consequences the director of rape crisis network ireland said diageo blames victims of sexual violence for the crimes that have been committed against them the belief that drunk girls are ‘asking for it’ is one that needs to be strongly challenged as it is one that we know perpetrators use to select and target their victims knowing this cultural attitude will mean they get away with it  this is a harmful regressive and hurtful message which targets the vulnerable survivors of sexual violence should never be used in this manner this latest ad builds on the shaming of women theme that can be seen in much drink related campaigning the outofcontrol campaign which started by asking women if they were ‘embarrassed’ while they were being photographed without their consent in a potentially compromising position has now progressed to blaming victims of rape for their own rape in november  diageo announced its intention of selling

the steam up and stated that any business with a sense of history would give the picture to a public gallery in scotland the place without which both the business and the picture would be nothing it would be the decent thing in july  diageo was accused of using its huge influence over irish publicans to pressure some based in cork city into swapping out craft beer taps offering irishproduced

production in kilmarnock scotland the birthplace of the brands founder and production hub since  in december  diageo provoked controversy over its decision to change its cardhu brand scotch whisky from a single malt to a vatted blended malt whilst retaining the original name and bottle style diageo took this action because it did not have sufficient reserves to meet demand in the spanish market where cardhu had been successful after a meeting of producers diageo agreed to make changes on  february  diageo restated last fiscal years earnings under us accounting rules reducing net income by  million pounds or  million in  the cardhu brand quietly changed back to being a single malt in july  diageo announced that after nearly  years of association with the town of kilmarnock scotland they would be closing the johnnie walker blending and bottling plant as part of restructuring to the business this would make  workers unemployed and caused outrage from press local people and politicians a campaign against this decision was launched by the local snp msp willie coffey and labour mp des browne a petition was drawn up against the diageo plans which also involves the closure of the historic port dundas grain distillery in glasgow part of the johnnie walker operation will be moved to a diageo site at leven fife with the creation of  jobs there as part of this expansion in leven diageo culled a herd of roe deer living on the site to make way for new buildings in february  it was reported in the guardian that the company had restructured itself so as to avoid paying tax in the uk the national puerto rican coalition planned to run a series of ads in new york city and puerto rico urging a boycott of diageoowned alcoholic drinks to protest the corporation’s production move of its captain morgan rum from puerto rico to the us virgin islands which will provide it with  billion in tax benefits over  years in  diageo agreed to pay more than  million to settle us civil regulatory charges that it made improper payments to foreign officials regulators accused the british company of violating the us foreign corrupt practices act through its subsidiaries to obtain lucrative sales and tax benefits for its johnnie walker and windsor scotch whiskeys and other brands the sec said that from  to  diageo paid  million to foreign officials in india thailand and south korea through its subsidiaries the settlement includes  million in disgorgement of profits plus  million in interest and a  million penalty for years diageos subsidiaries made hundreds of illicit payments to foreign government officials sec associate director of enforcement scott friestad said in a statement as a result of diageos lax oversight and deficient controls the subsidiaries routinely

funding from bii scotlands annual awards if brewdog was to be named winner of the best bar operator award diageo was forced to issue an apology in  diageo offended survivors of rape and sexual abuse with an advertising campaign showing a young girl crying with her makeup smeared as her sister looks at her from the doorway and the caption whos following in your footsteps out of control drinking has consequences the director of rape crisis network ireland said diageo blames victims of sexual violence for the crimes that have been committed against them the belief that drunk girls are ‘asking for it’ is one that needs to be strongly challenged as it is one that we know perpetrators use to select and target their victims knowing this cultural attitude will mean they get away with it  this is a harmful regressive and hurtful message which targets the vulnerable survivors of sexual violence should never be used in this manner this latest ad builds on the shaming of women theme that can be seen in much drink related campaigning the outofcontrol campaign which started by asking women if they were ‘embarrassed’ while they were being photographed without their consent in a potentially compromising position has now progressed to blaming victims of rape for their own rape in november  diageo announced its intention of selling at auction sir edwin landseers iconic  painting the monarch of the glen – which the company owns but which has been on loan to the national museum of scotland in edinburgh since  – as it has no direct link to our business or brands the sale is expected
