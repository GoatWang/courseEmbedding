strategy tactical allocation performance insights quantitative analysis quarterly market insights investment articles contact joseph henry scholtz jr  joseph henrique scholtz   “the scholtz family has been in finance for generations” historywhen i founded scholtz  company in  i named the firm after the original family business which played a major role in bringing the scholtz family to america in the early s from venezuela the common thread between the two businesses is finance – something that has provided a livelihood for many of the scholtz family from the bits and pieces gathered from my grandfather father and uncle i’ve tried to retell the story of the scholtz  company name below jose’ henrique scholtz –  scholtz  marturet was formed around  as a partnership in venezuela the original partners were mr marturet jose henrique scholtz and carlos arturo scholtz shortly after the partnership’s formation mr marturet died and the firm changed its name to scholtz  company originally the partnership transacted in a variety of imports and exports to new york but after a while the firm chose to focus in on cocoa and coffee jose henrique knew the coffee business well as his father jose henrique sr was a coffee roaster in caracas venezuela a few years later as the business grew the family moved to brooklyn and scholtz  company became a coffee and cocoa importer based in new york at  wall street the business continued to grow and became a major dealer in the two commodities which eventually led to carlos scholtz becoming chairman of the cocoa exchange in  during this time the scholtz family took roots in brooklyn jose henrique’s son joseph henry “henry” grew up in brooklyn and after graduating from mit he became a civil engineer for a few years he then joined the firm and worked there until the late ’s jose’ henrique scholtz jr –  unfortunately the depression was hard on the partnership as it was for many businesses there is an old family story that claims that at one time the employee payroll was made by selling family flatware and using some cash that an aunt had saved in a cookie jar yet through the difficult years the firm persevered carlos died in the early ’s and when jose henrique retired in the mid ’s tito abbo and his brother henrique abbo bought jose henrique’s share of the partnership the business had shifted to the next generation early on disagreements over the business arose between henrique abbo and henry scholtz which caused tito to buy out his brother’s interest and bring in his other brother luis as a silent partner at this point the abbo and scholtz families became close business associates for many decades tito abbo formed a colombian coffee processing and exporting company abbo jarimillo  cia in the early ’s they worked closely with scholtz  company in new york facilitating orders to the large us roasters in january of  right out of the army henry’s son andy went to colombia to help organize tito’s company and learn the business he returned in june of  to work at scholtz  company andy became a partner in  making the total four henry andy tito and luis abbo in  the partnership moved to  wall street to accommodate their larger size jose’ henrique scholtz – ’s i visited scholtz  company at  wall street while i was still in college in  i imagine it looked much like it did in the early years only a little english was spoken among the back office clerks the kitchen had a large roaster machine with little burlap sacks of sample coffees on top of the cabinets around the room in the center was a small table with a large brass spittoon next to it for the taste tester on my trip i also enjoyed a tour of the coffee and sugar exchange as well as a visit to the cocoa exchange the cocoa exchange was very simple it consisted of a large board room table in an oak paneled room with a handful of traders waiting for orders the trip was very memorable for an impressionable young college student in awe of the “family business” several years later in  my uncle andy guided the partnership’s sale to cargill the large privately held commodity firm he retired from cargill five years later when i started my own firm in  there was only one name that i wanted to use – scholtz  company however this firm would be focused on investing for high net worth individuals something i had been doing for years at smith barney well capitalized the new scholtz  company even had henry and his son andy as partners we started with seventeen million in assets under management which has grown to over one hundred and thirty million

investment articles contact quantitative models  peter scholtz was one of the first portfolio managers at smith barney to develop quantitative models during the earlymid s the model has seen several major revisions most recently in  but is undergoing constant tinkering basic overview as a current or prospective client it is important that you understand the elements that comprise our quantitative model which we have named the “momentum value model” the momentum value model is derived from four separate component models which analyze the factors we have found to be vital in determining a security’s attractiveness the inputs to each component model are for the most part financial ratios and concepts that you are already familiar with our earnings model emphasizes the importance of earnings momentum quarterly earnings surprises and analyst estimate revisions our value model examines priceearnings pricecash flow enterprise valueebitda book value return on equity and discounted cash flow our sentiment model considers short interest and corporate insider behavior finally our technical model takes into account moving averages and volumes these four separate components are then blended in order to compile a composite score for each security it is the blend and weight we have assigned to each of the component models that makes our process both unique and productive why we use quantitative models the problem that many investment advisory firms face is the inability to adequately investigate the entire investment universe without computerized quantitative screening many firms are often forced to narrow their focus in order to sufficiently understand their investments consequently they become largecap growth managers smallcap value managers or they focus only on certain countries sectors or industries we believe the opportunity costs of these limited viewpoints are high by contrast at scholtz  company our initial security selection process does not eliminate securities simply because they do not fall within a particular investment style through a compilation of the most powerful techniques of many disparate investment styles we are able to broaden our universe to include all of those securities for which we can obtain reliable data from this pool we focus our efforts by investigating securities whose composite scores on our quantitative model signal the potential for outperformance how we use our quantitative models a common misconception is that quantitative models by implication lead to some type of trading system a “black box” dictates which securities should be bought and sold and the portfolio managers are merely tools to implement the model’s recommendations with no understanding of the investment merits while this may be the reality at some firms our models are merely aids to assist with decisions not make them for us at scholtz  company the quantitative models perform two separate but equally important basic functions the first function of the models is to provide our portfolio managers with guidance on potential security selections every monday morning we are confronted with the possibility of examining fresh data on  us equity securities as we have discussed previously this flow of information can quickly become overwhelming and cause a loss of focus the models allow us to direct our efforts to a select group of securities that the model has identified as attractive once we have our focus group the traditional process of fundamental analysis takes over we learn about the company’s product lines examine the balance sheet read the available analyst research and speak with the company’s management if a security survives this additional scrutiny it becomes a legitimate buy candidate the second function of quantitative models is to measure the health of our portfolios a classic problem in the portfolio management process is that it becomes much harder to identify sell candidates than buy candidates investors often become attached to their core holdings over time especially those that have performed well having our holdings ranked every monday morning forces us to examine and assimilate new information that is affecting the value of our securities in near real time this practice is in stark contrast to many firms that discontinue most research on current holdings until major news forces them to reevaluate in this regard the quantitative model helps identify securities with fundamentals that may be gradually eroding often before the market wakes up to that fact as can be seen in our investment performance we believe it is possible to consistently identify and exploit market inefficiencies that lead to superior investment performance our years of experience lead us to believe that quantitative analysis can continue to provide our clients with an investment edge the world will continue to evolve and change but our framework is flexible enough to allow us to incorporate new innovations into our quantitative process in order to stay ahead of competitors this edge will allow us to continue to provide you with the personal attention and feel of a small firm while providing quality investment services note we will never invest in a security simply because our model likes it rather we use the model to screen out investments quickly and highlight names that are worth indepth fundamental analysis we feel strongly that quantitative analysis is a tool that must be married with fundamental research   company individual investors consultants  institutions investment
