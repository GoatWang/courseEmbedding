nowgo»elite data services inc why this email promoted stock may crash hardjan   about elite data deac investor protection association short onlysummarywe have received numerous emails touting deac from various stock promotersthe timing of the emails promoting deac coincides with what seems to be an abnormal rise in price and trading volume of the stockthe recent financials balance sheet and cash flow report of the company appear to be very bleakwe have not contacted the company regarding the claims in the articlenote this article is about a nanocap stock also referred to as a penny stock while all investments are risky nanocap stocks are among the most risky among microcap stocks the most risky stocks are those which are subject to promotional campaigns such as deac they are also among the most illiquid stocks usually having a large spread between the bid and offer at any given moment quite often it occurs that the illiquidity of these stocks does not allow a trader to rapidly close or open a position deac is no exception to that deac is a nanocap stock which is traded on the otc markets and priced well below the  mark the readers of this article should be highly aware of the aforementioned facts prior to undertaking any action based on the content of this article introduction deac otcpkdeac is a company trading at a price which has recently ran from a range of approximately  to a high of  during the course of just a few days in this article we will outline the facts which are in our opinion related to the sudden increase in the price and trading volume of this usually thinlytraded low volume stock the promotion let us analyze the recent price action and trade volume of deac the trading volume and price of deac have both increased slightly during december  promotional emails were sent on several occasions during that month and during the following month also it is quite obvious that the emails being sent out and the sudden rise in volume and price of the stock are interconnected events the reality nearly zero revenue negativenearly zero net income huge dreams as it often happens with aggressively promoted companies a glimpse at the balance sheet is often enough to reveal a grim and bleak picture it seems that elite data services inc is of no exception to that rule in our opinion it is clear that the current price of deac has nothing in common with the stocks true value if we take a look at deacs income statement we would see that the companys revenue has remained nearly zero and during the entire year of  while its net income has been mostly negative during that period of time moreover if we check the latest q form filed on  we would see that the company is actually classified as a going concern with all the attendant circumstances it is based on the aforementioned data that we firmly believe that deacs current line of business involves having its shares promoted and sold at overinflated prices rather than delivering or attempting to deliver a true product to the market but why you ask the reason why would any company need to have its stock ticker advertised that is the most important question an investor should ask himself prior to buying a promoted stock the answer for this hides of course in the small print let us have a look at the disclaimer found in the promotional emails touting deac which weve received in simple plain english someone  may it be the promoter sending out the email message or a third party which had paid the promoter in cash for sending the message  is holding shares of deac and plans to get rid of them dump them in the open market therefore our conclusion is that the promotional emails sole purpose was to have unsuspecting investors buy the stock at artificially heightened prices while the promoters or third party unload their shares upon them conclusion it is based on the aforementioned facts and analysis presented in this article we hold the opinion that deac shares are essentially worthless we believe that the recent increase in the price of the stock has been a direct result of email messages being sent out by stock promoters in massive quantities and touting investors to buy the stock this practice is well known and is done exclusively for one reason only  so the insiders can unload dump their shares which they had previously acquired for almost free in the free market onto unsuspecting investors while taking advantage of the stocks inflated price in view of that we would recommend any investor who had purchased shares of the company to liquidate his entire position immediately even a small weakness in price could mean that the dump is nearing our view hope in reality is the worst of all evils because it prolongs the torments of man  friedrich nietzsche for longs if you are long the stock we believe you should consider getting out immediately it is with full confidence we say that every upward movement in the stocks price is likely to be temporary as it will never repeat its previous highs we believe deac has a price target of around  which it is likely to reach in the upcoming weeks or months at most if you have already accrued losses on the stock sell now so as to avoid additional losses do not persuade yourself into thinking the stock price will come back to its previous highs do not have hope leaving you holding the bag as it has happened to far too many we believe deac stocks price will drop  or more in the following weeks it may be the right decision to minimize your losses by selling now look at market fluctuations as your friend rather than your enemy profit from folly rather than participate in it  warren buffett for shorts bearing the aforementioned facts in mind we believe sophisticated investors will quickly apprehend the idea that shorting deac may be a lucrative opportunity as we are convinced that the potential downside for deac is substantial if you are able to locate borrows we believe shorting deac may prove to be profitable as its price may prove to be highly inflated disclosure the author is short deac the author wrote this article themselves and it

paid pumpjan  about elite data deac hunter straus longterm horizon growth longshort equitysummaryelite data services has under  in cash yet claims to be operating multiple complex business linescurrent insiders own over  of the companys stockthe company has switched between multiple unrelated businesses over the past several yearsmanagement filed an k which confirmed that it would be engaging an investor relations service promotional emails soon followedbackground elite data services inc otcpkdeac formerly dynamic energy alliance corporation has been the subject of a recent series of promotional emails what is particularly interesting about this stock pump is that the company filed an k stating that it would be engaging an investor relations service and would be compensating them with stock just before the first round of promotional emails went out furthermore the companys k detailing these conditions was not made public until after the promotional emails went out however the circumstances beyond the companys promotion are even more interesting  a history of unrelated business lines and constantly changing executives are just a few of the red flags about this company business if you visit the companys website at wwwedscompaniescom you are greeted with a homepage which vaguely suggests that the company is a somewhat diversified conglomerate that operates in a variety of businesses on the left hand side of the homepage it displays this tells us that the company was engaged in marketing but is now shifting its priorities towards the gaming and resorts and is looking for a location to use its newlyacquired casino license it sounds ambiguous and is unclear as these businesses are quite different but it is forgivable if the companys public filings are in order and can back up the story unfortunately if you look at the companys most recent q there is no mention of the casino business at all  the companys stated business engagements are completely different the only mention of the casino license transaction occurred in an k that was filed on december   from the companys most recent q elite data services incs describes its business as follows elite data services inc changed its name from dynamic energy alliance corporation on november   prior to that we were formerly mammatech corporation and were incorporated in the state of florida on november   under the name mammathetics corp the company is engaged primarily in the marketing and advertising sector pertaining to the following classifiedridecom and autoglancecom launched to the public in february  classifiedrides platform was designed to revolutionize the selling and buying for online automotive markets currently classifiedride provides a classified listing platform where users can list their vehicle truck boat ie anything that has a motor to the companys website either by free or paid listing options the main premise of the website is to aid the private seller in selling or trading their vehicle the company in turn then works as the community leader to establish relationships between buyers and sellers using social media platforms and consumer customer support incentives these relationships are used to generate revenue from private sellers dealerships affiliate lead providers and third party advertisers autoglance is a search engine of used cars that prioritizes and compares inventory in individualized markets by displaying the best deals first while hiding listings that are older more expensive and have more mileage autoglance currently has a provisional patent for this method of organizing and displaying vehicles more specifically autoglances invention groups vehicles of the same make and model in a market location to determine the best price based on the market value of the vehicle vehicles that are deemed worse deals are hidden from the user the user may easily see hidden cars if heshe wishes by the click of a button the companys q makes no mention of the casino business or plans to engage in it at all if you poke around on the company website enough there is a section where it mentions the companys automotiveoriented businesses but the presentation makes it seem like a side venture if one does a google search for classified ride the very first hit that one gets is a negative testimonial claiming that it is a scam  not the first thing that i want to see when looking for the company in fact i was unable to find any positive testimonials about the website as all sources that named the website stated that there had been sort of phishing attempt while this could be due to unsavory individuals prowling the website in search of potential victims it doesnt speak well to the security and operation of the website preliminary research did not look that great so i took a look at autoglance when one goes to wwwautoglancecom and searches for anything there are  results  absolutely none i tried a variety of zip codes and searched for any makemodel at any price with any amount of miles on it and still found nothing so the companys marketing and advertising business ventures appear to have an extremely negative public perception or are simply nonexistent dynamic energy alliance it is important to note that the company previously engaged in completely different businesses  if one looks up dynamic energy alliance corp you will find that the companys business was described as through its wholly owned subsidiary dynamic energy development corporation dedc the company has a business plan to develop commercialize and sell innovative technologies in the recoverable energy sector specifically it is focused on identifying combining and enhancing existing industry technologies with proprietary recoverable production and finishing processes to produce synthetic oil carbon black gas and carbon steel from discarded or waste tires waste this process will be accomplished with limited residual waste product and significant reductions in greenhouse gases compared to traditional processing to maximize this opportunity the company has developed a scalable commercial development strategy to build energy campuses with low operational costs and longterm recurring revenues it seems interesting that the company would switch from producing synthetic oil from old tires to creating websites for searching for used cars and then engaging in the casinoresort businessall with less than  in cash prior to being dynamic energy alliance the company was mammatech corporation in the companys filings it states that from  through the first quarter of  the companys business was that of a marketer of tumor detection equipment the transition from being in the medical industry for  years to becoming a renewable energy company is not described very clearly id like a bit more detail as to why the company seemingly abruptly made this change but it is not in the filings financials this is where things begin to vary drastically between the companys presentation and goals and what is actually feasible according to the companys most recent q it has  in cash and  in intangible assets that amount of cash doesnt seem like enough to accomplish much  but lets have a look at the notes to the financial statements to see what this  in intangibles is the companys intangible asset value and note balance to a related party were reduced to the appropriate carrying value of  as of june   the change was done in accordance with gaap asc  which relates to the carrying value of assets and liabilities at the date of transfer by related parties that is the only description given for the companys intangibles nothing about who the related parties were or what they were from or what can be done with them additionally the company has  million in current liabilities and  million in total liabilities in the most recent quarter it had  in revenue and net income of  while the company generated positive net income it is important to note that  was gained on extinguishment of debt there is no discussion on this item as it seems like a very important part of the companys financials with respect to cash flow the companys operations used  not a good sign if the company has less than  in the bank and no surprise that it has a going concern clause in its most recent q the company has a net loss from operation of  and accumulated deficit of  the company currently has only limited working capital with which to continue its operating activities the amount of capital required to sustain operations is subject to future events and uncertainties the company must secure additional working capital through loans sale of equity securities or a combination in order to implement its business plans there can be no assurance that such funding will be available in the future or available on commercially reasonable terms these conditions raise substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern never a good sign  the fundamentals look bleak and are inconsistent what the company presents on the surface or in its business plans insider ownership and management according to the companys latest k filed on may   all officers and directors hold  of the companys common stock since the k was filed there have been no form s or any other filings that indicate that this has changed following his resignation three new individuals were appointed for the separate roles of chief executive officer and director chief financial officer and president it was not made clear whether these individuals have employment agreements with the company and their compensation was not disclosed the most recent k states that the company has no significant employees besides its executive officers hardly what seems necessary to execute its business strategy since then it seems that the only employees are still the executive officers and directors paid promotion from the companys most recent k filed on december   it reads on december   elite data services inc company and erastar inc erastar or the consultant entered into an investor relations consulting agreement the agreement to advise the company regarding investor communications public relations with shareholders brokers dealers and other investment professionals as to the companys current and proposed activities the duties of erastar include but are not limited to advising consulting and assisting the company in developing and implementing appropriate plans and means for presenting the company and its business plans strategy and personnel to the financial community assisting in establishing an image for the company in the financial community and assisting in creating the foundation for subsequent financial public relation efforts as consideration for the services described in the agreement the company has agreed to pay consultant a onetime retainer of twentyfive thousand dollars  within twenty  business days from the signing of the agreement and fifteen thousand  per month upon signing of the agreement as an accommodation by the consultant the company may issue stock in lieu of any cash payment if the company is unable to fulfill their payment obligation the company has also agreed to issue the consultant a eight hundred sixtynine thousand four hundred fortyone  shares of the companys common stock payable as follows five hundred thousand  shares as a nonrefundable nonapportionable and nonratable retainer and three hundred sixtynine thousand four hundred and fortyone  shares payable upon completion of the six month term and b warrant to purchase one million  shares of common stock of the company at an exercise price of  per share for a period of one year upon mutual consent by both the company and the consultant the agreement will be extended for another six  months and if extended the company will issue to the consultant eight hundred sixty nine thousand four hundred forty one  shares of the companys common stock within ten  business days thereafter so the company is paying an investor relations service to pump up the price of the stock but is paying them in both cash and stock sound fishy note that the december  agreement date coincides with the first email advertisements which appeared on december   for penny stock gurucom subsequent promotions followed from additional stock promotion sites additionally the date of the filing december   would have made it impossible for the public to know that the company had initiated the services of a pr firm to pump the companys stock conclusion from a financial perspective elite data services inc has a weak balance sheet and is bleeding cash  the company needs to secure a source of financing soon likely in the form of issuing more equity while poor financials can be forgivable if there is something exciting in the business it really is not clear what the companys goals are it claims to have switched business models so many times in a short period of time on top of that the company filed a statement with the sec that essentially admitted that it was engaging in a paid promotion for its stock and was paying the promoters in stock surely there must be some conflict of interest there as the companys filings indicate that insiders owns nearly all of the stock beyond the companys poor financials one of the companys businesses has been reported to be a scam or fraught with scammers from several sources in the instance of classifiedridecom or appears to be nonexistent or at least nonfunctional in the instance of autoglancecom if you have received promotional emails claiming that elite data services inc is the next greatest thing reconsider what is being advertised have a look at the companys public filings  they are an amazing source of information that will let you know what lies beneath the surface disclosure the author has no positions in any stocks mentioned and no
