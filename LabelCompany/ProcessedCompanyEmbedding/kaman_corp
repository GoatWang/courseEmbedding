submitted by kamanadmin on mon   alleviate wear scarring with highly efficient high load lightweight bearings   titanium diffusion hardening tdh is a surfacehardening process for titanium alloys that significantly improves its tribological properties in lined selflubricating bearing systems by providing a highhardness outer surface to the titanium base material this is a diffusion hardening process not a coating conducted in a controlled atmosphere that yields a deep uniform hardened case layer within the titanium component tdh will consistently yield a highhardness case layer with an affected depth that is unmatched by other titanium surface engineering processes “using our proprietary titanium diffusionhardening process we’ve really been able to raise the bar for lightweight selflubricating plain bearing systems using a diffusionhardened ti mating surface we’ve been able to achieve karon wear and friction results equivalent to those we experience with highhardness stainless steels at nearly half the assembly weight” said mat mormino vp of engineering kaman specialty bearings  engineered products in applications that require low overall weight titanium alloy is a popular choice for bearing material for years customers using these bearings struggled with the fact that at very high bearing loads such as those specified in as titanium alloys tend to exhibit lessstable dynamic friction coefficients titanium alloy bearings can also be subject to surface distress wear scarring of the titanium using a diffusionhardened ti mating surface within selflubricating bearing systems kaman specialty bearings  engineered products has been able to alleviate wear scarring providing customers with a solution for highly efficient high load lightweight bearings tdh treated titanium journal bearings have successfully passed the test requirements of as high loadwear at four times the required cycles with only onetenth the allowable wear from the figure below one can easily discern that during high loadwear testing bearings utilizing the tdh capability significantly outperform those that have not been treated in addition to the as test tdh treated titanium spherical bearings have also passed the respective tests of as highload spherical bearing tests leadership team  kaman skip to main content  news events media governance search
