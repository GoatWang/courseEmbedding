deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses and financial advisory fees of approximately  million payable by us will be approximately  million or approximately  million if the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares of our common stock is exercised in full assuming a public offering price of  per share which is the midpoint of the range of the public offering price per share set forth on the front cover of this prospectus we will contribute the net proceeds from this offering to our operating partnership in exchange for common units we intend to use approximately  million of the net proceeds to acquire the nymt contributed assets approximately  million to fund our predecessor’s contract to acquire a joint venture equity investment in the preserve at port royal which is expected to close in august  and substantially all of the remaining net proceeds to fund our future acquisition of joint venture equity ownership and preferred equity ownership in and mezzanine debt and other highyield investments secured by multifamily apartment properties and for general corporate purposes including financing operating expenses and our other expenses until future investments can be identified and consummated we intend to invest the net proceeds in interestbearing shortterm investmentgrade securities or moneymarket accounts that are consistent with our intention to qualify as a reit including for example government and government agency certificates certificates of deposit and interestbearing bank deposits we expect that these initial investments will provide a lower net return than we expect to receive from investments in our targeted assets in sourcing and acquiring or originating investments for our portfolio we will compete with other mortgage reits equity reits specialty finance companies savings and loan associations banks mortgage bankers insurance companies mutual funds institutional investors investment banking firms other lenders governmental bodies and other entities many of which have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital available to them than we have in addition there are a number of mortgage reits with asset acquisition objectives similar to or overlapping with our objectives and others may be organized in the future which may increase competition for the available investments suitable for us competitive variables include market presence and visibility size of the proposed investment and underwriting standards to the extent that a competitor is willing to risk larger amounts of capital in a particular transaction or to employ more liberal underwriting standards when evaluating potential investments than we are our revenue and profit margins could be impacted our competitors may also be willing to accept lower returns on their investments and may succeed in buying the assets that we have targeted for acquisition although we believe that we are well positioned to compete effectively in each facet of our business there is enormous competition in our market sector and there can be no assurance that we will compete effectively or that we will not encounter further increased competition in the future that could limit our ability to conduct our business effectively company description riverbanc multifamily investors inc is a maryland
