procedure to reshape the chin either by enhancement with an implant or reduction surgery on the bone although human beauty and attractiveness are generally subjective there are some rules that dictate whether contours are aesthetic or not in regards to the chin these rules revolve around the positioning and prominence of the chin relative to the base of the nose therefore it is not uncommon for a
