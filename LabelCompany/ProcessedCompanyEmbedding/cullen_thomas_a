books of the times on the road to selfdiscovery korean jail was a pothole by william grimesmarch   continue reading the main story share this page continue reading the main story as a child on suburban long island cullen thomas devoured tintin comic books and the tales of richard francis burton the victorian explorer he thirsted for high adventure in foreign parts at age  he got it a sentence of three and a half years in south korean prisons for mailing himself a kilogram of hashish“brother one cell” is mr thomas’s affecting account of his prison experience it’s an offbeat comingofage story the tale of a wideeyed innocent middleclass american thrust into a world of deprivation and daily trials that speed his passage into adulthood and a deeper understanding of himself and the fallen creatures around him told simply and with extraordinary good humor it reads like a cross between “what i did on my summer vacation” and “one day in the life of ivan denisovich”korea was an accident at loose ends after college mr thomas joined a friend in seoul who assured him that there was good money to be made teaching english this turned out to be true but mr thomas quickly grew restless during a vacation in the philippines he visited a remote village he had heard about purchased a block of hashish and mailed it to a post office in seoul the police were waiting when he turned up to claim itmr thomas’s first inkling that he has made a serious mistake comes during his interrogation when he is stimulated with a cattle prod then tapped lightly on the skull with a nightstick just enough to make the point mr shin the unsmiling prosecuting attorney assures him that he is in deep trouble facing long years in prison mr shin is in his own way a kindly man rather fascinated by mr thomas and eager to improve his english at one point he summons mr thomas from his cell in the city’s detention center to ask him what the “wuthering” in “wuthering heights” means advertisement continue reading the main story by pretending to believe that mr thomas intended to use the hashish himself rather than sell it he smooths the way for a light sentence to be handed down continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story after all those dull months teaching english to korean students mr thomas suddenly finds himself among fascinating people he meets billy the kid a colombian gem smuggler and jailhouse lawyer with whom he reads nietzsche and tolstoy and develops a philosophy for dealing with prison life he listens in wonder to the exploits of a peruvian who wanders the world with a gang of welldressed thieves who steal suitcases in hotels and airports he befriends and tries to understand a fellow american who has smothered his two sons photo cullen thomas credit chris thomas alone in his cell mr thomas struggles with shame selfdoubt souldestroying boredom and a long list of fundamental life questions that most people are too busy to address he is afraid lonely and angry he cries and he rages “i saw myself variously as an idiot and a clown then an alchemist who might turn isolation into strength then a cipher a shutout” he writeshis american citizenship gives him status so does his language which all koreans even the guards are eager to learn at the same time as one of perhaps a hundred foreign prisoners in korea he is culturally isolated confused by a language he speaks with difficulty and a system of cultural norms that baffle himnothing much happens in prison but the details are fascinating as mr thomas describes it violence is limited to occasional scuffles and the atmosphere of terror and intimidation in american prisons is absent although consensual sex occurs usually for pay rape is unknown it’s no

or contact us anytime the physical conditions however are harsh in winter water freezes in unheated cells and so does the ink in mr thomas’s pen the diet leans heavily on lowquality rice and kimchi the famous korean condiment of spicy pickled cabbage dirty electric razors leave mr thomas with painful boils on his face and by the end of his term he develops parasiteshe does not complain quite the contrary “i didn’t mind having few possessions and could see the value in being removed from the noise and consumption of the outside world” he writes he and his fellow prisoners he reflects wryly live a model lifestyle “like progressive ascetics”like solzhenitsyn’s denisovich mr thomas finds a grim satisfaction in work he is happy to cobble shoes for the korean riot police at the rate of  cents a day even better than the loose camaraderie and open spaces of the factory floor is the prison sports program each factory has a basketball team and mr thomas a firstround draft pick emerges as the michael jordan of the south korean penal system the rules combine the nba and confucius when mr thomas is tackled on a drive to the basket no one seems to regard this as a foul but the players can see that he is upset as a facesaving solution he is awarded four free throwsmr thomas is not a deep or complex thinker sincerity and earnestness are his strong points a romantic to the end he confronts his situation with thoreau ready to hand drawing simple conclusions from hard lessons taking pleasure in small things and appreciating the unexpected turn his life has taken “i was at the end of the earth” he reflects toward the end of his prison term like his hero burton he writes “i’d entered a forbidden city lived among a bizarre and wondrous people gained knowledge of a province previously unknown to my race”splendid but mom adds a badly needed coda on greeting her son at the airport in new york she cries hugs him and holds him at arm’s length to take a good look then she slaps him and says “don’t ever do that again” continue reading the main story we’re interested in your feedback on this page tell us what you think related coverage related coverage whats next loading

one cell cullen thomas had a typical suburban upbringing he was raised on long island and after graduating from college he was looking for meaning and excitement possessed of a youthful romantic view of the world he left new york at age twentythree and set off for a job teaching english in seoul south korea as foreigners on the fringe of korean society cullen and his friends felt intensely separate then untouchable that delusion was quickly shattered cullen would spend four years in the country seven months teaching then three and a half years in jail for smuggling hashish brother one cell is his memoir of that time–the harrowing and powerful story of a young american learning hard lessons in strange prisons on the other side of the worldone of few foreign inmates cullen shared a cell block with human traffickers jewel smugglers murderers and thieves humbled by the ordeal he describes his fight to restore his identity and to come to terms with the harsh living conditions and the rules of korea’s strict confucian culture which were magnified in prison in this crucible cullen shed the naïveté and ego of youth and to his surprise achieved a lasting sense of freedom and gratitude with its gritty descriptions of life behind high walls and acute insights into korean society brother one cell is part cautionary tale and part insightful travelogue about places few of us
