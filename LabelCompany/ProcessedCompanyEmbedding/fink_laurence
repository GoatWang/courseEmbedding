christopher meade thank you this is chris meade the general counsel of blackrock before we begin i would like to remind you that during the course of this call we may make a number of forwardlooking statements we call your attention to the fact that blackrock’s actual results may of course differ from these statements as you know blackrock has filed reports with the sec which list some of the factors that may cause the results of blackrock to differ materially from what we see today blackrock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forwardlooking statements so with that i will turn it over to gary gary shedlin thanks chris and good morning everyone it’s my pleasure to present results for the second quarter of  before i turn it over to larry to offer his comments i will review our financial performance and business results while our earnings release discloses both gaap and asadjusted financial results i will be focusing primarily on asadjusted results blackrock’s globally integrated technology and investment platform continues to position us as the solutions provider of choice to both retail and institutional clients the breadth and scale of our capabilities allows us to continuously and efficiently reinvest in our investment distribution technology and risk management franchises in order to provide increase by its both clients and shareholders over time as a result of that commitment to reinvest net inflows for the last  months totaled  billion as organic growth accelerated in the second quarter total quarterly flows exceeded  billion and were positive across client types asset classes and investment styles highlighting the uniqueness of our diversified investment platform which includes cash market cap weighted index products a spectrum of active offerings from smart beta and factors to high conviction alpha strategies and illiquid alternatives second quarter longterm net inflows of  billion were a record for blackrock and represented an annualized organic asset growth rate of  annualized organic base fee growth was  for the quarter and  for the last  months despite the pricing changes we have previously announced over the last  months record quarterly revenue of  billion was  up over a year ago operating income of  billion was also  higher than a year ago and earnings per share of  increased  nonoperating results for the quarter reflected  million of net investment gains an increase from the second quarter of  due to higher marks in the current quarter and the impact of our debt refinancing last quarter our asadjusted tax rate for the second quarter was  we continue to estimate that  remains a reasonable projected tax runrate for the remainder of  though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of additional discrete items and tax law changes that could arise during the year second quarter base fees rose  yearoveryear driven primarily by the positive impact of organic growth and market appreciation on average aum partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange movements and certain previously announced pricing changes not reflected in last year’s second quarter while the dollar has recently given up gains versus major currencies the impact of dollar appreciation over the last year still reduced our quarterly yearoveryear base fee growth by about  sequentially base fees were up  and benefited from higher securities lending revenue in the second quarter which increased  driven by seasonality and higher on loan balances last month at the morgan stanley conference i spoke about several exogenous factors including divergent beta and fx that have negatively impacted our blended fee rate over the last several years and masked the benefit we have achieved from executing our differentiated growth strategy as some of these headwinds lessened during the second quarter with emerging markets outperforming us markets and the us dollar weakening our blended fee rate has stabilized and the impact of our accelerating organic base fee growth should become more apparent performance fees of  million decreased  million from the prior year due to weaker relative performance and longonly equity funds with annual locks in the second quarter technology and risk management revenue of  million increased  yearoveryear driven by several clients going live on the aladdin platform and new client wins market demand remains strong for our full range of products including institutional aladdin aladdin risk for wealth management provider aladdin iretire and futureadvisor clients continue to seek sophisticated risk analytics portfolio construction and scalable distribution tools and our first three aladdin risk for wealth management clients went live on the platform earlier in the quarter in line with our strategic focus on technology to enhance value and deliver innovative solutions to clients we announced the acquisition of cachematrix a leading provider of financial technology that simplifies the cash management process for corporate treasury clients and the minority investment in scalable capital one of the fastest growing digital investment managers in europe together with our minority investment in icapital we believe blackrock can significantly enhance the growth profile of these businesses while simultaneously benefiting from their unique capabilities the strong organic growth we are experiencing today is a result of the investments we have made in our business over time and we continue to invest aggressively to create more opportunity for the future expense increased  yearoveryear and  sequentially driven primarily by higher volume related expense as a result of higher average aum and higher ga expense employee compensation and benefit expense was up  million or  yearoveryear primarily reflecting higher headcount sequentially compensation expense was down  reflecting lower seasonal employer payroll taxes in the current quarter and  million of onetime expense associated with the repositioning of our active equity platform in the prior quarter the accelerating shift to passive is impacting growth in our volume related expense and direct fund expense was up  million or  yearoveryear primarily reflecting significant growth in our ishares franchise ga expense was up  million or  yearoveryear reflecting increased levels of spend to drive growth including investments in technology and data and higher discretionary marketing and promotional spend yearoveryear comparisons were also impacted by the timing of certain accruals and additional expense related to the sale of our uk defined contribution platform sequentially ga expense increased  million from the first quarter or  reflecting similar increases in technology data and marketing spend but also higher foreign exchange remeasurement expense in the current quarter assuming stable markets and giving the timing and levels of our spend in the first half of  we would anticipate planned ga expense for the second half of  to be in the range of  million our first quarter asadjusted operating margin of  was flat yearoveryear and up  basis points sequentially as we have stated in the past we do not manage the business to a specific margin target but remain committed to optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible by leveraging the benefits of our scale for both clients and shareholders we are also committed to using our cash flow to optimize shareholder value by first reinvesting in our business and then returning excess cash to shareholders in line with that commitment in the second quarter we closed the acquisition of first reserve’s infrastructure equity funds larry will talk more about additional investments in innovation across the broader ecosystem to support future growth we also repurchased an additional  million worth of shares in the second quarter and stand by previous guidance as it relates to share repurchases for the remainder of the year second quarter longterm net inflows of  billion were positive across client types and diversified across asset classes and investment styles longterm net inflows were driven by ishares which crossed  trillion of global aum in the quarter and continue to benefit from the accelerating global shift to fee based advisory in the wealth channel and the rapid adoption of ishares etfs as asset allocation tools and financial instruments by professional money managers global ishares generated record quarterly net inflows of  billion representing  annualized organic growth with strength across our core and noncore exposures in the nine months since we announced pricing changes to the core in october of last year we have already recaptured over  of our investment through organic growth alone ishares equity net inflows of  billion reflected demand for core etfs cross both developed and the emerging market exposures and strong inflows into higher fee precision exposures and smart beta etfs fixed income ishares net inflows of  billion were led by flows into investment grade corporate emerging market bond and treasury funds our institutional business generated  billion with longterm net inflows across both active and index strategies institutional active net inflows of  billion were driven by strong multiasset and alternative inflows partially offset by equity and fixed income outflows multiasset flows were driven by our lifepath target date series which is our record net inflows of  billion we also saw strength in fiduciary mandates and factors each with approximately  billion of net inflows alternatives generated nearly  billion of net inflows driven primarily by our global infrastructure franchise institutional index net inflows of  billion reflected strong flows the  billion into fixed income partially offset by index equity outflows of  billion as several large clients made strategic asset allocation decisions during the quarter retail net inflows of  billion were positive in the us and internationally led by fixed income and index equity products partially offset by outflows from multiasset fixed income net inflows of  billion were diversified across our top performing platform and included  billion of inflows into unconstrained strategies as well as strong flows into municipals and total return strategies while total multiasset flows were once again impacted by outflows from world allocation strategies our multiasset income strategy nevertheless raised another  billion during the quarter as investors continued to target income oriented outcomes blackrock’s second quarter results reflect the benefits of our ongoing commitment to continuously invest for the future our diversification scale and globally integrated investment in technology platform enables us to generate differentiated and more consistent organic growth in aum and based fees resulting in longterm value creation for both clients and shareholders with that i will turn it over to larry laurence fink thanks gary good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call blackrock’s second quarter results reflect the trust our clients continue to place in our global investment and technology platform blackrock’s ability to partner with clients across our broad range of investment strategies and technology solutions and as a thought leader drove  billion of total net inflows in the quarter with a record  billion in longterm strategies which were positive across all client types product types and investment styles while significant cash remains on the sidelines investors have begun to put more other assets to work and global equity markets continue to rise in the quarter underscoring a generally healthier global economy and proving that so far markets have been resilient the political shocks through the second quarter the sp was up  year todate reaching alltime highs and many international markets have even outperformed at the same time while markets have started to anticipate a normalization a policy in the environment of sustained expansion negative yields remain a reality in some countries and expectations for a continued low yield environment persists and while amounts of cash is still are uninvested and the ongoing risk of both economic and political disruption on the horizons investors continue to face challenges in meeting their clients future need both institutional and retail clients are looking to blackrock for investment strategies and for aladdin risk management and portfolio construction technology they are also turning to blackrock for our insights to help them understand how to navigate the investment landscape insurance companies are one example of clients that continued to face significant challenges in this low yield environment last month’s leveraging blackrock’s extensive experience with the needs of insurance clients and risk modeling capabilities we launched an insurance industry risk study we took the investment portfolios of the entire us insurance industry at the individual security line item level uploading them onto aladdin and then cut the data in a variety of ways the fee was taking what kinds of risk and how are they are being rewarded for that type of risk and we brought together a group of insurance companies ceos to talk about the results to answer questions like what is the current opportunities set in their own individual portfolio and how should they be positioned in the event of a stressed economy or another crisis we also showed the ceos how their investment positions reflected versus their peers and so as the incredible peer analysis for the ceos our goal was to provide them with more information to look to blackrock to help them making strategic decisions that would ultimately drive their stakeholder returns this is just one example blackrock is increasingly using our technology our scale and innovative ways to enhance the value that we can provide to our clients as the wealth management landscape evolves globally our intermediary partners are accelerating their movement their changes towards a feebased advisory and feebased accounts and are expected to grow by upward of  trillion in the us over the next several years as a result our wealth partners are placing more emphasis than ever before on portfolios not just a product not just an individual bond or not just an individual stock there also focused on both performance and the value that the underlying investors provide to investors and increasingly our partners are looking for access to high quality portfolio construction and digital technologies to help execute repeatable processes in this environment blackrock is able to provide more value to wealth management clients than ever before and in the us through technology like aladdin risk for wealth management which i will talk about in a few minutes the reinvention of our sales model and tech enabled an advisor engagement had allowed us to partner with  more financial advisors this year than we did at the same point last year at no additional cost the combination of blackrock’s differentiated technology offerings and our broad based investment platforms position us as a most sophisticated portfolio construction partner in the industry for both institutions and wealth managers looking at flows for the quarter blackrock saw  billion of active net flows driven by multiasset fixed income and alternatives which contributed to strong organic base fee growth in the quarter blackrock is seeing increasingly strong fund raising momentum in the liquid alternatives with  billion in flows and commitments yeartodate with particularly strengthened infrastructure funds as the investments we have made in our platform over time are resonating with our clients our acquisition of first reserve infrastructure equity funds which closed in the quarter adds a talented team with specific expertise in energy infrastructure investing and  billion of assets to our platform we now have over  billion of total investment and commitment infrastructure capital to manage on behalf of our clients we also launched the uk first alternative solution fund earlier this month the fund offers pension searching for yield a longterm outcome oriented strategy in a single portfolio which again leverages blackrock’s specialist teams across credit real estate and infrastructure we now managed  billion of assets across our core alternative platform and have an additional  billion of committed capital to invest going forward blackrock saw  billion of net inflows into ishares and index funds in the second quarter global ishares momentum continued with a record  billion of net inflows for a total of  billion of net inflows yeartodate as growth continues following our strategic investment to lower prices for clients we generated  billion of inflows in ishares’ core funds in the quarter importantly noncore ishares exposures generated over  billion of flows contributing to a higher organic base fee growth for the firm the rapid growth we are seeing in ishares is increasingly due to the fact that etfs are no longer used only as a passive allocation but by active investors that generate alpha in their portfolios etf provide those investors targeting exposures without the idiosyncratic risk of any one single stock or one any single bond accelerating growth is also coming from the investments we are making more broadly to innovate across the entire etf ecosystem this is more than just a product innovation it’s innovation and distribution it’s innovation and portfolio construction technology and etf and portfolio construction education and in building new markets for new users all of which foster further adaptation of etfs worldwide as we deepen our partnership with clients and continue to strengthen our brand through both investment and technology offerings global ishares market share of yeartodate flows has expanded to more than  fixed income etfs are a great example of the area where broad ecosystem innovation is driving growth after several years of blackrock working with the national association of insurance commissioners on the mechanics of fixed income etfs accounting guidelines will now treat them as bonds instead of equities they will treat it as they look through treatment to the underlying assets making it much more efficient for insurers to own fixed income etfs or their portfolios another example is the new segment for ets we recently announced changes in our ishares etf mbb the industry flagship mortgagebacked security etf to drive accelerated growth we are evolving mbb or our mortgage backed bond etf to become the leading financial instruments and i want to underline risk management tool for institutions to access fully funded exposures to physical mortgage pools by lowering the price to make the fund competitive with direct investments in mortgage securities institutions will have a more efficient a more liquid option for hedging their mortgagebacked exposures and their direct mortgage origination we also launched blackrock’s first selfindex etfs two smart beta fixedincome etfs these new indexes are based on unique intellectual property and leveraging the best of blackrock’s analytics and modeling capabilities to achieve superior investment outcomes for clients this illustrates one of the ways we are using our scale and technology to reduce manufacturing costs and pass along greater savings to our clients technology is transforming the asset management industry as that pace of technology innovation is accelerating i have talked about blackrock’s aspirational target of  of our revenues being enabled by technology  years from now that is the vision for how i believe technology will help drive revenues and create efficiencies across blackrock some of that vision will be driven by growth in aladdin and our technology offerings but much of it will come from using technology to drive investment performance and build better distribution capabilities ultimately delivering growth in base fees and performance fees and in addition i am using this target as a mechanism to get all  of blackrock’s employees to understand how technology and the utilization of technology is going to change blackrock is going to change our client’s needs and will change the entire ecosystem in what we do technology will impact all aspects of our business the way we generate alpha the way we build portfolios the way we manage risk the way we distribute solutions the way we engage with service providers the way we operate and even the way we source talent aladdin’s portfolio and risk management technology continues to be in demand by institutional clients looking to invest and operate smarter and with more efficiencies we now have nearly  institutional clients using aladdin our investment teams are combining big data and machine learning with traditional fundamental human analysis to generate better sustainable alpha for our clients as portfolios become increasingly complex and interconnected we are leveraging our analytical and risk management technology to create more sophisticated and more scalable portfolio construction asset allocation and risk management tools for wealth management our first three aladdin risk for wealth management clients are now live and they are benefiting from the aladdin technology we are also providing our wealth management partners with integrated digital distribution platform so they can reach and interact with their end investors in a more scalable in a more repeatable way building on our acquisitions of futureadvisor our investment in icapital we continue to expand our digital distribution capabilities with an acquisition of cachematrix and a minority investment in scalable capital both platforms will allow us to provide our clients with scalable technologyenabled solutions in addition to driving growth we are using aladdin to drive operating efficiencies the investments we made in our trading technology and operations have dramatically reduced the cost of our trades we have reduced our trades by  over the last  years this has been a huge reduction in those basic costs and is totally driven by technology going forward technologyenabled scale will be increasingly important for every aspect of an asset managers business our client service our asset generation and operational excellence this year we will be spending  billion on technology and data and have over  employees working on technology and datarelated roles we recently signed a year lease for a new global headquarters at hudson yards in new york which will be the stateoftheart hub that is technologically advanced environmentally sustainable and operationally resilient our new headquarters will epitomize our techcentric culture and create a worldclass experience for our people and our clients as i have said many times but i made it as much as ever today i have never seen more opportunities for blackrock than i do today the record growth we are seeing is a direct result of the investments we made to build our platform over time continuing to invest in high growth areas of our business and moving into the adjacent areas to enhance the solutions we can offer to our clients both remain a critical priorities in order to drive future growth and provide increased value to both our clients and to our shareholders with that let me open up for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question is from glenn schorr with evercore laurence fink hi glenn glenn schorr hello there so i want to get a little followup on the aladdin for wealth so we have been watching you invest in this we turned three on this quarter i am assuming there is not much in the way of revenue yet and it’s more expense upfront so maybe as we roll forward say over the next year or so what are we supposed to think about in terms of i am sure there is a lot of training going on behind the scenes what kind of uptake should we expect and when do you think we will see it show up in both revenues and flows because retail still  of aum but i like you have a lot of high hopes for this investment gary shedlin so glenn it’s gary good morning i think we are obviously working very hard on an active pipeline for aladdin risk for wealth management i think part of – but first of all it’s generating revenue today obviously there are long implementations as there are for any aladdin implementation which could be as long as  months to  months where we bear more significant cost upfront as we have talked about before but i think really the clients that we had are – we are all still learning together about all of the amazing things that we can do with these clients both from the topdown in terms of some of the risk and compliance opportunities and then more importantly some of the other bottomsup more specific financial advisor opportunities regarding portfolio construction and asset allocation that move from advisor on so i think it’s hard for us to basically specify any given level of revenue other than to say that we think it’s going to accelerate significantly over the next couple of years both as we continue to adopt new opportunities with the existing clients and basically work through the pipeline of new opportunities going forward laurence fink glenn i would very similar to institutional implementations aladdin for wealth management is actually even more complex because we are in that dealing with let’s say dozens of portfolio managers ultimately aladdin for wealth management is going to be delta to house level at the cio level and then ultimately it will be implemented maybe depending on each firm at the individual financial advisor level and this will allow us to have on opportunity to be at our financial advisor’s desktops so the actual implementation probably it is a little longer because of the significance of the scale of it but let’s be clear this may become one of the great opportunities for blackrock we are going to continue to be driving more and more of the opportunities for aladdin for wealth management i see this being our transformation for our position in retail globally and what i believe this does it allows blackrock to be even more important than the overall ecosystem of – in wealth management it gives us the aladdin system will provide portfolio construction tools it provides risk management it is not a tools to sell only blackrock products it is a tool that enhance the wealth managers value proposition they will be able to use other products on another firms but we believe by having that placement in the desktop that placement and we have seen this in other areas it gives us that that opportunity to have deeper better dialogues and so we look at this as one more fundamental longterm strategies for positioning and as gary suggested there are revenues now but the revenues are very indiscernible to how the institutional side are there are very modest and the margins are subdued during this process of implementation and once utilized depending on how well they are utilized by the amount of financial advisors then we would expect increased utilization and through increased utilization will revenues from the platform operator our next question is from line of ken worthington with jpmorgan laurence fink hi ken ken worthington hi good morning the sga conducted a review on the mutual fund industry with some conclusions on the competitiveness of the market and on pricing what sort of reactions have you seen from that review and how might this parallel your minority stake in scalable capital gary shedlin well i think that we as all – hey ken it’s gary as always you i think we obviously support a better ecosystem for investors we think that to the extent that there is a better ecosystem that supports more transparency for investors and they feel more comfortable they will obviously put more money to work so i think we are obviously broadly supportive of a lot of what’s in the study we are just debriefing in fact we are going to be going through it in more detail but i think that everything there feels constructive we are supportive of basically trying to inform how we do business in a more transparent manner with investors and we will be making and obviously continuing to work with the regulators to make additional comments to affect we try and optimize that going forward but i think we feel that we are incredibly well positioned from the study to drive our business i think the us in many respects in terms of the most of the changes that’s occurred here in terms of the migration to fee based planning which we think is obviously where europe is going to go positions us incredibly well to learn and to basically effectuate that opportunity and i think our desire to basically grow that is exactly why we looked for an opportunity like scalable capital to do it in a matter that will help us evolve with the marketplace laurence fink along the question with scalable capital or any digital advise it’s a portal that is offering low fee products such as etfs is going to be of greater value we did not we bought scalable capital on a macro base we believe in that as gary said the us experience will be similar in europe and so once again we are trying to take a couple steps ahead of our clients and we are i think paying a good attention to the ecosystem changes that the regulators are evolving themselves in terms of making this a better environment for more investors one thing i would say the key issue for europe is over  of all savings is in cash in europe one of the great reasons why pe ratios are lower in europe than the united states is most savers are only in cash and bank deposits if through regulatory changes through digital advise through low cost alternatives if we could provide europeans with a better alternative that they look towards for investing overall a long horizon by being positioned there with digital technology with our ishares brand in europe i think we are as well positioned as any firm in the whole continent operator your next question comes from craig siegenthaler with credit suisse laurence fink hi craig craig siegenthaler thanks good morning everyone to the data shows the etfs aren’t jut stealing share from mutual funds or active managers but also from other sources like single security investors including in short retail investors so the industry is stealing wallet share financial assets and total retail flows have actually accelerated in  despite the dlo world do you have any data or thought taking share behind this trend to help us think about how much of ishares’ growth is actually coming from outside of the asset management industry gary shedlin well i think you cited it quite well and i cited it in my prepared talks we are seeing regulatory changes change the etfs environment we do believe we see accelerated flows because the method to because of the movement towards the fiduciary role in the united states we are seeing more active investors using etfs to express their exposures which i talked about i think that is accelerating having the insurance commissioners changing capital having a look through treatment for fixed income etfs is very important because insurance industry did not use etfs because the differential in capital charges just because of the cusip number and now you have a look through treatment and so we believe the environment for etfs is continuing to evolve we believe it’s continuing to grow and much of it also has to do with the ecosystem innovation i think what we are doing in the mortgage backed area is going to have even a large opportunity for etf growth as we can now use etfs as a vehicle to hedge mortgage production so i think what’s going on is – and then i’ll let rob kapito to speak up i do believe you are seeing more utilization of etfs from institutions and retail as a foreign exposure in the active side we are seeing more utilization across the board in more products and i think that’s what we are starting to see that acceleration before rob speaks i just want to say one important point index and etf still only represent  of the entire equity market global capitalization and here we are talking about a great amount of flows with  odd trillion global equity market capitalization we have much more opportunities for etfs to grow not just in equities but in fixed income and i believe this is just the beginning it reminds me of when rob and i were young driving the mortgagebacked securities market in the late s early s or for me in the late s rob rob any comments robert kapito yes first of all i am younger than you but second of all craig i think it’s not just stealing market share what’s obvious where that’s coming from whether it be mutual funds or whether it become futures or others what’s exciting is new areas that are being created with the awareness of etfs that not only can that be used for hedging vehicles they can be used as larry mentioned in the insurance area now with mortgagebacked securities which as you know are very expensive to buy because of prepayments and because of custodial costs so there is new and newer uses for etfs every single day and that’s why what we are trying to do is respond and be in front of our clients and we have to go out and discuss with them ways that they can use etfs that they have not been able to use them before so i would say it’s not only stealing market share it’s creating new market share which is really the big opportunity for all of us gary shedlin one last thing i would say that’s really important historically many institutions used derivative swaps or futures for hedging purposes and that was very obscure and nontransparent what we are now seeing whether it’s a bank a trading desk or a bank balance sheet an insurance company a mortgage originator we are now starting to see more and more utilization of etfs which is transparent so we look at this as a net positive and when people talk about this or not taken into the context how large derivative swap in futures have been and now – which was totally nontransparent and now all this activity is moving much more on to a transparent platform which obviously is one of the reason why you are seeing the growth and the other thing i would just say and rob talked about it we are seeing more and more investors instead of buying individual stocks or individual bonds are using etfs to get their exposures christopher meade their next question operator your next question is from brennan hawken with ubs brennan hawken good morning thanks for taking the question gary shedlin good morning brennan hawken so just wanted to followup on gary’s comments about the fee rate so i know that you walked through the fact that it’s stable which is certainly attributed to the reversals from the divergent beta and fx as you highlighted i am just kind of curious whether or not is it too much to expect that some of the reversal of those trends that have hindered your fee rate over the last few years could actually turn into tailwinds which might allow for the fee rate to expand or is stability the best way we should think about it and i know that sometimes averages can cause the numbers on a quarterly basis to not necessarily reflect the whole story so when we think about the exit rate coming out of the quarter here how should we think about the fee rate here tactically more in the nearterm too thanks gary shedlin thanks brennan good question so again i just want to take a step back again just back to the morgan stanley conference so we talked there about the fact that the blended fee rate over the last several years has obviously been impacted by a variety of factors that we don’t control we have talked about them as exogenous factors we have obviously pointed to both the virgin equity beta dollar appreciation but importantly also shifting client preferences towards lower risk asset classes and index strategies especially last year where obviously we saw probably – we saw a large dispersion between our asset growth rate and our base fee growth rate and that actually has also has an impact by virtue of mix in terms of our fee rate and i think all of those factors have really masked the benefit we have achieved from executing you know a pretty good differentiated growth strategy the fee rate declined about  basis points from the second quarter of last year and that was a continuation of some of the things we have talked about the impact of international market underperformance dollar appreciation throughout last year impact importantly of recent price cuts or what we would rather call an investment in our ishares franchise that were not reflected in last year’s prior second quarter and importantly a slower rate of organic base fee growth relative to asset growth in the second half of last year sequentially the fee rate has stabilized as those headwinds as you mentioned associated with divergent beta and fx have abated and should those trends continue the impact of our accelerating organic base fee growth rate which has been about  yeartodate so far clearly should be more apparent over time in my opinion know if we can sustain organic based fee growth in excess of  frankly we have done that in  ‘ ‘ ‘ and yeartodate this year last year was really the first year in the last five that we didn’t do that i am not really sure why the fee rate itself is garnering that much attention other than i understand that it’s the basis of a lot of the modeling that everybody is doing but i think right now we are feeling incredibly comfortable with the level of organic base fee growth rate that we are seeing and are paying a little less attention to the overall fee rate as long as we can generate that revenue momentum operator your next question is from the line of dan fannon with jefferies gary shedlin good morning dan dan fannon can you discuss the reaction from both clients and your distribution partners from the repositioning of the equity platform earlier this year and in particular maybe talk about some of the flows at the product level and if there is outflows that you anticipate that may still come as a result of those changes laurence fink so look we continue to believe in active management and as clients focus more on outcomes both the active and the index are going to play a role in portfolios to drive returns so we announced changes to our active equity platform in march these changes were not effective until mid to late june so it’s a little early to tell and see any material progress from the reorg of both flows or financial advice but as anticipated we saw some accelerated outflows from the funds impacted by the changes which contributed to some of the active equity outflows in the second quarter but other of our fundamental active equity funds that were in part of the changes to the platform actually saw a slight improvement in outflows and additionally we had a few large client redemptions from our scientific active equity but a portion of these outflows were recaptured on our platform as certain clients moved into index strategies so our focus is going to be on generating strong performance which we believe differentiates our ability to work with our clients to achieve their desired longterm outcomes to drive improvements in both the scientific and fundamental active equity funds since last year and there i have already seen some excellent performance in the quantitative side  of our active – quantitative active equity and  of our fundamental active equity assets are above their benchmark and peer mediums for the year period and then the creation of our advantage series which is offering clients the ability to outperform and have the lowest fees all of those are showing results and all of this i believe is part of our announcement of monarch and the upside that we have to come so we are very encouraged the portfolio managers are energized to be able share information across multiple platforms we have heard very positive views from our clients because everyone is focused on figuring out how to utilize the big data that’s out there to their advantage to create performance so the rollout of it has been something that we have gotten very very good client feedback from and i am very optimistic about it going forward operator your next question is from the line of alex blostein with goldman sachs alex blostein thanks hi good morning everybody so larry i want to go back to the comment you made around  billion you guys are spending currently on tech and data with over  people obviously it’s been and continues to be very important growth area for you guys but how much i guess do you guys expect that to grow over the next years and which area specifically you targeted more either on the data side or the technology side and i guess you have just taken a step back bigger picture how should we think about overall margins in the tech and risk business as you guys continue to invest and scale this up over the next couple of years laurence fink let me let gary answer that and i will give some color gary shedlin so good morning alex so just to give a little bit of color on the people and the investment the  rough cut people in technology and data related roles includes expected technology roles such as programmers and quant modelers but also less obvious ones that leverage technology and data in a significant way like our ishares analytics and electronic trading teams so as larry basically mentioned we are thinking technology much more holistically not as a specific definition but embracing technology to drive our overall – our overall business we are spending about  billion this year to support that technology and data initiative which includes a number of things but also includes compensation and related expenses associated with obviously those people as well as hardware software and market data costs for the firm more broadly i think in terms of margins more broadly know as you know we are not really big on talking about individual margins of vertical businesses and so as we really think about incremental margins on specific products or businesses that’s not an overwhelming or relevant number that we think about daytoday but for example to think about driving growth in ishares as an example we are investing beyond simple product innovation we are investing in the entire etf ecosystem we are investing in distribution or investing in portfolio construction technology we are investing in capital markets etf and portfolio construction education we are talking about building new markets for new users and i think there is no question the accelerating growth that we are seeing in ishares is a direct result of those investments more broadly we are really trying to take a much more portfolio oriented approach to investing in technology and notwithstanding some of things that we are doing that go also through our pl you are also seeing us making a number of strategic acquisitions or other investments sometimes they are controlled like cachematrix and sometimes they really do get to see that the table and try to learn and help our partners evolve like scalable capital and high capital i think the important thing is that whichever direction we are going to go we are going to continue use our scale which we think is a huge driver of our ability to efficiently spend on technology in ways that others can’t really to drive that growth and increased market share for both shareholders and our clients laurence fink alex i would argue in every industry in the world today technology will be changing how we operate how our clients operate and if we are not aggressively trying to be providing technology to interface with our clients better technology to create more efficiencies as we operate and technology as we think about how to get better insights we will be – we will not provide the information and the ideas to our clients and i believe we need to be driving this faster and i do believe as i said for quarter and quarter and quarter i believe through this relentless investments we are able to secure deeper broader relationships with more clients worldwide i think aladdin for wealth management is going to allow us to have a much better position going forward with all our distribution partners and helping them to think about the risk for their own clients so they do a better job with their clients and the key for all of us worldwide if our clients have better outcomes as i talked about europe and the amount of cash if we can provide better outcomes and better risk information so people look to investing more for the longterm we will all be better off and i believe this is an important responsibility and role for blackrock to use technology to enhance financial literacy technical difficulty financial literacy to our financial advisors and ultimately financial – and allowing that technology allow our financial advisors provide better literacy to their clients and this is something that is we are very aggressive on and i do believe the relentless pace that we have related towards technology puts us in a differentiated position than any other asset manager and we will continue to try to drive technology to make us different operator your next question is from william katz with citigroup laurence fink hey bill william katz good morning everyone thanks for taking the question and this is actually feeds on what you guys are sort of talking about as you think about the margin i was trying to look back to your last analyst day it seemed like the formula was some revenue growth some operating leverage and you get some sort of midteens earnings growth on top of that with low capital management is there a shift here just to more of a top line focus and maybe a little bit more flattening the margin opportunity on a go forward basis and within that the  million ph mentioned to sort of second half of planned ga could you talk about is that sort of like the new run rate as you look ahead given the relentless drive to grow the business thank you gary shedlin thanks bill good morning to you so look as we have said in the past week we really don’t manage the business to a specific margin target and in my view my personal view quarterly comparisons here are less relevant and you really should look at our performance over a more appropriate period of time especially in the context of the organic growth that we are generating today our commitment has not changed our commitment has always been to optimize organic growth in the most efficient way possible especially by leveraging our scale for both clients and shareholders and i think if you look back over the work that we have done since bgi in particular the operating margin is up well over  basis points and we have invested significantly back into the business we are currently generating record organic growth especially in terms of base fees as i mentioned over the last  months  million plus of net new business that’s  organic aum growth and importantly  organic base fee growth it was a significant time where people were asking us when we were going to get to those levels and well i think it’s still early to call it’s sustainable for a significant period of time this level of growth is clearly a direct result of the investments that we have made over time no one likes higher margins than i do or well maybe the guy sitting next to me actually does but i also know that our level of organic growth determines our multiple and continuing to invest to support these record levels of organic growth is a critical priority for us and one that will be maintained going forward while there is obviously an upward bias to our margin as we continue to grow in a constructive environment i think as larry indicated in his in his remarks we intend to continue playing offense by aggressively investing to create more opportunities for future growth operator ladies and gentlemen we have reached the allotted time for questions mr fink do you have any closing remarks laurence fink i just want to thank everybody for joining us this morning for your interest in blackrock our second quarter results once again highlights our longterm investments we made to enhance and differentiate blackrock it is differentiated because our global investment platform is differentiated because of our global technology platform we will continue to invest in both our technology and investment capabilities and use our scale to deliver better outcomes for our clients and shareholders and we are going to use that scale to provide better financial literacy and better longterm results on behalf of our clients which will enable them to invest in more financial assets we and the whole industry will be better off we believe we have a good start in doing that and we believe we have deeper stronger relationship with more clients worldwide than we ever had before which i believe will lead to future growth for the firm and for our shareholders everyone have a very good quarter and we will talk to you soon operator this concludes today’s teleconference you may now disconnect copyright policy all transcripts on

continue reading the main story share this page continue reading the main story photo over the last  years laurence d fink has transformed blackrock from a bond shop catering to pension funds and insurance companies into an assetgathering machine that uses advanced technology to reimagine how investors buy sell and assess risks credit damon winterthe new york times los angeles — laurence d fink the leader and founder of blackrock the world’s largest asset manager had come homea bruin to the bone — class of  — he had a story to tell the  giddy graduates packed into the cavernous basketball arena at the university of california los angeles once upon a time he was a rock star on wall street he had big hair and flashed turquoise jewelry and making money had never seemed so easyuntil it wasn’t“i screwed up” mr fink declared recalling the  million he blew thanks to failed mortgage trades in  “and it was bad”for the graduating millennials the morality tale resonated not least because it came from a ucla grad who had ascended fallen from and again scaled wall street’s treacherous peaks but it was his description of why he stumbled that truly explained his evolution from downonhisluck bond trader to master of a firm that has its eye on a sum about equal to the  trillion united states economy advertisement continue reading the main story “i had become complacent — too sure of what i thought i knew” mr fink said “i believed i had figured out the market but i was wrong because while i wasn’t watching the world had changed” continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story over the last decade no other financial firm has gone further in challenging the classic wall street moneymaking model for investment banks and traditional mutual fund companies hire — and handsomely pay — hotshots to make big bets with other people’s moneythe future of finance mr fink has argued lies with rulesbased datadriven investment styles such as exchangetraded funds which track a variety of stock and bond indexes or adhere to a set of financial rules the idea is that such an approach eliminates at least some of the potential for human error while lowering costsit is this notion of using technology to root out investment risks that lies at the heart of blackrock’s investing strategy putting this into practice is the firm’s riskmitigation platform aladdin which enjoys a ubiquity within the firm — it tracks everything from bond trades to head count — that evokes hal  the sentient computer in the movie “ a space odyssey” some employees even use aladdin as a verb as in “has the new portfolio manager been aladdinized yet”directing the flowon wall street prestige and influence have always been functions of a firm’s ability to capture a large amount of what investors call flow — the trillions of dollars in securities that are bought and sold on a given day worldwide before the financial crisis goldman sachs’s reputation was made because the choice transactions ran through its bankers and traders the same could be said of the hedge fund sac capital advisors under steven a cohen who rose to fame and also became the target of regulators on his ability to trade off this cascadebut in today’s world of violent price swings and cashstarved markets those with near infinite buying power — central banks sovereign wealth funds and the largest money manager in the land — have become the new arbiters of flow “we have never seen a paradigm shift like this” said anthony j perrotta jr an analyst with the tabb group which analyzes the structure of financial markets “it is not about the flow of securities anymore it is about the flow of information and indications of interest”blackrock’s strategy was forged and ultimately empowered by two market calamities over the last three decades the first of course was mr fink’s experience at first boston in  when he bet big on mortgages without assessing how the securities would trade in a period of extreme stressbut blackrock became the behemoth it is today only after the events of  that is when a soupedup toxic variety of the securitized mortgages that mr fink helped design years earlier at first boston imploded — setting off a chain of bank failures and the deepest global economic downturn since the great depression chastened investment banks were forced to exit these businesses under pressure from regulators advertisement continue reading the main story and in stepped blackrock its assets under management swelled as investors — starved for higher returns — piled into the company’s etfs which tracked the highflying markets“the balance of power is now with firms like blackrock because they have the ‘bid’” said mr perrotta of tabb using wall street argot to describe the buying power of large asset managersthe power shift was on display this spring when mr fink took the stage at an investor conference alongside john cryan recently charged with reviving the sagging fortunes of deutsche bank one of the global investment firms that was minting money before the markets collapsed in  while the event was billed as a cozy exchange of ideas between two wall street heavyhitters it played out instead as a series of slightly peevish questions posed by mr cryan to mr fink“you are effectively becoming the supplier of liquidity of last resort — beyond the central banks” mr cryan said to mr finkthe assertion bordered on the impudent — suggesting that blackrock and its  trillion stash of assets had become the new guarantor of stability because of its ability to buy and sell stocks and bonds in times of duress investment banks which previously aspired to this duty have been complaining for years that the financial system has become riskier because blackrock and similar firms cannot perform such a marketmaking functionbut to say as much to mr fink directly — and in a room full of investors no less — was highly unusual mr fink was clearly irritated by the query “well that is not our role — we won’t play that role” he replied stifflyit was not the most convincing of replies‘i am aladdin’over the last  years mr fink has transformed blackrock from a bond shop catering to pension funds and insurance companies into an assetgathering machine that uses advanced technology to reimagine how investors buy sell and assess the risks of a wide variety of securities via its  trillionplus in exchangetraded funds blackrock has been instrumental in creating newly liquid markets in highyield and corporate bonds — a direct attack on the business model of banks like deutsche bank fink’s upward trajectory in over two decades at blackrock laurence d fink has watched the firm grow to manage  trillion and through its big datamining risk platform aladdin or asset liability and debt and derivatives investment network blackrock says it has developed the market’s most highly evolved framework for stresstesting how securities will respond to certain situations — such as a sudden rise in interest rates or what happens in the event of a political surprise like donald j trump being elected president advertisement continue reading the main story staffed by  of blackrock’s  employees aladdin promises to help firms trade analyze and keep a compliant eye on the assets they manage in an era of severe regulatory scrutiny the service has become quite popular seventyfive firms — including deutsche bank’s asset management unit and freddie mac — managing a total of  trillion now use itfor a man who in his speeches consistently spends more time talking about technology and risk analytics than the vagaries of the capital markets mr fink is no techie like many wall street titans of his vintage the yearold mr fink rarely sends emails an infrequent texter he does most of his communicating by phone in meetings or over a plate of spicy pasta at his goto italian restaurant in midtown manhattanmr fink maintains a grueling schedule mixing regular bicoastal trips in the united states with frequent client jaunts to china and the middle east “this job requires an enormous commitment” he said “the pace is relentless there will be a day when i wake up one day and say i just can’t do it anymore”that day remains well in the future he says still with blackrock’s growth in size and sway the issue of who if anyone from within the firm is qualified to succeed mr fink has become an existential question for the company’s board of directorsthe problem is typical when replacing a founder mr fink has increased assets to  trillion from zero and the imprint of his domineering personality has become so profound that virtually anyone will suffer to some degree in comparison considering his track recordafter all in  he structured one of the first collateral mortgage obligations and along with lewis ranieri at salomon brothers made it possible for large investors to enter the market for mortgages a quarter of a century later mr fink recognized that the time was right for etfs and — in the depths of the financial crisis — bought barclays’s ishares business a deal analysts consider one of the shrewdest in recent wall street memoryand beyond a soaring stock price there are few better ways for a financial chief to command the respect of his peers than to slip through the grasp of regulators so when mr fink and his highpowered lobbyists in washington were able to make the case after the  financial crisis that major fund companies like blackrock posed no risks to the markets because of their size it only added to his aurathere is a moment in don delillo’s “cosmopolis” his meditation on the alienating effects of money and machines when the protagonist financier offers a bit of advice to a colleague there’s only one thing worth pursuing professionally and intellectually he says the interaction between technology and capital — its inseparability advertisement continue reading the main story that more or less is what mr fink told dexter senft his computer expert at first boston in  “we are bringing the computer onto the trading floor dexter” mr fink recalls saying at the time “if we can do this it will change our business forever”not only would mr fink and his bond wizards be able to sell billions of dollars of new securities giving birth to today’s market for asset backed mortgages they could also analyze how these securities would trade in certain situations newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify youre not a robot by clicking the

policy opt out or contact us anytime the immense losses at first boston in  taught a lesson that eventually shaped blackrock mr fink realized that his clients on the “buy side” the fund managers insurance companies and pension funds shopping for investments had become dependent on the ability of the “sell side” the wall street investment banks to analyze mortgages that was because few buyside clients had invested in computers and technology to the level first boston hadmost money management firms highlight their investment returns first and risk controls second blackrock has taken a reverse approach it believes that risk analysis such as gauging how a security will trade if interest rates go up or down improves investment resultsthat is where aladdin comes in aladdin is a network of code trades chat algorithms and predictive models that on any given day can highlight vulnerabilities and opportunities connected to the  trillion the firm tracks —  trillion of which belongs to outside firms that pay blackrock a fee to have access to the platformaladdin fills the monitors of most blackrock employees one portfolio manager even went so far as to hang a nearly cinemasize screen on his office wall in order to get the full aladdin experience and at the company’s investor day in june mr fink and other top executives mentioned aladdin  times — more than any other business line — even though the platform represents just  percent of the  billion in revenues blackrock took in last yearor consider a recent marketing video that shows mr fink and other top executives gazing at the camera and intoning one after the other “i am aladdin”moment in the sunfrom mr fink’s early days on wall street his ambition has been stoked by a sense that he has not been receiving the proper credit for his achievements at first boston even though he was among the earliest to popularize trading in mortgage securities his peers including mr ranieri and others drew more public attention as innovators and moneymakersas a successful albeit mostly anonymous bond manager at blackrock in the s and s he saw acclaim pay and influence go to the chief executives of goldman sachs merrill lynch and morgan stanley that began changing only in  when he bought barclays’s etf business last year he was among a small circle of wall street executives to attend the state dinner at the white house for the chinese president xi jinping advertisement continue reading the main story a part of mr fink — a fervent democrat today — believes he would make a pretty good treasury secretary say people who have discussed politics with him although he recently persuaded cheryl mills one of hillary clinton’s closest advisers to join the board of blackrock the view is fairly strongly held that if mrs clinton becomes president there is little chance that she will tap a wall street insider for the treasury job photo the future of finance mr fink has argued lies with rulesbased datadriven investment styles credit damon winterthe new york times with blackrock’s stock having more than doubled since  far outpacing the likes of goldman and jpmorgan and trading close to its record high it seems that the market has come around to mr fink’s financial worldview that a low cost systematic style of investing will over time grow faster than the costlier “active investing” model in which individuals not algorithms make stock bond and asset allocation decisionsand the numbers in that regard are arresting through july etfs and traditional index funds made up  percent of total mutual fund assets according to the investment company institute a ratio that has doubled in just under  yearsof course with close to  trillion in actively managed funds mr fink is not ready to write off a segment of the industry that even after years of outflows clocks in at  trillion and he underlines the importance of being able to offer the best of both active and passive investing styles to blackrock clientsbut inside the firm and out there is little doubt that he is betting the ranch on etfs and similarly themed investments choices these include socalled factor strategies in which a bet is made on a certain investment outcome — like value stocks outpacing growth stocks or a basket of lowvolatility equities beating the broader indexesin san francisco a team of equity investors deploys data analysis to study the language that a chief executive uses during an earnings call does he seem unusually bearish this quarter compared with last if so maybe the stock is a sell“we have more information than anyone” mr fink saida notsoshort listsome analysts in fact argue that blackrock should be valued as a technology company as opposed to an asset managermark wiedman  a blackrock executive who is on the short list to succeed mr fink believes that bond etfs in particular are creating a liquid market where a new generation of bond investors can freely buy and sell advertisement continue reading the main story for years he and mr fink have been pitching insurance companies and pension funds to stop buying individual bonds from the likes of deutsche bank and instead choose a blackrock bond etf now it’s happening“i think of etfs as technology” mr wiedman said as he leaned back in a swivel chair in his office “it is a product that bundles up a bunch of securities puts them on a screen and makes them easier to trade”like many top executives here mr wiedman can get a bit manic when discussing the subject midway through an interview he felt the need to somewhat violently undo his tie and cast it asideregulators are less enthusiastic global watchdogs like the bank for international settlements and the international monetary fund have described these bountiful flows into and out of blackrock bond etfs as a liquidity illusion which means according to ken monaghan an investor in highyielding corporate bonds that easytotrade etfs have lured “tourist” investors — people seduced by the rich yields but who may not be able to stomach a sustained market reversaland if they all leave at once watch out“etfs do not create liquidity” said mr monaghan of the global fund manager amundi smith breeden “these new investors are not permanent”aside from mr wiedman of blackrock the short list to succeed mr fink includes robert s kapito  a founding partner and current president of the firm who is seen as the top choice if a handover occurs sooner rather than later other candidates are rob goldstein the yearold chief operating officer and driving force behind aladdin’s growth mark mccombe  a former hsbc executive who looks after the firm’s big clients rich kushel  who oversees multiasset investment strategies for clients and gary shedlin  the chief financial officer there is also mark wiseman a new hire who joined the firm this month to oversee its equity businessit is a long list and purposely so for mr fink recommending a successor to his board is probably the weightiest decision he will make as blackrock chief he has taken pains to not tip his hand “i want to make sure that the day after i leave the firm is better off without me” he saidthis spring mr fink called together more than  of the firm’s most senior executives for two days of meetings in barcelona spain blackrock was approaching its th anniversary and mr fink was in a nostalgic mood yet there was an edge to his remarks advertisement continue reading the main story yes blackrock was thriving because of its focus on lowrisk lowcost funds and the allseeing wonders of aladdin but now was not the time to coast“we cannot let someone brand us as a vampire squid” warned mr fink referring to a defining article in rolling stone magazine that so described goldman sachsnor was this a time to sit fat and happy on a big pile of assets and let the fees roll in an indirect slap at actively managed giants such as franklin templeton and pimco where assets under management have recently been declining never before he said had the fund management industry been so competitive and changing “if you think you know everything about our business you are kidding yourself” he said “the biggest question we have to answer is ‘are we developing the right leaders’”and then looking out over the striving blackrock executives gathered before him he put it to them directly “are you” he asked “prepared to be one of those leaders” continue reading the main story we’re interested in your feedback on this page tell us what you think whats next loading go to home page » site
