to live it up in the hamptons martha stewartstyle martha stewart is diving into apparel and skincare blame martha stewart for yankees ruined perfect game martha stewart launches virtual wine store the rivalry between domestic diva martha stewart and gwyneth paltrow amped up monday when the oscarwinning actress hired lisa gersh to be the ceo of goop her fledgling lifestyle and ecommerce company gersh is the former chief of martha stewart living omnimedia who exited in early  after only a year on the job paltrow  has been using the yearold goop to move slowly but steadily into stewart’s sweet spot — that is handing out advice on home food and fashion in fact goop which paltrow and gersh prefer to present with a lowercase “g” sometimes publishes recipes adapted from stewart stewart  has been curtly dismissive of paltrow’s efforts to crack the personal lifestyle multimedia genre that stewart has pioneered with books magazines web properties and tv shows in a recent interview stewart said paltrow should pipe down and stick to acting “she just needs to be quiet” stewart was quoted as telling netaporter’s porter magazine “she’s a movie star if she were confident in her acting she wouldn’t be trying to be martha stewart” paltrow started goop in london but recently moved the company to the us and is clearly intent on expanding what has been a moneylosing ecommerce company “lisa is a visionary leader with unparalleled creativity and savvy” paltrow said in making the announcement “she’s the perfect person to build on the momentum we have already created at goop and to diversify our opportunities to bring goop’s positive energy directly to consumers in what they read what they try and what they buy and how they live” gersh  who worked at nbc before mslo and cofounded oxygen media hinted that part of her job at goop would be to bring new products to market but she did not say if any of those new products would be a magazine moving into print would make paltrow even more of a rival to stewart “building on goop’s unique success we’ll continue to invest in the company expand globally and launch next product lines and partnerships the future of commerce is all tied to best in class trusted distinctive curated content” goop had  revenues of  million and posted a loss of  in that year according to documents on file with companies house in britain which
