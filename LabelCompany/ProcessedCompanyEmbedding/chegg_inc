said the firm sometimes uses strategic partners such as ecampuscom if a particular book isnt in its warehouse but the reporter wondered whether the use of third party suppliers might cause confusion when books needed to be returned at the end of the semester chegg was the most expensive rental and charged sales tax the least expensive alternative was textbookscom although this firm required an upfront expense of  king surmised the upfront payout would mean college students had less money available during the semester in all cases books had to be returned by the deadline to make the cost

described chegg as a leader in the burgeoning arena of college textbook rentals the firm had  customer service reps at that point since many textbooks become outofdate quickly often replaced with new versions a key to profitability will be how long a book can be rerented or recycled in the market for rental cars for example firms such as hertz and avis buy new cars but sell them after about a year or two of service but what is the useful life of a rented book the market can be tricky said market analyst kathy mickey because professors must use the same books for several semesters in order for bookrental companies to make money on the programs competitorsedit the college textbook market has a variety of competitors while the main source of books for college students is college bookstores

an expensive accounting textbook and noted some confusion with book packages with return labels differing from the firms which had been ordered from figuring out that the original sources were campus book rentals and chegg required matching the shipping tracking orders with the email invoices a chegg spokesperson said the firm sometimes uses strategic partners such as ecampuscom if a particular book isnt in its warehouse but the reporter wondered whether the use of third party suppliers might cause confusion when books needed to be returned at the end of the semester chegg was the most expensive rental and charged sales tax the least expensive alternative was textbookscom although this firm required an upfront expense of  king surmised the upfront payout would mean college students

experts  for everything else cheap college books for sale or rent college textbook sales by university book stores is an estimated billiondollarplus industry chegg is turning that world upside down by creating over  billion dollars in student savings on college textbooks since  through revolutionizing the “old” system colleges and universities reap huge profits from the sale of new and used textbooks at their institutional bookstores which consistently feature heavily markedup prices for even the most basic of textbooks and with the increasing costs of attending an institution of higher learning and earning a degree students are looking for ways to cut costs any way they can therefore it’s no shock that year after year more and more students are deciding to save big bucks on their college textbooks from chegg rather than continue to fund their school bookstore’s profits chegg is a true leader in helping students save money on their college textbooks by offering a wide selection of used college textbooks to rent or purchase because chegg operates primarily in the used textbook space they are able to offer significant discounts for your required reading materials not found anywhere else in the market compared to the receipts at your local college store you could potentially save up to  using chegg’s textbook rental service that’s a significant savings you won’t find shopping your traditional retailers of college books and why chegg delivered over  million college textbooks in  alone in addition to college textbooks students love our online tutoring services as
