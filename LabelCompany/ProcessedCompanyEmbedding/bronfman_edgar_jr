cannot be considered a war crime waldheim had served as an intelligence officer in a unit of the army that participated in the transfer of greek jews to death camps the allegations against waldheim

irascible selfmade canadian magnate who founded a distilling company in  and got rich during prohibition when bronfman liquor found its way to american customers through bootleggersedgar gave the company a more sophisticated image in keeping with his own elegantly turnedout profile in new york society — a prominence underscored in the s by the headlines generated by the kidnapping of his son sam for ransom moneybut as liquor profits began to falter he broadened the company by acquiring tropicana taking seagram into the oil business and eventually making it the largest minority shareholder

deposited their savings in switzerland before world war iimr bronfman shrugged off criticism from those who feared that his aggressive tactics were risking an antisemitic backlash “the answer isn’t to say ‘don’t make trouble’ and hide our heads in the sand” he wrote in his  memoir “good spirits the making of a businessman” “we may not earn the friendship of others but we will demand their respect”prospering by prohibitionedgar miles bronfman was born in montreal on june   his father and his mother the former saidye rosner were jewish immigrants from eastern europe who had moved to

allan established a successful mailorder liquor company but were forced to give it up when provincial governments in canada took over the retail side of the liquor business themselves the bronfmans decided that if they could not sell liquor they would produce it the family built its own distillery near montreal in it prospered and the bronfmans took advantage of prohibition by opening more distilleries just across the border from the united states one that the brothers bought was owned by the seagram family and they incorporated the name when prohibition ended they were strategically placed to open a seagram subsidiary in the united states in “how much business father and his brothers did with bootleggers was never clear” mr bronfman wrote in “good spirits”edgar and his siblings

tarrytown ny and at the family retreat on lake placid in the adirondacks advertisement continue reading the main story but affluence did not always evoke fond memories “my childhood was marked by a tension between privilege on the one hand and emotional dysfunction on the other” mr bronfman wrote in “good spirits” he complained that his father had rarely been around and that his mother had been remote and inaccessiblemr bronfman said he had grown up with a confused understanding of his jewish identity the bronfmans kept a kosher home and the children received religious schooling on weekends

he joined seagram working as an apprentice taster and accounting clerk in montreal and then at the main distillery nearby where he eventually oversaw production he had a knack for finances and the boldness to tell his tyrannical father how best to handle his money at  he explained that seagram could reap great tax benefits if it incorporated its petroleum subsidiary and carried out exploration in the united states rather than in canada“fortunately father saw the point at once and agreed” he wrotemr bronfman was a confident executive safe in the knowledge that as the firstborn son he was the heir apparent his brother accepted his status and throughout his life deferred to mr bronfman on business decisions but his oldest sibling minda resented the accident of gender that had removed her from consideration as the eventual heir despite her degree in business administration relations between her and edgar were strained for most of their lives photo mr bronfman received the presidential
