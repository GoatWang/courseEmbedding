storiesbuilding a family legacy  the marriott story building a family legacy  the marriott story written by richard e marriott my family and i are very proud to have our name associated with this great school—not only because it’s a terrific educational institution but because we espouse similar values my purpose today is to give you an appreciation of what marriott values are and what they mean to me the best way to do this is to share a little family and corporate history they are both about the same the marriott companies most people know and recognize today are marriott international of which my brother bill is the ceo and chairman and host marriott of which i am chairman both companies came from the original marriott corporation which began as hot shoppes inc my father j willard marriott was the founder of it all he was frequently asked “what is the secret to your success” he invariably responded that three elements were integral to his success  being born right  developing good habits and  marrying right being born right my father had two things going for him at birth he was born in the united states and he had good genes he was blessed to live in one of the few countries where if you work hard and make reasonably intelligent decisions you can become successful i serve on the board of the national restaurant association with about ninetyfive people who are very successful and well known in the business world almost every one of them started working as a dishwasher table busser or server in a restaurant and then worked up to management and often ownership this great country in which we live gives each of us this opportunity secondly my father had good genes and a lot of those genes came from his grandmother elizabeth stewart elizabeth was born in liverpool england she and her brother william were converted to the church of jesus christ of latterday saints their family was very poor and gave little support to elizabeth’s and william’s decision to join the church and make the long arduous trip to zion which was a fairly heavy expense in 8 elizabeth had one possession of value—a beautiful shawl she received from her mother—which she sold for enough money to book passage on a ship sailing from liverpool to st louis missouri after arriving in st louis william used his last few dollars to pay for his passage on a wagon train to salt lake city elizabeth had nothing left so she worked for two years as a housekeeper to earn enough money to join a wagon train of course in those days when you joined a wagon train you didn’t actually ride in a wagon—you walked alongside it unfortunately she had only one pair of shoes she wrote in her diary “i would not want to walk down the streets of salt lake city in wornout shoes” so she took those shoes put them in her bag and walked barefoot so she would have good shoes when she got to salt lake city she was a strongwilled woman after her trek across the plains elizabeth lived with her brother in kaysville utah shortly after she arrived there she was standing in the doorway of his home looking out across a field and saw a giant of a man on horseback coming toward her she said he was not very handsome but the spirit whispered to her “this is going to be your husband” i don’t think she was especially happy to hear that his name was john marriott and about three days later he approached her and said “i’ve got the feeling you and i are to be married” and so they were wed shortly thereafter one of the products of that marriage was hyrum willard marriott my grandfather developing good habits my father j willard grew up on his father’s farm just west of ogden in the small town of marriott utah which was founded by his grandfather john marriott as a young boy he quickly learned how to work hard and take responsibility he and his seven brothers and sisters had to take care of the crops and the livestock as the eldest son my dad had primary responsibility for the sheep and cattle he spent so much of his time during his teen years tending them on the farm and herding them on the ranges of nevada and utah that he never graduated from high school he was called on a mission at age nineteen and that provided him the welcome opportunity to leave the farm and spend two years on the east coast preaching the gospel from washington dc to maine when my dad returned to utah he was able to talk his way into being accepted at weber college without having a high school diploma his second year of college is exemplary of the kind of worker he was he was the salesman and writer for the newspaper the manager and stock boy for the bookstore an english teacher and senior class president after graduating from weber my father transferred to the university of utah and worked in a foodcatering business with franklin d richards who was to be one of his lifelong friends during summers at the university of utah he earned his living selling black wool long underwear produced by a utah woolen mill dad would go to the northwest logging camps and sell this underwear for  a pair that was a lot of money back then so he developed a special selling strategy he would find two mean looking lumberjacks and challenge them saying “each of you take a leg of this pair of underwear if you can pull this underwear apart i’ll give you a free pair if you can’t you’ve got to buy it” the loggers would then have a tugofwar but could never tear the underwear apart dad earned more than  in commissions during a single summer and was the most productive salesman in the company marrying right in addition to succeeding as a salesman my father also succeeded in finding the right woman to marry at the university of utah he met a young lady named alice sheets she was eighteen years old and in her junior year on one of their first dates he took her to a little restaurant in the center of salt lake city it was a small orange and black box building selling one item—aw root beer my father was extremely impressed—not because he liked root beer but because they had a line of people a block long waiting to buy this product he was so excited that he jumped on a train for sacramento california to talk to roy allen the “a” in aw roy sold him a license to sell aw root beer in the washington dc area dad chose this area because he’d been there on his mission and knew how hot and miserable it was in the summer he proposed to alice and told her he would be back to marry her when she graduated he left for washington to make all the root beer stand arrangements and returned to utah in may  for the wedding on the day they were to be married in the salt lake temple my father didn’t show up when the ceremony was supposed to start he was trying to get his commissions from the woolen mills he arrived at the wedding twoandahalf hours late with no money he asked my mother “do you still want to marry me” she said “yes” of course his motherinlaw had the presence of mind to cancel the wedding reception and give dad the  they were going to spend for the reception with that money mom and dad jumped into his model t ford and started their twoweek drive to washington dc my mother was a tremendous partner to my father she kept the books for their new nineseat restaurant which opened up the day lindbergh flew across the atlantic  may  every night she would take the nickels which were covered in root beer syrup and wash them in the kitchen sink the bank wouldn’t accept sticky nickels she’d then put the clean coins into a paper bag and walk down to the bank around midnight to make the deposit of the day’s revenue she understood what it took to run a restaurant and she supported my dad throughout his career because she loved him and appreciated the work he was doing i learned a lot of important lessons from my parents many of which are the same ones you’ll be learning not only in the business world but also at the marriott school success is never final change is what puts life in your business and in your life the customer needs change constantly and your business and you have to change to meet those needs when my folks opened their root beer stand they had one product icecold root beer that worked great from may through september october rolled around and it got cold and rainy in washington dc nobody wanted icecold root beer the customers my father still had said “hey you better get something hot in here to eat or you’re going to be out of business” fortunately my folks lived next to the mexican embassy my mother spoke a little spanish and befriended the chef at the embassy he gave her his secret recipe for chili and hot tamales my father put up a new sign over the aw root beer stand that read “hot shoppe” and mother prepared their new mexican recipes they served root beer hot tamales and chili in what was now a “real” restaurant it was a very explosive menu but it worked and provided the foundation for one of the largest restaurant chains in the eastern united states watch the details my parents taught me my brother and their employees to watch the details of the business i have vivid memories of visiting the hot shoppes as a small boy in their book in search of excellence thomas peters and robert waterman were right on target when they wrote about management by walking around you cannot run a service business without walking around and seeing what’s going on in the operation you can’t be in the office looking at the books all day and know what’s really happening with your customers my father would go out and talk to the customers talk to the employees and inspect the units he believed that you can’t expect what you don’t inspect if you ask somebody to do something and never go back to check and see if it’s done it might get done the first time but it probably won’t get done thereafter you’ve got to get out there check and make sure your associates follow through on their commitments and let them know you will be checking then you must show appreciation to people for doing a good job if they’re not doing a good job explain how to do the job properly and give them encouragement expect perfection expect perfection and don’t cut corners if you cut corners somebody will find out and it’s usually one of your best customers my father’s inspections included tasting all the food checking the temperatures of both the food and the equipment looking for dirt under and behind every piece of equipment and talking to the customers he always said that you can’t be happy with an  percent positive customer response—it’s not good enough he said you can’t spill coffee on  percent of your customers and expect to be successful in the restaurant business you must expect  percent satisfaction you may not achieve it the first time or the second time but it should always be the goal you are striving for and the expectation you convey to your employees and your customers lead a balanced life don’t let your work hurt your family relations success is a lot more assured if your mind is free from family problems if you’re happy at home there’s a much greater chance of being happy at work be active in your church spiritual strength can be a great help don’t underestimate the value of being moved by the spirit when difficult decisions come we need help and it’s not always in the textbook and it’s not always with your associates oftentimes we have to ask our heavenly father for help and he’s willing to give it to us if we are living the commandments and are in tune with the spirit be active in the community give back to the community it makes you feel good it makes your associates and employees feel good and have respect for you it builds loyalty and morale the customers love it it’s a winwin situation one of the basic tenets of the gospel is to serve the lord and your fellow beings public service is an essential element of the society in which we live it is a moral responsibility we must accept in order to live our lives successfully and be faithful to god’s teaching address issues injustices and inequalities that are present in our communities and
