hightech material and superior design is the bat to beat the competition with specifically for downhole pump products such as sucker rods tubing and fracking balls we will have a strength cost and survivability advantage over steel and first generation composite products the depths that pumping equipment go to now almost preclude the use of steel it does not have the strength to support its weight at these super long lengths capturing market share based on a superior product is the focus but the capacity constraints of suppliers to the pumpers will enhance our position to a quicker entry and a larger presence company description fairwind energy inc is a development stage company we were incorporated under the laws of the state of nevada on april   we are involved in the design engineering and manufacturing of composite products the initial thrust of our business will be to supply products to the oil and gas industry these products will include upstream production products such as sucker rods fracking plugs casings and other products where high temperature resistance chemical resistance and a low weight to strength ratio products offer advantages to traditional materials eg  steel if we are able to supply products to the oil and gas industry then we plan to continue the development and sales of wind and solar hybrid energy systems these systems also benefit from the use of higher performance materials composites and we will intend to incorporate them in product design and development through its proprietary use of materials and manufacturing technique fairwind energy is developing power sources drawing from renewable energy supply we also use our trade secrets and composite industry knowhow to crossmarket products into the oil  gas extraction industry providing a reliable power source based on renewable energies required us to address shortcomings of existing technologies ranging from availability of supply ie solar power at night to quality of componentry available blades stanchions magnets the hybridization of power sources solar and wind and manufacturing with next generation composite materials is our solution in a priority project we are currently near developmental completion of a high strength high tg high temperature use composite designed and intended to be used in the oil  gas industry intended for use in the exploration and production sector we have manufactured nearly  feet of “sucker rod” used to be use in connection with the extraction of oil and gas from underground the employed design uses proprietary resin systems that exceed typical temperature use limits of competing thermosetting systems additionally utilizing higher tensile strength reinforcements our parts can achieve higher operating loads allowing for superior performance new designs for mechanical joints in the rod string have also been completed significant testing has been completed on the final design and will be continuing we believe that the testing marks we have achieved to date are a result of the high performance materials and architecture of the product our intended business operations will be to make use of our proprietary resin systems and unique composite architecture and apply that to other areas with proof of concept via physical and field trial testing in hand we will proceed to apply the proven benefits see above in other infrastructure projects two examples that are currently in the examination stage include pultruded power poles suitable for supporting high voltage electrical transmission lines another early stage endeavor is second generation composite strength members for cable and conductor as a replacement to more typical construction materials eg steel aluminum concrete and even lower performing frp – we believe that our composite parts mix the benefits of strength weight corrosion resistance nonconductivity and high temperature operation another project in current development is a hybrid power generating system incorporating both solar and wind power initially we have purchased wind turbines and are in the process of combining them with solar panels the first planned demonstration project will be to power streetparking lot lighting the potential to independently operate off battery stored power or to backfeed into the grid is possible after vetting the poc prototypes we intend to combine alreadyestablished supply chain lines for componentry with inhouse manufactured composite elements eg see power poles above this hybrid power project gives us
