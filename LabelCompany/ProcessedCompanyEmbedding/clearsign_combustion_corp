simple preengineered and standardized direct burner replacement solution for traditional refinery heaters where duplex™ technology can be applied to great benefit unlike existing burner solutions the evolution of duplex technology into an offtheshelf product reduces the customized engineering associated with typical retrofits while delivering unparalleled low emissions and the elimination of flame impingement the plug  play design is ideal for vertical process heaters and can be configured for a variety of gaseous fuels including natural gas refinery fuels and field or waste gas this unique “plug  play” design can be easily retrofitted to replace existing burners and can be inserted into an existing burner opening even while the heater is operational — onthefly and without the need for a costly shutdown duplex plug  play™ brings nox levels to below  ppm and eliminates flame impingement on process and shock tubes as well as burnerto burner interaction problems common among typical lowemission burners performance is achieved without the use of socalled “staged combustion” excess air catalyst flue gas recirculation or other similar methods for reducing nox and co emissions within industrial fired heaters its cleanduplex technology is the simplest solution on the market for reducing nox to less than ppm while improving all other critical performance factors its efficientunlike traditional burner technology duplex is the only combustion solution that improves system efficiency its low costduplex technology is by far the lowestcost method of reducing emissions from combustion sources it comprises a simple retrofit let us install the duplex system solution duplex™ technology offers scrlevel performance at a fraction of the cost california dreaming joe colannino and roberto ruiz clearsign combustion usa introduce an innovative piece of technology that was able to help a californian refinery reduce its nox emissions in the july  issue of hydrocarbon engineering click here to read the entire article be sure not to miss this issue of oilgas journal mar   volume  dr roberto ruiz and dr donald kendrick publish the findings of clearsign’s breakthrough duplex™ technology over a week evaluation period at a california refinery click the image above or here to view the entire article a simple innovative approach to combustion systems how do we do it the secret of duplex technology lies in the thousands of small chambers that make up a duplex tile each holds a tiny flame burning with far more efficiency than a single large flame the result is a more efficient radiant heat profile that eases stress on burner parts while improving combustion efficiency and increasing maximum throughput potential the duplex tiles radiate uniform heat the roar of the turbulent flame becomes a whisper and harmful gases and particulates are prevented from ever forming in the first place duplex is the most capable and beneficial combustion technology on the market a typical burner configuration produces a turbulent cloud of fire inside the flame cloud the mix of oxygen to fuel is inconsistent throughout resulting in relatively poor combustion and the production of undesirable gases and particulates dangerous hotspots can form within the chamber and stress burner parts it is not uncommon for stressed parts to fail catastrophically and risk injury or death repairs can take weeks due to this risk maintenance must be performed frequently however each shutdown period is costly in terms of manpower equipment and lost productivity at clearsign we wanted to find a way to reduce criteria emissions while addressing the challenge of cost inefficiency and maintenance downtime we did just that and you’re going to love our solution by contrast duplex products improve the airtofuel mix by greatly expanding the mixing zone for optimal performance the combustion that occurs within the duplex tiles is much more complete as a result duplex technology reduces nox emissions to levels that meet or beat the most stringent environmental regulations found anywhere in the world since the duplex technology operates as a black or grey body heat is radiated more efficiently than a raw flame therefore unlike a typical burner flame heat is radiated in a manner that will never impinge upon furnace process tubes resulting in fewer maintenance cycles fewer outages and more production duplex technology is the first of a series of clearsign developed platforms that virtually eliminate criteria pollutants while increasing operational efficiency in industrial combustion applications reduce pollutionprevent harmful gases and particulates from ever forming in the first place reduce maintenanceeasier on your equipment and requires fewer maintenance cycles improve performanceeliminate costly downstream equipment that cuts into your bottom line return on investmentduplex is the only combustion system that pays for itself period press releases
