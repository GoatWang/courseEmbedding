actively managed exchangetraded fund etf on february   that is designed to give investors exposure primarily to investment grade bonds the first trust tcw opportunistic fixed income etf nasdaq fixd the fund seeks to maximize longterm total return using a value driven approach the fund is subadvised and managed by tcw investment management company llc tcw or subadvisor the fund is a multisector portfolio that provides exposure to core and satellite fixed income assets under normal market conditions the fund will seek to achieve its investment objective by investing at least  of its net assets including investment borrowings in fixed income securities of any credit quality and may invest up to  of its net assets in securities rated below investment grade tcw takes a very careful and deliberate approach to new product development and we could not be more pleased to launch this fund with an industryleading partner like first trust said steve kane portfolio manager at tcw given the increased market demand for actively managed fixed income etfs we believe this offering will provide another means for investors to access our teambased value approach to managing fixed income portfolios unlike passive indexing strategies tcws active approach focuses on generating alpha primarily through sector allocation and security selection the investment process comprises additional strategies including careful duration management yield curve positioning and opportunistic trade execution the result is a portfolio that is diversified not only in a traditional sense across maturities sectors and securities but also across strategies that provide the opportunity to seek higher riskadjusted returns tcws fixed income management philosophy reflects a goal of consistently outperforming the broader bond market over full market cycles while maintaining below average volatility with an emphasis on capital preservation particularly in rising interest rate environments we believe fixed income markets provide significant opportunities for active managers to add value said ryan issakainen cfa senior vice president and etf strategist for first trust tcw is a world class

this and other information about the fund the prospectus or summary prospectus should be read carefully before investingetf characteristicsthe fund will list and principally trade its shares on the nasdaq stock market llcinvestors buying or selling fund shares on the secondary market may incur customary brokerage commissions market prices may differ to some degree from the net asset value of the shares investors who sell fund shares may receive less than the share’s net asset value shares may be sold throughout the day on the exchange through any brokerage account however unlike mutual funds shares may only be redeemed directly from the fund by authorized participants in very large creationredemption units if the funds authorized participants are unable to proceed with creationredemption orders and no other authorized participant is able to step forward to create or redeem fund shares may trade at a discount to the funds net asset value and possibly face delistingrisk considerationsthe fund’s shares will change in value and you could lose money by investing in the fund one of the principal risks of investing in the fund is market risk market risk is the risk that a particular security owned by the fund fund shares or securities in general may fall in valuethe fund is subject to credit risk call risk income risk interest rate risk and prepayment risk credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security will be unable or unwilling to make dividend interest andor principal payments when due and that the value of a security may decline as a result credit risk is heightened for the floating rate loans in which the fund invests because companies that issue such loans tend to be highly leveraged and thus are more susceptible to the risks of interest deferral default andor bankruptcy call risk is the risk that if an issuer calls higheryielding debt instruments held by the fund performance could be adversely impacted income risk is the risk that income from the fund’s fixed income investments could decline during periods of falling interest rates interest rate risk is the risk that the value of the fixed income securities in the fund will decline because of rising market interest rates prepayment risk is the risk that during periods of falling interest rates an issuer may exercise its right to pay principal on an obligation earlier than expected this may result in a decline in the fund’s incomecertain of the fixedincome securities in the fund may not have the benefit of covenants which could reduce the ability of the issuer to meet its payment obligations and might result in increased credit riskhighyield securities or “junk” bonds are subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of loss than securities with higher ratings and therefore may be highly speculative these securities are issued by companies that may have limited operating history narrowly focused operations andor other impediments to the timely payment of periodic interest and principal at maturity lower quality debt tends to be less liquid than higher quality debtthe risks associated with senior loans are similar to the risks of highyield fixed income instruments the loans are usually rated below investment grade but may also be unrated upon a prepayment either in part or in full the actual outstanding debt on which the fund derives interest income will be reduced the fund may not be able to reinvest the proceeds received on terms as favorable as the prepaid loanmortgagerelated securities including mortgagebacked securities are more susceptible to adverse economic political or regulatory events that affect the value of real estate mortgagerelated securities are subject to the risk that the rate of mortgage prepayments decreases which extends the average life of a security and increases the interest rate exposurein a falling inflationary environment both interest payments and the value of treasury inflation protected securities tips will declinesecurities issued or guaranteed by federal agencies and us government sponsored instrumentalities may or may not be backed by the full faith and credit of the us governmentcollateralized loan obligations clos carry additional risks including the possibility that distributions from collateral securities will not be adequate to make interest or other payments the quality of the collateral may decline in value or default the possibility that the investments in clos are subordinate to other classes or tranches and the complex structure of the security may not be fully understood at the time of investment and may produce disputes with the issuer or unexpected investment resultsthe use of options and other derivatives can lead to losses because of adverse movements in the price or value of the underlying asset index or rate which may be magnified by certain features of the derivatives these risks are heightened when the fund’s portfolio managers use derivatives to enhance the fund’s returns or as a substitute for a position or security rather than solely to hedge or offset the risk of a position or security held by the fundif a counterparty defaults on its payment obligations the fund will lose money and the value of an investment in fund shares may decreaseas the use of internet technology has become more prevalent in the course of business the fund has become more susceptible to potential operational risks through breaches in cyber securitynonus securities are subject to higher volatility than securities of domestic issuers due to possible adverse political social or economic developments restrictions on foreign investment or exchange of securities lack of liquidity currency exchange rates excessive taxation government seizure of assets different legal or accounting standards and less government supervision and regulation of exchanges in foreign countries these risks may be heightened for securities of companies located in or with significant operations in emerging market countries changes in currency exchange rates and the relative value of nonus currencies will affect the value of the fund’s investment and the value of fund shares because the fund’s net asset value is determined on the basis of us dollars you may lose money if the local currency of a foreign market depreciates against the us dollarinvestments in sovereign bonds involve special risks because the governmental authority that controls the repayment of the debt may be unwilling or unable to repay the principal andor interest when due in times of economic uncertainty the prices of these securities may be more volatile than those of corporate debt obligations or of other government debt obligationsilliquid securities involve the risk that the securities will not be able to be sold at the time desired by the fund or at prices approximately the value at which the fund is carrying the securities on its booksthe fund is classified as “nondiversified” and may invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in a limited number of issuers as a result the fund may be more susceptible to a single adverse economic or regulatory occurrence affecting one or more of these issuers experience increased volatility and be highly concentrated in certain issuersthe fund’s creation units will generally be issued and redeemed for cash and in certain circumstances inkind for securities in which the fund invests as a result the fund may be less tax efficientthe fund currently has fewer assets than larger more established funds and like other relatively new funds large inflows and outflows may impact the fund’s market exposure for limited periods of timethe fund is subject to management risk because it is an actively managed portfolio in managing the fund’s investment portfolio the subadvisor will apply investment techniques and risk analyses that may not have the desired result there can be no guarantee that the fund

the securities in the index may be substantially different from those in the fund morningstar analyst rating disclosure the morningstar analyst rating is not a credit or risk rating it is a subjective evaluation performed by the mutual fund analysts of morningstar inc morningstar evaluates funds based on five key pillars which are process performance people parent and price morningstar’s analysts use this five pillar evaluation to identify funds they believe are more likely to outperform over the long term on a riskadjusted basis analysts consider quantitative and qualitative factors in their research and the weighting of each pillar may vary the analyst rating ultimately reflects the analyst’s overall assessment and is overseen by morningstar’s analyst rating committee the approach serves not as a formula but as a framework to ensure consistency across morningstar’s global coverage universe the analyst rating scale ranges from gold to negative with gold being the highest rating and negative being the lowest rating a fund with a “gold” rating distinguishes itself across the five pillars and has garnered the analysts’ highest level of conviction a fund with a ‘silver’ rating has notable advantages across several but perhaps not all of the five pillarsstrengths that give the analysts a high level of conviction a “bronze”rated fund has advantages that outweigh the disadvantages across the five pillars with sufficient level of analyst conviction to warrant a positive rating a fund with a ‘neutral’ rating isn’t seriously flawed across the five pillars nor does it distinguish itself very positively a “negative” rated fund is flawed in at least one if not more pillars and is considered an inferior offering to its peers analyst ratings are reevaluated at least every  months the morningstar analyst rating should not be used as the sole basis in evaluating a mutual fund morningstar analyst ratings involve unknown risks and uncertainties which may cause morningstar’s expectations not to occur or to differ significantly from what we expectedmorningstar rating disclosure the morningstar ratingtm for funds or “star rating” is calculated for managed products including mutual funds variable annuity and variable life subaccounts exchangetraded funds closedend funds and separate accounts with at least a threeyear history exchangetraded funds and openended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes it is calculated based on a morningstar riskadjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product’s monthly excess performance placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance the top  of products in each product category receive  stars the next  receive  stars the next  receive  stars the next  receive  stars and the bottom  receive  star the overall morningstar rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three five and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics the weights are  threeyear rating for  months of total returns  fiveyear rating threeyear rating for  months of total returns and  year rating fiveyear rating threeyear rating for  or more months of total returns while the year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the year period the most recent threeyear
