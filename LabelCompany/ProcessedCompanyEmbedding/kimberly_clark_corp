alexander  kimberlyclark corp thank you and good morning everyone welcome to kimberlyclarks second quarter earnings conference call with us this morning are tom falk chairman and ceo mike hsu president and chief operating officer and maria henry our cfo heres the agenda for the call tom will start with some opening comments about the current environment maria will then review our second quarter results and after that tom will provide his perspectives on our results and the outlook for the year and well finish with qa as usual we have a presentation of todays materials in the investors section of our website as a reminder well be making forwardlooking statements today please see the risk factors section of our latest annual report on form k for further information lastly well be comparing our  results to  adjusted results which exclude certain items described in this mornings news release and now ill turn it over to tom thomas j falk  kimberlyclark corp thanks paul and good morning everyone before maria gives you some of the details on the quarter i thought i would comment on how i see the environment overall and then how were approaching it so while i remain optimistic about our longterm future the nearterm environment has become more challenging than maybe we saw at the beginning of the year so category growth has slowed broadly in lots of places over the last year or so and we expect that growth will pick back up over time but that pickup may not happen quickly in the meantime competitive activity has increased including higher spending in north america over the last  months so in this environment we continue to focus on what we think are the fundamentals that create longterm shareholder value that means were continuing to invest behind our brands by launching innovation pursuing targeted growth initiatives and then supporting our brands with strong marketing campaigns at the same time we finetune some of our promotion strategies and we have a heightened focus on delivering more cost savings and tightly controlling our discretionary spending in an environment like this were also continuing to manage our company with financial discipline and allocate capital in shareholderfriendly ways so in short we continue to execute our strategies for longterm success and we are adjusting our nearterm plans as we operate in a more difficult environment and with that ill turn it over to maria for a review of our second quarter results maria g henry  kimberlyclark corp thanks tom good morning everyone let me start with the headlines for the quarter sales and earnings were down slightly reflecting a challenging environment as tom just described and comparison to strong results last year we delivered significant cost savings in the quarter and weve increased our full year cost savings outlook and finally were on track with our overall capital plan now lets take a look at the details starting with sales our second quarter net sales were  billion thats down  yearonyear due to lower organic sales tom is going to provide some more color on our top line in just a few minutes on profitability second quarter gross margin was  thats down  basis points yearonyear operating margin was  down  basis points while margins were down slightly overall im encouraged with the improvements that we achieved in our personal care and kc professional business segments and also in the developing and emerging markets overall commodities were a  million drag in the second quarter and for the full year were now expecting inflation of  million to  million thats  million higher than our previous estimate driven by higher pulp costs our teams continued to deliver significant force cost savings second quarter savings were  million and weve increased our full year savings target to  million to  million our original target was for savings of at least  million given the current environment we are also tightly managing our overhead spending on the bottom line second quarter earnings per share were  down  yearonyear lower equity income reduced earnings by  per share offset by a lower share count and a slightly better effective tax rate now lets take a look at cash flow cash provided by operations in the second quarter was  million in line with our expectations cash flow was down compared to  million in the yearago quarter including the impact of higher tax payments this year second quarter working capital cash conversion cycle was down six days compared to full year  bringing the yeartodate decline to five days were making very good progress in this area and we expect to nicely exceed our original oneday improvement target for the full year we also continue to manage capital spending in this environment and we now expect that full year spending will be in the lower half of our  million to  million target range on capital allocation second quarter dividend payments and share repurchases totaled more than  million we continue to expect that full year dividends and share repurchases will total between  billion and  billion looking at our segments in personal care organic sales fell  due to lower net selling prices organic sales were up  in developing and emerging markets but were down elsewhere personal care operating margins were  up  basis points the improvement was driven by cost savings partially offset by lower selling prices and higher input costs in consumer tissue organic sales were down  driven by north america overall consumer tissue operating margins were  down  basis points the results were impacted by lower sales and higher pulp costs in kc professional organic sales in the quarter were up  with gains in all major geographies kc professional operating margins were  up  basis points the comparison included benefits from cost savings so in summary our second quarter results were impacted by difficult environment with weaker economies category softness and increased competitive activity nonetheless we are achieving strong cost savings were generating healthy cash flow and were allocating capital in shareholderfriendly ways ill now turn the call back over to tom thomas j falk  kimberlyclark corp thanks maria ill provide more detail on our top line sales and market conditions and then ill address our fullyear outlook as maria just mentioned our organic sales were down  in the quarter as were operating in a challenging growth environment in our consumer businesses in north america organic sales fell by  that were impacted by category softness lower promotional shipments and higher competitive activity just for perspective in the categories that we compete in in north america the total market declined by about  in the quarter looking at our businesses in north america personal care volumes were off  in the infant and child care mega category our volumes were down midsingle digits beyond tough comparisons results were impacted by competitive activity and lower category demand which is down about  yeartodate following last years  decline in the us growth rate on the other hand volumes were up midsingledigits in baby wipes and low singledigits in adult care in adult care were introducing an improved depend product this quarter and were increasing marketing and promotion support to help drive more growth in this category our consumer tissue volumes were down  and that compares to a  growth in the base period wed expect some better performance in consumer tissue in the back half of the year as we got a stronger promotional calendar planned and were making some targeted promotion changes on kleenex facial tissue turning to developed markets outside of north america organic sales were down  in the second quarter sales were down in personal care in south korea where the diaper category is being impacted by a pretty significant decline in the birth rate we expect results to pick up some in the second half of the year as we got some diaper and feminine care product upgrades in the market and were also relaunching our baby wipes business there volumes were also down in the quarter in consumer tissue in western and central europe reflecting a continued challenging environment there moving to developing and emerging markets organic sales were up  in the second quarter for the first half of the year organic sales have increased by  with volume growth of more than  so im encouraged by our volume performance and overall were largely on track with our plans in these markets looking at second quarter performance in some of our key markets in china organic sales in diapers were similar yearonyear as higher volumes and improved mix were offset by lower selling prices and while competitive activity picked up somewhat in the second quarter we continue to be optimistic that pricing wont be as negative in china this year as it was last year we launched several innovations in china in the second quarter and going forward we plan to continue to focus on driving winning product solutions behind our huggies brand moving to brazil organic sales in personal care were down high singledigits compared to a  increase in the yearago period through six months organic sales in brazil are similar yearonyear which is probably a better indicator of our underlying trends while category volumes are still down in brazil our volumes were up mid singledigits aided by innovation and changes to our promotional strategies there in argentina organic sales in personal care were up midteens driven by higher selling prices although category volumes are still down pretty significantly our volumes are up somewhat following the relaunch of huggies diapers earlier this year and then lastly in eastern europe our organic sales in diapers rose about  as our teams there delivered another doubledigit volume increase this quarter weve also recently introduced several innovations on huggies in russia to help us drive even more growth now beyond our sales performance ill just briefly build on marias comments to say that i am encouraged with the force cost savings our improvements in working capital and the cash weve been able to return to shareholders in the first half of the year now turning to our outlook in terms of our full year targets we expect organic sales will be similar or up slightly yearonyear our prior assumption was for growth of  to  we still expect growth in the second half of the year to pick up somewhat from the first half and thats largely due to easier comparisons along with benefits from innovations and other steps were taking to improve our performance on the bottom line we expect that earnings per share will be at the low end of our target range of  to  that reflects our new outlook for organic sales and cost inflation along with additional cost savings some overhead spending reductions and a slightly lower effective tax rate our priorities for the second half of the year are as follows first to execute on our brand fundamentals with excellence to make sure we improve our top line performance second to deliver cost savings to help keep our margins healthy and third and finally to generate strong cash flow our teams are very focused on these priorities and our plan is to deliver sales and earnings growth in the back half of the year beyond the near term over the long term were committed to continuing our long track record of making changes to improve our company so that we achieve success for our brands for our businesses and for our shareholders that wraps up our prepared remarks and now well begin to take your questions questionandanswer session operator our first question comes from lauren lieberman with barclays lauren rae lieberman  barclays capital inc thanks good morning thomas j falk  kimberlyclark corp hey good morning lauren lauren rae lieberman  barclays capital inc i wanted to talk a little bit about the competitive environment in north america you called out across the consumer businesses is it one primarily from branded players is it private label and then also just how retailers are kind of playing into all of that or stimulating the change in the environment thomas j falk  kimberlyclark corp yeah ill give you a couple of comments and maybe mike can give a little bit more color i mean i think the answer is probably all of the above when you have weaker category growth overall and you have about the same number of people fighting over it you can see that play out and there is no question there is channel shifting going on as ecommerce grows and thats putting pressure on lots of retailers maybe mike has some other comments to add michael d hsu  kimberlyclark corp no i definitely agree with that lauren id say its probably certainly branded players and then also private labels have an effect too i would say north america is always competitive but we are really focused on the fundamentals that we need to bring which is innovation creating longerterm shareholder value we are really focused on building the categories and so we got a really strong lineup of winning products out there right now but we got to really finetune whats in our current marketing plans and promotions to improve our competitiveness in the market were also focused on as tom mentioned earlier improving our instore execution in the second half lauren rae lieberman  barclays capital inc and with instore execution and you mentioned kind of promotional adjustments it feels like a lot of your category volume maybe less so for tissue but more in personal care is sort of naturally shifting more online so how effective do you feel like for the focus on instore is there things that youre also doing to better position your businesses online right we know amazon has – we know theyve made their push in diapers and wipes and it looks like wipes is probably the piece thats had some success so what are you also doing from an online standpoint not just instore thomas j falk  kimberlyclark corp yeah i mean instore to us i guess broadly means whatever mom wants to shop so thats a traditional bricksandmortar retail or an online retail so its making sure you got the right items in distribution the right pricing the right merchandising support michael d hsu  kimberlyclark corp yeah weve got a lot of resources focused on driving online growth and working with our customers on their online strategies and obviously all of our customers or many of our customers are working towards the same end i would say were making pretty good progress in growing online still the majority of our business is still sold offline but were making good progress but not satisfied with our online performance but id say bringing us back to the offline portion i think if you characterize our first half we were going up against a very strong comp in the first half last year and some of our promotion plans kind of were balanced more tilted towards the second half this year so we are expecting much stronger performance in the back half particularly of our family care business with promotions lauren rae lieberman  barclays capital inc okay thank you thomas j falk  kimberlyclark corp thanks lauren operator our next question comes from ali dibadj with bernstein ali dibadj  sanford c bernstein  co llc hey guys thomas j falk  kimberlyclark corp hey ali ali dibadj  sanford c bernstein  co llc so i have a few questions one is just on organic sales obviously they continue to be challenging clearly more challenging than we last talked but you also say that you expect the top line to grow again im trying to understand the underlying reasoning for that and i guess more specifically is that the conclusion from mikes strategic review that you said he was doing or is that yet to come really thinking about the longterm  to  organic sales growth target and if thats not the conclusion from that review when should we get that verdict and then also want to talk about margins almost in a similar vein i mean force has done just extraordinarily well for you guys obviously continuing to do so and now raising it recently the target for this year can you give us a sense of how much of that needs to be reinvested and where exactly are the savings coming from in particular because youre seeing consumer tissue margins fall so much this quarter should we be thinking about cost cutting not coming from there anymore force not coming from there anymore and kind of consumer tissue margins being past peak thomas j falk  kimberlyclark corp yeah well i think i got a lot of those so on the top line i mean a lot of it is if you look at our north american business and paul you can check me on the numbers i think first half last year we were up  in the back half we were flat paul j alexander  kimberlyclark corp correct thomas j falk  kimberlyclark corp so just the comp will lead you more to growth naturally just as we continue with the rate that were on so i think the things thats probably different than on our top line look overall is the category declines really some of the birthrate declines both in north america and in places like korea you can still see category weakness in some of the latin american markets although some of the more recent data has been a little bit more encouraging on that front in terms of the strategic review i mean i wouldnt say any of what were talking about today is related to that i mean the strategic review is tending to look longterm and we still see the category potential in all of our categories as the developing and emerging markets grow but how quickly we get to that future and the environment that were in is still something that were taking a look at coming back to force i dont know maria if you want to comment on cost savings maria g henry  kimberlyclark corp yeah we do continue to deliver significant cost savings through the force program and we were able to take up the full year target and what id say is that as the program name implies our teams really are focused on reducing costs everywhere when you look at our supply chain savings that includes improving productivity and waste across our manufacturing operations driving down the cost of our facilities optimizing the cost of our product specifications and continually negotiating lower input costs or material costs of our products and yeartodate we are at  of cost of goods which is really a strong performance not only internally but benchmarks very well i continue to see opportunities for us to continue to deliver the force cost savings as we move forward so good performance there and i think more opportunity there thomas j falk  kimberlyclark corp yeah we come back to the reinvestment rate if you look at the cost savings we generated relative to the commodity costs and other things that hit us i mean you can see that even though we had a great cost savings quarter we still had gross margins that were down because of lower pricing and higher commodity costs so and the biggest single factor in the tissue margins was pulp price change yearoveryear and the force cost savings probably fell a little bit more in the personal care segment this quarter which is where the margin improvement occurred ali dibadj  sanford c bernstein  co llc if i can go back to sort of the strategic review tom you mentioned in your remarks were committed to making the changes to improve our company going forward is that something thats also being thought through in the strategic review and what i mean by that is when do we get confirmation about  to  organic sales growth top line not to put too much pressure on you mike but when do we get confirmation on that or a different number and also are you going to tell us about perhaps some other changes like how you are in europe pc maybe a bigger breakup for example the company or something i mean is there a timeframe for us to be thinking about when you guys would tell us mike the outcome of your strategic review and whether it touches all those elements thomas j falk  kimberlyclark corp yeah ali i think your plan for the strategic review might be a little more glorious than what were looking at i mean really what mike and his team are trying to do and he can kind of add some comment to it as well as to say what are the things we need to do to really unlock the potential of our business in china or how do we grow our adult care business everywhere when we see the huge opportunity there and to kind of take us to the next level of performance and how our company operates and realizes the potential that we see in our categories everywhere so thats under way its more about probably how we work together and use the matrix inside the company its not a portfolio analysis as you would have described it ali dibadj  sanford c bernstein  co llc got it okay go ahead mike michael d hsu  kimberlyclark corp id just add that yeah were certainly excited about the longterm development growth of our categories we do believe were operating in some of the fastestgrowing categories because of our de potential longer term and so were really focused on category development and internally we call it development of the white space for us but we also recognize that the last couple of years have been a little slower and so we are working to see hey when do we get back onto that track that said probably and you may not find earth shattering news from us but its probably going to result in greater focus and more intentional development of some of our categories and geographies ali dibadj  sanford c bernstein  co llc got it so we shouldnt expect anything like in analyst day or presentation or anything that was all right i also thought thats what is going to come out of this but it sounds like no michael d hsu  kimberlyclark corp we give you our  guidance well give you an update on where were at at that stage so ali dibadj  sanford c bernstein  co llc okay thanks very much thomas j falk  kimberlyclark corp thanks ali operator our next question comes from jason english with goldman sachs thomas j falk  kimberlyclark corp hey jason jason english  goldman sachs  co hey hey good morning folks thanks for the question i guess i want to pick up on alis line of questioning because i think his line of questioning was very much focused in terms of the longterm trajectory and the intrinsic value of the company and i think thats important because as ive had lots of conversations from investors theres really been two sticking points for people one is the path to return to the type of growth that you used to be able to realize in personal care and the second is the glide path to where margins can go in tissue and professional particularly with the consternation of private label price aggression so i was hoping you could delve in a little bit more deeply there you mentioned category growth has slowed can you give us some more context around what you think the drivers are and what levers may be there to get us back to reacceleration and then a little bit deeper on the consumer tissue side the results today are likely to do nothing other than sort of fuel those concerns with margins sort of rolling in that business pricing under pressure despite input cost inflation is there reason to believe that private label competitive dynamics in that market are indeed going to be ratcheted a lot higher on the forward and likely going to be causing some – a minimal cap on margins there if not some downward pressure thomas j falk  kimberlyclark corp okay a lot of questions jason well do the best we can on those so coming back to the growth path and some of the drivers of weaker categories i mean in personal care and baby and child care in particular its been birthraterelated in a lot of the developed markets so we had kind of projected  was going to be a flat birthrate year in the second quarter we got the final fourth quarter numbers that showed it down  for the fourth quarter which brought the full year down  so that obviously has caused category growth to be weaker than we wouldve anticipated going into  koreas birthrate i think we got the final  numbers was down  which is a pretty big big drop so i think there is potentially lots of reasons we dont really understand it at a deep enough consumer insight level id say but a broad trend is that millennials are having their children a little later as long as they have the same number were in good shape because the category growth will return you have to go through the adjustment while that age shift happens from a demographic standpoint so i think in latin america weve seen some of the negative category growth and thats really economically driven because of some of the economic recession with gdp per capita going backwards in places like brazil and argentina id say in the last couple of share periods in brazil weve seen a little bit more positive category growth and things seem to be returning more to an equilibrium there argentina is still a little bit volatile were seeing negative category trends and positive pricing trends and so thats putting a lot of pressure on the consumer in other markets where youre seeing some category negatives were places that had big currency swings last year and where we took pricing and some of that pricing has come back out of the market this year that would be markets like russia and other key markets in eastern europe so probably a bunch of things happening some demographic some economic that put pressure on our categories in the first half of the year on tissue margins i mean good progress on kcp in the quarter and continue to see opportunity there as that business builds around the world on consumer tissue its probably always going to be a little bit more volatile and affected by pulp prices weve seen good progress lately over the last couple of years we were kind of asked where can it go from there and we thought that highteens was kind of the right place for consumer tissue to land in the near to medium term and if i look at our yeartodate margins in consumer tissue i think its  so we are in the ballpark it was a little lower than that in the second quarter thats usually a light facial tissue quarter and we had a little bit higher pulp prices so id say were not concerned about the current tissue trends privatelabel shares as you mentioned are up a tick in towels but havent seen a lot of share movement on private label really anywhere at this stage so i dont know if that covers most of what you had jason i think so jason english  goldman sachs  co yeah i think so and it was a loaded question so i will be respectful of others people time and pass it on thomas j falk  kimberlyclark corp thanks jason operator our next question comes from olivia tong with bank of america merrill lynch olivia tong  bank of america merrill lynch great thanks good morning first in terms of baby and child care promotion i mean how much of this is being funded by you versus the retailer maybe can you talk about north american price by sort of major product segments it looks like price was flat overall but i imagine there is a fair bit of difference in your segment and i know you are not funding the majority of it but how are you adjusting sort of your longterm plans to help combat against an environment in which the consumer is starting to get more and more used to lower prices bigger and better deals particularly in that category thank you thomas j falk  kimberlyclark corp yes i mean you are right olivia retailers determine the final finished products selling price in north america and thats the way its always been and so we go to market with a consistent trade deal and then our customers decide how they want to apply those funds and whether they want to invest some of their own funds to attract the young family into their retail environment and thats kind of been the way the game has been played for a long long time and thats really not any different now it was the way walmart played as they grew and certainly some of the ecommerce players are offering hot deals to try to make sure the family gets converted to their shopping in terms of how do we flex in that environment were trying to make sure weve got a winning product proposition number one that youve got great product superiority you got good marketing and innovation coming and that youre communicating all of that to the consumer and thats changing with digital and social and all the other tools that we have but i dont know mike if you want to add any more color on that michael d hsu  kimberlyclark corp no yeah certainly olivia i think funding or you could see it in our numbers i think our price levels are comparable versus year ago i would say probably the softness that we are seeing in the category primarily is driven by retail pricing i think our overall plan though is and were not happy about the softness there is some shift into training pants and i think thats healthy for the category overall except in the way that its occurring were not happy about the impact on our polis business because some of that is being driven by the lower prices we are focused on innovation and being the category leaders and trying to drive the category to growth and that means bringing in innovation were the consumerpreferred brand strong consumer preferred brand proposition and so were really focused on category driving messaging on the training pant category and then in diapers again we continue to bring news but we are recognizing we probably need to finetune our plans to make sure and we have done that to make sure that were competitive on promotion olivia tong  bank of america merrill lynch great thanks and then i guess in terms of north american consumer tissue why do you think private labels is gaining the momentum that it is and why do you think theres so much of a push in promotion in tissue because obviously i understand the desire to winning new mom in diapers but its not as obvious in tissue thomas j falk  kimberlyclark corp yeah i think that in some ways ive got kind of the privatelabel shares here across our business if you looked at it it was up a tick versus the previous quarter and probably paper towels is the area where weve seen the most share growth generally and if you think about it theres relatively low cost of product failure in the paper towel category so if the towel doesnt work you take another one as opposed to personal care where if the diaper leaks or the fem pad leaks youve got a major problem and so i think thats probably been part of it michael d hsu  kimberlyclark corp yeah and olivia i think the thing that well say is tissue just like diapers they tend to be strong traffic drivers for the retailers and so thats why youre probably seeing some intensified activity there i think given whats going on in the economy and the retail environment there are some external factors that are kind of tailwinds for privatelabel expansion however we do believe that retailers when theyre competing compete more effectively and successfully with national brands because of that value proposition thats more transparent to brands and so we really feel like our job is to bring the innovation and the categorydriving messaging and you dont have to look further than what weve done in adult care i think if you looked  years ago i think the category had been inverted we lost our leading share position to private label the team went back to the brand foundations and really focused on bringing valueadded news like real fit and i think thats driven over doubledigit share increases in that period and got us back to the right leadership and the right category expansion profile so we recognize given the economy youre going to see some of this fluctuation but were focused on bringing innovation and the right messaging for the category olivia tong  bank of america merrill lynch got it and if i can just sneak in one more on feminine care can you talk a little bit about the trends post the launch of u by kotex because at least from the tracked channel data it doesnt look like much has changed so far thomas j falk  kimberlyclark corp are you asking about fitness olivia tong  bank of america merrill lynch yes thomas j falk  kimberlyclark corp yeah yeah so i think volumes were down but were lapping olivia  growth in the yearago base period so last year some of our results benefited by some promotional shipments and then some distribution gains so our market shares were flat sequentially and down a little bit versus q last year we did launch ubk fitness i think were off to a good start its on track consumer feedback is strong and were just rolling out the marketing support behind that launch right now olivia tong  bank of america merrill lynch all right thanks so much appreciate it thomas j falk  kimberlyclark corp thanks olivia operator our next question comes from bonnie herzog with wells fargo bonnie l herzog  wells fargo securities llc good morning thomas j falk  kimberlyclark corp good morning bonnie bonnie l herzog  wells fargo securities llc i have a bit of a followon question on your consumer tissue business i was hoping you could touch on some of the executional issues you called out last quarter do you guys think you did a better job in q broadly speaking and then maybe specifically do you think you did a better job of matching some of the promotions in the quarter with your displays for instance and then where are you at with your price points in your tissue business i think you guys have mentioned you wanted to sharpen those and then finally what other changes have you made to drive better growth in this business thomas j falk  kimberlyclark corp yeah bonnie couple of changes just for a couple of facts and im assuming most of those questions relate to north america so our north america volume was down  in the second quarter and thats up against a plus comp in the yearago base period so that does reflect some lower promotional shipments and stronger competitive activity that happened in the quarter q was an improvement versus our  decline in the first quarter but we still have a lot of work to do were not satisfied with our performance yet we have better activity coming up in the second half we strengthened the promotion calendar i think our field selling organization is better prepared in the second half with their events and we finetuned some of our pricing most notably on kleenex where we did take a price increase early in the year the beginning of the year and weve adjusted some of that onshelf pricing given the market conditions and were expecting better results bonnie l herzog  wells fargo securities llc okay so bottom line you think second half obviously should ramp in this specific business given things that you can control and just maybe broadly do you think the competitive environment should ease or do you expect that to still be pretty heightened thomas j falk  kimberlyclark corp dont know i dont know how to answer that but were going to focus on what we control which is improving our execution bonnie l herzog  wells fargo securities llc okay and then just maybe a quick question on china youve been lapping some easy price compares in the market now for quite some time so i guess im curious what gives you the confidence that this can improve in the second half especially i guess given that procter i think is about to finally begin rolling out a new diaper product in august i think thomas j falk  kimberlyclark corp yeah i mean i think a lot of the pricing started in the back half of last year and so i think were just going to start to lap easier price compares in the back half of this year so id say we had some benefit from mix in this quarter as we had a little heavier newborn shipments last year we still see strong underlying category growth its still a tough competitive market i dont know mike if you want to give any other color on that front michael d hsu  kimberlyclark corp yeah i think the market and the competitive environment certainly remains very active but we do think the pricing situation has eased compared to this time a year ago we remain pretty excited and confident in our china business were expecting better volume gains in the second half and for the full year behind doubledigit category growth we do have bestinclass innovation we rolled out a new tier  product earlier this year and i think thats performing very well weve got premium tier diaper pants that are out in the marketplace so i think weve got the right innovation and the right products out there and i think the team is doing a great job and i think the longterm opportunity for growth in china is huge as you know and its about five times as many births per year and the market size is depending on what numbers you want to look at comparable and so over the longterm this market is going to be much larger than the us and so weve got a lot of opportunity to grow bonnie l herzog  wells fargo securities llc okay thats helpful thank you thomas j falk  kimberlyclark corp thanks bonnie operator the next question comes from stephen powers with ubs stephen r powers  ubs securities llc great thanks so tom i think you said in your prepared remarks that you seemed happy with the developing and emerging market progress so far yeartodate relative to your plan i guess was that a volume comment or was that a comment reflective of both volume and pricing and overall organic growth thomas j falk  kimberlyclark corp yeah i mean i would say that its more directed to volume but if you look at their results overall and their sales in dollars their profit in dollars theyre tracking much closer to their plan stephen r powers  ubs securities llc okay so then trying to decompose the roundabout twopoint reduction in organic growth outlook from where we started the year is it really all related to the category volume pressures that you called out related to the us and korea in birthrates or just versus the stronger competitive environment that weve also talked about im trying to assess if its not de and its not de volumes is it just developed market volumes and birthrate that really two points or theres competition thomas j falk  kimberlyclark corp id say no theres probably two factors one is currencyrelated pricing rollback so as the dollar has weakened relative to where it was a year ago theres markets like russia where we took pretty aggressive pricing and had to roll some of that back this year youre seeing some of the same factors in brazil and then obviously theres some continued price competition in markets like china so price is one factor some of it related to a weaker dollar that is part of it and then category growth in developed markets as we discussed is probably the other factor stephen r powers  ubs securities llc okay so pricing coming back in de markets but no volume no volume no positive volume actually thomas j falk  kimberlyclark corp yeah and if you look at our decompose of this quarter it was flat volume minus  price and a lot of that price rollback was some of the markets where there were some currencydriven pricing last year stephen r powers  ubs securities llc okay to bonnies question on pgs upcoming launch have you factored any – im assuming that wasnt in your original outlook is there any incremental cushion you baked in for that or it sounds like youre kind of assuming kind of business as usual im just trying to assess if thats the case or if youve baked in some allowances there thomas j falk  kimberlyclark corp id say business as usual in china as its a competitive environment with lots of terrific product launches primarily from our japanese and other competitors and so we had assumed going in that china was going to be a competitive environment with lots of competitive launch activity and that has played out and so i would say again our team is focused on beating the best product in the market and if that is pg with this launch then that will be who were aiming at but at this point in recent times its been more the japanese players that have had significant product news that weve been up against stephen r powers  ubs securities llc okay thats fair enough and just if i could sneak in one more i asked about this last call too just want to see if were still on the same trajectory i think  million to  billion in buybacks was the outlook coming into the year you seem to be running ahead of that just want to checkpoint there and then also on interest expense you had assumed that would be down i know that youve got some august notes youre going to reissue but it also seems like you issued more debt in the quarter than i expected so whats the outlook on those two numbers as well if i could thanks maria g henry  kimberlyclark corp sure on the buyback the  million to  billion is still the right number for the year were on track with that and in terms of the interest expense we did some prefunding on the  million that comes due in august which is why you see a higher debt number at the end of the quarter but that should normalize and the debt that well take out in august is a pretty high coupon its  and so that will be replaced with lower interest rate debt and that should bring the interest expense down for the year stephen r powers  ubs securities llc okay perfect thank you so much maria g henry  kimberlyclark corp yep thomas j falk  kimberlyclark corp thanks stephen operator our next question comes from nik modi with rbc capital markets thomas j falk  kimberlyclark corp hi nik nik modi  rbc capital markets llc yeah good morning everyone good morning just two quick questions theres been a lot of commentary recently at least this earnings season from a variety of companies on the us weakening and i mean we have our own theories im just curious on kind of your assessment from the companys standpoint on whats driving the sequential deterioration and then the second question is just wanted to understand did the amount of promotions particularly in north america pickup as the quarter went on or has it been more steady thanks thomas j falk  kimberlyclark corp yeah in terms of the us category growth rate as we looked at that yearoveryear i mean the big driver is infant and child care in terms of why were down if you kind of look across the categories adult care is still growing midsingle digits baby wipes is still growing low single digits femcare is pretty flat consumer tissue is pretty flat and value of infant and child care is down  its like  volume and  price and so netnet our total categories were down  with a good chunk of it being driven by birthrate and then competitive pricing activity in baby and child care nik modi  rbc capital markets llc great and then on the promotion question thomas j falk  kimberlyclark corp promotion side i mean i wouldnt say its more competitive mike maybe you have a different view of that michael d hsu  kimberlyclark corp yeah nik no i would say comparable to the first quarter and i think well birthrate is a driver in the diaper business and there is multiple reasons for that including the hypothesis around the way in household formation there is a decline in some hispanic household births so thats one side but i think the competitive activity has been i would say at a higher level than weve experienced in recent years and that probably started in the back half of last year and has persisted through q and now q and certainly we recognize the need to adjust and fine tune our promotional plans and strategy and were doing that nik modi  rbc capital markets llc great thanks a lot thomas j falk  kimberlyclark corp thanks nik operator our next question comes from kevin grundy with jefferies kevin grundy  jefferies llc thanks good morning thomas j falk  kimberlyclark corp good morning kevin kevin grundy  jefferies llc so first question this is picking up on steves question can you quantify for us and bridge the  organic sales growth that you were targeting at the start of the year and now sort of flattish and specifically how much of it is a slowdown in the category is that a point versus how much is maybe market share losses that were not anticipated and then related to that so your guidance now suggests something like up modestly maybe up  in the back half of the year whats implied in that from an industry growth perspective and then i have a followup thanks thomas j falk  kimberlyclark corp yeah i mean i think weve probably given you about as much detail on this as i can give you im just kind of looking in january i think if you recall organic volume was up  and price was going to be similar to up slightly and now were going to tell you our volume is up slightly and price is probably going to be down slightly and so if thats helpful kevin grundy  jefferies llc its helpful but whats the expectation for the industry so in other words i mean is there an expectation that youre going to see market share in the back half of the year thomas j falk  kimberlyclark corp id say our expectation is that our share should improve relative to where we are in the first half of the year id expect the birthrate change isnt going to shift quickly so given that we had the  decline in births in the us in the fourth quarter thats going to roll over into this year and i dont think the korean birthrate that we talked about is going to turn around quickly either so i think you are going to see some of the continued drag on category and then well see where share falls out kevin grundy  jefferies llc okay and then one followup just sticking with the share question so were kind of limited here for now its a bit of a blackbox in terms of whats going on online across categories not specifically the ones that you are participating in would we draw any wrong conclusions by looking at the share trends in the nielsen data are you seeing drastically different share trends for your business online because i guess the way we look at it now its a challenging environment but the market share performance for your portfolio has certainly been difficult i mean as i look at it over the most recent  weeks youve lost market share to varying degrees across your portfolio are you seeing something similar in the online channel or is there very different dynamics going on so any commentary there would be helpful and i guess if the answer is it looks similar are investment levels appropriate now both with respect to trade investment and with respect to advertising and marketing does that need to move higher is the cost of business moving higher even while category growths are slowing so any commentary there would be helpful and thats it for me thank you thomas j falk  kimberlyclark corp yeah i think kevin certainly the offline and nonmeasured share performance is better than the measured at this point our online growth is accelerating and our shares continue to grow that said i think were not happy with our share performance in north america and we are finetuning our plans to make sure that our share performance improves in the back half kevin grundy  jefferies llc thank you operator our next question comes from faiza alwy with deutsche bank faiza alwy  deutsche bank securities inc yes hi good morning so i just had a couple of followup questions one on consumer tissue so first can you just clarify for us it looks like pulp costs have increased versus april but then it also seems like youre not really able to transfer those cost increases to retailers can you just confirm that thats just because of the retail transformation that were seeing especially in your categories and is there any expectation that that is going to change as input costs potentially continue to increase thomas j falk  kimberlyclark corp yeah theres no question pulp prices are up sequentially and our outlook is for them to moderate a bit in the back half of the year because our full year outlook for pulp price is slightly below what the current market price is and up until this point it hasnt resulted in any major finished product selling price increases and i think the question is going to be more on the expected outlook for pulp and if people are expecting that to moderate which at the moment they are that makes it a little tougher to pass finished product selling prices along and so at this point it hasnt resulted in finished product pricing we have gotten some pricing in our professional business and theyve had some similar trends on secondary fiber as youve seen on virgin fiber but again it is tough broadly getting selling price increases in developed markets at this point faiza alwy  deutsche bank securities inc okay and then just on the competitive environment where youve talked about market share losses i think this question was asked earlier but could you just clarify for us how much of this is coming from like your primary competitor like procter and how much of it is coming from smaller players so asked another way are you seeing especially as consumers are shopping more and more online are you seeing a higher growth in potentially niche brands or private label specifically online thomas j falk  kimberlyclark corp are you talking about any particular market faiza faiza alwy  deutsche bank securities inc i would say north america specifically and maybe more so on the diaper side or just infant child care thomas j falk  kimberlyclark corp yeah i mean so id say in north america broadly our shares have been fairly similar sequentially and i think were down about  point yearonyear in infant care procter has picked up most of that behind their easy ups launch last year i think in another category i think mike commented on femcare i think its down twotenths sequentially and there is not much to talk about there adult care i think were up fourtenths sequentially and if you look at some of the tissue brands kind of a similar story facial tissue were down a couple of points yearoveryear and up a tenth sequentially dry bath were down  point yearonyear and up  point sequentially paper towels were down a little under  point yearonyear and up a tenth sequentially and so yeah a little bit better kind of a mixed performance sequentially and a little bit down yearonyear and most of it with the exception of paper towels has been other branded competitors faiza alwy  deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you operator our next question comes from iain simpson with société générale iain e simpson  société générale sa uk thank you very much morning all a couple of questions please firstly could you just talk us through where both pulp and reclaimed paper costs are at yearonyear and how you expect that to progress in the second half and how we should think about its impact on pricing in both consumer tissue and professional and secondly i guess a much wider question i think the us is almost unique amongst developed markets in having a branded consumer tissue category where companies can actually earn a return meaningfully in excess of their cost of capital what sort of gives you comfort that this is sustainable and that what were seeing now isnt the start of a slide where the us consumer tissue ends up looking like europe or australia where its almost completely commoditized thanks very much thomas j falk  kimberlyclark corp okay on the pulp question we typically quote eucalyptus pricing because thats our biggest virgin fiber category so our outlook is for  to  a ton on average for the year i think the current market price is a little bit above that and that compares to about  last year so its about  to  a ton would be our call up yearonyear secondary fiber our call again theres a wide variety of grades that you can buy there were looking at a doubledigit increase versus  and its in the low  a ton for the typical grade that we look at and the broader margin question i mean we do have consumer tissue businesses all over the world and with some wide ranging market structures so us has consistently been a pretty high margin market but we have other markets like peru for example or mexico that are similarly very very profitable high margin markets for us and even yeah markets like korea and australia are still reasonably good performing markets and so we think the strength of brand and innovation in north america is justifying the value that were delivering and weve got scale and efficiency here and that seems to be playing out and supporting the margin levels for most of the players in the category iain e simpson  société générale sa uk thanks very much operator our next question comes from andrea teixeira with jpmorgan andrea f teixeira  jpmorgan securities llc hi good morning everyone so tom just back on your comments on and i think mike as well alluded for emerging market and i understand of course china you are probably lapping what you mentioned in terms of price declines but i was curious about brazil you mentioned that youre probably growing mid singledigits you also commented about russia which similar to brazil you have some kind of like return of the fx kind of like now becoming a tailwind how can we layer that with for example in brazil one of your competitors consolidating the same competitor that consolidated in mexico is the competitive environment getting marginally worse there so you have to kind of pull back some of the pricing some of the promotions into pricing which were seeing by other multinationals there doing the same thing or how should we think which goes against of course the economy has been improving from its bottom but if you think about like competitive environment getting worse as we marginally think about brazil pricing thomas j falk  kimberlyclark corp yeah i mean i would have said at least the economic environment in brazil is getting marginally better and weve seen that in a little bit healthier category trends in the last couple of share periods and its been a competitive environment throughout so i wouldnt say that weve seen a big stepup in brazil competitive activity mike i dont know you were just down there not long ago so you may have a different comment to add michael d hsu  kimberlyclark corp yeah i think were cautiously optimistic about both maybe brazil and argentina about the economy showing signs of improvement although that hasnt fully translated into our categories yet however yeah i think youre right the competitive environment remains active and probably throughout our second quarter maybe what were getting is more volume than price and i think the team has adjusted their plans to be able to plan that environment little more effectively what theyve done is improved their lowertiers or their tier  product to make that more competitive and then adjusted some price packs to make the onshelf affordability better so i i think were cautiously optimistic about latin america i think the team is largely on track with what they set out for the year and then with cee which you mentioned in russia were pretty excited about that business even though they still have tough economic conditions i think the consumer still demonstrates that theyre willing to spend in our categories were up doubledigits organically up there in russia weve got winning products the team is executing great in store we look great onshelf and you can see it in their share were up about  point in the quarter in share as you can see in that performance andrea f teixeira  jpmorgan securities llc this is very helpful is it fair to say that on those countries specifically and including id say layer in your kimberlyclark mexico partners seeing the same thing is that the fragmentation of the brands not happening that much yet right as far as i mean were in different problems i should say in emerging markets visàvis what you see here in the us you dont see yet like the same folks i think walmex definitely does their part on mexico but from the retail standpoint you dont see them pushing for pricing the same way or promotions the same way as were seeing in developed markets is that a fair assumption thomas j falk  kimberlyclark corp i mean i think its a little different in each market in brazil theres probably  or  diaper brands if you looked across every state in brazil and some are just tiny and you might have called them a private label but theyre just in one region or one state and they wouldnt typically pop up on even the nielsen data so you have seen the trends the consolidation around the bigger brands over time and thats not really changing and mexico we continue to have very strong shares pablo and the team down there have done a great job and id say its about the same number of other players they occasionally change owners mabesa was acquired by ontex et cetera but it hasnt really fundamentally changed the competitive position from that standpoint and russia is mostly the international players its us and pg and the japanese players are present there for the most part andrea f teixeira  jpmorgan securities llc okay thank you very helpful thomas j falk  kimberlyclark corp thanks andrea operator our next question comes from lauren lieberman with barclays lauren rae lieberman  barclays capital inc thanks i just have one quick followup so one thing we know that procter is changing in china its not just an upcoming launch but also their sales force coverage they talked about adding  people to cover the mom and baby channel in china so could you just share with us a little bit about your sales model in china if youve dedicated coverage for channels et cetera thanks michael d hsu  kimberlyclark corp yeah we do have dedicated channel coverage we do concentrate more in the larger cities so we probably wont have those head count numbers that our competitor is talking about the other thing that i would point out lauren is that almost the majority of our business now is sold online and so thats where a lot of our resourcing and our strategy is focused on but the baby channel is very important to us weve got great coverage there weve got a great team there and weve been performing very well in that channel lauren rae lieberman  barclays capital inc okay thank you operator at this time we have no other questioners in the queue paul j alexander  kimberlyclark corp all right well we thank everyone for your questions and well wrap up with a comment from tom thomas j falk  kimberlyclark corp yeah once again its a challenging environment and were looking forward to showing you we can deliver growth in the second half of the year and thank you again for your support of kimberlyclark paul j alexander  kimberlyclark corp thank you very much operator ladies and gentlemen that

quantity verified purchasethese are great for light and heavy household cleaning they can be reused and washed pretty easily and last a while they do get a little dingy looking after a week or so depending on what you use it for great for wiping down counter tops refrigerators windows mirrors tables you name it i dont like them for dishes because they are too soft and seem to soak up oils this amount  is the only option that seems economical when you consider shipping and packaging i hate to order them because of the added environmental impact but they dont sell them where i live twentyfour
