foreseeable future the company has incurred losses resulting in an accumulated deficit of  as of may   and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business raising substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern the ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the company generating profitable operations in the future and or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve

analysis of financial condition and results of operations   general   toucan interactive corp was incorporated in the state of nevada on january   and maintained its official business address at sabanilla de montes de oca urbanizacion carmiol casa  san jose costa rica   from inception until april  the company’s principal business consisted of developing a website wwwneedforcreditcom to provide credit option services to users primarily in costa rica canada the united states and south and central america and to market context advertising services to banks and financial institutions in these countries and regions   in april  pursuant to the transactions described in the current report on form k filed on april   the company experienced a change of control the “change of control” and ceased operations as a provider of credit option services the company also changed the address of its principal executive offices to  e foothill blvd arcadia california    the company currently serves as a vehicle to investigate and if such investigation warrants acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation management does not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in our securities either debt or equity until we have successfully concluded a business combination the company will not restrict its potential candidate target companies to any industry specific business or geographical location and thus may acquire any type of business   the company does not currently engage in any business activities that generate cash flow during the next twelve months we anticipate incurring costs related to   i filing exchange act reports and ii investigating analyzing and consummating a business combination   we believe we will be able to meet these costs through use of funds in our treasury and additional amounts as necessary to be loaned to or invested in us by our controlling stockholder management or other investors as of the date of the period covered by this report the company has no cash in its treasury there are no assurances that the company will be able to secure funding as needed   as of the date of this quarterly report the company has not entered into any definitive agreement with any party nor have there been any specific discussions with any potential business combination candidate regarding business opportunities for the company the company has unrestricted flexibility in seeking analyzing and participating in potential business opportunities the analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of the company’s officers and directors in its efforts to analyze potential acquisition targets the company will consider the following factors   a potential for growth indicated by new technology anticipated market expansion or new products   b competitive position as compared to other firms of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the industry as a whole   c strength and diversity of management either in place or scheduled for recruitment   d capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds to be provided by the company or from operations through the sale of additional securities through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources   e the cost of participation by the company as compared to the perceived tangible and intangible values and potentials to be acquired   f the extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced        in applying the foregoing criteria no one of which will be controlling management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data in evaluating a prospective business combination the company will conduct as extensive a due diligence review of potential targets as reasonably possible   we anticipate that the selection of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky potentially available business combinations may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities difficult and complex we cannot assure investors that our choice of a business combination will result in profitable operations   critical accounting policies   there have been no significant changes during the three months ended may   to the critical accounting policies disclosed in our audited financial statements included in our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended february     results of operations   the company was a startup company and has generated minimal revenue to date we have incurred recurring losses to date we currently serve as a vehicle to investigate and if such investigation warrants acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and accordingly do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation we expect we will require additional capital to meet our goal of consummating a business combination with suitable growth potential and to meet our long term operating requirements we expect to raise additional capital through among other things loans from our controlling stockholder and the sale of equity or debt securities we have no committed source of financing and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to raise funds as and when we need them   three month period ended may   compared to three month period ended may     we earned no revenue during the three months ended may   and  we have earned minimal revenue since the date of inception   our net loss for the three month period ended may   was  compared to a net loss of  for the three months ended may     during the three month period ended may   we incurred general and administrative expenses of  as compared to  incurred for the three month period ended may   general and administrative expenses incurred during the three month periods ended may   and  were generally related to corporate overhead and administrative contracted services   liquidity and capital resources   three month period ended may       as of may   we had cash of  prepaid expenses of   liabilities of  and a working capital surplus of  as of february   we had cash of  liabilities of  and a working capital deficit of  we expect to incur continued losses until we acquire a company with operations and those operations are profitable        cash flows from operating activities   for the three months ended may   and  net cash used in operating activities amounted to  and  respectively   cash flows from investing activities   for the three months ended may   and  the company has not generated any cash flows from investing activities   cash flows from financing activities   we have financed our operations primarily from loans or the issuance of equity for the three months ended may   and  net cash provided by financing activities amounted to  and  respectively   we have generated minimal revenues from operations to date it is not likely that we will generate any further revenues until a business combination has been consummated however even following a business combination there is no guarantee that any revenues will be generated that any revenues will be sufficient to meet our expenses or that we will ever become profitable we may consider a business combination with a target company which itself has recently commenced operations is a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products or markets is seeking to develop one or more new products or services or is an established business which may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital   moreover any target business that is selected may be financially unstable or in the early stages of development or growth including businesses without established records of sales or earnings in that event we will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies in addition we may effect a business combination with a target company in an industry characterized by a high level of risk and although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target company there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks   the foregoing considerations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern  we are currently planning on devoting the vast majority of our efforts to identifying investigating and conducting due diligence on target companies and negotiating structuring documenting and consummating a business combination our longterm ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to complete a business combination and thereafter achieve profitable operations   we believe that we will be able to meet these costs through future cash on hand if any and additional amounts as may be necessary to be loaned by or invested in us by our controlling stockholder management andor others currently however our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate future profitable operations andor to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due  our ability to continue as a going concern is also dependent on our ability to find a suitable target company and enter into a business combination  management’s plan includes obtaining additional funds through a combination of sales of our equity securities before contemporaneously with or following the consummation of a business combination and borrowings although we do not believe that we will be eligible to borrow funds from a bank until at least a business combination is consummated  however there is no assurance that any additional funding will be available on terms that are favorable to us or at all    on april   all the loans made by the company’s then sole director were repaid in full since the change of control in april  we rely on loans from our controlling stockholder to meet our expenses there is no guarantee that our controlling stockholder will continue to lend us funds to meet our expenses in the future currently we do not have any other arrangements for financing on may   the controlling stockholder loaned  to the company for working capital        we have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all if financing is not available to us on satisfactory terms or at all we may be unable to develop operations or meet our expenses  additionally any equity financing in which we might engage would result in dilution to our existing stockholders   going concern   the independent auditors’ audit report accompanying our financial statements dated february   contained an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern the financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business   offbalance sheet arrangements   as of the date of this quarterly report we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors   item  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   not applicable   item  controls and procedures   our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule ae and de under the exchange act that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the commission’s rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure   an evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of may   based on that evaluation our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms such officers also confirmed that there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the threemonth period ended may   that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting        part ii  other information    item  legal proceedings   we are not currently a party to any lawsuit or proceeding which in the opinion of management is likely to have a material adverse effect on us or our business   item a risk factors   an investment in our common stock involves a number of very significant risks   any investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk some but not all of the risks that affect an investment in our company include   ● we have little operating history and minimal revenue and there is no guarantee that we can establish a profitable operation in the foreseeable future ● we have incurred recurring net losses in the past and unless we receive additional financing we may be forced to cease all operations and liquidate our company ● we face intense competition for business combination opportunities and because of our limited resources we will be at a competitive disadvantage in identifying possible business opportunities and successfully completing a business combination with suitable growth potential ● we may be unable to obtain additional financing that may be needed to fund the operations andor growth of the target business ● we have no full time employees and are substantially dependent on the efforts of parttime management and members of the board of directors working for perdiem or no cash compensation none of whom are bound by term employment agreements and ● our controlling stockholder and executive officers and directors currently are able to influence matters requiring stockholder approval and their interests may conflict with those of other stockholders   we do not have any targets for a business combination or other transaction and we have no minimum standards for a business combination   we have no arrangement agreement or understanding with respect to acquiring a business opportunity or engaging in a business combination with any private entity there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify and evaluate suitable business opportunities or conclude a business combination we have not established a specific length of operating history or a specified level of earnings assets net worth or other criteria which we will require a target business opportunity to have achieved accordingly we may enter into a business combination with a business opportunity having no significant operating history losses limited or no potential for earnings limited assets negative net worth or other negative characteristics   our stockholders may face significant restrictions on the resale of our common stock   the following factors there can be others may significantly affect our stockholders’ ability to resell our common stock   ● there is currently no established public trading market for our common stock which makes it difficult for our stockholders to resell their shares ● as we are currently a “shell company” as defined under rule  stockholders who receive our restricted securities will not be able to sell our shares without registration until one year after we have satisfied the applicable conditions under rule  ● our common stock may be subject to significant restriction on resale
