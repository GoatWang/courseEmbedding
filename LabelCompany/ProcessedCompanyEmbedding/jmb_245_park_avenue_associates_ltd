then paid to jmb approximately  as repayment toward the jmb notes one jmb note remained after such repayment which was secured by the partnerships interest in bfp lp on october   the partnership and jmb entered into an agreement to split the jmb note which had an unpaid principal and accrued and deferred interest balance at october   of approximately  into two separate replacement notes the replacement notes whereby the partnership issued the replacement notes payable to jmb that allocated the outstanding principal balance and accrued and unpaid interest under the jmb note between the replacement notes in the amounts of  of principal and  of accrued and unpaid interest to one replacement note replacement note  and  of principal and all other accrued and all unpaid interest totaling  including all of the default interest of  to the second replacement note replacement note  the division of the jmb note and its replacement by replacement note  and replacement note  resulted in those two notes superseding the jmb note the security interest rate and maturity date for the replacement notes remained unchanged from those under the jmb note through a series of transactions jmb assigned and contributed replacement note  to jmb park avenue inc which is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of jmb and the corporate general partner of the partnership effective october   the corporate general partner and the partnership entered into an assignment and contribution agreement pursuant to which the corporate general partner assigned and contributed replacement note  to the partnership as an additional voluntary contribution of capital this resulted in the release of the partnership from liability for repayment of replacement note  with aggregate principal and interest of  due to the decrease in the partnerships outstanding indebtedness interest accruals in future periods will be substantially less replacement note  remains as outstanding indebtedness of the partnership owed to jmb and is secured by the partnerships interest in bfp lp the unpaid principal and accrued interest balance of replacement note  at december   and  was  and  respectively in addition to the amounts owing to jmb under replacement note  advances totaling  and  were made to the partnership from jmb in  and  respectively these advances are evidenced by a demand note demand note dated december   which bears interest at prime plus  percent and is secured by the partnerships interest in bfp lp additional advances totaling  were made by jmb under the demand note in january  jmb is under no obligation to make further advances and has the right to require repayment of the demand note together with accrued and unpaid interest at any time in connection with the partial redemption the limited partnership agreement of bfp lp was amended the amendment to among other things provide for the right of the partnership to consent to the nomination of an independent director to the board of directors of bpc the amendment also generally provides that in the event either i a sale or other disposition of the  park avenue building by bfp lp results in the recognition by the partnership of gain for federal income tax purposes or ii as a result of a merger or consolidation of bfp lp the partnership thereafter holds less than onehalf of its retained interest in a form which does not give rise to a material amount of gain for federal income tax purposes the partnership may elect to sell to bfp lp or bfp lp may elect to redeem from the partnership the retained interest at its fair market value as defined in the bfp lp partnership agreement per class a unit but in no event less than   and no greater than   of the redemption distribution per class a unit in the partial redemption under the terms of the amendment bfp lp is obligated to use its commercially reasonable efforts in any agreement of merger or consolidation entered into by bfp lp on or before december  to the extent that the consideration is comprised in whole or in part of equity interests to provide for the partnership to obtain its share of such equity interests in a form such that the partnership will not recognize a material amount of gain for federal income tax purposes if bfp lp having used its commercially reasonable efforts is unable to provide for the partnership to receive such an equity interest bfp lp must pay to the partnership in addition to the partnerships share of the merger consideration a cash amount equal to the percentage of the merger consideration in the form of equity multiplied by a number which is  million in  and reduces by  million per year through the year  bfp lp has had the right to sell the  park avenue property without the consent of the partnership since january  bfp lp notified the partnership that it sold a  interest in the  park avenue property to an unaffiliated third party on october   the partnership did not receive any proceeds from the sale of the  interest in  park avenue however as a result of such transaction and subject to the terms of the transaction a substantial amount of gain for federal and state income tax purposes was allocated to the holders of interests without any distribution of cash under certain circumstances the partnership may have obligations for federal or state withholding or estimated tax payments on behalf of certain holders of interests notwithstanding any such obligations the partnership believes that the holders of interests have the ultimate responsibility for the timely filing of state and federal tax returns and the payment of all related taxes including the reimbursement to the partnership of all withholding tax payments or estimated tax payments made on their behalf bfp lp has a substantial amount of indebtedness outstanding any proceeds from the sale of the buildings in which bfp lp has an interest would be first applied to repayment of the mortgage and other indebtedness of bfp lp in any event any net proceeds obtained by the partnership could then be available to satisfy replacement note  and the demand note previously discussed only after such applications would any remaining proceeds be available to be distributed to the holders of interests similarly in the event of a sale or other disposition of the retained interest including a redemption pursuant to an election discussed above the partnerships share of the proceeds of such sale or disposition would be available to satisfy replacement note  and the demand note only after such application would remaining proceeds if any be available to be distributed to the holders of interests it is unlikely that the holders of interests ever will receive any further distributions from the partnership or any further return on their original investment however it is expected that holders of interests will be allocated a substantial amount of additional gain for federal and state income tax purposes as a result of transactions which may occur over the remaining term of the partnership these transactions include i a sale or other disposition of the  park avenue property or other properties in which bfp lp owns an interest ii a sale or other disposition of the partnerships interest in bfp lp including a redemption of the retained interest or iii a significant reduction in the indebtedness of the  park avenue property or other indebtedness of the partnership for federal and state income tax purposes the amount of gain for federal and state income tax purposes to be allocated to a holder of interests over the remaining term of the partnership is expected to be at a minimum equal to all or most of the amount of such holders deficit capital account for tax purposes such gain may be offset by suspended losses from prior years if any that have been allocated to the holder of interests the actual tax liability of each holder of interests will depend on such holders own tax situation the

financial statements to which reference is hereby made for a description of such transactions item a risk factors the partnership is subject to significant risks including factors related to its

the consensus reached in eitf issue no  determining whether a general partner or the general partners as a group controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights eitf  eitf  is effective for all newly formed limited partnerships after the consensus was ratified and january  for all existing limited partnership agreements the partnership has evaluated the ownership structure of its existing investment in bfp lp and again has determined that it does not demonstrate control over this entity as defined by eitf  results of operations the operations of the partnership in  and  have been funded entirely by advances under a demand note from jmb totaling  and  in  and  respectively the increase in interest and other receivables at december   as compared to december   and the increase in interest and other income for the year ended december   as compared to the years ended december   and  is due to the reversal of an allowance on a receivable of approximately  which was received by the partnership in january  from a holder of interest for previous withholding tax payments made by the partnership on behalf of the holder of interest the increase in demand note payable to an affiliate at december   as compared to december   is due primarily to advances totaling  made to the partnership in  by jmb the increase in note payable to an affiliate at december   as compared to december   is due to interest accrued on the note payable in  the decrease in interest expense for the year ended december   as compared to the years ended december   and  is primarily due to the jmb note split in october  and the resulting decrease in the partnerships indebtedness the decreases in professional services for the years ended december   and  as compared to the year ended december   is primarily due to decreases in fees for legal and accounting services related to the partial redemption of the partnerships interest in bfp lp in december  the decrease in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   and the increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   is primarily due to the provision for doubtful receivables recognized in  inflation due to the low levels of inflation in recent years and the limited business activity of the partnership inflation generally has not had a material effect on it use of estimates and critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period critical accounting policies are those that are both significant to the overall presentation of the partnerships financial condition and results of operations and require management to make difficult complex or subjective judgments the partnership made no significant estimates or assumptions for the year ended december   and thus has concluded that there are no critical accounting policies item a
