english version people build companies early growth specialists ethos sequoia  and beyond the creative spirits the underdogs the resolute the determined the outsiders the defiant the independent thinkers the fighters and the true believers these are the founders with whom we partner they’re extremely rare and we’re ecstatic when we find them we partner early—sometimes when a company is no more than an idea we know these crucial first decisions can have an exponential influence on the curve of success our style is not for everyone we push when we see potential we are direct some don’t like our approach most who know us do our team mirrors the founders with whom we partner hungry overachievers with a deeprooted need to win many come from humble backgrounds many are immigrants many formed or built companies of their own before joining sequoia each shares the mindset of an entrepreneur and knows what it means to walk that path we value teamwork over showmanship our contribution to a company always comes from several of us working together we’re skittish about the first person singular and don’t care to see our names in the press our team is small we prefer a few people with diverse strengths focused on a small number of companies and we are always mindful of lessons learned  some painfully  that are eternal truths our network is strong our advantage comes from four decades of legendary founders helping each other long ago we made nonprofits the backbone of our limited partner base working for these charities brings intense meaning to what we do it gives us a heightened sense of responsibility we’re serious about our work and carefully choose the words to describe it terms like “deal” or “exit” are forbidden and while we’re sometimes called investors that is not our frame of mind we consider ourselves partners for the long term we help the daring build legendary companies   forbidden access is denied server error   forbidden access is denied you do not
