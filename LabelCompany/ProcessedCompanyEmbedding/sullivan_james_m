statement ofjames m sullivandirector office of asset enterprise managementdepartment of veterans affairsbefore the house committee on veterans’ affairsseptember   september   mr chairman and members of the committee thank you for the opportunity to discuss with you the department of veterans affairs va green management program and our commitment to energy efficiencies and cleaner energy – and to building lasting change that reduces va’s impact on the environment      i am accompanied here today by ed bradley director of investment and enterprise development service office of asset enterprise management and john stenger director of healthcare engineering and john beatty director of safety health environmental and emergency management both from the veterans health administration vha   as the lead for va’s “green team” i will present our green management program and identify the four major program areas scope of responsibilities recent accomplishments investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy energy savings and va’s path toward reducing its carbon footprint as an agency while enabling and supporting va’s primary mission – to provide the highest quality care and services to our veterans and their families   green management program – overview va is making great strides in conserving resources at its facilities across the country by proactively managing its energy environmental fleet and sustainable building efforts  these four program areas are the cornerstone of our integrated green management program  working collaboratively with va’s administrations  vha veterans benefits administration vba and national cemetery administration nca and staff offices  we have for example reduced the rate at which va uses energy in buildings by  percent since  we have created facility energy engineer positions to serve all facilities  we have exceeded alternative fuel vehicle acquisition mandates and installed pumps to dispense alternative fuels at   fueling stations with many more planned and on the way  six va facilities have earned certification as green buildings and others are in the evaluation process right now    we are dedicating over 4 million in recovery act funds to make facilities more energy efficient and to add solar wind and other renewable energy capacity  activities such as these that help “green” our world are the right thing to do  they improve our wellbeing and ensure a healthy planet for the generations to come  reducing our energy and environmental footprint is not only the right thing for va to do it is the smart thing  each action we take to reduce reuse and recycle energy water and other resources has the potential to generate cost savings that va can redirect to its core mission of caring for our nation’s veterans and their families    our agency has established a tangible goal for each and every employee to integrate energy and environmental considerations into their daytoday activities and into all va operations and longterm planning processes   energy and water management since  va has been successful in setting goals that exceed mandates benchmarking energy consumption at its facilities improving energy efficiency and investing in renewable energy generation to reduce its fossil fuel consumption     energy project investment process va instituted a rigorous centralized energy project identification evaluation and investment process in   the process begins with regionally coordinated facility energy assessments to identify and evaluate potential energy and water conservation measures  once measures are identified facility and regional decisionmakers select measures to implement and decide on funding methods which include appropriations and alternative financing such as energy savings performance contracts  va’s national energy business center established in  provides the department with all energyrelated contracting services from energy assessments to performance contracting    technologies  projects the va’s green management program has focused especially on identifying facilities with high potential for renewable energy projects and pursuing implementation of those projects  va is making use of the funds provided through the recovery act to fund designbuild contracts and feasibility studies at existing medical centers and national cemeteries across the country  additionally va is conducting renewable energy feasibility studies for all new construction projects   solar photovoltaic pv panels are one technology that va is deploying  in  we installed solar pv systems at  medical centers and we expect to award designbuild contracts for  additional projects this year  with the designbuild process contractors evaluate va needs and propose the technologies and systems best suited to filling those needs including both thin film and crystalline technologies  va is actively pursuing wind and geothermal systems as well with contracts for two wind and four geothermal systems to be awarded this year   cogeneration also known as combined heat and power is an energy efficient system especially suited to meeting medical center energy needs  such systems simultaneously produce electricity and steam hot water or chilled water   the cogeneration plant at the mountain home va medical center vamc in johnson city tennessee uses waste methane gas that is produced from and processed at a local municipal landfill  the cogeneration system at the san diego vamc won a department of energy doe award in 6 and features a natural gas turbine with very low emissions of nitrogen oxide nox  va awarded  contracts this past august for feasibility studies of renewably fueled cogeneration at  sites in  states and puerto rico    va is aggressively implementing advanced metering systems to measure consumption at the building level to help identify problems and opportunities to improve energy performance  we are currently completing installation of electric and nonelectric meters in veterans integrated service networks visns  and  awarding a contract this fiscal year to install electric meters in all other va facilities and funding nonelectric metering for all va facilities through the recovery act     water management va’s medical facilities must use water relatively intensely to meet stringent patient care requirements  at va’s national cemeteries water is essential for maintaining appropriate national shrine environments  va was able to reduce its water consumption intensity by  percent between fy  and fy  while also meeting these missionrelated requirements exceeding the mandated reduction by  percent  the new vba regional office in reno nevada is certified leadership in energy and environmental design leed silver and uses waterwise landscaping and other water management techniques such as waterless urinals to reduced water consumption by more than  percent  nca has been taking steps to reduce water consumption while maintaining respect for our veterans’ resting places  for example at fort bliss national cemetery el paso texas nca used waterwise landscaping with droughtresistant plants and installed dripemitters for irrigation  several va facilities have won doe awards for water management and va is actively pursuing additional opportunities   sustainable building as a federal agency va is required to ensure that  percent of its building inventory incorporates sustainable practices by  in accordance with the mandates of executive order 4 strengthening federal environmental energy and transportation management   the green building initiative inc gbi recently awarded green globes sustainable building certifications to three vamcs  additionally one vha and two vba facilities have leed certifications  the new vba regional office in boise idaho which will be activated in october  uses geothermal energy and is in process for leed gold certification  moreover all new construction and major renovation projects are being designed to meet sustainable building principles    there are  additional va facilities that expect to obtain thirdparty green building certification by the end of   once certifications are obtained va’s sustainable building square footage will reach  percent of total applicable square footage in inventory    we recognize the importance of building our new facilities to be as sustainable as possible and also maintaining that status through the use of the energy star building rating system  va has been an active participant in the energy star buildings program since   twentyfive vamcs have received an energy star label representing nearly  percent of all energy star labeled medical centers in the united states  these labels signify that the facility is among the top  percent of comparable facilities in the nation in terms of energy performance  we have also established energy star ratings for all of our medical centers and for two vba regional offices    environmental  the nation’s environmental statutes impact the way va facilities are maintained and operated  protecting the environment is critical to ensuring the health of veterans employees and the public as well as the communities that va serves  va is committed to continually improving its environmental programs to meet federal state and local environmental requirements and reduce risks that va facility operations may pose to the environment  vha is responsible for providing quality healthcare to our nation’s veterans at more than  vamcs  communitybased outpatient clinics and other healthcare facilities    environmental management systems the green environmental management system gems is the foundation for environmental management in va’s medical centers focused on environmental performance through a process of continuous improvement  by  gems were in place at all vamcs with dedicated gems coordinators serving at  percent of medical facilities  in  vha began presenting detailed gems training courses to improve understanding of statutes and regulations  nca is expanding the number of cemeteries covered by environmental management systems significantly using recovery act funding and will soon be adding coordinators as well    green purchasing buying green products is consistent with va’s mission to provide our nation’s veterans with a healthy environment  va is proud of fort custer national cemetery’s augusta michigan prestigious  white house closing the circle award for testing and using biobased products in cemetery grounds maintenance equipment  between september  and june   percent of the desktop computers that va leased were electronic product environmental assessment tool gold or silver products signifying relatively low environmental impact    electronic stewardship va is preparing to implement computer power management nationwide  this project is challenging not only because of va’s size and widely dispersed facilities but because of its impact on other information technology requirements all of which need to be fully integrated as implementation proceeds va will be developing a strategy for activating power management in nonmissioncritical equipment    greenhouse gas ghg reduction last year va participated in developing protocol for the public sector to inventory ghg emissions and has joined a new federal interagency initiative to “road test” the protocol  va is working with the federal energy management program office at doe in their ghg reduction leadership role  we have established an advisory group within va to shape va’s strategy for establishing a baseline inventory and achieving va’s initial target of  percent reduction by fy  from a fy  baseline   fleet management  va is taking steps to curb petroleum use and increase the use of alternative fuels   we are on track to exceed our fleet management goals of reducing petroleum consumption  percent annually and increasing our alternative fuel consumption  percent annually  to support our growing alternative fuel vehicle fleet  facilities plan to add alternative fueling capacity and we are completing a study to identify optimal locations for constructing up to  additional stations with the  million in minor construction program funding we received for this purpose  also va is placing electric vehicles on vamc campuses and national cemeteries   education  outreach va has recently embarked on a new initiative called the “green routine”  this initiative is an outreach and awareness campaign created with the support of secretary shinseki  the outreach will provide the necessary information and resources to educate all employees on how they can take advantage of the daily opportunities within their grasp to contribute personally to creating a healthier environment  deliverables include an informational video a web page an instructional guide to going green in the workplace and a facilities action plan  our agency is a leader among other federal agencies in reducing its energy consumption and environmental impact but now we are educating and reaching out to our  employees nationwide to help us continue on the right path – the green path   conclusion over the past several years va has laid a solid foundation of leadership in green management at its facilities by implementing environmental management systems and hiring energy managers and environmental coordinators  we are building lasting change by constructing sustainable new facilities with energy efficiency and renewable energy features  reducing environmental impacts and increasing energy efficiency are a top priority of the green management program while we maintain our focus on our core mission of caring for our nation’s
