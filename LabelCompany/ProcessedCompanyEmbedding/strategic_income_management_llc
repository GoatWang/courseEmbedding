the long cycle continues we expect the long postcrisis economic recovery to continue in  as a base case we think growth is poised to broaden out to more countries with the global economy drawing on more sources of strength than at any point since  from an investment perspective our base case view is broadly supportive for risk assets we prefer equities over credit and credit over rates but we expect low returns from these traditional exposures given  elevated valuations  limited upside for corporate earnings from current levels and  limits to economic growth potential broadening exposure beyond conventional stocks and bonds identifying opportunities in emerging markets and deploying more dynamic asset allocation strategies are some ways to adapt in some respects our outlook represents an extension of the same long cycle we envisioned heading into  the key difference for  revolves around four emerging transitions populism is challenging globalism and creating new tail risks concerns about low growth are giving way to concerns about inflation years of focus on monetary policy are giving way to a close watch over fiscal policy and concerns about new regulation are acceding to hopes for deregulation transition will be an evolving theme in  and we will be revisiting it in our publications throughout the year in this investment outlook we highlight specific signposts we will be watching both to gauge the pace of transition and to test our base case view on the key investment questions three key questions is it time to derisk is it time to derisk no we think derisking would be premature at least from a purely returngenerating standpoint we expect the macro environment to remain supportive of risk assets during  amid a slowbutsteady expansion in developed markets and an acceleration of growth in some emerging markets view more what’s driving the expansion what’s driving the expansion we believe this is a slowgrowth recovery best explained by cyclical economic drivers we believe the concerns about the developed world being mired in a pattern of underinvestment and stalled growth— socalled secular stagnation—are overdone view more where do we see opportunities where do we see opportunities in a lowreturn world we look for sources of return beyond conventional stock and bond market approaches we also think rangebound or volatile markets create opportunities for more dynamic investment strategies view more     transitions we’re watching in  globalism to populism the biggest transition in the current environment is a shift away from globalism to a rising populist trend stagnation to inflation we expect concerns around potential secular stagnation to give way to a more inflationary paradigm in the us monetary to fiscal policy the focus for stimulus is shifting toward fiscal spending as central banks are stretching toward the limits of their easing ability regulation to deregulation we see the potential for greater regulatory divergence globally and the potential for competitive deregulation  gdp forecasts by country region and market  we expect the prolonged expansion phase of the growth cycle to continue in    source gsam as of january  our

and since  in a crossover portfolioadditional high yield materialsdetailed philosophy and strategy presentationgips presentationhigh yield productsactive managementwe are active managers we do not circle around an index making minor tweaks to industry weightings there are several industries where our portfolio is very underweight or has no representation at all because their cyclical nature makes high leverage inappropriate or because the industry is in longterm secular decline we are more focused than most managers historically holding not much more than  issuers in the portfolio our turnover ratio tends to be lower than average since our strategy leads us to longer time horizons in our investmentsthe core portfoliowe build a core portfolio around longterm secular trends some examples of these are demographics technology globalization regulatory trends and fiscal and monetary policy alignment with these trends can give companies the support of a strong tailwind this in combination with our industry focus leads to a more robust portfolio industry firstin analyzing a company we first seek to gain an understanding of the industry and its longterm trends our experience is that this constitutes more than half of the investment process most often it boils down to the basic question of econ  are supply and demand in balance if not what will bring them into balanceanalyze as a cfo wouldwe analyze companies as a good cfo would making sure there is adequate return on capital cash flow and liquidity and that the company reinvests enough to sustain the businessoutoffavor industriessectorswe supplement the core portfolio first by investing in outoffavor sectors not simply contrarians we invest in outoffavor sectors that have longterm viability and where our industry analysis tells us that supply and demand are on a path to rebalancing usually through a cleansing of excess supply that rebalancing can take two or more years so analyzing companies as a cfo is important in identifying the survivors the great thing about high yield bonds as opposed to stock is that you can get rewarded by collecting high interest income while the industry turnaround works itself outnontraditional high yieldthe second strategy we employ to supplement the core portfolio is to invest in nontraditional high yield securities that have fallen out of favor some examples of these are emerging market debt convertible bonds preferreds and reits these sectors have select groups of natural buyers that periodically abandon them when these sectors of the capital market lose their natural buyers their yields can become very competitive to high yield the advantage of these sectors is that they not only offer competitive yields but their lower correlation to traditional high yield serves to reduce overall risk of the portfoliorisk control inherent in the strategywe wait for outoffavor opportunities to present themselves to us and screen them for viable investments towards the end of the business cycle investors chase every bit of extra yield they can find and very little tends to be outoffavor in that environment the lack of opportunities “forces” us back into our core portfolio late in the cycle yield spreads are tight overall thus minimizing the cost of being in that more conservative less cyclical portfolio with our “horns pulled in” we tend to be better situated for a downturn and for the outoffavor opportunities that will arise from it home   welcome to strategic income management strategic income management
