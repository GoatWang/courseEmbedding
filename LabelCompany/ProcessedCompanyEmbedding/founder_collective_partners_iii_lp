founder collective founder collective our mission is to be the most aligned fund for founders at the seed stage as weve pursued this goal weve been fortunate to back hundreds of startups meet the entire collective here’s what we believe  we have great empathy for founders we’ve been there second generation pharmacist tj parker and his cofounder elliot cohen had a compelling vision of a robotpowered pharmacy disrupting an oligopoly isn’t for the faint of heart and we proudly invested the first capital into pillpack weve been empathic supporters ever since  great startups practice efficient entrepreneurship we believe entrepreneurs should try to raise as little money as possible to accelerate their businesses while preserving ownership startups don’t have to raise billions to be worth billions—a point proven by the trade desk which raised just m in vc before earning a billion dollar ipo  the future belongs to the weird  wonderful founder collective is deliberately antithematic we don’t have a vr thesis but when kuvee showed us the future of wine we couldn’t resist visionary founders have shown us that the weird use cases of today can become the hot themes of tomorrow   staged capital  the right amount for the right stage our seed funding enabled diaco to expand beyond a bushwick warehouse  then when sales exploded we helped the founders think through scale and build out their team with top talent we’re our own biggest investors our mission is to be the most aligned fund for founders at the seed stage everyone on the investment team has started a

founder collective  foundry group foundry group our investment in founder collective by lindel eakman on march   we recently shared our thinking on fund investing with our post “what does a foundry group next fund investment look like” we noted that we are largely driven by people and ecosystem we want to continue laying out our thinking by talking about each of our fund investments we’ll start with our most recent fund investment founder collective and walk backwards to catch up on what was a very active first year of investing for foundry group next our recent investment in founder collective iii lp is a good example of our ecosystem thesis at work we previously worked with the founder collective “fc” partners david frankel eric paley and micah rosenbloom through shared company and fund investments we coinvested with them in makerbot pantheon and formlabs with many other shared opportunities along the way it was easy for us to get excited about fc’s prior portfolio and fund performance they have a number of highprofile company investments and importantly they are one of the few seed funds to have shipped home large boxes of cash in addition to strong valuation markups in their portfolio we also got excited about their fund discipline and investor alignment choosing to stay the same size and take more of the fund themselves i have to think that most lps are ready to invest at that point it’s fc’s partnership dynamics however that get us really excited they have strong internal dynamics that limit the noise and encourage debate to reach thoughtful decisions their history together as founders and investors makes it clear that they deeply care about each other it is those deep bonds and relationships that allow for the space needed to make good decisions across the portfolio brad’s post kindred spirits – our investment in founder collective does a nice job of laying out our shared values and goes into detail as to why we felt such a strong motivation to partner with them these are clearly our kind of people the fc strategy also shows that they deeply align themselves with and identify internally as founders the personal feedback we got from their portfolio founders was strong and their local ecosystem players noted support for their involvement as preferred investors we also knew fc had a great investor base and we would be lucky to get a chance to join that group in this new fund it was only because of shared relationships and some embarrassing cajoling that we were able to become the only new lp in their new fund we are excited to formally partner with the fc team and look forward to finding more great entrepreneurs to back alongside them jul  our investment in impact health jul  our investment in misty robotics jun  our zero

investment in founder collective foundry group is best known for our investments in startups but our vehicle currently investing in other venture funds foundry group next is off to what we believe to be a great start and i wanted to share an update about it by talking about our new investment in a fund managed by founder collective i’ve written previously about why we created foundry group next we have been personally investing as lps in funds of other managers for decades and found the activity to be emotionally rewarding when we decided we wanted to expand and formalize that activity it gave us a chance to work more closely with lindel eakman who was the largest investor in our first fund through his role at utimco lindel joined foundry group as a partner to lead the fund investing activity of foundry group next we’ve made about a dozen investments in funds including funds offered by union square ventures true ventures and forerunner ventures one of our recent investments offered by founder collective fc – an eightyearold manager with offices in boston and san francisco – is an excellent example of what we look for when we invest in funds offered by other managers it starts with the people we don’t invest in managers unless we can picture working with them for decades we’ve had the opportunity to work with founder collective’s partners – david frankel eric paley and micah rosenbloom – over the years on several companies we also know many of the entrepreneurs in their portfolio from those founders we are aware that fc takes their mission “to be the most aligned fund to founders at the seed stage” very seriously we aren’t a generational firm but investing in other vc funds gives us the benefit of working with managers who challenge and enhance our thinking while sharing the lessons we’ve learned with other investors we want to work with people who bring a focused and complementary perspective to investing and were interested in the founder collective mantra of being “stagefocused and sector agnostic” this means fc avoids trends and relentlessly questions entrepreneurs about how their product enables specific use cases and market opportunities this approach has paid off and helped the team to identify hot sectors well outside of the current hype cycle if you look at the founder collective portfolio you’ll see many wellrecognized companies that they invested in at the very first round in general these investments were rarely competitive at the time of their first financing “founder friendly” is an overused term but there is a big difference between marketing this as a concept and living it every day the team at fc has structurally designed their firm around alignment to founders they’re a rare venture fund that doesn’t exercise prorata rights over the lifetime of an investment meaning they dilute alongside company founders which they believe better aligns their interests as seed investors with the entrepreneurs at a time where funds are aggressively deploying capital and not considering the downsides for founders fc is actively promoting the value of efficient entrepreneurship and helping founders maximize their outcomes and optionality not only are the downsides of overcapitalization problematic for founders but fc also examined overcapitalization in upside scenarios by studying the data from the last five years of tech ipos the findings were surprising in that the amount of money a company raised and its success in the public markets were not positively correlated in fact the companies that raised less money outperformed the most funded over time needless to say having investors that keep this balance in mind can be precious to founders it’s one thing to have a unique perspective it’s another to generate returns with it as an lp i’ve had the good fortune to be an investor in many funds including some exceptional ones before diving into diligence we had a sense that founder collective had strong performance based on their portfolio when we saw their financial track record we realized how special the performance was we know many firms that build portfolios with great logos by buying into companies at later stages and higher valuations fc’s portfolio is made up exclusively of seed stage investments at seed valuations these aren’t just paper gains – they have already returned a meaningful amount of cash to their investors founder collective’s first fund has the potential to be enshrined in the annals of vc history their second fund is tracking ahead of the first at the same point in development needless to say we had many reasons to hope to be part of their third fund the only problem was they didn’t have any room we found out they were oversubscribed just from their existing fund ii investors – that’s without pitching any new lps but they didn’t take advantage of that demand instead they stuck to their principles and kept their fund size the same as their previous fund we love seeing that strategy discipline as we believe it is the mark of good fund managers when union square ventures’  fund was on fire fred and brad raised their next fund at the same size this has also been our approach at foundry group in the case of founder collective the partners effectively shrunk their fund regarding outside capital by increasing their personal financial commitment to their fund this investment generates additional evidence that they are confident in their strategy while creating more alignment with their lps as a gp i applauded the approach and accepted that as an lp we had to beg and plead our way into to the fund all the same we were honored that foundry group next was the only new investor in founder collective iii due to our long and trusted relationship by virtue of time and focus we can only help so many startups but we’re proud to be investors in funds like founder collective which is deeply committed to helping enrich the startup ecosystem we are delighted to be working alongside them and finding other managers of their caliber going forward also published on medium darius v congrats not asking for pro rata nicely aligns investors and founders also solid point about keeping financially responsible and not being addicted to outside capital for all growth for founders mario cantin “i applauded the approach and accepted that as an lp we had to beg and plead our way into to the fund” how did they make room for fg next then i assume they kept the fund size the same so did they put in less of their own capital into the new fund or did they leave out one or more of their fund  lps also what do you fundamentally think of their “cultural” decision to forego pro rata do you think it is a strategy that works for them as an aberration or do you think the approach should gain momentum as a new “movement” for a new generation of vcs in the future bfeld they put more of their personal capital in the fund they cut back a few other lps to make room for us i love their view on prorata it’s how i’ve always approached my angel investing i don’t think it’s a new “movement” rather it’s one of the strategic approaches see  have a financial strategy in httpsfeldcomarchivessuggestionsforangelinvestorshtml mario cantin i was asking because until now i had only heard either david frankel or eric paley mention in a podcast that founders collective doesn’t believe in pro rata while everyone else in vc from what i hear — not angel — “has” to take pro rata it seems as one of the tools with which to make their funds perform and so i was wondering whether this could become a trend but i’ll guess that once you reach series a you have to take pro rata and so this founder alignment philosophy could only realistically work for angel preseed and seed until fund economics dictate otherwise for the larger rounds am i close bfeld the assumption or assertion that “everyone has to take prorata” isn’t correct in recent years it’s become all the rage again but there are different strategies around it the key thing is to be clear on your strategy mario cantin thank you if the occasion presents itself when you are being interviewed in the future — or when you write on your blog — to elaborate on this well know that there is at least one person interested to know more me and perhaps there are others when i hear fred wilson’s stance on this point just to name one individual well good luck on taking pro rata away from him that’s all i can say it’s an incessant barrage of “i wish we could have doubledown on uber or twitter” etc i continually hear or read about i’ve been following you and others for years now and i can’t recall the alternatives being discussed it’s an interesting topic bfeld yeah – probably worth me writing more about it again … scott lobo dont understand this site httpswwwsecondloanscom twitter facebook linkedin google founder collective iii lp  list of ceos founders and

founder collective ii and will allow us to continue our mission to build the most aligned fund for founders at the seed stage sticking to your knitting can sometimes seem boring but we continue the same ethos we’ve practiced from day one — make founder alignment our highest priority stay small and love the weird and wonderfulwe start and end with alignment and empathyfounder collective is predicated on the idea that “peertopeer investment” has huge benefits for entrepreneurs everyone at founder collective has started a company we’ve been through the good the fundraising the product launches the team building and the bad the layoffs the stress and the loneliness we’re here to be partners friends and sounding boards — as well as provide capitalwe are not a life cycle investor we invest between k and m at the seed stage and typically write a single support check in the series a these investments aren’t options on future funding rounds we don’t buy options so that our founders can have more of them by diluting alongside our founders they know that we have the same interests as them when making future financing decisionsventure capital should be a tool not a drugwe’re proud of how things have unfolded since we started founder collective in the midst of the great recession of  our first two funds have outperformed our high expectations thanks to an amazing group of portfolio companiesour investors were eager to put more capital to work and encouraged us to raise a larger fund but we purposefully chose to keep founder collective iii the same size as founder collective ii because we aspire to practice efficient entrepreneurship we don’t believe we can maintain our alignment with founders and manage a larger fund with greater pressure to deploy capitalmore capital doesn’t make entrepreneurs any more clever too much money can hurt a business as our recent study of  recent tech ipos shows and we believe the same goes for seed investors more ramen and less steak for us toowe love the weird and wonderfulfounder collective remains proudly antithematic we are stagefocused and sector agnostic historically this has led us to invest in a broad range of industries from ad tech to autonomous vehicles instant coffee and consignment sales pill delivery as well as plussize fashion ridesharing and realtime web development concert tickets and code schools we look for exceptional founders who inspire us and articulate compelling use cases the weird use cases of today become the hot themes of tomorrowwe’re our own biggest investorsa classic complaint of investors in venture funds comes from vcs acting more as agents than as principals in most venture funds the vcs themselves represent a tiny amount of the capital in the fund and are at risk of acting like money managers we are principals we the partners are the biggest investors in founder collective iii and as such are structurally positioned to behave differently from the typical vc that’s it to the best of our knowledge this is unique in the venture industryas we’ve done since the start of fc in  the fulltime investment team is proudly joined by a collection of founder partners seatgeek’s
