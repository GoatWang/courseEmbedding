homeprojectsfishing lures fishing lures   although our largest group of high volume purchasers are tackle manufacturers our experts at glow inc are not avid fisherman  in fact most of them would run at the sight of a worm but our baitloving customers report great success with glow in the dark fishing lures  to our surprise they even claim that the fish prefer the glow lures during the day fish talepossibly quick glow fishing tackle although we supply pigment to many lure manufacturers you do not need to buy offtheshelf glow in the dark tackle  we suggest you simply take a store purchased spoon or lure and dip it in ultra green glow in the dark paint  you will need at least a  pint can for this to work  then hang it to dry for  minutes  when dry coat it with krylon crystal clear spray paint  now go fishing and enjoy yourself professional glow spoons manufacturers use airbrushes and masking to paint spoons  proper airbrush techniques can give you the ability to apply a smooth consistent surface with impressive fading effects  for tips on using an airbrush consult our painting techniques section  also remember to use a sealer professional glow lures if you mold your own lures you can add up to  of glow in the dark pigment powder directly to the medium before filling the mold  this makes a lure that glows from the inside and does not usually need a sealer night fishing with glow in the dark paint by rodney long when i received my bottles of ultra green glow paint i was really excited to try it on my fishing gear i wanted to see how much this stuff would make night fishing easier i am impressed this stuff really works and now im going to tell you how to make your night fishing more productive the premixed glow paint can be brushed or sprayed an airbrush is the best way to get an even coat of paint onto your tackle but since most fishermen will not have access to an air brush this article will cover brush painting if you are lucky enough to have an airbrush read the airbrush page on the glow inc website the thicker you apply the paint the brighter and more effective it will be that being said a light thin coat still does quite well some of glow inc’s products are waterproof and do not need an additional coat others like the ultra green i used for my testing require a clear sealer to protect them from moisture i found that krylon crystal clear spray paint as recommended by glow inc is the best solution it is readily available at any walmart or home depot for approximately  for fishing applications i like to add  coats of this sealer one of the biggest problems with night fishing is seeing your rod tips even good lighting and brightly colored rods are a bit tough to see the glow paint helps out here a lot but i just could not bring myself to paint the end of  fishing rods a great solution is to use a coffee stirrer or drinking straw depending on the diameter of your tip you cut the straw to a length of about  inches and then cut a slit up one side paint the straw with a thick coat of glow paint and sealer then slip it onto your rod in fact i personally paint the straw after i have it on the rod because it looses some flexibility after a thick coat of paint this works very well to let you watch your tips but you still have to directly watch them i am lazy which is what they say about all inventors so i developed a way to have the rod notify me when fish are biting i went to the local craft store and bought tiny cowbells some have mentioned they like using the ones they sell for fishing but i don’t prefer them paint your bells with your glow paint and sealer then attach them to the rod tip using a paper clip letting the bell hang loosely many people fish with floats at night paint the top of your floats with a bit of ultra green and the sealer to make them visible when fishing at night or in deep stained water you can use glow beads or glow lures to bring attention to your bait glow beads can be made from a ” standard craft store beads painted with the glow paint one or more of these beads can be threaded onto your line just above your hook when painting the beads we suggest that you string them on a line to keep the holes open i know they sell molded “glow beads” but these are about  as bright as beads painted with the ultra green glow paint a single glow bead in front of any lure or bait can really increase the number of fish caught at night some have mentioned painting the glow weights my experience is that the bead method allows you to get the “glow” closer to the hook the glow paint is also much more durable on a bead than on a weight since the ultra green glow paint puts out the same color as natural glowing deep water animals it does not spook the fish in the least the final piece of advice i can offer is on charging your new glow items you will want a bright light source or a uv light source onsite to keep your glow tackle not only glowing but glowing brightly an inexpensive way to accomplish this is with used disposable flash cameras which can be acquired free from most photo developers a better option is to buy a portable black light that runs on aa batteries these are available from spencer gifts for approximately  about the author rodney long is a designer of innovative fishing products for several major brands he owns the patents for dozens of products that are used in the fishing industry his biggest successes include the “boomerang fishing pro” “the long shot wiggle rig” “standout hooks” “mojos rock hopper” and “rig saver weights” more information on his products can be found on his website at httpezknotcom review of michigan stingers new glow in the dark lures by daniel clark as a photoluminescent chemist i didnt realize the level of bio engineering that goes into designing fishing tackle  to say the least i was surprised when i received a phone call from the engineer at michigan stinger requesting technical data  that call took place over two years ago  since then the stinger engineers have performed over a hundred laboratory and reallife tests to design an efficient high end lure  as i write this review their  line of glow lures are being distributed to tackle shops around the world   fish think about food like a hungry teenager  if they see something that looks appetizing they throw it in their mouth as fast as they can  therefore the biggest requirement of a great lure is that it can be seen from a distance  but the hard part is to design a lure that looks more appetizing than the local feeder fish  any mom that has to prepare healthy meals to compete with junk food will fully understand the complexity   there are about  companies currently manufacturing glow in the dark lures  the majority simply took existing lures and added a layer of the ultra green glow paint  while this definitely increases performance there was a lot of room for improvement  therefore i will detail some of the technical aspects of the new stinger line which sets them apart it is a fact that fish prefer their victims to have scales  for the last  years it was thought that shiny smooth lures had better performance  at the time this was true  shiny lures improved visibility at a distance when they reflected light from the surface  but photoluminescent pigment removes that benefit  careful observation of fish shows that a smooth shiny surface actually sometimes discouraged fish as they approached the lure to address this stingers engineers stamped tiny random hexagons into the metal of the lure  although the lure now had scales it was still a bit too shiny so they added a texture to the paint to eliminate reflections the second major fact is that fish like to eat raw fish  in japan they call this sushi  the best sushi is colorful and as such is more attractive  once again fish go crazy over something bright from a distance  but as they approach they want something that looks edible  while a mile island glowing green fish looks like caviar when you are starving it is not so appealing as a midday snack   for many years manufactures painted lures with a variety of contrasting colors in fish inspired shapes  no one has a doubt that this highly increases performance  but when it came to glow paint that knowledge went out the window when they started mimicking the colors and designs of the regular lures with different colors of glow paint they found it made a massive improvement  tests showed that fish would lock their radar at a distance and kept approaching right through the attack as you can see they made major technological improvements to something as basic and simple as a lure  they now had a lure that was visible at a distance and attractive as food at close range  but they decided to address another performance concern that they witnessed late in the process photoluminescent paint is highly visible in moderate to lowlight conditions  in moderate to bright conditions this long range visibility does not exist without some help  they addressed this issue with fluorescent pigments which convert uv light from the sun into a highly visible almost neon light  this is bright enough to increase longrange visibility yet it is not focused enough to discourage the predator although it is an expensive proposition for any manufacturer stinger actually adds regular pigment fluorescent pigment and photoluminescent pigment to every color of their new line of glow lures to the regular human these enhancements will not visibly be the most impressive  in fact lures made by other manufacturers are much prettier  but to a fish it is the difference between a greasy chicken mcnugget and a slow cooked basted turkey i commend michigan stinger for doing the research to produce a truly advanced product  if your favorite passtime is sitting on a boat relaxing and drinking beer than these highend lures are not for you  on the other hand if you like reelin em in then give technology a try you may consider glow lures the latest fad but michigan stingers long list of national fishing trophies backs their ability to do one thing  catch fish michigan stingers glow lures are distributed by advanced tackle  you can visit their website at wwwmistingercom  if you dont know the difference between a mouse and a keyboard you may be better off calling   newsletter
