so a coterie of aging diplomats convenes at the elegant metropolitan club of new york over lunch in a glassenclosed restaurant overlooking central park they engage in verbal thrust and parry over the foreign policy issues of the daythe man who sits at the head of the table is frank g wisner a bald barrelchested martinidrinking he gave up cigars friends say yearold retired ambassador and businessman like his lunch mates he is of a distinct class in washington a corps of foreign policy realists who came of age in an era when american power reigned supreme and who have the heft and experience to troubleshoot the crises of the momentwhen the united states and iran headed into a stalemate on nuclear issues during the administration of george w bush — who had branded iran part of the “axis of evil” — mr wisner was among several wellconnected former officials pursuing a “track two” process of backchannel communications to find a way out the effort fizzledwhen mr bush was contemplating war in iraq mr wisner joined with edward p djerejian another fellow former ambassador to publicly warn against it yet when mr bush needed help bringing kosovo to independence his state department deployed mr wisner as chief negotiator there he was successful advertisement continue reading the main story “he’s one of the supreme american diplomats of the last  to  years” said r nicholas burns who oversaw the kosovo talks as under secretary of state continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story this week mr wisner whose stints around the globe have included four ambassadorships one of them to egypt was briefly president obama’s man in cairo charged with prodding an old friend president hosni mubarak to make his exit how much effect he had was unclear on wednesday as mr mubarak resisted mr obama’s demand for an immediate peaceful transition and each side dug in its heels mr wisner left the country“he wasn’t sent there to flatter him and hold his hand” said leslie h gelb the longtime diplomat and journalist who cofounded the lunch club with mr wisner “he was sent there because he has a very close relationship with mubarak and because that’s the kind of person who can best deliver some hard messages”an imposing presence with a resonant voice whose last posting was as ambassador to india mr wisner has spent the years since his retirement in  operating at the nexus of diplomacy and business for more than a decade he was vice chairman of the insurance giant aig he left in  just as the company was getting bailed out by american taxpayers and joined the lobbying firm patton boggshe is well known in foreign policy circles but not beyond them unlike the late richard c holbrooke — the obama administration envoy to pakistan and afghanistan who was one of mr wisner’s best friends — he does not crave the limelight but he is respected enough that his name is being bandied about as a possible holbrooke replacement a job friends say he would be unlikely to take photo frank g wisner a diplomat who came of age when us power reigned supreme credit darko vojinovicassociated press “he’s not a flashy fellow in the sense that dick was” said morton i abramowitz another longtime diplomat who knows mr wisner well “but he’s very solid he studies the issues he’s a very serious guy who works very quietly very effectively and knows how to deal with people”mr gelb put it this way “dick saw being a public figure as part of the power he needed to do what he wanted frank was much more of an inside man”but as did mr holbrooke mr wisner relished the frisson of the diplomat’s life he has been married twice to uppercrust french women mr wisner’s current wife from whom he is separated was once married to pal sarkozy

the honorary title “he reveled in the role of being an ambassador he loved the substance and the trappings of the role and was very enthusiastic about representing the united states abroad”at the
