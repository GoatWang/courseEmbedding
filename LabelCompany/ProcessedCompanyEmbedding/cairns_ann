specifically it is alleged that mastercards and visas network rules prohibit atm operators from offering lower prices for transactions over pindebit networks that are not affiliated with visa or mastercard the suit says that this price fixing artificially raises the price that consumers pay using atms limits the revenue that atmoperators earn and violates the sherman acts prohibition against

majority of named class plaintiffs have objected and vowed to opt out of the settlement opponents object to provisions that would bar future lawsuits and even prevent merchants from opting out of significant portions of the proposed settlement stephen neuwirth a lawyer representing home depot said it’s so obvious visa and mastercard were prepared to make a large payment because of the scope of the releases being given it’s all one quid pro quo and merchants like the home depot are being denied the chance to opt out of that quid pro quo and say this is a bad deal  plaintiffs allege that visa mastercard and major credit card issuers engaged in a conspiracy to fix interchange fees also known as swipe fees that are charged to merchants for the privilege of accepting payment cards at artificially high levels in their complaint the plaintiffs also alleged that the defendants unfairly interfere with merchants from encouraging customers to use less expensive forms of payment such as lowercost cards cash and checks the settlement provides for the cash equivalent of a  basispoint reduction  percent of swipe fees charged to merchants for a period of eight months this eightmonth

to make a large payment because of the scope of the releases being given it’s all one quid pro quo and merchants like the home depot are being denied the chance to opt out of that quid pro quo and say this is a bad deal  plaintiffs allege that visa mastercard and major credit card issuers engaged in a conspiracy to fix interchange fees also known as swipe fees that are charged to merchants for the privilege of accepting payment cards at artificially high levels in their complaint the plaintiffs also alleged that the defendants unfairly interfere with merchants from encouraging customers to use less expensive forms of payment such as lowercost cards cash and checks the settlement provides for the cash equivalent of a  basispoint reduction  percent of swipe fees charged to merchants for a

privilege of accepting payment cards at artificially high levels in their complaint the plaintiffs also alleged that the defendants unfairly interfere with merchants from encouraging customers to use less expensive forms of payment such as lowercost cards cash and checks the settlement provides for the cash equivalent of a  basispoint reduction  percent of swipe fees charged to merchants for a
