fairlawn will bring new businesses to topeka including a marriott hotel a ninescreen theater a johnny’s tavern and a spin pizza   businessmen jim klausman and butch eaton purchased the acre property in  with the idea of creating a mixeduse development the first of its kind in topeka “we really wanted to create a lifestyle environment where we focused on living working and playing all in the same environment” said greg schwerdt president of schwerdt design group inc which designed the project “jim and butch early on did not want to develop anything that was just going to be a retail strip center” professionals with wheatfield development went in front of the topeka city council tuesday evening presenting a plan overview as they prepare to seek incentives for the project “development has moved in kansas from a lot of greenfield developments to redevelopment repositioning” said john petersen a real estate attorney at polsinelli overland park “extraordinary sites with extraordinary design and extraordinary ideas unfortunately come with extraordinary costs that don’t necessarily pencil in to your typical equitydebt type of financing structure” clearing off a site and bringing it up to top standards including moving utilities and other such work can be more expensive than building on the greenfield or new undeveloped sites he said both the tenants and  fairlawn llc are in business and need to get a return on their investment petersen said and infill developments like wheatfield usually require help from city incentives public hearings will be set on proposals the wheatfield developers have that would create a publicprivate partnership to make sure it happens as petersen tackles the complex issue of financing the project schwerdt and tenants who have committed to the development are focused on creating a new community that puts topeka ahead of anywhere else in kansas “i think the neat thing here is that jim and his group are way ahead of the curve in where the vision is going on a lot of these developments” said matt pennington president of drake development overland park “they don’t exist yet to see topeka get one of these first really ahead of kansas city is a testament to jim and the rest of these people who are here” as pennington sought tenants for the development schwerdt focused on creating a design that would match what klausman and eaton wanted to do green spaces or open parklike spaces are abundant at wheatfield meant to support a quality of life that is becoming popular nationwide and trending words like “walkability” using stone and wood to create a warm atmosphere schwerdt said the focus was on creating a community with a resort style a squarefoot pavilion area will offer a place for a southwest topeka farmer’s market and can be used for other outdoor activities or events he said in addition the design connects the shunga trail to wheatfield “we worked with the city to move the shunga trail from the north side of the creek to the south side” schwerdt said adding that they saved the city about  because they didn’t have to build a bridge anyone biking or walking the trail will be able to swing into wheatfield grab a cup of coffee at pt’s coffee lunch at johnny’s tavern or spin pizza and then head back to the trail he said apartment living the living component of the mixedused development is a unit apartment complex klausman and eaton will develop with epc real estate group kansas city mo an awardwinning multifamily developer they’re targeted to people seeking highquality living with quality amenities the apartment complex which is still in design stages will be the second phase of the project developed just shortly behind the other elements klausman said but he was excited about one design element that he referred to as wrap parking the parking will be in the center of the apartments which will “wrap” the structure “individuals can have indoor parking and they can walk directly out of their space right into the complex” klausman said adding that the design is efficient makes parking accessible and provides high security “we also provide some amenities such as private courtyards and pools that typically you wouldn’t find in this type of environment” schwerdt said topeka hasn’t seen the building of a highquality apartment complex in at least  years he said “there is a big demand for the quality type of facility that we’re looking at i think there’s a shortage in general and even more of a shortage of highend quality” schwerdt said a movie night out bb theatre is a yearold liberty mo company that is specializing in highend movie theaters with reclining seats full kitchens and a bar said brock bagby a fourthgeneration family member who is vice president of programming and business development bagby said a screen theater with a full kitchen bar and reclining seats is planned for the wheatfield site bb has  locations in seven states with about  screens he said they’ve been focused on remodeling many of their properties to include the amenities and finding success “thirtythree percent of our screens are now recliner seating a full lazboy and we’ve got almost  bars now and six kitchens” he said the ease of watching movies from home hasn’t hurt them at all bagby said “people that had stopped going to movies are coming back” he said “my grandpa always said that everybody has a kitchen but they go out to dinner you’ve got to get out of the house regardless of netflix home screening giant screens at home people still want to get out of the house and now we’re elevating the experience with recliners and food and a bar and massive walltowall curved screens” grab coffee and a bite to eat wheatfield will be home to pt’s coffee a new spin pizza and a johnny’s tavern brent boles spin developer who recently opened a location in lawrence has been seeking the perfect spot in topeka for months he intended to open topeka before lawrence but wanted to be in wheatfield “we’re kind of a unique style it’s called polished fast casual” he said of the restaurant “what that means is people come through decide what they want place their order and then they get fullservice at their table” the handspun homestyled pizza uses fresh ingredients and everything is made from scratch boles said being involved in the mixeduse development is exciting he added “people will be attracted to that the fact that we can park our car and walk to a movie theater and walk to a couple of different restaurants we don’t have that right now” fred polzin cfo of pt’s agreed that the concept makes a difference to his company “these type of developments are really really becoming more popular” he said “this will actually be our fourth location that’s involved directly with an apartmenttype complex we’ve got a few more potentially in the works we’ve found a lot of times that coffee shops and apartments go hand in hand because they create a nice customer base that’s there every day and that’s when a coffee shop really becomes a community for that area” the store will be the company’s first drivethru location polzin said johnny’s tavern is a wellknown lawrence bar and restaurant with nine locations in lawrence and the kansas city area spend the night or a few weeks liberty mobased ferguson properties will develop a townesuites place by marriott hotel at wheatfield an extended stay upscale concept by the international marriott brand “it has nice amenities like full kitchens in each room a nice pool outdoor grilling areas” said jeff sharp ferguson vice president his company currently is developing two townsuites marriott hotels in hays and leavenworth the company has been a longtime marriott franchisee “this is a really nice product that we’re going to build and we helped jim klausman analyze this market on what would be built here and what would do well” sharp said he reiterated what petersen said about incentives adding that they will be crucial to the continuation of the development development of the hotel will require investment of  to  million sharp said being a part of wheatfield offers the company the “full package” of amenities and this will be the first time ferguson development has been involved with a mixeduse development like this one moving forward bob johnson a polsinelli attorney presented the development to the city council depending on how quickly public hearings are set and things move forward klausman and schwerdt are hopeful to begin clearing the site by fall “what we really have here is a local homegrown developer that’s taking a big risk” johnson said “he’s taking a risk on a new concept in this community it will take a publicprivate partnership to bring the level that jim wants to bring to topeka and what these tenants expect and deserve” for klausman wheatfield is an investment but it’s also a little bit of touching his roots when he and eaton founded midwest health services an early office  years ago as they built their business was in a little strip mall on the sw th and fairlawn property they purchased he laughed “it was not the best office space in town” all it takes is  million incentives

of different restaurants we don’t have that right now” fred polzin cfo of pt’s agreed that the concept makes a difference to his company “these type of developments are really really becoming more popular” he said “this will actually be our fourth location that’s involved directly with an apartmenttype complex we’ve got a few more potentially in the works we’ve found a lot of times that coffee shops and apartments go hand in hand because they create a nice customer base that’s there every day and that’s when a coffee shop really becomes a community for that area” the store will be the

are hopeful to begin clearing the site by fall “what we really have here is a local homegrown developer that’s taking a big risk” johnson said “he’s taking a risk on a new concept in this community it will take a publicprivate partnership to bring the level that jim wants to bring to topeka and what these tenants expect and deserve” for klausman wheatfield is an investment but it’s also a little
