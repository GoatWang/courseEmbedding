research analystthe information networksummarycabot microelectronics led the semiconductor cmp slurry business with a market share more than twice that of its closest competitor in versum materials slid from second place to third as it lost share to japanese suppliers hitachi chemical fujimi and fijifilmcabot microelectronics and versum materials lost market share to asian slurry suppliers in  chemical mechanical planarization nysecmp is a process used in semiconductor manufacturing whereby the surface of the wafer is leveled and smoothed using abrasive slurries the process is used following every depositionetch step and is critical to precise lithography patterning one of the growth drivers for cmp slurry is d nand and d finfet devices i noted in a january   seeking alpha article entitled applied materials  exposure to euv lithography will stunt longterm growth that current duv immersion is viable for processing devices with nm features below that engineers employ multiple patterning steps as a way of extending the duv lithography tool these multiple processing steps are depositionetch intensively utilizing equipment from applied materials nasdaqamat and lam research nasdaqlrcx and others in other words semiconductor manufacturers are utilizing multiple patterning processes requiring extensive use of deposition and etch equipment to avoid purchasing the extremely expensive euv lithography equipment so until euv becomes production worthy over the next couple of years when the nm node is reached cmp will benefit from the extension of immersion duv using multiple patterning euv will only be utilized in the foreseeable future by intel nasdaqintc tsmc and samsung electronics otcssnlf unfortunately cabot microelectronics nasdaqccmp has a  exposure to euv because tsmc and samsung each accounted for approximately  of revenue in  but again the impact of euv on ccmp is long term according to our report entitled cmp technology competition products markets cabot microelectronics maintained its dominance in the cmp slurry business although market share dropped one point the company is facing competition from korean cmp slurry companies kc tech soulbrain and cheil for its position at samsung electronics according to the report versum materials nysevsm dropped from second to third place in the cmp market as the company was replaced at the number two position by hitachi chemical versum lost more than one point in share not only to hitachi chemical but to other japanese suppliers fujimi and fijifilm vsms exposure to euv is even worse in fiscal  intel samsung and tsmc accounted for  of sales these are companywide sales not just cmp slurry as the company does not transparently provide these type of data versum officially spun off from air products nyseapd on october   and then began operations as an independent public company prior to the spin off the company operated as da nanomaterials which had been a joint venture between apd and dupont nysedd until apd purchased dds  share in  i discussed the spin off in a december   seeking alpha article entitled air products  the more things change the more they remain the same dow chemical nysedow maintained sixth place behind the above mentioned companies investor takeaway ccmp is one of the original suppliers of cmp slurry having spun off of cabot corp nysecbt in  it has an established customer base and counts tsmc and samsung electronics among its largest customers it lost market share in the past in the copper slurry business but continues to be strong in tungsten and dielectric slurries the company continues to grow organically and through acquisitions particularly in the cmp pad business vsm is strong in copper slurries and is focusing on enhancing its shallow trench isolation nysesti slurry product but the sti slurry sector is dominated by hitachi chemical and other companies such as ferro corp nysefoe are also working on improving their sti product vsm
