partnerships annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended march     organization   wnc housing tax credit fund vi lp series  the “partnership” is a california limited partnership formed under the laws of the state of california on july   and commenced operations on august   the partnership was formed to acquire limited partnership interests in other limited partnerships local limited partnerships which own multifamily housing complexes “housing complexes” that are eligible for federal low income housing tax credits “low income housing tax credits” the local general partners the “local general partners” of each local limited partnership retain responsibility for maintaining operating and managing the housing complex each local limited partnership is governed by its agreement of limited partnership the “local limited partnership agreement”   the general partner of the partnership is wnc  associates inc “associates” or the “general partner” the chairman and the president of associates own all of the outstanding stock of associates the business of the partnership is conducted primarily through the general partner as the partnership has no employees of its own   the partnership shall continue in full force and effect until december   unless terminated prior to that date pursuant to the partnership agreement or law   the financial statements include only activity relating to the business of the partnership and do not give effect to any assets that the partners may have outside of their interests in the partnership or to any obligations including income taxes of the partners   the partnership agreement authorized the sale of up to  units of limited partnership interest “partnership units” at  per partnership unit the offering of partnership units concluded in july  at which time  partnership units representing subscriptions in the amount of  net of dealer discounts of  and volume discount of  had been sold the general partner has a  interest in operating profits and losses taxable income and losses cash available for distribution from the partnership and low income housing tax credits of the partnership the investors the “limited partners” in the partnership will be allocated the remaining  of these items in proportion to their respective investments as of september   and march   a total of  partnership units remain outstanding      wnc housing tax credit fund vi lp series   a california limited partnership   notes to condensed financial statements  continued for the quarterly period ended september    unaudited   note   summary of significant accounting policies continued   the proceeds from the disposition of any of the housing complexes will be used first to pay debts and other obligations per the respective local limited partnership agreement any remaining proceeds will then be paid to the partnership the sale of a housing complex may be subject to other restrictions and obligations accordingly there can be no assurance that a local limited partnership will be able to sell its housing complex even if it does so there can be no assurance that any significant amounts of cash will be distributed to the partnership should such distributions occur the limited partners will be entitled to receive distributions from the proceeds remaining after payment of partnership obligations and funding reserves equal to their capital contributions and their return on investment as defined in the partnership agreement the general partner would then be entitled to receive proceeds equal to its capital contributions from the remainder any additional sale or refinancing proceeds will be distributed  to the limited partners in proportion to their respective investments and  to the general partner   risks and uncertainties   an investment in the partnership and the partnership’s investments in local limited partnerships and their housing complexes are subject to risks these risks may impact the tax benefits of an investment in the partnership and the amount of proceeds available for distribution to the limited partners if any on liquidation of the partnership’s investments some of those risks include the following   the low income housing tax credits rules are extremely complicated noncompliance with these rules results in the loss of future low income housing tax credits and the fractional recapture of low income housing tax credits already taken in most cases the annual amount of low income housing tax credits that an individual can use is limited to the tax liability due on the person’s last  of taxable income the local limited partnerships may be unable to sell the housing complexes at a price which would result in the partnership realizing cash distributions or proceeds from the transaction accordingly the partnership may be unable to distribute any cash to its limited partners low income housing tax credits may be the only benefit from an investment in the partnership   the partnership has invested in a limited number of local limited partnerships such limited diversity means that the results of operation of each single housing complex will have a greater impact on the partnership with limited diversity poor performance of one housing complex could impair the partnership’s ability to satisfy its investment objectives each housing complex is subject to mortgage indebtedness if a local limited partnership failed to pay its mortgage it could lose its housing complex in foreclosure if foreclosure were to occur during the first  years the “compliance period” the loss of any remaining future low income housing tax credits a fractional recapture of prior low income housing tax credits and a loss of the partnership’s investment in the housing complex would occur the partnership is a limited partner or a nonmanaging member of each local limited partnership accordingly the partnership will have very limited rights with respect to management of the local limited partnerships the partnership will rely totally on the local general partners neither the partnership’s investments in local limited partnerships nor the local limited partnerships’ investments in housing complexes are readily marketable to the extent the housing complexes receive government financing or operating subsidies they may be subject to one or more of the following risks difficulties in obtaining tenants for the housing complexes difficulties in obtaining rent increases limitations on cash distributions limitations on sales or refinancing of housing complexes limitations on transfers of interests in local limited partnerships limitations on removal of local general partners limitations on subsidy programs and possible changes in applicable regulations uninsured casualties could result in loss of property and low income housing tax credits and recapture of low income housing tax credits previously taken the value of real estate is subject to risks from fluctuating economic conditions including employment rates inflation tax environmental land use and zoning policies supply and demand of similar properties and neighborhood conditions among others      wnc housing tax credit fund vi lp series   a california limited partnership   notes to condensed financial statements  continued for the quarterly period ended september    unaudited   note   summary of significant accounting policies continued   the ability of limited partners to claim tax losses from the partnership is limited the irs may audit the partnership or a local limited partnership and challenge the tax treatment of tax items the amount of low income housing tax credits and tax losses allocable to the limited partners could be reduced if the irs were successful in such a challenge the alternative minimum tax could reduce tax benefits from an investment in the partnership changes in tax laws could also impact the tax benefits from an investment in the partnership andor the value of the housing complexes   the partnership currently has insufficient working capital to fund its operations associates has agreed to continue providing advances sufficient enough to fund the operations and working capital requirements of the partnership through november     anticipated future and existing cash resources of the partnership are not sufficient to pay existing liabilities of the partnership however substantially all of the existing liabilities of the partnership are payable to the general partner andor its affiliates though the amounts payable to the general partner andor its affiliates are contractually currently payable the partnership anticipates that the general partner andor its affiliates will not require the payment of these contractual obligations until capital reserves are in excess of the aggregate of then existing contractual obligations and then anticipated future foreseeable obligations of the partnership the partnership would be adversely affected should the general partner andor its affiliates demand current payment of the existing contractual obligations and or suspend services for this or any other reason   no trading market for the partnership units exists or is expected to develop limited partners may be unable to sell their partnership units except at a discount and should consider their partnership units to be a longterm investment individual limited partners will have no recourse if they disagree with actions authorized by a vote of the majority of limited partners   exit strategy   the compliance period for a housing complex is generally  years following construction or rehabilitation completion associates was one of the first in the industry to offer syndicated investments in low income housing tax credits the initial programs have completed their compliance periods   upon the sale of a local limited partnership interest or housing complex after the end of the compliance period there would be no recapture of low income housing tax credits a sale prior to the end of the compliance period could result in recapture if certain conditions are not met none of the remaining housing complexes have completed their year compliance period   with that in mind the general partner is continuing its review of the housing complexes the review considers many factors including extended use requirements such as those due to mortgage restrictions or state compliance agreements the condition of the housing complexes and the tax consequences to the limited partners from the sale of the housing complexes   upon identifying those housing complexes with the highest potential for a successful sale refinancing or resyndication the partnership expects to proceed with efforts to liquidate them the objective is to maximize the limited partners’ return wherever possible and ultimately to wind down the partnership as low income housing tax credits are no longer available local limited partnership interests may be disposed of any time by the general partner in its discretion while liquidation of the housing complexes continues to be evaluated the dissolution of the partnership was not imminent as of september     as of march   the partnership sold its local limited partnership interests in mendota i lp “mendota” villas of palm lp “villas of palm” preservation partners iii limited partnership “preservation” and calico terrace limited partnership “calico terrace” the compliance period for mendota preservation and calico terrace expire in   and  respectively the respective purchasers have guaranteed that the llp will stay in compliance with the low income housing tax credit code therefore there is no risk of recapture to the investors of the partnership          wnc housing tax credit fund vi lp series   a california limited partnership   notes to condensed financial statements  continued for the quarterly period ended september    unaudited   note   summary of significant accounting policies continued   as of september   the partnership has identified the following local limited partnerships for possible disposition   local limited partnership

       saw mill creek ii ldha lp                        estimated price and close date have yet to be determined the local limited partnership is not under contract to be purchased as of the report filing   the proceeds from the disposition of any of the housing complexes will be used first to pay debts and other obligations per the respective local limited partnership agreement any remaining proceeds will then be paid to the partners of the local limited partnership including the partnership in accordance with the terms of the particular local limited partnership agreement the sale of a housing complex may be subject to other restrictions and obligations accordingly there can be no assurance that a local limited partnership will be able to sell its housing complex even if it does so there can be no assurance that any significant amounts of cash will be distributed to the partnership as the proceeds first would be used to pay local limited partnership obligations and funding of reserves   method of accounting for investments in local limited partnerships   the partnership accounts for its investments in local limited partnerships using the equity method of accounting whereby the partnership adjusts its investment balance for its share of the local limited partnerships’ results of operations and for any contributions made and distributions received the partnership reviews the carrying amount of an individual investment in a local limited partnership for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such investment may not be recoverable recoverability of such investment is measured by the estimated value derived by management generally consisting of the sum of the remaining future low income housing tax credits estimated to be allocable to the partnership and the estimated residual value to the partnership if an investment is considered to be impaired the partnership reduces the carrying value of its investment in any such local limited partnership the accounting policies of the local limited partnerships generally are expected to be consistent with those of the partnership costs incurred by the partnership in acquiring the investments were capitalized as part of the investment and were being amortized over  years   “equity in losses of local limited partnerships” for the periods ended september   and  has been recorded by the partnership management’s estimate for the three and sixmonth periods is based on either actual unaudited results reported by the local limited partnerships or historical trends in the operations of the local limited partnerships equity in losses of local limited partnerships allocated to the partnership is not recognized to the extent that the investment balance would be adjusted below zero if the local limited partnerships report net income in future years the partnership will resume applying the equity method only after its share of such net income equals the share of net losses not recognized during the periods the equity method was suspended see note    in accordance with the accounting guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities the partnership determines when it should include the assets liabilities and activities of a variable interest entity vie in its financial statements and when it should disclose information about its relationship with a vie the analysis that must be performed to determine which entity should consolidate a vie focuses on control and economic factors a vie is a legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets which must be consolidated by a company if it is the primary beneficiary because it has  the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vies economic performance and  the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie if multiple unrelated parties share such power as defined no party will be required to consolidate the vie further the guidance requires continual reconsideration of the primary beneficiary of a vie      wnc housing tax credit fund vi lp series   a california limited partnership   notes to condensed financial statements  continued for the quarterly period ended september    unaudited   note   summary of significant accounting policies continued   based on this guidance the local limited partnerships in which the partnership invests meet the definition of a vie because the owners of the equity at risk in these entities do not have the power to direct their operations however management does not consolidate the partnerships interests in these vies as it is not considered to be the primary beneficiary since it does not have the power to direct the activities that are considered most significant to the economic performance of these entities the partnership currently records the amount of its investment in these local limited partnerships as an asset on its balance sheets recognizes its share of partnership income or losses in the statements of operations and discloses how it accounts for material types of these investments in its financial statements the partnerships balance in investment in local limited partnerships plus the risk of recapture of tax credits previously recognized on these investments represents its maximum exposure to loss the partnerships exposure to loss on these local limited partnerships is mitigated by the condition and financial performance of the underlying housing complexes as well as the strength of the local general partners and their guarantee against credit recapture to the investors in the partnership   dis   forbidden access is denied server error   forbidden access is denied you do not have

companies however applicants request an exemption under section c and e of the act from all provisions of the act except sections  through  of the act and the rules and regulations under those sections  section aa of the act provides that an issuer is an “investment company” if it is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily or proposes to engage primarily in the business of investing reinvesting or trading in securities applicants believe that the fund will not be an investment company under section aa because the fund will be in the business of investing in and being beneficial owner of apartment complexes not securities  section ac of the act provides that an issuer is an “investment company” if it is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing reinvesting owning holding or trading in securities and owns or proposes to acquire “investment securities” having a value exceeding  of the value of such issuers total assets exclusive of government securities and cash items applicants state that although the local limited partnership interests may be deemed “investment securities” they are not readily marketable cannot be sold without severe adverse tax consequences and have no value apart from the value of the apartment complexes owned by the local limited partnerships  applicants believe that the twotier structure is consistent with the purposes and criteria set forth in the commissions release concerning twotier real estate partnerships the start printed page “release” the release states that investment companies that are twotier real estate partnerships that invest in limited partnerships engaged in the development and operation of housing for low and moderate income persons may qualify for an exemption from the act pursuant to section c section c provides that the commission may exempt any person from any provision of the act and any rule thereunder if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act section e permits the commission to require companies exempted from the registration requirements of the act to comply with certain specified provisions of the act as though the company were a registered investment company  the release lists two conditions designed for the protection of investors which must be satisfied by twotier partnerships to qualify for the exemption under section c first interests in the issuer should be sold only to persons for whom investments in limited profit essentially taxshelter investments would not be unsuitable second requirements for fair dealing by the general partner of the issuer with the limited partners of the issuer should be included in the basic organizational documents of the company  applicants assert among other things that the suitability standards set forth in the application the requirements for fair dealing provided by the partnership agreement and pertinent governmental regulations imposed on each local limited partnership by various federal state and local agencies provide protection to investors in units in addition applicants assert that the requested exemption is both necessary and appropriate in the public interest start signature for the commission by the division of investment
