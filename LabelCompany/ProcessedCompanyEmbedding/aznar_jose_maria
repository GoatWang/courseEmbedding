government maintained the commitment of the previous government to join the european unions single currency and showed itself willing to take political risks in order to meet the requirements for membership in the middle of  it announced a decision to freeze the wages of civil servants in the following year and stood by that decision throughout the fall despite a series of unionled demonstrations that culminated in protest marches by tens of thousands of spaniards throughout the nation on  december the government with the backing of regional nationalist parties passed a strict  budget on  december four days before time would have run out for its approval the opposition united left coalition argued that the spending cuts and tax adjustments contained in the budget would hurt the disadvantaged and benefit the rich the budget aimed to enable spain to lower its deficit to below  of gross domestic product a requirement for joining the eus single currency some critics note that this wasnt the only way of doing so the government was also forced to back down on a plan to reduce spanish dependence on its own highpriced coal when hundreds of coal miners blocked highways and demonstrated in november the miners persuaded the government to adjust a national electricity plan that would have phased out the subsidy of spanish coal making it more expensive than imported coal aznar also announced the sale early in  of the nations remaining minority stake golden shares in the telefónica telecommunications company and the petroleum group repsol these golden shares in telefónica and repsol ypf as well as in endesa argentaria and tabacalera all presided over by people close to aznar have since been declared illegal by the european union this marked the beginning of a period of privatizations after the previous psoe government had nationalized parts of the economy after the pps first year in office the goodwill between it and the major nationalist parties in the legislature convergence and unity ciu and the basque nationalist party pnv appeared to have lost strength both parties had enjoyed leverage over the previous psoe government and the pnv in particular stepped back from colluding too closely with the government ecological issues came to the fore in spain during  a vigorous public debate created a new awareness of topics such as environmental pollution and deforestation and a host of organizations competed to spread the ecological message the government conscious of the political implications of this new concern was also party to the debate and promised active cooperation as a reaction against attempts to liberalize the current abortion laws roman catholic groups renewed their antiabortion campaigns the economy suffered the effects of the global recession unleashed by the financial crisis in asia and the economic ministry reduced its  economic growth estimate from  to  the sharp decline in share prices on the madrid and barcelona stock exchanges on average about  created cause for concern among both business associations and trade unions the latter voiced their concern about the risk of increased unemployment which remained around  despite this slowdown salaries increased by an average of  that year in  the european union introduced the euro a major success for aznar and his government steady economic growth and falling unemployment though the rate exceeded all other eu member states won the government public support the governments credibility was damaged when the psoe revealed at the end of the year that the ranks of top spanish civil servants had increased  over the previous year despite pp promises to cut the bureaucracy second term –edit barroso blair bush and aznar in the azores spanish voters reelected aznar in the  general election with an outright majority the pp obtained  of the vote and  seats the spanish electorates participation was the lowest for a general election in spain in the postfranco era spain was one of the fastestgrowing economies in the european union eu in  despite inflation nearing  and signs of an economic slowdowncitation needed however the governments problems involved politics as much as policies a number of issues were handled clumsily including implementation of immigration legislation passed in january and a health scare over lowquality olive oil in july in the autumn complaints that the government was steamrolling controversial university reforms through the parliament inflamed the opposition at the end of the year students all over the country joined in strikes demonstrations and sitins often alongside their rectors and professors though still outperforming most of its eu partners spain failed to escape the effects of the global economic downturn in  falling exports declining domestic consumption and a sharp drop in tourist revenue helped bring annual gross domestic product growth down to an estimated  the lowest level since  in addition rising crime rates and soaring house prices up almost  since  were the object of widespread public concern providing opposition parties with powerful ammunition against aznars government the government ran into even deeper trouble in its attempt to reform the unemployment benefit system a controversial decreelaw issued on  may introduced new restrictions on entitlement to benefits making it harder for those receiving welfare to turn down jobs offered by the public employment agency and phasing out the special subsidy for agricultural workers in the south the trade unions reacted by calling a hour general strike on  june embarrassing the government on the eve of an eu summit in seville the stoppage proved a largely unexpected success on  october just two days after a major national demonstration in madrid to protest against the law new labor minister eduardo zaplana announced an abrupt uturn accepting nearly all of the unions demands and leaving only the reform of the subsidy for farm laborers on the statute book a major secondaryeducation bill also proved controversial intended to raise educational standards the proposed law of quality lowered the age at which students were streamed into different educational tracks allowed special schools in the state sector to select on merit and introduced a new secondaryschoolleaving exam opposition to the bills potential socially divisive effects and inadequate funding for the public educational system brought student organizations trade unions and leftwing parties into the streets as the bill was being debated in the parliament in october amid the relatively stagnant european economies estimated gdp growth of  made spain the second fastestgrowing economy in the european union in  continued expansion enabled the spanish government to proclaim proudly that it would end the year with a budget surplus for the first time in recent history however inflation was running at  compared with the eus  in november unemployment stood at more than  almost onethird of the workforce had temporary contracts and housing prices were spiraling the european commission shared analysts concerns that a hike in interest rates or increased unemployment could send housing prices tumbling with disastrous consequences for families burdened with unprecedented levels of debt and for the financial institutions that had given them loans aznar and george w bush in february  aznar supported the us invasion of iraq that year despite major domestic opposition after six years of relative political calm when political debate was dominated by a consensus within the ruling party on economics regional nationalism and terrorism several issues arose which polarized spanish public opinion like uk prime minister tony blair aznar actively supported the united states war on terrorism despite public opposition aznar met with bush in a private meeting before  invasion of iraq to discuss the situation of in the un security council el país leaked a partial transcript of the meeting the government handling of the wreckage of the greek prestige tanker near the spanish coast which resulted in a major ecological disaster also became a divisive issue he actively encouraged and supported the bush administrations foreign policy and the us invasion of iraq in  defending it on the basis of secret intelligence allegedly containing evidence of the iraqi governments nuclear proliferation the majority of the spanish population including some pp members were against the war spains major cities were the scene of the largest street demonstrations ever seen in the country as a result of the governments participation in the invasion aznar lost some support from those who had voted for the pp in  on a live tv interview aired on the public station while demonstrations were taking place on the streets he asked the spanish people to take his word assuring there were weapons of mass destruction in iraq of which he had evidence this is now regarded as incorrect in january  aznar called a general election and designated his successor as candidate mariano rajoy sticking to a pledge of not seeking office for a third term despite political tensions polls suggested that the popular party was set to win a third consecutive election on the strength of the economy an opinion poll carried out by the governmentrun cis which had estimated that  of the spanish people did not support the war in iraq in february  estimated that the pp would win an election with  of the vote while the psoe would only get citation needed madrid train bombings and end of termedit main article  madrid train bombings three days before the  general election  bombs killed  people in the  march  madrid train bombings initially the government and the opposition stated publicly that it was possible the bombings may have been the work of eta however the pp government continued to blame eta even after evidence that the attacks may have been the work of an islamist group emerged having the minister of foreign affairs ana palacio instruct all spanish diplomats to place the blame on eta at every opportunity the public perception that the government hid information from the general population gave rise to a public outcry two days after the atocha bombings demonstrations took place across spain demanding news from the investigation where chants such as we want the truth before we vote and who is responsible were heard three days after the train bombings the opposition psoe won the elections the subsequent investigations held by a parliamentary committee were characterized by bitter partisan exchanges between the different political parties with dispute over who may have been responsible for the bombings aznar appeared before the committee in november  and declared his belief that the authors of the bombings were not to be found in faraway deserts or remote mountains aznar said in  that he

political risks in order to meet the requirements for membership in the middle of  it announced a decision to freeze the wages of civil servants in the following year and stood by that decision throughout the fall despite a series of unionled demonstrations that culminated in protest marches by tens of thousands of spaniards throughout the nation on  december the government with the backing of regional nationalist parties passed a strict  budget on  december four days before time would have run out for its approval the opposition united left coalition argued that the spending cuts and tax adjustments contained in the budget would hurt the disadvantaged and benefit the rich the budget aimed to enable spain to lower its deficit to below  of gross domestic product a requirement for joining the eus single currency some critics note that this wasnt the only way of doing so the government was also forced to back down on a plan to reduce spanish dependence on its own highpriced coal when hundreds of coal miners blocked highways and demonstrated in november the miners persuaded the government to adjust a national electricity plan that would have phased out the subsidy of spanish coal making it more expensive than imported coal aznar also announced the sale early in  of the nations remaining minority stake golden shares in the telefónica telecommunications company and the petroleum group repsol these golden shares in telefónica and repsol ypf as well as in endesa argentaria and tabacalera all presided over by people close to aznar have since been declared illegal by the european union this marked the beginning of a period of privatizations after the previous psoe government had nationalized parts of the economy after the pps first year in office the goodwill between it and the major nationalist parties in the legislature convergence and unity ciu and the basque nationalist party pnv appeared to have lost strength both parties had enjoyed leverage over the previous psoe government and the pnv in particular stepped back from colluding too closely with the government ecological issues came to the fore in spain during  a vigorous public debate created a new awareness of topics such as environmental pollution and deforestation and a host of organizations competed to spread the ecological message the government conscious of the political implications of this new concern was also party to the debate and promised active cooperation as a reaction against attempts to liberalize the current abortion laws roman catholic groups renewed their antiabortion campaigns the economy suffered the effects of the global recession unleashed by the financial crisis in asia and the economic ministry reduced its  economic growth estimate from  to  the sharp decline in share prices on the madrid and barcelona stock exchanges on average about  created cause for concern among both business associations and trade unions the latter voiced their concern about the risk of increased unemployment which remained around  despite this slowdown salaries increased by an average of  that year in  the european union introduced the euro a major success for aznar and his government steady economic growth and falling unemployment though the rate exceeded all other eu member states won the government public support the governments credibility was damaged when the psoe revealed at the end of the year that the ranks of top spanish civil servants had increased  over the previous year despite pp promises to cut the bureaucracy second term –edit barroso blair bush and aznar in the azores spanish voters reelected aznar in the  general election with an outright majority the pp obtained  of the vote and  seats the spanish electorates participation was the lowest for a general election in spain in the postfranco era spain was one of the fastestgrowing economies in the european union eu in  despite inflation nearing  and signs of an economic slowdowncitation needed however the governments problems involved politics as much as policies a number of issues were handled clumsily including implementation of immigration legislation passed in january and a health scare over lowquality olive oil in july in the autumn complaints that the government was steamrolling controversial university reforms through the parliament inflamed the opposition at the end of the year students all over the country joined in strikes demonstrations and sitins often alongside their rectors and professors though still outperforming most of its eu partners spain failed to escape the effects of the global economic downturn in  falling exports declining domestic consumption and a sharp drop in tourist revenue helped bring annual gross domestic product growth down to an estimated  the lowest level since  in addition rising crime rates and soaring house prices up almost  since  were the object of widespread public concern providing opposition parties with powerful ammunition against aznars government the government ran into even deeper trouble in its attempt to reform the unemployment benefit system a controversial decreelaw issued on  may introduced new restrictions on entitlement to benefits making it harder for those receiving welfare to turn down jobs offered by the public employment agency and phasing out the special subsidy for agricultural workers in the south the trade unions reacted by calling a hour general strike on  june embarrassing the government on the eve of an eu summit in seville the stoppage proved a largely unexpected success on  october just two days after a major national demonstration in madrid to protest against the law new labor minister eduardo zaplana announced an abrupt uturn accepting nearly all of the unions demands and leaving only the reform of the subsidy for farm laborers on the statute book a major secondaryeducation bill also proved controversial intended to raise educational standards the proposed law of quality lowered the age at which students were streamed into different educational tracks allowed special schools in the state sector to select on merit and introduced a new secondaryschoolleaving exam opposition to the bills potential socially divisive effects and inadequate funding for the public educational system brought student organizations trade unions and leftwing parties into the streets as the bill was being debated in the parliament in october amid the relatively stagnant european economies estimated gdp growth of  made spain the second fastestgrowing economy in the european union in  continued expansion enabled the spanish government to proclaim proudly that it would end the year with a budget surplus for the first time in recent history however inflation was running at  compared with the eus  in november unemployment stood at more than  almost onethird of the workforce had temporary contracts and housing prices were spiraling the european commission shared analysts concerns that a hike in interest rates or increased unemployment could send housing prices tumbling with disastrous consequences for families burdened with unprecedented levels of debt and for the financial institutions that had given them loans aznar and george w bush in february  aznar supported the us invasion of iraq that year despite major domestic opposition after six years of relative political calm when political debate was dominated by a consensus within the ruling party on economics regional nationalism and terrorism several issues arose which polarized spanish public opinion like uk prime minister tony blair aznar actively supported the united states war on terrorism despite public opposition aznar met with bush in a private meeting before  invasion of iraq to discuss the situation of in the un security council el país leaked a partial transcript of the meeting the government handling of the wreckage of the greek prestige tanker near the spanish coast which resulted in a major ecological disaster also became a divisive issue he actively encouraged and supported the bush administrations foreign policy and the us invasion of iraq in  defending it on the basis of secret intelligence allegedly containing evidence of the iraqi governments nuclear proliferation the majority of the spanish population including some pp members were against the war spains major cities were the scene of the largest street demonstrations ever seen in the country as a result of the governments participation in the invasion aznar lost some support from those who had voted for the pp in  on a live tv interview aired on the public station while demonstrations were taking place on the streets he asked the spanish people to take his word assuring there were weapons of mass destruction in iraq of which he had evidence this is now regarded as incorrect in january  aznar called a general election and designated his successor as candidate mariano rajoy sticking to a pledge of not seeking office for a third term despite political tensions polls suggested that the popular party was set to win a third consecutive election on the strength of the economy an opinion poll carried out by the governmentrun cis which had estimated that  of the spanish people did not support the war in iraq in february  estimated that the pp would win an election with  of the vote while the psoe would only get citation needed madrid train bombings and end of termedit main article  madrid train bombings three days before the  general election  bombs killed  people in the  march  madrid train bombings initially the government and the opposition stated publicly that it was possible the bombings may have been the work of eta however the pp government continued to blame eta even after evidence that the attacks may have been the work of an islamist group emerged having the minister of foreign affairs ana palacio instruct all spanish diplomats to place the blame on eta at every opportunity the public perception that the government hid information from the general population gave rise to a public outcry two days after the atocha bombings demonstrations took place across spain demanding news from the investigation where chants such as we want the truth before we vote and who is responsible were heard three days after the train bombings the opposition psoe won the elections the subsequent investigations held by a parliamentary committee were characterized by bitter partisan exchanges between the different political parties with dispute over who may have been responsible for the bombings aznar appeared before the committee in november  and declared his belief that the authors of the bombings were not to be found in faraway deserts or remote mountains aznar said in

aznar said that anthropogenic climate change is a scientifically questionable theory which had become a religion and whose followers were enemies of freedom these views were similar to those expressed by klaus in his book blue planet in green shackles which was published in spanish by faes aznars speech caused some puzzlement as his government had been a signatory to the kyoto protocol in  and it appeared that he had subsequently changed his mind about climate change in  aznar was due to speak to a heartland institute conference which was billed as the worlds largestever gathering of global warming skeptics he withdrew at short notice and in the absence of a public explanation there was speculation that he did so in order to spare his party embarrassment the peoples party distanced

political risks in order to meet the requirements for membership in the middle of  it announced a decision to freeze the wages of civil servants in the following year and stood by that decision throughout the fall despite a series of unionled demonstrations that culminated in protest marches by tens of thousands of spaniards throughout the nation on  december the government with the backing of regional nationalist parties passed a strict  budget on  december four days before time would have run out for its approval the opposition united left coalition argued that the spending cuts and tax adjustments contained in the budget would hurt the disadvantaged and benefit the rich the budget aimed to enable spain to lower its deficit to below  of gross domestic product a requirement for joining the eus single currency some critics note that this wasnt the only way of doing so the government was also forced to back down on a plan to reduce spanish dependence on its own highpriced coal when hundreds of coal miners blocked highways and demonstrated in november the miners persuaded the government to adjust a national electricity plan that would have phased out the subsidy of spanish coal making it more expensive than imported coal aznar also announced the sale early in  of the nations remaining minority stake golden shares in the telefónica telecommunications company and the petroleum group repsol these golden shares in telefónica and repsol ypf as well as in endesa argentaria and tabacalera all presided over by people close to aznar have since been declared illegal by the european union this marked the beginning of a period of privatizations after the previous psoe government had nationalized parts of the economy after the pps first year in office the goodwill between it and the major nationalist parties in the legislature convergence and unity ciu and the basque nationalist party pnv appeared to have lost strength both parties had enjoyed leverage over the previous psoe government and the pnv in particular stepped back from colluding too closely with the government ecological issues came to the fore in spain during  a vigorous public debate created a new awareness of topics such as environmental pollution and deforestation and a host of organizations competed to spread the ecological message the government conscious of the political implications of this new concern was also party to the debate and promised active cooperation as a reaction against attempts to liberalize the current abortion laws roman catholic groups renewed their antiabortion campaigns the economy suffered the effects of the global recession unleashed by the financial crisis in asia and the economic ministry reduced its  economic growth estimate from  to  the sharp decline in share prices on the madrid and barcelona stock exchanges on average about  created cause for concern among both business associations and trade unions the latter voiced their concern about the risk of increased unemployment which remained around  despite this slowdown salaries increased by an average of  that year in  the european union introduced the euro a major success for aznar and his government steady economic growth and falling unemployment though the rate exceeded all other eu member states won the government public support the governments credibility was damaged when the psoe revealed at the end of the year that the ranks of top spanish civil servants had increased  over the previous year despite pp promises to cut the bureaucracy second term –edit barroso blair bush and aznar in the azores spanish voters reelected aznar in the  general election with an outright majority the pp obtained  of the vote and  seats the spanish electorates participation was the lowest for a general election in spain in the postfranco era spain was one of the fastestgrowing economies in the european union eu in  despite inflation nearing  and signs of an economic slowdowncitation needed however the governments problems involved politics as much as policies a number of issues were handled clumsily including implementation of immigration legislation passed in january and a health scare over lowquality olive oil in july in the autumn complaints that the government was steamrolling controversial university reforms through the parliament inflamed the opposition at the end of the year students all over the country joined in strikes demonstrations and sitins often alongside their rectors and professors though still outperforming most of its eu partners spain failed to escape the effects of the global economic downturn in  falling exports declining domestic consumption and a sharp drop in tourist revenue helped bring annual gross domestic product growth down to an estimated  the lowest level since  in addition rising crime rates and soaring house prices up almost  since  were the object of widespread public concern providing opposition parties with powerful ammunition against aznars government the government ran into even deeper trouble in its attempt to reform the unemployment benefit system a controversial decreelaw issued on  may introduced new restrictions on entitlement to benefits making it harder for those receiving welfare to turn down jobs offered by the public employment agency and phasing out the special subsidy for agricultural workers in the south the trade unions reacted by calling a hour general strike on  june embarrassing the government on the eve of an eu summit in seville the stoppage proved a largely unexpected success on  october just two days after a major national demonstration in madrid to protest against the law new labor minister eduardo zaplana announced an abrupt uturn accepting nearly all of the unions demands and leaving only the reform of the subsidy for farm laborers on the statute book a major secondaryeducation bill also proved controversial intended to raise educational standards the proposed law of quality lowered the age at which students were streamed into different educational tracks allowed special schools in the state sector to select on merit and introduced a new secondaryschoolleaving exam opposition to the bills potential socially divisive effects and inadequate funding for the public educational system brought student organizations trade unions and leftwing parties into the streets as the bill was being debated in the parliament in october amid the relatively stagnant european economies estimated gdp growth of  made spain the second fastestgrowing economy in the european union in  continued expansion enabled the spanish government to proclaim proudly that it would end the year with a budget surplus for the first time in recent history however inflation was running at  compared with the eus  in november unemployment stood at more than  almost onethird of the workforce had temporary contracts and housing prices were spiraling the european commission shared analysts concerns that a hike in interest rates or increased unemployment could send housing prices tumbling with disastrous consequences for families burdened with unprecedented levels of debt and for the financial institutions that had given them loans aznar and george w bush in february  aznar supported the us invasion of iraq that year despite major domestic opposition after six years of relative political calm when political debate was dominated by a consensus within the ruling party on economics regional nationalism and terrorism several issues arose which polarized spanish public opinion like uk prime minister tony blair aznar actively supported the united states war on terrorism despite public opposition aznar met with bush in a private meeting before  invasion of iraq to discuss the situation of in the un security council el país leaked a partial transcript of the meeting the government handling of the wreckage of the greek prestige tanker near the spanish coast which resulted in a major ecological disaster also became a divisive issue he actively encouraged and supported the bush administrations foreign policy and the us invasion of iraq in  defending it on the basis of secret intelligence allegedly containing evidence of the iraqi governments nuclear proliferation the majority of the spanish population including some pp members were against the war spains major cities were the scene of the largest street demonstrations ever seen in the country as a result of the governments participation in the invasion aznar lost some support from those who had voted for the pp in  on a live tv interview aired on the public station while demonstrations were taking place on the streets he asked the spanish people to take his word assuring there were weapons of mass destruction in iraq of which he had evidence this is now regarded as incorrect in january  aznar called a general election and designated his successor as candidate mariano rajoy sticking to a pledge of not seeking office for a third term despite political tensions polls suggested that the popular party was set to win a third consecutive election on the strength of the economy an opinion poll carried out by the governmentrun cis which had estimated that  of the spanish people did not support the war in iraq in february  estimated that the pp would win an election with  of the vote while the psoe would only get citation needed madrid train bombings and end of termedit main article  madrid train bombings three days before the  general election  bombs killed  people in the  march  madrid train bombings initially the government and the opposition stated publicly that it was possible the bombings may have been the work of eta however the pp government continued to blame eta even after evidence that the attacks may have been the work of an islamist group emerged having the minister of foreign affairs ana palacio instruct all spanish diplomats to place the blame on eta at every opportunity the public perception that the government hid information from the general population gave rise to a public outcry two days after the atocha bombings demonstrations took place across spain demanding news from the investigation where chants such as we want the truth before we vote and who is responsible were heard three days after the train bombings the opposition psoe won the elections the subsequent investigations held by a parliamentary committee were characterized by bitter partisan exchanges between the different political parties with dispute over who may have been responsible for the bombings aznar appeared before the committee in november  and declared his belief that the authors of the bombings were not to be found in faraway deserts or remote mountains aznar said in

aznar said that anthropogenic climate change is a scientifically questionable theory which had become a religion and whose followers were enemies of freedom these views were similar to those expressed by klaus in his book blue planet in green shackles which was published in spanish by faes aznars speech caused some puzzlement as his government had been a signatory to the kyoto protocol in  and it appeared that he had subsequently changed his mind about climate change in  aznar was due to speak to a heartland institute conference which was billed as the worlds largestever gathering of global warming skeptics he withdrew at short notice and in the absence of a public explanation there was speculation that he did so in order to spare his party embarrassment the peoples party distanced itself from the environmental views of aznar classing him among a sceptical minority within its membership however some peoples party politicians favored aznar and wanted a public debate on climate change most notably esperanza aguirre in  it was reported that aznar would chair the advisory council of the global adaptation institute a new body concerned with adaptation to climate change foreign

political risks in order to meet the requirements for membership in the middle of  it announced a decision to freeze the wages of civil servants in the following year and stood by that decision throughout the fall despite a series of unionled demonstrations that culminated in protest marches by tens of thousands of spaniards throughout the nation on  december the government with the backing of regional nationalist parties passed a strict  budget on  december four days before time would have run out for its approval the opposition united left coalition argued that the spending cuts and tax adjustments contained in the budget would hurt the disadvantaged and benefit the rich the budget aimed to enable spain to lower its deficit to below  of gross domestic product a requirement for joining the eus single currency some critics note that this wasnt the only way of doing so the government was also forced to back down on a plan to reduce spanish dependence on its own highpriced coal when hundreds of coal miners blocked highways and demonstrated in november the miners persuaded the government to adjust a national electricity plan that would have phased out the subsidy of spanish coal making it more expensive than imported coal aznar also announced the sale early in  of the nations remaining minority stake golden shares in the telefónica telecommunications company and the petroleum group repsol these golden shares in telefónica and repsol ypf as well as in endesa argentaria and tabacalera all presided over by people close to aznar have since been declared illegal by the european union this marked the beginning of a period of privatizations after the previous psoe government had nationalized parts of the economy after the pps first year in office the goodwill between it and the major nationalist parties in the legislature convergence and unity ciu and the basque nationalist party pnv appeared to have lost strength both parties had enjoyed leverage over the previous psoe government and the pnv in particular stepped back from colluding too closely with the government ecological issues came to the fore in spain during  a vigorous public debate created a new awareness of topics such as environmental pollution and deforestation and a host of organizations competed to spread the ecological message the government conscious of the political implications of this new concern was also party to the debate and promised active cooperation as a reaction against attempts to liberalize the current abortion laws roman catholic groups renewed their antiabortion campaigns the economy suffered the effects of the global recession unleashed by the financial crisis in asia and the economic ministry reduced its  economic growth estimate from  to  the sharp decline in share prices on the madrid and barcelona stock exchanges on average about  created cause for concern among both business associations and trade unions the latter voiced their concern about the risk of increased unemployment which remained around  despite this slowdown salaries increased by an average of  that year in  the european union introduced the euro a major success for aznar and his government steady economic growth and falling unemployment though the rate exceeded all other eu member states won the government public support the governments credibility was damaged when the psoe revealed at the end of the year that the ranks of top spanish civil servants had increased  over the previous year despite pp promises to cut the bureaucracy second term –edit barroso blair bush and aznar in the azores spanish voters reelected aznar in the  general election with an outright majority the pp obtained  of the vote and  seats the spanish electorates participation was the lowest for a general election in spain in the postfranco era spain was one of the fastestgrowing economies in the european union eu in  despite inflation nearing  and signs of an economic slowdowncitation needed however the governments problems involved politics as much as policies a number of issues were handled clumsily including implementation of immigration legislation passed in january and a health scare over lowquality olive oil in july in the autumn complaints that the government was steamrolling controversial university reforms through the parliament inflamed the opposition at the end of the year students all over the country joined in strikes demonstrations and sitins often alongside their rectors and professors though still outperforming most of its eu partners spain failed to escape the effects of the global economic downturn in  falling exports declining domestic consumption and a sharp drop in tourist revenue helped bring annual gross domestic product growth down to an estimated  the lowest level since  in addition rising crime rates and soaring house prices up almost  since  were the object of widespread public concern providing opposition parties with powerful ammunition against aznars government the government ran into even deeper trouble in its attempt to reform the unemployment benefit system a controversial decreelaw issued on  may introduced new restrictions on entitlement to benefits making it harder for those receiving welfare to turn down jobs offered by the public employment agency and phasing out the special subsidy for agricultural workers in the south the trade unions reacted by calling a hour general strike on  june embarrassing the government on the eve of an eu summit in seville the stoppage proved a largely unexpected success on  october just two days after a major national demonstration in madrid to protest against the law new labor minister eduardo zaplana announced an abrupt uturn accepting nearly all of the unions demands and leaving only the reform of the subsidy for farm laborers on the statute book a major secondaryeducation bill also proved controversial intended to raise educational standards the proposed law of quality lowered the age at which students were streamed into different educational tracks allowed special schools in the state sector to select on merit and introduced a new secondaryschoolleaving exam opposition to the bills potential socially divisive effects and inadequate funding for the public educational system brought student organizations trade unions and leftwing parties into the streets as the bill was being debated in the parliament in october amid the relatively stagnant european economies estimated gdp growth of  made spain the second fastestgrowing economy in the european union in  continued expansion enabled the spanish government to proclaim proudly that it would end the year with a budget surplus for the first time in recent history however inflation was running at  compared with the eus  in november unemployment stood at more than  almost onethird of the workforce had temporary contracts and housing prices were spiraling the european commission shared analysts concerns that a hike in interest rates or increased unemployment could send housing prices tumbling with disastrous consequences for families burdened with unprecedented levels of debt and for the financial institutions that had given them loans aznar and george w bush in february  aznar supported the us invasion of iraq that year despite major domestic opposition after six years of relative political calm when political debate was dominated by a consensus within the ruling party on economics regional nationalism and terrorism several issues arose which polarized spanish public opinion like uk prime minister tony blair aznar actively supported the united states war on terrorism despite public opposition aznar met with bush in a private meeting before  invasion of iraq to discuss the situation of in the un security council el país leaked a partial transcript of the meeting the government handling of the wreckage of the greek prestige tanker near the spanish coast which resulted in a major ecological disaster also became a divisive issue he actively encouraged and supported the bush administrations foreign policy and the us invasion of iraq in  defending it on the basis of secret intelligence allegedly containing evidence of the iraqi governments nuclear proliferation the majority of the spanish population including some pp members were against the war spains major cities were the scene of the largest street demonstrations ever seen in the country as a result of the governments participation in the invasion aznar lost some support from those who had voted for the pp in  on a live tv interview aired on the public station while demonstrations were taking place on the streets he asked the spanish people to take his word assuring there were weapons of mass destruction in iraq of which he had evidence this is now regarded as incorrect in january  aznar called a general election and designated his successor as candidate mariano rajoy sticking to a pledge of not seeking office for a third term despite political tensions polls suggested that the popular party was set to win a third consecutive election on the strength of the economy an opinion poll carried out by the governmentrun cis which had estimated that  of the spanish people did not support the war in iraq in february  estimated that the pp would win an election with  of the vote while the psoe would only get citation needed madrid train bombings and end of termedit main article  madrid train bombings three days before the  general election  bombs killed  people in the  march  madrid train bombings initially the government and the opposition stated publicly that it was possible the bombings may have been the work of eta however the pp government continued to blame eta even after evidence that the attacks may have been the work of an islamist group emerged having the minister of foreign affairs ana palacio instruct all spanish diplomats to place the blame on eta at every opportunity the public perception that the government hid information from the general population gave rise to a public outcry two days after the atocha bombings demonstrations took place across spain demanding news from the investigation where chants such as we want the truth before we vote and who is responsible were heard three days after the train bombings the opposition psoe won the elections the subsequent investigations held by a parliamentary committee were characterized by bitter partisan exchanges between the different political parties with dispute over who may have been responsible for the bombings aznar appeared before the committee in november  and declared his belief that the authors of the bombings were not to be found in faraway deserts or remote mountains aznar said in

aznar said that anthropogenic climate change is a scientifically questionable theory which had become a religion and whose followers were enemies of freedom these views were similar to those expressed by klaus in his book blue planet in green shackles which was published in spanish by faes aznars speech caused some puzzlement as his government had been a signatory to the kyoto protocol in  and it appeared that he had subsequently changed his mind about climate change in  aznar was due to speak to a heartland institute conference which was billed as the worlds largestever gathering of global warming skeptics he withdrew at short notice and in the absence of a public explanation there was speculation that he did so in order to spare his party embarrassment the peoples party distanced itself from the environmental views of aznar classing him among a sceptical minority within its membership however some peoples party politicians favored aznar and wanted a public debate on climate change most notably esperanza aguirre in  it was reported that aznar would chair the advisory council of the global adaptation institute a new body concerned with adaptation to climate change foreign

political risks in order to meet the requirements for membership in the middle of  it announced a decision to freeze the wages of civil servants in the following year and stood by that decision throughout the fall despite a series of unionled demonstrations that culminated in protest marches by tens of thousands of spaniards throughout the nation on  december the government with the backing of regional nationalist parties passed a strict  budget on  december four days before time would have run out for its approval the opposition united left coalition argued that the spending cuts and tax adjustments contained in the budget would hurt the disadvantaged and benefit the rich the budget aimed to enable spain to lower its deficit to below  of gross domestic product a requirement for joining the eus single currency some critics note that this wasnt the only way of doing so the government was also forced to back down on a plan to reduce spanish dependence on its own highpriced coal when hundreds of coal miners blocked highways and demonstrated in november the miners persuaded the government to adjust a national electricity plan that would have phased out the subsidy of spanish coal making it more expensive than imported coal aznar also announced the sale early in  of the nations remaining minority stake golden shares in the telefónica telecommunications company and the petroleum group repsol these golden shares in telefónica and repsol ypf as well as in endesa argentaria and tabacalera all presided over by people close to aznar have since been declared illegal by the european union this marked the beginning of a period of privatizations after the previous psoe government had nationalized parts of the economy after the pps first year in office the goodwill between it and the major nationalist parties in the legislature convergence and unity ciu and the basque nationalist party pnv appeared to have lost strength both parties had enjoyed leverage over the previous psoe government and the pnv in particular stepped back from colluding too closely with the government ecological issues came to the fore in spain during  a vigorous public debate created a new awareness of topics such as environmental pollution and deforestation and a host of organizations competed to spread the ecological message the government conscious of the political implications of this new concern was also party to the debate and promised active cooperation as a reaction against attempts to liberalize the current abortion laws roman catholic groups renewed their antiabortion campaigns the economy suffered the effects of the global recession unleashed by the financial crisis in asia and the economic ministry reduced its  economic growth estimate from  to  the sharp decline in share prices on the madrid and barcelona stock exchanges on average about  created cause for concern among both business associations and trade unions the latter voiced their concern about the risk of increased unemployment which remained around  despite this slowdown salaries increased by an average of  that year in  the european union introduced the euro a major success for aznar and his government steady economic growth and falling unemployment though the rate exceeded all other eu member states won the government public support the governments credibility was damaged when the psoe revealed at the end of the year that the ranks of top spanish civil servants had increased  over the previous year despite pp promises to cut the bureaucracy second term –edit barroso blair bush and aznar in the azores spanish voters reelected aznar in the  general election with an outright majority the pp obtained  of the vote and  seats the spanish electorates participation was the lowest for a general election in spain in the postfranco era spain was one of the fastestgrowing economies in the european union eu in  despite inflation nearing  and signs of an economic slowdowncitation needed however the governments problems involved politics as much as policies a number of issues were handled clumsily including implementation of immigration legislation passed in january and a health scare over lowquality olive oil in july in the autumn complaints that the government was steamrolling controversial university reforms through the parliament inflamed the opposition at the end of the year students all over the country joined in strikes demonstrations and sitins often alongside their rectors and professors though still outperforming most of its eu partners spain failed to escape the effects of the global economic downturn in  falling exports declining domestic consumption and a sharp drop in tourist revenue helped bring annual gross domestic product growth down to an estimated  the lowest level since  in addition rising crime rates and soaring house prices up almost  since  were the object of widespread public concern providing opposition parties with powerful ammunition against aznars government the government ran into even deeper trouble in its attempt to reform the unemployment benefit system a controversial decreelaw issued on  may introduced new restrictions on entitlement to benefits making it harder for those receiving welfare to turn down jobs offered by the public employment agency and phasing out the special subsidy for agricultural workers in the south the trade unions reacted by calling a hour general strike on  june embarrassing the government on the eve of an eu summit in seville the stoppage proved a largely unexpected success on  october just two days after a major national demonstration in madrid to protest against the law new labor minister eduardo zaplana announced an abrupt uturn accepting nearly all of the unions demands and leaving only the reform of the subsidy for farm laborers on the statute book a major secondaryeducation bill also proved controversial intended to raise educational standards the proposed law of quality lowered the age at which students were streamed into different educational tracks allowed special schools in the state sector to select on merit and introduced a new secondaryschoolleaving exam opposition to the bills potential socially divisive effects and inadequate funding for the public educational system brought student organizations trade unions and leftwing parties into the streets as the bill was being debated in the parliament in october amid the relatively stagnant european economies estimated gdp growth of  made spain the second fastestgrowing economy in the european union in  continued expansion enabled the spanish government to proclaim proudly that it would end the year with a budget surplus for the first time in recent history however inflation was running at  compared with the eus  in november unemployment stood at more than  almost onethird of the workforce had temporary contracts and housing prices were spiraling the european commission shared analysts concerns that a hike in interest rates or increased unemployment could send housing prices tumbling with disastrous consequences for families burdened with unprecedented levels of debt and for the financial institutions that had given them loans aznar and george w bush in february  aznar supported the us invasion of iraq that year despite major domestic opposition after six years of relative political calm when political debate was dominated by a consensus within the ruling party on economics regional nationalism and terrorism several issues arose which polarized spanish public opinion like uk prime minister tony blair aznar actively supported the united states war on terrorism despite public opposition aznar met with bush in a private meeting before  invasion of iraq to discuss the situation of in the un security council el país leaked a partial transcript of the meeting the government handling of the wreckage of the greek prestige tanker near the spanish coast which resulted in a major ecological disaster also became a divisive issue he actively encouraged and supported the bush administrations foreign policy and the us invasion of iraq in  defending it on the basis of secret intelligence allegedly containing evidence of the iraqi governments nuclear proliferation the majority of the spanish population including some pp members were against the war spains major cities were the scene of the largest street demonstrations ever seen in the country as a result of the governments participation in the invasion aznar lost some support from those who had voted for the pp in  on a live tv interview aired on the public station while demonstrations were taking place on the streets he asked the spanish people to take his word assuring there were weapons of mass destruction in iraq of which he had evidence this is now regarded as incorrect in january  aznar called a general election and designated his successor as candidate mariano rajoy sticking to a pledge of not seeking office for a third term despite political tensions polls suggested that the popular party was set to win a third consecutive election on the strength of the economy an opinion poll carried out by the governmentrun cis which had estimated that  of the spanish people did not support the war in iraq in february  estimated that the pp would win an election with  of the vote while the psoe would only get citation needed madrid train bombings and end of termedit main article  madrid train bombings three days before the  general election  bombs killed  people in the  march  madrid train bombings initially the government and the opposition stated publicly that it was possible the bombings may have been the work of eta however the pp government continued to blame eta even after evidence that the attacks may have been the work of an islamist group emerged having the minister of foreign affairs ana palacio instruct all spanish diplomats to place the blame on eta at every opportunity the public perception that the government hid information from the general population gave rise to a public outcry two days after the atocha bombings demonstrations took place across spain demanding news from the investigation where chants such as we want the truth before we vote and who is responsible were heard three days after the train bombings the opposition psoe won the elections the subsequent investigations held by a parliamentary committee were characterized by bitter partisan exchanges between the different political parties with dispute over who may have been responsible for the bombings aznar appeared before the committee in november  and declared his belief that the authors of the bombings were not to be found in faraway deserts or remote mountains aznar said in

aznar said that anthropogenic climate change is a scientifically questionable theory which had become a religion and whose followers were enemies of freedom these views were similar to those expressed by klaus in his book blue planet in green shackles which was published in spanish by faes aznars speech caused some puzzlement as his government had been a signatory to the kyoto protocol in  and it appeared that he had subsequently changed his mind about climate change in  aznar was due to speak to a heartland institute conference which was billed as the worlds largestever gathering of global warming skeptics he withdrew at short notice and in the absence of a public explanation there was speculation that he did so in order to spare his party embarrassment the peoples party distanced itself from the environmental views of aznar classing him among a sceptical minority within its membership however some peoples party politicians favored aznar and wanted a public debate on climate change most notably esperanza aguirre in  it was reported that aznar would chair the advisory council of the global adaptation institute a new body concerned with adaptation to climate change foreign

bbc world on  july  he voiced doubts about islamists being the sole culprits of the disputed  madrid train bombings you know in this moment some perpetrators of the attacks but you do not know who imagined the attack who is the leader of the attack who is the idea sic of the attack who established and supported means for the attacks who defined the logistics of the attacks who established the

political risks in order to meet the requirements for membership in the middle of  it announced a decision to freeze the wages of civil servants in the following year and stood by that decision throughout the fall despite a series of unionled demonstrations that culminated in protest marches by tens of thousands of spaniards throughout the nation on  december the government with the backing of regional nationalist parties passed a strict  budget on  december four days before time would have run out for its approval the opposition united left coalition argued that the spending cuts and tax adjustments contained in the budget would hurt the disadvantaged and benefit the rich the budget aimed to enable spain to lower its deficit to below  of gross domestic product a requirement for joining the eus single currency some critics note that this wasnt the only way of doing so the government was also forced to back down on a plan to reduce spanish dependence on its own highpriced coal when hundreds of coal miners blocked highways and demonstrated in november the miners persuaded the government to adjust a national electricity plan that would have phased out the subsidy of spanish coal making it more expensive than imported coal aznar also announced the sale early in  of the nations remaining minority stake golden shares in the telefónica telecommunications company and the petroleum group repsol these golden shares in telefónica and repsol ypf as well as in endesa argentaria and tabacalera all presided over by people close to aznar have since been declared illegal by the european union this marked the beginning of a period of privatizations after the previous psoe government had nationalized parts of the economy after the pps first year in office the goodwill between it and the major nationalist parties in the legislature convergence and unity ciu and the basque nationalist party pnv appeared to have lost strength both parties had enjoyed leverage over the previous psoe government and the pnv in particular stepped back from colluding too closely with the government ecological issues came to the fore in spain during  a vigorous public debate created a new awareness of topics such as environmental pollution and deforestation and a host of organizations competed to spread the ecological message the government conscious of the political implications of this new concern was also party to the debate and promised active cooperation as a reaction against attempts to liberalize the current abortion laws roman catholic groups renewed their antiabortion campaigns the economy suffered the effects of the global recession unleashed by the financial crisis in asia and the economic ministry reduced its  economic growth estimate from  to  the sharp decline in share prices on the madrid and barcelona stock exchanges on average about  created cause for concern among both business associations and trade unions the latter voiced their concern about the risk of increased unemployment which remained around  despite this slowdown salaries increased by an average of  that year in  the european union introduced the euro a major success for aznar and his government steady economic growth and falling unemployment though the rate exceeded all other eu member states won the government public support the governments credibility was damaged when the psoe revealed at the end of the year that the ranks of top spanish civil servants had increased  over the previous year despite pp promises to cut the bureaucracy second term –edit barroso blair bush and aznar in the azores spanish voters reelected aznar in the  general election with an outright majority the pp obtained  of the vote and  seats the spanish electorates participation was the lowest for a general election in spain in the postfranco era spain was one of the fastestgrowing economies in the european union eu in  despite inflation nearing  and signs of an economic slowdowncitation needed however the governments problems involved politics as much as policies a number of issues were handled clumsily including implementation of immigration legislation passed in january and a health scare over lowquality olive oil in july in the autumn complaints that the government was steamrolling controversial university reforms through the parliament inflamed the opposition at the end of the year students all over the country joined in strikes demonstrations and sitins often alongside their rectors and professors though still outperforming most of its eu partners spain failed to escape the effects of the global economic downturn in  falling exports declining domestic consumption and a sharp drop in tourist revenue helped bring annual gross domestic product growth down to an estimated  the lowest level since  in addition rising crime rates and soaring house prices up almost  since  were the object of widespread public concern providing opposition parties with powerful ammunition against aznars government the government ran into even deeper trouble in its attempt to reform the unemployment benefit system a controversial decreelaw issued on  may introduced new restrictions on entitlement to benefits making it harder for those receiving welfare to turn down jobs offered by the public employment agency and phasing out the special subsidy for agricultural workers in the south the trade unions reacted by calling a hour general strike on  june embarrassing the government on the eve of an eu summit in seville the stoppage proved a largely unexpected success on  october just two days after a major national demonstration in madrid to protest against the law new labor minister eduardo zaplana announced an abrupt uturn accepting nearly all of the unions demands and leaving only the reform of the subsidy for farm laborers on the statute book a major secondaryeducation bill also proved controversial intended to raise educational standards the proposed law of quality lowered the age at which students were streamed into different educational tracks allowed special schools in the state sector to select on merit and introduced a new secondaryschoolleaving exam opposition to the bills potential socially divisive effects and inadequate funding for the public educational system brought student organizations trade unions and leftwing parties into the streets as the bill was being debated in the parliament in october amid the relatively stagnant european economies estimated gdp growth of  made spain the second fastestgrowing economy in the european union in  continued expansion enabled the spanish government to proclaim proudly that it would end the year with a budget surplus for the first time in recent history however inflation was running at  compared with the eus  in november unemployment stood at more than  almost onethird of the workforce had temporary contracts and housing prices were spiraling the european commission shared analysts concerns that a hike in interest rates or increased unemployment could send housing prices tumbling with disastrous consequences for families burdened with unprecedented levels of debt and for the financial institutions that had given them loans aznar and george w bush in february  aznar supported the us invasion of iraq that year despite major domestic opposition after six years of relative political calm when political debate was dominated by a consensus within the ruling party on economics regional nationalism and terrorism several issues arose which polarized spanish public opinion like uk prime minister tony blair aznar actively supported the united states war on terrorism despite public opposition aznar met with bush in a private meeting before  invasion of iraq to discuss the situation of in the un security council el país leaked a partial transcript of the meeting the government handling of the wreckage of the greek prestige tanker near the spanish coast which resulted in a major ecological disaster also became a divisive issue he actively encouraged and supported the bush administrations foreign policy and the us invasion of iraq in  defending it on the basis of secret intelligence allegedly containing evidence of the iraqi governments nuclear proliferation the majority of the spanish population including some pp members were against the war spains major cities were the scene of the largest street demonstrations ever seen in the country as a result of the governments participation in the invasion aznar lost some support from those who had voted for the pp in  on a live tv interview aired on the public station while demonstrations were taking place on the streets he asked the spanish people to take his word assuring there were weapons of mass destruction in iraq of which he had evidence this is now regarded as incorrect in january  aznar called a general election and designated his successor as candidate mariano rajoy sticking to a pledge of not seeking office for a third term despite political tensions polls suggested that the popular party was set to win a third consecutive election on the strength of the economy an opinion poll carried out by the governmentrun cis which had estimated that  of the spanish people did not support the war in iraq in february  estimated that the pp would win an election with  of the vote while the psoe would only get citation needed madrid train bombings and end of termedit main article  madrid train bombings three days before the  general election  bombs killed  people in the  march  madrid train bombings initially the government and the opposition stated publicly that it was possible the bombings may have been the work of eta however the pp government continued to blame eta even after evidence that the attacks may have been the work of an islamist group emerged having the minister of foreign affairs ana palacio instruct all spanish diplomats to place the blame on eta at every opportunity the public perception that the government hid information from the general population gave rise to a public outcry two days after the atocha bombings demonstrations took place across spain demanding news from the investigation where chants such as we want the truth before we vote and who is responsible were heard three days after the train bombings the opposition psoe won the elections the subsequent investigations held by a parliamentary committee were characterized by bitter partisan exchanges between the different political parties with dispute over who may have been responsible for the bombings aznar appeared before the committee in november  and declared his belief that the authors of the bombings were not to be found in faraway deserts or remote mountains aznar said in

aznar said that anthropogenic climate change is a scientifically questionable theory which had become a religion and whose followers were enemies of freedom these views were similar to those expressed by klaus in his book blue planet in green shackles which was published in spanish by faes aznars speech caused some puzzlement as his government had been a signatory to the kyoto protocol in  and it appeared that he had subsequently changed his mind about climate change in  aznar was due to speak to a heartland institute conference which was billed as the worlds largestever gathering of global warming skeptics he withdrew at short notice and in the absence of a public explanation there was speculation that he did so in order to spare his party embarrassment the peoples party distanced itself from the environmental views of aznar classing him among a sceptical minority within its membership however some peoples party politicians favored aznar and wanted a public debate on climate change most notably esperanza aguirre in  it was reported that aznar would chair the advisory council of the global adaptation institute a new body concerned with adaptation to climate change foreign

political risks in order to meet the requirements for membership in the middle of  it announced a decision to freeze the wages of civil servants in the following year and stood by that decision throughout the fall despite a series of unionled demonstrations that culminated in protest marches by tens of thousands of spaniards throughout the nation on  december the government with the backing of regional nationalist parties passed a strict  budget on  december four days before time would have run out for its approval the opposition united left coalition argued that the spending cuts and tax adjustments contained in the budget would hurt the disadvantaged and benefit the rich the budget aimed to enable spain to lower its deficit to below  of gross domestic product a requirement for joining the eus single currency some critics note that this wasnt the only way of doing so the government was also forced to back down on a plan to reduce spanish dependence on its own highpriced coal when hundreds of coal miners blocked highways and demonstrated in november the miners persuaded the government to adjust a national electricity plan that would have phased out the subsidy of spanish coal making it more expensive than imported coal aznar also announced the sale early in  of the nations remaining minority stake golden shares in the telefónica telecommunications company and the petroleum group repsol these golden shares in telefónica and repsol ypf as well as in endesa argentaria and tabacalera all presided over by people close to aznar have since been declared illegal by the european union this marked the beginning of a period of privatizations after the previous psoe government had nationalized parts of the economy after the pps first year in office the goodwill between it and the major nationalist parties in the legislature convergence and unity ciu and the basque nationalist party pnv appeared to have lost strength both parties had enjoyed leverage over the previous psoe government and the pnv in particular stepped back from colluding too closely with the government ecological issues came to the fore in spain during  a vigorous public debate created a new awareness of topics such as environmental pollution and deforestation and a host of organizations competed to spread the ecological message the government conscious of the political implications of this new concern was also party to the debate and promised active cooperation as a reaction against attempts to liberalize the current abortion laws roman catholic groups renewed their antiabortion campaigns the economy suffered the effects of the global recession unleashed by the financial crisis in asia and the economic ministry reduced its  economic growth estimate from  to  the sharp decline in share prices on the madrid and barcelona stock exchanges on average about  created cause for concern among both business associations and trade unions the latter voiced their concern about the risk of increased unemployment which remained around  despite this slowdown salaries increased by an average of  that year in  the european union introduced the euro a major success for aznar and his government steady economic growth and falling unemployment though the rate exceeded all other eu member states won the government public support the governments credibility was damaged when the psoe revealed at the end of the year that the ranks of top spanish civil servants had increased  over the previous year despite pp promises to cut the bureaucracy second term –edit barroso blair bush and aznar in the azores spanish voters reelected aznar in the  general election with an outright majority the pp obtained  of the vote and  seats the spanish electorates participation was the lowest for a general election in spain in the postfranco era spain was one of the fastestgrowing economies in the european union eu in  despite inflation nearing  and signs of an economic slowdowncitation needed however the governments problems involved politics as much as policies a number of issues were handled clumsily including implementation of immigration legislation passed in january and a health scare over lowquality olive oil in july in the autumn complaints that the government was steamrolling controversial university reforms through the parliament inflamed the opposition at the end of the year students all over the country joined in strikes demonstrations and sitins often alongside their rectors and professors though still outperforming most of its eu partners spain failed to escape the effects of the global economic downturn in  falling exports declining domestic consumption and a sharp drop in tourist revenue helped bring annual gross domestic product growth down to an estimated  the lowest level since  in addition rising crime rates and soaring house prices up almost  since  were the object of widespread public concern providing opposition parties with powerful ammunition against aznars government the government ran into even deeper trouble in its attempt to reform the unemployment benefit system a controversial decreelaw issued on  may introduced new restrictions on entitlement to benefits making it harder for those receiving welfare to turn down jobs offered by the public employment agency and phasing out the special subsidy for agricultural workers in the south the trade unions reacted by calling a hour general strike on  june embarrassing the government on the eve of an eu summit in seville the stoppage proved a largely unexpected success on  october just two days after a major national demonstration in madrid to protest against the law new labor minister eduardo zaplana announced an abrupt uturn accepting nearly all of the unions demands and leaving only the reform of the subsidy for farm laborers on the statute book a major secondaryeducation bill also proved controversial intended to raise educational standards the proposed law of quality lowered the age at which students were streamed into different educational tracks allowed special schools in the state sector to select on merit and introduced a new secondaryschoolleaving exam opposition to the bills potential socially divisive effects and inadequate funding for the public educational system brought student organizations trade unions and leftwing parties into the streets as the bill was being debated in the parliament in october amid the relatively stagnant european economies estimated gdp growth of  made spain the second fastestgrowing economy in the european union in  continued expansion enabled the spanish government to proclaim proudly that it would end the year with a budget surplus for the first time in recent history however inflation was running at  compared with the eus  in november unemployment stood at more than  almost onethird of the workforce had temporary contracts and housing prices were spiraling the european commission shared analysts concerns that a hike in interest rates or increased unemployment could send housing prices tumbling with disastrous consequences for families burdened with unprecedented levels of debt and for the financial institutions that had given them loans aznar and george w bush in february  aznar supported the us invasion of iraq that year despite major domestic opposition after six years of relative political calm when political debate was dominated by a consensus within the ruling party on economics regional nationalism and terrorism several issues arose which polarized spanish public opinion like uk prime minister tony blair aznar actively supported the united states war on terrorism despite public opposition aznar met with bush in a private meeting before  invasion of iraq to discuss the situation of in the un security council el país leaked a partial transcript of the meeting the government handling of the wreckage of the greek prestige tanker near the spanish coast which resulted in a major ecological disaster also became a divisive issue he actively encouraged and supported the bush administrations foreign policy and the us invasion of iraq in  defending it on the basis of secret intelligence allegedly containing evidence of the iraqi governments nuclear proliferation the majority of the spanish population including some pp members were against the war spains major cities were the scene of the largest street demonstrations ever seen in the country as a result of the governments participation in the invasion aznar lost some support from those who had voted for the pp in  on a live tv interview aired on the public station while demonstrations were taking place on the streets he asked the spanish people to take his word assuring there were weapons of mass destruction in iraq of which he had evidence this is now regarded as incorrect in january  aznar called a general election and designated his successor as candidate mariano rajoy sticking to a pledge of not seeking office for a third term despite political tensions polls suggested that the popular party was set to win a third consecutive election on the strength of the economy an opinion poll carried out by the governmentrun cis which had estimated that  of the spanish people did not support the war in iraq in february  estimated that the pp would win an election with  of the vote while the psoe would only get citation needed madrid train bombings and end of termedit main article  madrid train bombings three days before the  general election  bombs killed  people in the  march  madrid train bombings initially the government and the opposition stated publicly that it was possible the bombings may have been the work of eta however the pp government continued to blame eta even after evidence that the attacks may have been the work of an islamist group emerged having the minister of foreign affairs ana palacio instruct all spanish diplomats to place the blame on eta at every opportunity the public perception that the government hid information from the general population gave rise to a public outcry two days after the atocha bombings demonstrations took place across spain demanding news from the investigation where chants such as we want the truth before we vote and who is responsible were heard three days after the train bombings the opposition psoe won the elections the subsequent investigations held by a parliamentary committee were characterized by bitter partisan exchanges between the different political parties with dispute over who may have been responsible for the bombings aznar appeared before the committee in november  and declared his belief that the authors of the bombings were not to be found in faraway deserts or remote mountains aznar said in

aznar said that anthropogenic climate change is a scientifically questionable theory which had become a religion and whose followers were enemies of freedom these views were similar to those expressed by klaus in his book blue planet in green shackles which was published in spanish by faes aznars speech caused some puzzlement as his government had been a signatory to the kyoto protocol in  and it appeared that he had subsequently changed his mind about climate change in  aznar was due to speak to a heartland institute conference which was billed as the worlds largestever gathering of global warming skeptics he withdrew at short notice and in the absence of a public explanation there was speculation that he did so in order to spare his party embarrassment the peoples party distanced itself from the environmental views of aznar classing him among a sceptical minority within its membership however some peoples party politicians favored aznar and wanted a public debate on climate change most notably esperanza aguirre in  it was reported that aznar would chair the advisory council of the global adaptation institute a new body concerned with adaptation to climate change foreign policyedit israeledit in  aznar founded the friends of israel initiative with the stated goal to counter the attempts to delegitimize the state of israel and its right to live in peace within safe and

an ideal world the assault by israeli commandos on the mavi marmara would not have ended up with nine dead and a score wounded in an ideal world the soldiers would have been peacefully welcomed on to

first line of defense and must be protected in  in an address at the british house of commons aznar said israel is needed by the european union he said his report recommends that due to its western culture and the benefits it brings the european union israel should become a full member of the eu without preconditions controversyedit aznars government posthumously granted a medal of civil merit

reason why we have added several sections among which you can find actors singers football players and other sportmen politicians members of the royal family and immortal figures since they have done a good job we pay tribute to their career with a caganer in order to bring them luck in  we elaborated the first caganers —jordi pujol pasqual maragall and artur mas three catalan politicians— and it was such a success that we put heart into continue the series currently there are a lot of celebrities that feel proud of their caganer check them outsubcategories universalthis subcategory has remained a hodgepodge with caganers that would need a whole section itselves for its peculiarity this miscellany lead to a very special corner with emblematic characters such the famous dragon from park güell the dalai lama che guevara shakespeare the quijote or the statue of liberty most of them are clients requests they know it will bring calm and luck to their home musiciansnowadays there is a huge number of singers onto the stage so we could not miss a section dedicated to those characters who get along with us in a very special way through music our collection of caganers that sing goes over the musical history from pioners like john lennon and elvis presley to contemporary artists like shakira cinemain our celebrity section we could not resist turning up some actors and actresses that marked a milestone into caganers some of them have been such an icon that have become universal sex symbols or have been the promoters of a new style or school two good examples would be the

of offending we offer replicas in a caganer format of this group of people called politicians who manage to be heard and face this world we live in this section you will find personalities like donald

famous as fc barcelona we are honoured to dedicate a whole section to this organisation and to some players that have been —or are— essentials for the history of the club it seemed interesting to join together to important aspects of the catalan tradition —caganers and barça— in a single little figurine as a result of this blending of cultures in our blue and red corner you will find famous players
