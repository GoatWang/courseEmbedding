inc is a leading provider of infection prevention and decontamination products and services focused primarily on life sciences including healthcare biosafety pharmaceutical cleanroom and research our mission is to help our customers create a healthier world through tomi’s product line tomi’s motto is “innovating for a safer world” for healthcare and life as a global decontamination and infectious disease control company tomi™ provides environmental solutions for indoor and outdoor surface decontamination through the sale of equipment services and licensing of our steramist™ binary ionization technology® bit™ which is a epa registered hydrogen peroxide based mist and fog during august  tomi™ entered into negotiations to purchase the assets of a us defense company’s division that owned and operated bit™ the technology was a division of l applied technologies inc l in april  we completed the acquisition of certain assets from l for  and tomi™ began to develop engineer and complete regulatory testing for the epa registrations of bit™ and bit™ solution as a hospitalhealthcare disinfectant  bit™  is the platform that runs our steramist™ equipment that currently accounts for nearly all of our revenue tomi™ reengineered the prototypes into tomi’s current model of binary ionization technology® bit™ branded as steramist™ this technology was developed for the neutralization of anthrax spores and sponsored by the us defense advanced research projects agency darpa  this novel darpa project was sanctioned under darpacmo contract no mdac and developed through the special projects officespo immune building darpa order no p program code   north fairfax drive arlington va  in june  steramist™ bit™ was granted a registration from the us environmental protection agency epa as a hospitalhealthcare disinfectant for use as a mistingfogging agent epa registration  our product also holds a second epa registration for mold control and air  surface remediation epa registration    steramist™ binary ionization technology® bit™ bit™ was developed in response to amerithrax the anthrax attacks that occurred in washington dc shortly after the september  us terrorist attacks  it is a patented twostep process that aerosolizes and activates a low concentration hydrogen peroxide solution producing a fine aqueous mist that contains a high concentration of reactive oxidative species ros mostly hydroxyl radicals ros cause damage to pathogenic organisms via mechanisms such as oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids such as carbohydrates lipids and amino acids leading to cellular disruption andor dysfunction the unique alteration of the chemistry of our solution occurs after passing our epa registered bit™ solution through our atmospheric high voltage cold plasma arc which causes the breaking of the double bond of a hydrogen peroxide molecule  the net result is the hydroxyl radical this hydroxyl radical is known as activated ionized hydrogen peroxide aihp the tomi™ patented process allows these ros hydroxyl radicals to exist in high concentrations without rapidly recombining and losing their reactivity testing detailed by darpa demonstrates these ros which include the hydroxyl ion and hydroxyl radicals aggressively break the double bonds in bacterial spores biological and chemical warfare agents bwa and cwa neutralizing their threat and producing nontoxic byproducts brought to the commercial market by tomi™ in june  our current suite of products includes the steramist™ surface unit the steramist™ environment system and bit™ solution our steramist™ bit™ platform has expanded beyond the initial chemical and biological warfare applications to deactivate problem microorganisms including spores in healthcare laboratory clean rooms and a wide variety of other commercial and residential settings steramist™ bit™ provides fast acting biological deactivation and works in even the most hardtoreach areas while leaving no residue or noxious fumes the byproducts produced by steramist™ bit™ are oxygen and humidity the steramist™ surface unit is a fully portable fastacting hand held point and spray disinfectiondecontamination system it is a safe and easy process to make certain that your facility home and assets are disinfecteddecontaminated to the maximum extent possible the single applicator surface unit enables disinfection of all surfaces–including high touch sensitive medical equipment and electronics the space is safe to reenter within minutes after the activated ionized hydrogen peroxide aihp mist has been applied the epa registered second application time and minute contact time seamlessly results in quick room turnover while eliminating pathogens such as mrsa and hn tomi’s steramist™ surface unit is lightweight easy to transport and capable of achieving reliable disinfectiondecontamination as it is easily incorporated into current cleaning procedures and protocols the hydroxyl radicals produced by tomi’s plasma science does not require heating ventilation or air conditioning systems to be shut down and requires no wiping leaves no residue and is a bleach chlorine formaldehyde glutaraldehyde titanium dioxide peracetic and silver ion free formula the steramist™ environment system is a transportable remotely controlled system that provides complete room disinfectiondecontamination of a sealed space up to  m  ft individually each remote applicator can be used to treat a space of approximately  m  ft multiple environment systems can be used simultaneously to accommodate larger spaces fast application  minimal down time mechanical cleaning that makes whole room disinfectingdecontaminating easier with this automated touchless application solution you can treat multiple areas simultaneously our hybrid technology – applicators can be used in manual andor fogging modes great for frequent daily use saves time and labor  steramist™ is a powerful technology in fighting reducing and eliminating bacteria including c diff spores and when you reenter the room you can “smell the clean” tomi™ currently targets domestic and international markets our approach to the international markets is through strategic partners manufacturer representativesor and licensed distribution partners the company is currently focused in mexico and central america the eu and asia where the technology is used for the control of microorganisms and the decontamination of large and small indoor space for biological pathogens and chemical agents domestically tomi’s primary market is healthcarehospitals biosafety and pharmaceutical along with many other verticals that tomi sells to endusers or enduser can elect to have the areas treated through the tomi service network tsn a network professional service providers
