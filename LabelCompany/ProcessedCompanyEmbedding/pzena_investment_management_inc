investment results we believe that our longterm investment performance together with our willingness to close our strategies to new investors in order to optimize the prospects for future performance has contributed to our positive reputation among our clients and the institutional consultants who advise them • consistency of investment process   since our inception over twenty years ago we have utilized a classic value investment approach and a systematic disciplined investment process to construct portfolios for our investment strategies in us and nonus markets across all market capitalizations the consistency of our process has allowed us to leverage the same investment team to launch new strategies we believe that our consistent investment process has resulted in our strong

strategy the key to our success is continued longterm investment performance in conjunction with this we believe the following strategies will enable us to grow our business over time • unwavering focus on classic value investing   we view our unwavering focus on longterm classic value investment excellence to be the key driver of our business success • capitalize on growth opportunities

equities as of december    the total aum in our international exus value strategies global value strategies emerging markets value strategy european value strategy and other nonus strategies was  billion or  of our overall aum our global capability provides opportunity for implementation of our strategies around the world • work with our strong consultant relationships   we believe that we have built strong relationships with the leading investment consulting firms who advise potential institutional clients historically new accounts sourced through consultantled searches have been a large driver of our inflows and are expected to be a major component of our future inflows we estimate that approximately  of all retirement plan assets are advised by investment consultants with a relatively small number of these consultants representing a significant majority of these relationships as a result of a consistent servicing effort over our history we have built strong relationships with consulting firms that we believe are the most important new accounts sourced through consultantled searches have been a large driver of our historical growth and are expected to be a major component of our future growth as of december    our largest consultant relationship represented approximately  of our aum • expand our nonus client base   in recent years we have increased our efforts to develop our nonus client base through our strong relationships with global consultants we have been able to accelerate the development of our relationships with their nonus branches over time we aim to achieve growth of this client base through these relationships and by directly calling on the world’s largest institutional investors we have also sought to expand our nonus base

service office in london in addition to our headquarters in the united states and representative office in melbourne to date our marketing efforts have resulted in client relationships in fifteen

subadvised mutual funds on our institutional accounts we are paid fees according to a schedule which varies by investment strategy the substantial majority of these accounts pay us management fees pursuant to a schedule in which the rate we earn on the aum declines as the amount of aum increases with respect to our retail accounts as of december    we subadvised fifteen secregistered mutual funds that each have an initial twoyear term and are thereafter subject to annual renewal by each fund’s board of directors pursuant to the investment company act of  as amended the “investment

are generally paid a management fee according to a schedule pursuant to which the rate we earn on the aum declines as the amount of aum increases certain of these funds pay us fixedrate management fees due to the substantially larger account size of certain of these accounts the average advisory fees we earn on them as a percentage of aum are lower than the advisory fees we earn on our institutional accounts advisory fees we earn on institutional accounts are generally based on the value of aum at a specific date on a quarterly basis certain of our institutional accounts and all of the mutual funds that we subadvise are calculated based on the average of the monthly or daily market value of the account advisory fees are also generally adjusted for any cash flows into or out of a portfolio where the cash flow represents greater than  of the value of the portfolio while a specific group of accounts may use the same fee rate the calculation methodology may differ as described above certain of our clients pay us performance fees according to the performance of their accounts relative to certain agreedupon benchmarks which results in a lower base fee but allows for us to earn higher fees if the relevant investment strategy outperforms the agreedupon benchmark some performancebased fee arrangements include highwater mark provisions which generally provide that if a client account underperforms relative to its performance target it must gain back such underperformance before we can collect future performancebased fees fulcrum fee arrangements related to one client relationship require a reduction in the base fee or allow for a performance fee if the relevant investment strategy underperforms or outperforms respectively the agreedupon benchmark competition we compete in all aspects of our business with a large number of investment management firms commercial banks brokerdealers insurance companies and other financial institutions in order to grow our business we must be able to compete effectively to maintain existing aum and attract additional aum historically we have competed for aum principally on the basis of • the performance of our investment strategies • our clients’ perceptions of our drive focus and alignment of our interests with theirs • the quality of the service we provide to our clients and the duration of our relationships with them • our brand recognition and reputation within the investing community • the range of strategies and investment vehicles we offer and • the level of advisory fees we charge for

on the companys website is not part of or incorporated by reference into this annual report or any other report we file with or furnish to the sec item a risk factors we face a variety of significant and diverse risks many of which are inherent in our business described below are the risks we currently believe could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or cash flow risks related to our business our primary source of revenue is derived from management fees which are directly tied to our assets under management fluctuations in aum therefore will directly impact our revenue substantially all of our revenue is derived from management fees paid by our clients based on a percentage of the market value of our aum any decline andor significant impairment in aum would greatly affect our revenue and could occur due to a variety of factors including • poor performance of our strategies  poor performance of our investment strategies may result in decreased market value of aum in addition underperformance could impact our ability to maintain our existing client base and develop new relationships both of which could negatively impact aum • poor market environment  we expect our business may generate lower revenue in a depressed equities market or general economic downturn as a result of depreciation of our aum any decline in the market value of securities held in client portfolios due to such adverse conditions would reduce aum and lead to a decrease in revenue investor sentiment in a poor equities market environment could also decrease inflows and increase outflows from our investment strategies in favor of investments perceived as more attractive • global market economic geopolitical and other conditions  as a company that invests in both us and nonus markets and with a global client base our business is subject to changing conditions in the global financial markets and may also be affected by domestic and international political social and economic conditions any of which could negatively impact our investment performance growth strategy and aum see our global and nonus strategies consist primarily of investments in the securities of issuers located outside of the united states which may involve foreign currency exchange political social and economic uncertainties and risks below • termination of significant relationships  our clients can generally terminate our advisory agreements or reduce assets under management upon short notice and for any reason investors in the pooled funds that we manage may also redeem their investments in the funds at any time without prior notice as of december   three client relationships represented  and  of our aum and revenue respectively including one client relationship which  table of contents represents approximately  and  of our aum and revenue respectively the termination of any of these relationships and outflow of money from our pooled funds could significantly reduce our revenue and we may not be able to establish relationships with other clients in order to replace the lost revenue there can also be no assurance that our agreements with respect to these relationships will remain in place going forward • defined benefit plans are declining  defined benefit plans are declining as corporate plan sponsors are decreasing their liabilities and shifting employee enrollment to defined contribution plans  we currently do not have significant exposure to the defined contribution market but continue to try to gain new assets in this market given the reduction in funding and shift to defined contribution plans there is no guarantee that we will be successful in increasing our penetration of the defined contribution market which could limit our ability to grow our aum • intermediary dependence new accounts sourced through consultantled searches have been a large driver of our inflows in the past and are expected to be a major component of our inflows going forward we have also established relationships with certain mutual fund providers who have offered us opportunities to access certain market segments through subinvestment advisory roles such consultants and mutual fund providers routinely review and evaluate our organization and the services we offer and poor evaluations may result in client outflows and impact our ability to attract new assets through such intermediaries see item  — our business strategy — work with our strong consultant relationships and item  — our client relationships and distribution approach — distribution channels — retail distribution channel • passive strategies such as index and exchangetraded funds have grown substantially in relation to active strategies  during the past decade investors have exhibited a desire for passive investment products given their relative performance and lower fee structure compared to active strategies managed by investment managers such as ourselves if this market preference continues existing and prospective clients may choose to invest in passive investment products our growth strategy may be impaired and our aum may be negatively impacted we may face capacity constraints in certain of our strategies which may prevent us from accepting new investors in those strategies our ability to retain and grow assets as a firm has been and will be driven primarily by delivering attractive investment results to our clients as a consequence we have prioritized and will continue to prioritize investment performance over asset accumulation where we deemed it necessary we have at times closed certain strategies to new investors in order to preserve capacity to effectively implement our concentrated investment strategies for the benefit of existing clients we may in the future close certain of our strategies to new investors or to new inflows from existing investors any such closures may limit our future aum growth and hence our revenue growth market and competitive pressures to lower our advisory fees could lead to a decline in our profit and earnings market and competitive pressures in recent years have created a trend towards lower management fees in the asset management industry and there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current fee structure going forward as a result a shift in the composition of our aum from higher to lower feegenerating client relationships would result in a decrease in revenue even if our aggregate level of aum remains unchanged or increases a portion of our investment advisory revenue is also derived from performance fees we generally earn performance fees under certain client agreements according to the performance relative to an agreedupon benchmark this fee structure results in a lower base fee but allows for us to earn higher fees if the investment strategy outperforms the benchmark some performancebased fee arrangements include highwater mark provisions which generally provide that if a client account underperforms relative to its performance target it must gain back such underperformance before we can collect future performancebased fees therefore if we fail to achieve the performance target for a particular period we may not earn a performance fee for that period and for accounts with a highwater mark provision our ability to earn future performance fees may be impaired during fiscal years  and  we earned  million and  million in performance fees respectively an increase in performancebased fee arrangements with clients could create greater fluctuations in our revenue and earnings in addition certain accounts related to one retail client relationship have fulcrum fee arrangements these fee arrangements require a reduction in the base fee or allow for a performance fee if the relevant investment strategy underperforms or outperforms respectively the agreedupon benchmark over the contracts measurement period which extends to three years we recognized a  million reduction in base fees related to these fee arrangements for the year ended  table of contents december   which does not reflect the minimum base fees of accounts with fulcrum fee arrangements for the year ended december   we did not recognize a reduction in base fees related to fulcrum fee arrangements to the extent the threeyear performance records of these accounts fluctuate relative to their relevant benchmarks the amount of base fees recognized may vary increases in our expenses could lead to a decline in our profit margin and increase the volatility of our earnings our expenses are subject to increase based on a variety of factors such as higher operating expenses resulting from business expansion product development and increased marketing efforts higher compensation expense due to increased competition for talent headcount and seniority level and related expenses to meet business and regulatory needs  some or all of these expenses may remain at higher levels for the foreseeable future leading to higher costs for our business  fluctuations in expenses could impact our profit margins and contribute to earnings volatility loss of key employees and difficulties in attracting qualified investment professionals could have a material adverse effect on our business the success of our business largely depends on the participation of richard s pzena and the other members of our executive committee their professional reputations expertise in investing and relationships with our clients and within the investing community in the us and abroad are critical to executing our business strategy and attracting and retaining clients the retention of these individuals is crucial to our future success there is no guarantee that they will not resign join our competitors or form a competing company the terms of the current operating agreement of our operating company restrict each of these individuals from competing with us or soliciting our clients or employees during the term of their employment with us and in certain circumstances for a certain period thereafter the penalty for breach of these restrictive covenants may be the forfeiture of a number of class b units held by the individual and his permitted transferees as of the earlier of the date of his breach or the termination of his employment although we may seek specific performance of these restrictive covenants there can be no assurance that we would be successful in obtaining this relief after this postemployment restrictive period we may not be able to prohibit them from competing with us or soliciting our clients or employees furthermore we do not carry any key man insurance that would provide us with proceeds in the event of the death or disability of any of the above mentioned employees in addition to the participants mentioned above our success also depends on our ability to retain the senior members of our investment team and to recruit additional qualified investment professionals we may not be successful in our efforts to retain and recruit such individuals as the market for investment professionals is extremely competitive our portfolio managers possess substantial experience and expertise in classic value investing and maintain significant relationships with our clients the loss of any of our senior investment professionals could limit our ability to successfully execute our investment approach and to sustain the performance of our investment strategies which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our reputation client relationships and our revenue and earnings future growth of our business may place significant demands on our resources and employees and may increase our expenses risks and regulatory oversight future growth of our business may place significant demands on our infrastructure our investment team and other employees which may increase our expenses in addition we are required to continuously develop our infrastructure in response to the increasing sophistication of the investment management market as well as compliance with legal and regulatory developments we may face significant challenges in maintaining and developing adequate financial and operational controls implementing new or updated information and financial systems and procedures and training and managing and appropriately sizing our work force and other components of our business on a timely and costeffective basis there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage the growth of our business effectively or that we will be able to continue to grow and any failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to generate revenue and control expenses the potential inability of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions could also constrain our ability to expand our businesses and potentially raise regulatory issues in recent years we have substantially upgraded and expanded the capabilities of our data processing systems and other operating technology and we expect that we may need to continue to upgrade and expand these capabilities in the future to avoid disruption of or constraints on our operations  table of contents we face risks and corresponding potential costs and expenses associated with conducting operations and growing our business in numerous countries we offer investment management services in different regulatory jurisdictions around the world and intend to continue to expand our operations internationally in order to remain competitive we must be proactive and prepared to deploy necessary resources when and where growth opportunities present themselves if we lack the necessary resources andor personnel we may be unable to take full advantage of strategic opportunities when they appear and our strategic decisions may not be efficiently implemented meeting local requirements and complying with local industry standards may also place additional demands on sales and compliance personnel and resources that we may not be able to meet finding and hiring additional wellqualified personnel and crafting and adopting policies procedures and controls to address local or regional requirements remain a challenge as we expand our operations internationally moreover regulators could also change their policies or laws in a manner that might restrict or otherwise impede our ability to offer our investment products in their respective markets any of these requirements activities or needs could increase the costs and expenses we incur in a specific jurisdiction without any corresponding increase in revenue and income from operating in such jurisdiction the investment management business is intensely competitive competition in the investment management business is based on a variety of factors including investment performance investor perception of an investment manager’s drive focus and alignment of interests quality of service provided to clients and duration of client relationships business reputation and level of fees charged for services we compete in all aspects of our business with a large number of investment management firms commercial banks brokerdealers insurance companies and other financial institutions our competitive risks are heightened by the fact that some of our competitors may implement investment styles that are viewed more favorably than ours or they may invest in alternative asset classes which the markets may perceive as more attractive than the public equity markets if we are unable to compete effectively our revenue could be reduced and our business could be materially affected we may not be successful in expanding into new investment strategies markets and businesses we actively consider the opportunistic expansion of our businesses but we may not be successful in any such attempted expansion attempts to expand our businesses involve a number of risks including entry into markets in which we may have limited or no experience increasing the demands on our operational systems the broadening of our geographic footprint increasing the risks associated with conducting operations in nonus jurisdictions and the diversion of management’s attention from our core businesses we also may not be successful in identifying new investment strategies or geographic markets that increase our profitability because we have not yet identified all of these potential new investment strategies geographic markets or businesses we cannot identify all the risks we may face and the potential adverse consequences we also do not know how long it may take for us to expand if we do so at all a change of control could result in termination of our investment advisory or subinvestment advisory agreements pursuant to the investment company act each of the investment advisory or subinvestment advisory agreements for the secregistered mutual funds that we advise will automatically terminate upon their deemed “assignment” and a fund’s board and shareholders must approve a new agreement in order for us to continue to act as its investment adviser or subinvestment adviser in addition pursuant to the investment advisers act each of our investment advisory agreements for the separate accounts we manage contains a provision that states that the agreement may not be “assigned” without the consent of the client an assignment pursuant to both the investment company act and the investment advisers act could be deemed to occur upon a sale or transfer of a controlling block of our voting securities such an assignment may be deemed to occur in the event that the holders of the class b units of our operating company exchange enough of their class b units for shares of our class a common stock such that they no longer own a controlling interest in us if such a deemed assignment occurs there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain the necessary consents from clients whose assets are managed pursuant to separate accounts or the necessary approvals from the boards and shareholders of the secregistered funds that we subadvise an assignment actual or constructive would trigger these termination and consent provisions and unless the necessary approvals and consents are obtained could adversely affect our ability to continue managing client accounts resulting in the loss of aum and a corresponding loss of revenue  table of contents extensive regulation of our business has been and will be expensive and time consuming and exposes us to the potential for significant penalties including fines or limitations on our ability to conduct our business we are subject to extensive regulation of our investment management business and operations as a registered investment adviser the sec oversees our activities pursuant to its regulatory authority under the investment advisers act in addition we must comply with certain requirements under the investment company act with respect to the secregistered funds for which we act as investment adviser or subinvestment adviser pzena financial services llc our sec registered broker dealer subsidiary is regulated by the financial industry regulatory authority finra each of the regulatory bodies with jurisdiction over us has the authority to regulate various aspects of financial services including the authority to grant and in specific circumstances to cancel permissions to carry on particular businesses our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could result in fines censure suspensions of personnel or other sanctions including revocation of our registration as an investment adviser even if a sanction imposed against us is small in monetary amount the adverse publicity arising from the imposition of such sanctions by regulators could harm our reputation result in withdrawal by our clients andor impede our ability to retain clients and develop new client relationships as we continue to expand into the international market we may also be under the regulatory scope of local regulatory authorities and noncompliance with any of these authorities may result in fines sanctions and inability to operate in that local market the sec and its staff continue to engage in various initiatives and reviews that seek to improve and modernize the regulatory structure governing the asset management industry and registered investment companies in particular during the past few years the sec proposed among other things enhanced reporting by investment advisors enhanced reporting on registered mutual funds and cyber security and new vendor concerns while these proposals have yet to be finalized into new rules any new rules guidance or regulatory initiatives resulting from these efforts could expose us to additional compliance and reporting costs and may require us to change how we operate our business or manages funds the united kingdom uk and other european jurisdictions in which we operate have implemented the markets in financial instruments directive mifid rules into national legislation and have begun to implement mifid ii mifid ii builds upon many initiatives introduced through mifid which primarily focused on equity trading activity to migrate onto open and transparent markets mifid ii which will come into full effect in january  will be implemented through a number of more detailed directives regulations and standards to be made by the european commission and by the european securities markets authority esma it is expected that mifid ii will have significant and wideranging impacts on the european union eu securities market including i enhanced investor protection and governance standards ii rules regarding the ability of portfolio management firms to receive and pay for investment research relating to all asset classes iii an enhanced role for esma in supervising eu securities iv new requirements regarding noneu investment firms’ access to eu financial markets as well as many other requirements for derivatives and trading activities each of these proposals if adopted as stated may impose additional technological and compliance costs we continue to monitor developments of these rules and the impact they may have on business activities in june  the uk held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the eu commonly referred to as “brexit” as a result of the referendum it is expected that the british government will begin negotiating the terms of the uk’s future relationship with the eu the referendum is nonbinding however if passed into law negotiations would commence to determine future terms of the uk’s relationship with the eu including the terms of trade between the uk and the eu the effects of brexit will depend on any agreements the uk makes to retain access to eu markets either during a transitional period or more permanently the measure could lead to regulatory changes and uncertainty and result in additional legal and compliance costs we are actively working to ensure our operations are structured effectively and efficiently to service uk and european clients we also face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities including extended investigation and surveillance activity adoption of costly or restrictive new regulations and judicial or administrative proceedings that may result in substantial penalties the requirements imposed by our regulators are designed to ensure the integrity of the financial markets and to protect customers and other third parties who deal with us and are not designed to protect our stockholders any regulatory and legislative actions and reforms affecting the investment advisory industry may negatively impact earnings by increasing our costs of operations in addition the regulatory environment in which we operate is subject to ongoing modification and further regulation the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of  “the doddfrank act” and regulations to be promulgated pursuant to it is one such example certain provisions of the doddfrank act may have unintended consequences on the financial market as a whole that could negatively affect our business  table of contents specific regulatory changes also may have a direct impact on the revenue of our business in addition to regulatory scrutiny and potential fines and sanctions regulators continue to examine different aspects of the asset management industry for example the use of “soft dollars” where a portion of commissions paid to brokerdealers in connection with the execution of trades also pays for research and other services provided to advisors has been reexamined by different regulatory bodies and may in the future be limited or modified although a substantial portion of the research relied on by our business in the investment decisionmaking process is generated internally by our investment analysts external research including external research paid for with soft dollars is important to the process this external research generally is used for information gathering or verification purposes and includes brokerprovided research as well as thirdparty provided databases and research services if the use of soft dollars were to be limited we would have to bear additional costs the us department of labor’s fiduciary rule could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in april  the dol issued its final rule expanding the “investment advice fiduciary” definition under the employee retirement income security act of  erisa which should become generally applicable in april of  the rule significantly expands the circumstances under which investment advisers are treated as fiduciaries to erisa plans and individual retirement accounts and are therefore precluded from receiving compensation that varies with the investment choices made or from recommending proprietary investment products absent an exemption if the rule is enacted as written it will require many investment managers to revise a number of their distribution relationships create compliance and operational challenges for distribution partners and may limit abilities to provide services and education to its clients although this rule may not directly impact our operations our business sourced from distribution partners who could be subject to such rules may be adversely impacted and the assets from such sources may be difficult to maintain or grow as a result of the rule and its implementation changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity we are subject to income as well as nonincomebased taxes in both the us and nonus jurisdictions we are also subject to potential tax audits in various jurisdictions and in such event tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess penalties or additional taxes we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these potential audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these potential audits the actual outcomes of these potential audits could have a material impact on our net income or financial condition and any changes in tax laws or tax rulings could materially impact our effective tax rate and earnings certain changes in accounting andor financial reporting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” the sec or other standardsetting bodies could have a material impact on our reported financial position or results of our operations we are subject to the application of generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” which are periodically revised andor expanded as such we are required to adopt new or revised accounting andor financial reporting standards issued by recognized accounting standard setters or regulators such as the fasb and the sec changes associated with the adoption of revised financial reporting standards could have a material impact on our reported financial position or results of our operations inadequate business continuity plans including those of our significant thirdparty vendors could lead to material financial loss reputational harm and inability to continue business we rely heavily on our financial accounting trading compliance and other data processing systems any failure or interruption of these systems whether caused by natural disaster power or telecommunications failure act of terrorism or war or otherwise could result in a disruption of our business liability to clients regulatory intervention or reputational damage and thus materially adversely affect our business the backup systems that we have in place and other protective measures that we have taken may not be adequate in the event of a failure or interruption we depend on our headquarters in new york city for the continued operation of our business a disaster or a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business or directly affecting our headquarters may have a material adverse impact on our ability to continue to operate our business without interruption  table of contents we have a detailed business continuity plan in place that is tested on a quarterly basis we strive to understand the protective measures of our thirdparty vendors however there can be no assurance that these measures will be sufficient to mitigate the harm that may result from such a disaster or disruption any significant security breach of our software applications technology or other systems critical to our operations may disrupt our business or cause us to lose sensitive and confidential information which in turn may cause reputational and financial harm we are dependent on the effectiveness of our and our thirdparty vendors information and cyber security infrastructure policies procedures and capabilities to protect our computer and telecommunications systems and the data that resides in or is transmitted through them as part of our normal operations we maintain and transmit confidential information about our clients as well as proprietary information relating to our business operations we maintain a system of internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that fraudulent activity including misappropriation of assets fraudulent financial reporting and unauthorized access to sensitive or confidential data is either prevented or detected in a timely manner we also strive to understand the protective measures of our thirdparty vendors and ensure that we have complementary user controls in place to mitigate risk however our information technology systems may still be vulnerable to unauthorized access or may be corrupted by cyberattacks computer viruses or other malicious software code or authorized persons could inadvertently or intentionally release confidential or proprietary information although we take precautions to password protect andor encrypt our electronic hardware if such hardware is stolen misplaced or left unattended it may become vulnerable to hacking or other unauthorized use creating a possible security risk and resulting in potentially costly consequences to us a breach of our technology systems could result in the loss of valuable information liability for stolen assets or information remediation costs to repair damage caused by the breach additional security costs to mitigate against future incidents and legal costs resulting from the incident moreover loss of confidential customer information could harm our reputation result in the termination of contracts by our existing customers and subject us to liability under laws that protect confidential data resulting in loss of revenue the individuals counterparties or issuers on whom we rely to perform services for us may be unable or unwilling to honor their contractual obligations to us we rely on various third parties and other vendors to fulfill their obligations to us whether specified by contract course of dealing or otherwise disruptions in the financial markets and other economic challenges may cause our counterparties and other vendors to experience significant cash flow problems or even render them insolvent which may expose us to credit operational or other risk operational risk such as trade errors or system limitations or failures may create significant financial impact to us hamper future growth and cause potential reputational harm we face potential operational risk from our management of client assets and daily business risks include errors that may occur during the execution confirmation or settlement phase of transactions and such errors may cause material financial loss which in turn may cause material financial and reputational harm to us we also face the potential of inaccurate recording of transactions in our internal systems caused by human error system limitations or system malfunctions such errors may involve client and public reporting execution confirmation and settlement of trades and billing the potential for operational risk could have significant regulatory financial or reputational impact there can be no assurance that all risks and errors can be prevented we are exposed to legal risks which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations or cause significant reputational harm to us additionally litigation may result in higher insurance premiums and increased insurance coverage risks which could increase our costs and reduce our profitability we depend to a large extent on our relationships with our clients and our reputation for integrity and highcaliber professional services to attract and retain clients as a result dissatisfaction with our services could be more damaging to our business than to other types of businesses if our clients suffer significant losses or are otherwise dissatisfied with our services such as for breach of trading guidelines andor perceived conflicts of interest we could be subject to the risk of legal liabilities or actions alleging negligent misconduct breach of fiduciary duty or breach of contract these risks are often difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude often remain unknown for substantial periods of time while we strive to conduct our business in accordance with the highest ethical standards we are always open to the risk of litigation by parties in addition to our clients for instance by our shareholders employees and regulators we may incur significant legal expenses in defending against litigation substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us  table of contents could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations or cause significant reputational harm to us potential regulatory and governmental inquiries civil litigation or employmentrelated claims could involve substantial financial penalties certain insurance coverage may not be available or may be prohibitively expensive in future periods as our insurance policies come up for renewal we may need to assume higher deductibles or coinsurance liabilities or pay higher premiums which could increase our expenses and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations insurance coverage may not protect us from all of the liabilities that could arise from the risks inherent in our business we maintain insurance coverage focused on reducing potential losses related to our operations we purchase insurance in amounts and against risks that we consider appropriate there can be no assurance however that a claim or claims will be completely covered by insurance or if covered at all will not exceed the limits of our existing insurance coverage if a loss occurs that is partially or completely uninsured we may be exposed to substantial liability insurance costs are impacted by market conditions and our risk profile and may increase significantly over relatively short periods renewals of insurance policies may result in additional costs through higher premiums or the assumption of higher deductibles or coinsurance liability in addition insurance and other safeguards might only partially reimburse us for our losses in the event our business continuity plan fails and our operations are significantly disrupted our global and nonus strategies consist primarily of investments in the securities of issuers located outside of the united states which may involve foreign currency exchange political social and economic uncertainties and risks our global and nonus strategies which together represented  billion and  billion of our aum as of december   and  respectively are primarily invested in securities of companies located outside the united states investments in nonus issuers may be affected by political social and economic uncertainty affecting a country or region in which we are invested many emerging financial markets are not as developed or as efficient as the us financial market and as a result liquidity may be reduced and price volatility may increase the legal and regulatory environments including financial accounting standards and practices may also be different and there may be less publicly available information in respect of such companies these risks could adversely impact the performance of our strategies that are invested in securities of nonus issuers in addition fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may affect investment return and aum since we do not engage in currency hedging for these portfolios due to these factors our aum may fluctuate from one reporting period to another causing volatility in earnings risks related to our investment strategies and process our classic value investment style subjects us to the risk that the companies in which we invest may not achieve the level of earnings recovery that we initially expect or at all we generally invest in companies after they have experienced or are expected by the market to soon experience a shortfall in their historic earnings due to an adverse business development management error accounting scandal or other disruption and before there is clear evidence of earnings recovery or business momentum while investors are generally less willing to invest when companies lack earnings visibility our classic value investment approach seeks to capture the return that can be obtained by investing in a company before the market has confidence in its ability to achieve earnings recovery however our investment approach entails the risk that the companies included in our portfolios are not able to execute as we had expected when we originally invested in them thereby reducing the performance of our strategies since our positions in these investments are often substantial even partial sales of a substantial position into the market may cause the market price of our investment to decline and there is the risk that we may be unable to find willing purchasers for our investments when we decide to sell them since we apply the same investment process across all of our investment strategies utilizing one analyst team and given the overlapping universes of many of our investment strategies we could have common positions and industry or sector concentrations across many of our investment strategies at the same time as such factors leading one of our investment strategies to underperform may lead other strategies to underperform simultaneously our investment approach may underperform other investment approaches during certain market conditions our products are best suited for investors with longterm investment horizons in accordance with our classic value investment approach we typically hold securities for an average of three to five years our strategies may not perform well during points in the economic cycle when valueoriented stocks are relatively less attractive for instance during the late stages  table of contents of an economic cycle investors may purchase relatively expensive stocks in order to obtain access to above average growth valueoriented strategies may also experience weakness during periods when the markets are focused on one investment thesis or sector even when securities prices are rising generally portfolio performance can be affected by our investment approach the classic value approach has outperformed the market in some economic and market environments and underperformed it in others in particular a prolonged period in which the growthstyle of investing outperforms the valuestyle may cause our investment strategy to go out of favor with clients consultants and subadvised relationships our investment strategy may be less favored during certain time periods for other reasons as well including due to perceived riskiness or volatility of our approach poor performance relative to peers coupled with changes in personnel extensive periods in particular market environments or other difficulties may result in a decline in our aum our investment process requires us to conduct extensive fundamental research on any company before investing which may result in missed investment opportunities and reduce the performance of our investment strategies we take a considerable amount of time to complete the indepth research projects that our investment process requires before adding any security to our portfolio our process requires that we take this time to understand the company and the business well enough to make an informed decision as to whether we are willing to own a significant position in a company that does not yet have clear earnings visibility however the time we take to make this judgment may cause us to miss the opportunity to invest in a company that has a sharp and rapid earnings recovery any such missed investment opportunities could adversely impact the performance of our investment strategies risks related to our structure we are dependent upon distributions from pzena investment management llc to make distributions to our class a stockholders and to pay taxes and other expenses we are a holding company and have no material assets other than our ownership of membership units of our operating company we have no independent means of generating revenue and cash flow our operating company is treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes and as such is not itself subject to us federal income tax instead its taxable income is allocated to its members including us prorata according to the number of membership units each member owns accordingly we incur income taxes on our proportionate share of any taxable income of our operating company we also incur expenses related to our operations we intend to have our operating company distribute cash to its members in an amount at least equal to that necessary to cover their tax liabilities if any with respect to the earnings of our operating company to the extent we need funds to pay our tax or other liabilities or to fund our operations and our operating company is restricted from making distributions to us under applicable laws or regulations or contractual restrictions or does not have sufficient earnings to make these distributions we may have to borrow funds to meet these obligations and run our business and thus our liquidity and financial condition could be materially adversely affected there can be no assurance that funds will be available to borrow under such circumstances on terms acceptable to us or at all we are required to pay most of the tax benefit of any amortization deductions we may claim as a result of the tax basis step up we receive in connection with the sales of membership units and any future exchanges of class b units and this tax treatment could be challenged by tax authorities as part of the reorganization we implemented with our initial public offering ipo we purchased membership units of our operating company from three of its members the selling members in addition holders of class b units may at least once each year exchange their class b units of our operating company for shares of our class a common stock these purchases and subsequent exchanges have resulted and are expected to continue to result in increases in our share of the tax basis in the tangible and intangible assets of our operating company that otherwise would not have been available these increases in tax basis have reduced and are expected to continue to reduce the amount of tax that we would otherwise be required to pay in the future although the internal revenue service irs might challenge all or part of this tax basis increase and a court might sustain such a challenge pursuant to a tax receivable agreement dated october   among us the selling members and all holders of class b units after our ipo we are required to pay the selling members and certain holders of class b units who elect to exchange their class b units for shares of our class a common stock  of the amount of the cash savings if any in us federal state and local income tax that we realize as a result of the increases in amortizable tax basis due to the sale to us of their membership units the actual increase in tax basis as well as the amount and timing of any payments under this agreement may vary depending upon a number of factors including the timing of exchanges the price of our class a common stock at the  table of contents time of the exchange the extent to which such exchanges are taxable the amount and timing of our income and the tax rates then applicable payments under the tax receivable agreement are expected to give rise to certain additional tax benefits attributable to further increases in basis any such benefits are covered by the tax receivable agreement and may increase the amounts due thereunder we expect that as a result of the size and increases in our share of the tax basis in the tangible and intangible assets of our operating company attributable to our interest therein the payments that we may make to these members likely may be substantial if we exercise our right to terminate the tax receivable agreement early we may be obligated to make an early termination payment to the selling and converting shareholders based upon the net present value of all payments that would be required to be paid by us if certain change of control events were to occur we would also be obligated to make an early termination payment were the irs to successfully challenge the tax basis increases described above we would not be reimbursed for any payments made under the tax receivable agreement as a result in certain circumstances we could be required to make payments under the tax receivable agreement in excess of our cash tax savings risks related to our class a common stock the market price and trading volume of our class a common stock may be volatile which could result in rapid and substantial losses for our stockholders the market price of our class a common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in addition the trading volume of our class a common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur if the market price of our class a common stock declines significantly you may be unable to resell your shares of our class a common stock at or above your purchase price if at all we cannot assure you that the market price of our class a common stock may not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future the market price of our class a common stock could decline due to the large number of shares of our class a common stock eligible for future sale upon the exchange of class b units of our operating company or future issuance of shares of class a common stock pursuant to the operating agreement of our operating company on at least one date designated by us each year certain holders of class b units may exchange up to  of certain of their class b units for an equivalent number of shares of our class a common stock subject to certain restrictions and conditions set forth in the operating agreement also since  the nonemployee members of our operating company may exchange all of their vested class b units in accordance with the timing restrictions set forth in the operating agreement pursuant to the resale and registration rights agreement dated october   among the holders of class b units and us these holders may resell the shares of class a common stock issued to them upon the exchange of their class b units as discussed above during  we established december   and may   as exchange dates certain employee members nonemployee members and permitted transferees elected to exchange an aggregate of  of their class b units for an equivalent number of shares of our class a common stock which are freely tradable as of december   there remained  shares of our class a common stock that have previously been registered in various registration statements filed with the sec which may be issued upon the exchange of class b units as discussed above in addition we have an effective shelf registration statement filed with the sec under which we may sell up to an aggregate of  million of our class a common stock antitakeover provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could discourage a change of control that our stockholders may favor which could also adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it more difficult and expensive for a third party to acquire control of us even if a change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders for example our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue up to  shares of our preferred stock and to designate the rights preferences privileges and restrictions of unissued series of our preferred stock each without any vote or action by our stockholders we could issue a series of preferred stock to impede the consummation of a merger tender offer or other takeover attempt the antitakeover provisions in our amended and restated certificate of  table of contents incorporation and bylaws may impede takeover attempts or other transactions that may be in the best interests of our stockholders and in particular our class a stockholders in addition the market price of our class a common stock could be adversely affected to the extent that provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws discourage potential takeover attempts or other transactions that our stockholders may favor the disparity in the voting rights among the classes of our common stock may have a potential adverse effect on the price of our class a common stock and may give rise to conflicts of interest our class b stockholders collectively hold approximately  of the combined voting power of our common stock these stockholders consist of our named executive officers and their estate planning vehicles  of our other employees and their estate planning vehicles pzena investment management lp certain other members of our operating company including one of our directors and his related entities and former employees holders of shares of our class b common stock have entered into a class b stockholders’ agreement with respect to all shares of class b common stock then held by them and any additional shares of class b common stock they may acquire in the future pursuant to this agreement they may vote these shares of class b common stock together on all matters submitted to a vote of our common stockholders to the extent that we cause our operating company to issue additional class b units which may be granted subject to vesting to our employees pursuant to the pim llc  equity incentive plan these employees will be entitled to receive an equivalent number of shares of our class b common stock subject to the condition that they agree to enter into this class b stockholders’ agreement each share of our class b common stock entitles its holder to five votes per share for so long as the class b stockholders collectively hold  of the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding when a class b unit is exchanged for a share of our class a common stock an unvested class b unit is forfeited due to the employee holder’s failure to satisfy the conditions of the award agreement pursuant to which it was granted or any class b unit is forfeited as a result of a breach of any restrictive covenants contained in our operating company’s amended and restated operating agreement a corresponding share of our class b common stock will automatically be redeemed by us for so long as our class b stockholders hold at least  of the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding they will be able to elect all of the members of our board of directors and thereby control our management and affairs including determinations with respect to acquisitions dispositions borrowings issuances of securities and the declaration and payment of dividends in addition they will be able to determine the outcome of all matters requiring approval of stockholders and will be able to cause or prevent a change of control of our company or a change in the composition of our board of directors and could preclude any unsolicited acquisition of our company our class b stockholders have the ability to prevent the consummation of mergers takeovers or other transactions that may be in the best interests of our class a stockholders in particular this concentration of voting power could deprive class a stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares of class a common stock as part of a sale of our company and could ultimately affect the market price of our class a common stock each share of our class a common stock entitles its holder to one vote on all matters to be voted on by stockholders this difference in voting rights could adversely affect the value of our class a common stock to the extent that investors view or any potential future purchaser of our company views the superior voting rights of the class b common stock to have more value our ability to pay

needs we use annual nongaap earnings measures discussed in further detail in “item  — management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation — net income” in part ii of this annual report to assess the strength of the underlying operations of the business included in our annual results are certain tax related and nonrecurring adjustments that we feel add a measure of nonoperational complexity to our results as reported under gaap and obscure the underlying performance of the business management therefore does not consider these adjustments when evaluating operating results or financial information in any given period and instead uses nongaap measures of earnings which exclude these items to analyze our operations between periods and over time and to evaluate the financial condition and results of operations investors should consider the nongaap measures in addition to and not as a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap

company to make distributions to us in an amount sufficient to cover the dividends declared we may not pay dividends to our class a common stockholders in amounts that have been paid to them in the past or at all if among other things we do not have the cash necessary to pay our intended dividends or any of our financing facilities or other agreements restrict us from doing so to the extent we do not have cash on hand sufficient to pay dividends in the future we may decide not to pay dividends by paying cash dividends rather than investing that cash in our future growth we risk slowing the

certain private placement funds and nonus funds we function as the sole managing member of our operating company pzena investment management llc the “operating company” as a result we i consolidate the financial results of our operating company with our own and reflect the membership interest in it that we do not own as a noncontrolling interest in our consolidated financial statements and ii recognize income generated from our economic interest in our operating company’s net income as of december    the holders of our class a common stock and the holders of class b units of our operating

asset generated by the companys initial public offering and subsequent class b unit conversions as well as our tax receivable agreement and the associated liability to our selling and converting shareholders in addition to adjustments related to certain nonrecurring charges recognized in operating expenses during  and  we believe that these gaap adjustments add a measure of nonoperational complexity that partially obscures a clear understanding of the underlying performance of our business therefore in evaluating our financial condition and results of operations we also review certain nongaap measures of earnings which exclude these items excluding these items nongaap diluted net income and nongaap diluted earnings per share were   million and   respectively for the year ended

revenue we generate revenue primarily from management fees and performance fees which we collectively refer to as our advisory fees by managing assets on behalf of institutional accounts and for retail clients which are generally openend mutual funds catering primarily to retail investors our advisory fee income is primarily based on our aum as discussed below and is recognized over the period in which investment management services are provided following the preferred method identified in the revenue recognition topic of the financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification “fasb asc” income from performance fees is recorded at the conclusion of the contractual performance period when all contingencies are resolved our advisory fees are primarily driven by the level of our aum our aum increases or decreases with the net inflows or outflows of funds into our various investment strategies and with the investment performance thereof in order to increase our aum and expand our business we must develop and market investment strategies that suit the investment needs of our target clients and provide attractive returns over the longterm the value and composition of our aum and our ability to continue to attract clients will depend on a variety of factors as described in “item  — risk factors — risks related to our business — our primary source of revenue is derived from management fees which are directly tied to our assets under management fluctuations in aum therefore will directly impact our revenue for our institutional accounts we are paid management fees according to a schedule which varies by investment strategy the substantial majority of these accounts pay us management fees pursuant to a schedule in which the rate we earn on the aum declines as the amount of aum increases pursuant to our subinvestment advisory agreements with our retail clients and advisory agreements with pzenabranded funds we are generally paid a management fee according to a schedule in which the rate we earn on the aum declines as the amount of aum increases certain of these funds pay us fixedrate management fees due to the substantially larger account size of certain of these accounts the average advisory fees we earn on them as a percentage of aum are lower than the advisory fees we earn on our institutional accounts  table of contents advisory fees we earn on institutional accounts are generally based on the value of aum at a specific date on a quarterly basis certain of our institutional accounts and all of our retail accounts are calculated based on the average of the monthly or daily market value advisory fees are also generally adjusted for any cash flows into or out of a portfolio where the cash flow represents greater than  of the value of the portfolio while a specific group of accounts may use the same fee rate the calculation methodology may differ as described above certain of our clients pay us performance fees according to the performance of their accounts relative to certain agreedupon benchmarks which results in a lower base fee but allows for us to earn higher fees if the relevant investment strategy outperforms the agreedupon benchmark some performancebased fee arrangements include highwater mark provisions which generally provide that if a client account underperforms relative to its performance target it must gain back such underperformance before we can collect future performancebased fees fulcrum fee arrangements related to one client relationship require a reduction in the base fee or allow for a performance fee if the relevant investment strategy underperforms or outperforms respectively the agreedupon benchmark   our advisory fees may fluctuate based on a number of factors including the following • changes in aum due to appreciation or depreciation of our investment portfolios and the levels of the contribution and withdrawal of assets by new and existing clients • distribution of aum among our investment strategies which have differing fee schedules • distribution of aum between institutional accounts and retail accounts for which we generally earn lower overall advisory fees and • the level of our performance with respect to accounts on which we are paid performance fees or have fulcrum fee arrangements expenses our expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits expense as well as general and administrative expense our largest expense is compensation and benefits which includes the salaries bonuses equitybased compensation and

liabilities lease commitments debt obligations and operating company distributions compensation is our largest expense to the extent we deem necessary and appropriate to run our business recognizing the need to retain our key personnel we have the ability to change the absolute levels of our compensation packages as well as change the mix of their cash and noncash components historically we have not tied our level of compensation directly to revenue as many wall street firms do correspondingly there is not a linear relationship between our compensation and the revenues we generate this generally has the effect of increasing operating margins in periods of increased revenues but can reduce operating margins when revenue declines we continuously evaluate our staffing requirements and compensation levels with reference to our own liquidity position and external peer benchmarking data the result of this review directly influences management’s recommendations to our board of directors with respect to such staffing and compensation levels we anticipate that tax allocations and dividend equivalent payments to the members of our operating company which consists of certain of our employees unaffiliated persons former employees and us will continue to be a material financing activity cash distributions to operating company members for partnership tax allocations would increase should the taxable income of the operating company increase dividend equivalent payments will depend on our dividend policy and the discretion of our board of directors as discussed below we believe that our lack of longterm debt and ability to vary cash compensation levels have provided us with an appropriate degree of flexibility in providing for our liquidity needs dividend policy as we are a holding company and have no material assets other than our ownership of membership interests in our operating company we depend upon distributions from our operating company to pay any dividends that our board of directors may declare to be paid to our class a common stockholders when and if our board of directors declares any such dividends we then cause our operating company to make distributions to us in an amount sufficient to cover the dividends declared our dividend policy has certain risks and limitations particularly with respect to liquidity we may not pay dividends to our class a common shareholders in amounts that have been paid to them in the past or at all if among other things we do not have the cash necessary to pay our intended dividends to the extent we do not have cash on hand sufficient to pay dividends in the future we may decide not to pay dividends by paying cash dividends rather than investing that cash in our future growth we risk slowing the pace of our growth or not having a sufficient amount of cash to fund our operations or unanticipated capital expenditures should the need arise on an annual basis our board of directors has targeted a cash dividend payout ratio of approximately  to  of our nongaap diluted net income subject to growth initiatives and other funding needs our ability to pay dividends is subject to the board of directors’ discretion and may be limited by our holding company structure and applicable provisions of delaware law see “item a — risk factors — risks relating to our class a common stock — our ability to pay dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and may be limited by our holding company structure and applicable provisions of delaware law” tax receivable agreement our purchase of membership units of our operating company concurrent with our ipo and the subsequent and future exchanges by holders of class b units of our operating company for shares of our class a common stock pursuant to the exchange rights provided for in the operating company’s operating agreement has resulted in and is expected to continue to result in increases in our share of the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of our operating company which will increase the tax depreciation and amortization deductions that otherwise would not have been available to us these increases in tax basis and tax depreciation and amortization deductions have reduced and are expected to continue to reduce the amount of cash taxes that we would otherwise be required to pay in the future we have entered into a tax receivable agreement with the current members of our operating company the one member of our operating company immediately prior to our initial public offering who sold all of its membership units to us in connection with our initial public offering and any future holders of class b units that requires us to pay them  of the amount of cash savings if any in us federal state and local income tax that we actually realize or are deemed to realize in the case of an early termination payment by us or a change in control as described in the tax receivable agreement as a result of the increases in tax basis described above and certain other tax benefits related to entering into the tax receivable agreement including tax benefits attributable to payments under the tax receivable agreement  table of contents cash flows year ended december   versus december   cash and cash equivalents increased  million to  million in  compared to  million in   net cash provided by operating activities increased  million in  to  million from  million in   the increase primarily reflects a change in the timing of yearend bonus payments to january of the subsequent year as well as an increase in net income driven by taxes changes in the liability to selling and converting shareholders and gains losses and other investment income these increases were partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities and working capital net cash provided by investing activities was  million in  compared to  million used in   the  million increase was primarily due to a  million decrease in cash used in the purchases of property and equipment and a  million decrease in payments to related parties related primarily to loans made to employees in december of  partially offset by  million decrease in proceeds from net sales of investments net cash used in financing activities decreased  million in  to   million from   million in   this decrease is primarily due to a  million decrease in the repurchase and retirement of shares of class a common stock and class b units during  year ended december   versus december   cash and cash equivalents decreased  million to  million in  compared to  million in   net cash provided by operating activities increased  million in  to  million from  million in   the increase primarily reflects changes in operating assets and liabilities and working capital partially offset by a decrease in net income net cash used in investing activities was  million in  compared to  million used in   the  million increase was primarily attributable to a  million increase in purchases of property and equipment related to our new corporate headquarters and a  million increase in payments to related parties associated with loans made to employees during  which were partially offset by a  million increase in net proceeds from the sale of investments associated primarily with the redemption of seed capital in the pzena mutual funds during  net cash used in financing activities increased  million in  to  million from  million in   this increase is primarily due to a  million decrease in contributions from noncontrolling interests a  million increase in the repurchase and retirement of class a common stock and class b units and a  million increase in cash dividends paid during  these increases in cash used were partially offset by  million in cash received for the exercise of options and  million in units sold under our equity incentive plan during  contractual obligations the following table sets

december     table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under current circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions accounting policies are an integral part of our financial statements a thorough understanding of these accounting policies is essential when reviewing our reported results of operations and our financial condition management believes that the critical accounting policies discussed below involve additional management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods and assumptions used consolidation our policy is to consolidate all majorityowned subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest and variableinterest entities of which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary we assess our consolidation practices regularly as circumstances dictate all significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated during the first quarter of  the company adopted asu no  “consolidation topic  amendments to the consolidation analysis” issued by the fasb in february  this standard modifies consolidation guidance for reporting organizations that are required to evaluate whether certain legal entities should be consolidated the company elected to adopt asu no  under a modified retrospective approach by recording a cumulativeeffect adjustment to equity as of the january   the adoption of asu no  resulted in the deconsolidation of entities previously included in our consolidated results as the company no longer has a controlling financial interest in those entities the effects of asu no  on the company’s consolidated financial statements are included in “note  — significant accounting policies” of this annual report on form k income taxes we are a “c” corporation under the internal revenue code and thus liable for federal state and local taxes on the income derived from our economic interest in our operating company the operating company is a limited liability company that has elected to be treated as a partnership for tax purposes our operating company has not made a provision for federal or state income taxes because it is the responsibility of each of the operating company’s members including us to separately report their proportionate share of the operating company’s taxable income or loss similarly the income of our consolidated investment partnerships is not subject to income taxes as such income is allocated to each partnership’s individual partners the operating company has made a provision for new york city unincorporated business tax ubt and its consolidated subsidiary pzena investment management ltd has made a provision for uk income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits a valuation allowance is recorded on our deferred tax assets when it is morelikelythannot that all or a portion of such assets will not be realized when evaluating the realizability of our deferred tax assets all evidence both positive and negative is evaluated which requires management to make significant judgments and assumptions items considered when evaluating the need for a valuation allowance include our forecast of future taxable income future reversals of existing temporary differences tax planning strategies and other relevant considerations we believe that the accounting estimate related to the valuation allowance is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions can change from period to period for example tax law changes or variances in future projected operating performance could result in a change in the valuation allowance each quarter we reevaluate our estimate related to the valuation allowance including our assumptions about future taxable income if we are not able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future a valuation allowance would be recorded against our deferred tax asset and charged to income tax expense in the period such determination was made tax benefits related to stock option windfall deductions are not recognized until they result in a reduction of cash taxes payable the benefit of these excess tax benefits will be recorded in equity when they reduce cash taxes payable we will only  table of contents recognize a tax benefit from stock and unitbased awards in additional paidin capital if an incremental tax benefit is realized after all other tax benefits currently available have been utilized during the years ended december   and  we had approximately  million and  million respectively in tax benefits associated with stock and unitbased awards that we were not able to recognize this amount is reflected as an unrecognized tax benefit management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes evaluating our tax positions and establishing deferred tax assets and liabilities the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations if the ultimate resolution of uncertainties is different from currently estimated it could affect income tax expense and the effective tax rate recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted see note  significant accounting policies — recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this annual report item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk our exposure to market risk is directly related to our role as investment adviser for the institutional separate accounts we manage and the retail clients for which we act as subinvestment adviser our revenue for the three years ended december   was generally derived from advisory fees which are typically based on the market value of our aum which can be affected by adverse changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices accordingly a decline in the prices of securities would cause our revenue and income to decline due to a decrease in the value of the assets we manage in addition such a decline could cause our clients to withdraw their funds in favor of investments offering higher returns or lower risk which would cause our revenue and income to decline further the value of our aum was  billion as of december    a  increase or decrease in the value of our aum if proportionately distributed over all of our investment strategies products and client relationships would cause an annualized increase or decrease in our revenues of approximately  million at our current weighted average fee rate excluding the impact of performance fees and fulcrum fee arrangements of  there are differences in our fee rates across distribution channels investment strategies and the size of client relationships as such a change in the composition of our aum in particular an increase in the proportion of our total assets under management attributable to strategies clients or relationships with lower effective fee rates could have a material negative impact on our overall weighted average fee rates and thus different impact to revenues on the same  increase or decrease in the value of our aum we are also subject to market risk due to a decline in the value of our holdings and the holdings of our consolidated subsidiaries which as of december   consist primarily of marketable securities investments in equity method investees and securities sold short at december    the fair value of our assets subject to market risk was  million  at december    the fair value of our liabilities subject to market risk was  million  assuming a  increase or decrease the fair value of these assets and liabilities would increase or decrease by  million and  million respectively at december    exchange rate risk a substantial portion of the accounts that we advise or subadvise hold investments that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar movements in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and the underlying foreign currency affect the values of assets held in accounts that we manage thereby affecting the amount of revenues we earn the value of our aum was  billion as of december   and approximately  of our assets under management across our investment strategies were invested in strategies that primarily invest in securities of nonus companies and approximately  of our assets under management were invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar to the extent our assets under management are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar the value of those assets under management will decrease with an increase in the value of the us dollar or increase with a decrease in the value of the us dollar because we believe that many of our clients invest in those strategies in order to gain exposure to nonus currencies or may implement their own hedging programs we do not hedge an investment portfolio’s exposure to a nonus currency  table of contents we have not adopted a corporatelevel risk management policy to manage this exchange rate risk assuming that  of our assets under management is invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar and excluding the impact of any hedging arrangements a  increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar would decrease or increase the fair value of our assets under management by  billion which would cause an annualized increase or decrease in revenues of approximately  million at our current weighted average fee rate excluding the impact of performance fees and fulcrum fee arrangements of  we operate in several foreign countries but mainly in the united kingdom we incur operating expenses and have foreign currencydenominated assets and liabilities associated with these operations although our revenues are predominately realized in us dollar we do not believe that foreign currency fluctuations materially affect our results of operations interest rate risk as of december    our   million  in cash and cash equivalents was primarily held in demand deposit accounts as such interest rate changes would not have a material impact on the income we earn from these deposits in addition the company does not have any debt and as a result does not have any direct exposure to interest rate risk at december    item  financial statements and supplementary data our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto begin on page f of this annual

also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic

the crux of this approach is comparing the most accurate estimate to the zacks consensus estimate although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too in fact when combining a zacks rank  or better and a positive earnings esp
