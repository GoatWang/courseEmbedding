events  jobs mobile navigation anheuserbusch inbev acquires energy drink maker hiball chris furnari jul   at  pm one year after inking a deal with coffee giant starbucks the world’s largest beer company is making another investment in the nonalcoholic beverage segment anheuserbusch inbev today announced plans to acquire hiball inc a san franciscobased beverage company founded in  that markets a range of caffeinated beverages including energy drinks sparkling waters and cold brew coffees the company also makes a line of noncaffeinated juices and seltzers called alta palla “we are thrilled to partner with a company that shares our vision for where we can take hiball energy and alta palla in the future and brings real passion and dedication to their work every day” hiball founder todd berardi said in a press release “this deal is the beginning of a new and exciting chapter for me and my team and i can’t wait to get started” specific financial terms were not disclosed but anheuserbusch ceo joão castro neves said his company would purchase  percent of hiball inc in a deal that would be structured to include earnouts and various growth incentives the two companies expect the transaction to close during the third quarter of  “todd alyssa dan and the entire hiball team have created an incredible business developing some of the fastestgrowing brands in the beverage industry and giving their loyal consumers the choices they love” castro neves said via a press release “we are very happy to partner with these three entrepreneurs and invest to help them achieve their dreams” the purchase comes about  months after ab agreed to manufacture and distribute a readytodrink version of starbucks’ popular teavana product in an interview with brewbound castro neves said both the hiball investment and ab’s partnership with starbucks are part of a broader strategy aimed at “growing beyond beer” and a “desire” to advance the company’s position in the nonalcoholic space — a process that began about two years ago “part of the duediligence was to know where growth was going to come from” he said “we saw premium readytodrink tea being a place that is growing but we also see big growth coming from other areas in the future we also saw energy and sparkling waters those three more than anything else were growing fast” according to data from market research iri worldwide sales of energy drinks were up about  percent during the week period ending may  sales of sparkling waters and teas meanwhile were up  percent and  percent respectively during the same period the acquisition of hiball does more than give ab a foothold in the growing energy and sparkling water categories it enables the beer company to supply its nationwide distributor network with a broader array of nonalcoholic offerings particularly an energy drink something wholesalers lost in  when cocacola paid more than  billion for a  percent stake in monster beverage corporation as part of that deal coke and monster amended their distribution agreement in the us and pulled the energy drink brand from many ab wholesalers who had played a key role in growing sales at independent retailers and onpremise accounts “one of the things that we bring to the table is this amazing wholesaler network and our focus on route to market” castro neves said “we have been discussing this nonalcoholic strategy with them for the past two years and they all like that a lot” berardi who spoke to ab wholesalers during a conference call this morning described ab distributors as being “hungry for nonalcoholic items” “that makes us even more excited about this partnership” he said “we all want to create something big and that is what makes this partnership so exciting for our team” in the press release david stokes the ceo of grey eagle distributors and the chair of ab’s wholesaler advisory panel praised the deal calling hiball a “great addition” to his company’s “developing” nonalcoholic portfolio “we have been asking ab for a partnership opportunity just like this” he said “adding these outstanding brands to our wholesaler system increases the breadth of our product portfolio and strengthens our network as we offer more innovation to our customers” castro neves stressed however that the purchase of hiball wasn’t driven by a need to “replace” monster in the ab network instead he said it was a strategic move aimed at complementing ab’s already expansive beer portfolio “the fact that the ab network did so well — and according to everyone i spoke with they are part of the explanation on monster’s success – it gives me the confidence that if we have done it once we can do it twice” castro neves said of bringing a nonalcoholic beverage brand to market “high growth and high margins is something that they wholesalers look for and therefore i think it will be a winwin for all of us” he added hiball is distributed in  states with a mix of natural products distributors including unfi and kehe berardi told brewbound ab is planning a “phased transition” of hiball brands into its network but an official timeline was not disclosed hiball’s products will continue to be made at existing us copacking facilities berardi added but that could change over the next  months as ab determines if it will make additional brewery investments that would improve its ability to produce nonalcoholic drinks “now is about planning the next phase” castro neves said “this will come into discussion at a point in time but we are focusing on the topline right now” all  hiball employees will remain with the company berardi said and michael taylor the current vice president of abi’s north america zone will transition into a new role as the head hiball and alta palla he will also continue to serve on the board of directors for craft brew alliance which is  percent owned by ab but that position could be reevaluated castro neves said editor’s note a

inbev success story if any company can lay claim to guaranteeing access to a cold crisp bottle of beer it is anheuserbusch the storied company whose origins go back to century st louis was the first to invent pasteurization mechanical refrigeration and refrigerated railroad cars today anheuser busch inbev ab inbev is the largest beer manufacturer in the world by volume producing more than  of the world’s bestselling regional and international beers including budweiser stella artois beck’s michelob and skol in fact inbev is the leading global brewer and one of the world’s top five consumer product companies discover the challenge  solution  results anheuserbusch inbev company anheuserbusch brews innovation and savings with lexmark managed print services mps industries manufacturing products managed print services mps view the pdf version of this success story pdf  kb share this page challenge each year anheuserbusch’s north american operations produces  million hectoliters of beer and other beverages  of inbev’s total volume which are bottled packaged and sold through its network of companyowned and independent wholesalers and retailers as part of its daily administrative operations and to respond to increasing demand for its products the beer manufacturer had spent decades adding and replacing printers copiers fax machines and scanners as needed and without much thought the result an inefficient uncoordinated network of mismatched and aging printers and a dizzying and expensive collection of leases and maintenance plans to support them all “we had  to  leased copiers and multifunction devices and a few thousand devices that we owned” said jay emery director of workplace services it at anheuserbusch inbev’s st louis operations “it was a completely mixed model” he continued “for models we owned we had to buy things like toner and cartridges for models we leased toner was included maintenance plans weren’t consistent either nothing was simple we knew there was an opportunity for significant savings and that we could put those dollars to better use growing the company” the numbers were staggering an assessment conducted by lexmark revealed that original anheuserbusch output environment contained  distinct device models from  different manufacturers also telltale signs of an unmanaged environment the company had  inkjets  fax machines  copiers and a total of  wideformat a x devices that were underutilized but despite the condition of its output devices paper was still operationally critical and the lifeline of getting beer from the cask and into beer cases throughout north america “if a device goes down and beer can’t be shipped it’s thousands of dollars an hour that are lost” emery said “i’m not kidding when i say that we always had a printer in the closet as a backup just in case” furthermore because anheuserbusch’s product is alcohol specific shipping protocols must be adhered to faulty or missing printouts can botch a delivery “the most important piece is our bill of lading” emery said “everything needs to be printed in triplicate one of the legal requirements from the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives atf is that one copy goes with the driver one copy stays at the brewery and one copy goes to the wholesaler” our goal was to have one print vendor service all of our print and output needs and we were able to accomplish that with lexmark jay emery director of workplace services it anheuserbusch inbev paper was pervasive in the back office as well “people would print something and not even think about it and then at the end of the day there were stacks and stacks of paper that were left in the printers and forgotten about” said emery “every page printed and abandoned was a wasted opportunity to fund growth and innovation” an assessment conducted by lexmark revealed that the devices installed throughout anheuserbusch were an average of  years old breakdowns often caused by the age of the devices became a costly headache and soon it became clear that anheuserbusch’s output environment was not up to par anheuserbusch also knew that all of that paper printed and abandoned or even recycled had an environmental cost too the company wanted to get serious about reducing paper consumption—for environmental reasons as much as for savings—which had reached “multiple arch proportions” according to a lexmark assessment the brewer’s combined american and canadian operations produced  million printed pages in  alone an amount that if stacked on top of each other would be the equivalent of stacking st louis’ landmark gateway arch  times “there weren’t any systems in place to track manage or control print usage” emery acknowledged in  the company began looking for a better more cost effective and greener way to handle output one that would support its overall business objectives around growth and innovation uniformity ease of use lower costs and more functionality were all internal priorities but even more importantly anheuserbusch wanted all of its entities including newly acquired companies locations or wholesalers to be able to quickly and easily adopt the solution and share in its ease of use and efficiency “we are frequently acquiring new companies” emery said “when we do it’s really important for them to have a turnkey solution that they can just move to—a solution that’s easy and works and helps support their business” solution all of anheuserbusch’s priorities were attainable in the solution from lexmark a unified set of networked multi and singlefunction printers under a longterm lease agreement supported by a multiyear managed print services mps contract to handle the ongoing upkeep and optimization of the fleet and consumables replenishment “our goal was to have one print vendor service all of our print and output needs and we were able to accomplish that with lexmark” said emery following an extensive evaluation of suppliers anheuserbusch selected products solutions and services from lexmark anheuserbusch began by removing its menagerie of existing devices and installing  lexmark devices in  locations throughout the us and canada the optimized fleet of lexmark monochrome and color multifunction products mfps and printers represents a  percent reduction in the total number of devices anheuserbusch now uses for its business operations throughout north america all the devices are networked and can be shared among employees regardless of office location and making color finishing and other advanced features available to everyone to tackle the mountain of paper—and to remove systemic inefficiencies for employees—anheuserbusch opted for lexmark’s print release solution this solution queues print jobs and releases them only when job owners authenticate themselves at selected lexmark devices connected to the network it also eliminates the time gap between printing and pickup ensuring that forgotten print jobs do not pile up after fourhours print jobs are deleted automatically from the print queue and thereby never printed at all “the most cost effective page is the one never printed” said emery “we’ve reduced printing by two million pages per month just by implementing print release and defaulting to duplex” anheuserbusch also outsourced oversight management and maintenance to lexmark under a multiyear managed print services agreement “moving to a managed services model is a growing industry trend” emery said “our philosophy is that if it’s not our core competency we don’t want to own it we want operations to support our business and not be a focus of our staff” with managed print services lexmark proactively monitors the entire fleet of devices tracking device alerts and conditions lexmark technicians perform remote diagnostics and dispatch field engineers when necessary lexmark printers and mfps automatically trigger new toner cartridges to be ordered and shipped directly to that device’s precise location ensuring that no printer runs out of toner and avoiding the buildup of costly cartridge inventories in each location with lexmark print release alone we’re on track to knock out  of wasted printing or two million pages per month jay emery director of workplace services it anheuserbusch inbev lexmark also collects valuable information about the fleet of devices providing anheuserbusch with data that can be used to make factbased business decisions for example underutilized devices can be moved to higherdemand areas devices removed from the network can be spotted right away volume in color printing can be tracked spikes in output volume can be investigated to see if there is a better more cost effective way to accomplish that unique business requirement “we are a very datadriven company” said emery “we have used the information about our printing habits to drive cultural change we partnered with highvolume print departments such as our people and legal departments as areas for improvement and we rewarded teams for being ‘most improved’ in terms of their print goals as we have created a little bit of competition and promoted these successes across business units our results have continued to grow” changes in printing habits were also fostered through a creative communications plan to employees that started at the top of the executive food chain and that was linked to corporate holidays and other internal events such as world environmental day and arbor day anheuserbusch’s primary message think before you print “print reduction from an it perspective is something that our vice president is very passionate about” said emery “he challenges senior leadership using real data from the lexmark reports to do their part” together anheuserbusch and lexmark orchestrated an aggressive deployment schedule  offices in  days “lexmark did a fantastic job” emery said the lexmark team created a deployment schedule that tackled four to eight locations concurrently coordinating equipment resources and training all at the same time “what impressed us was lexmark’s ability to be nimble move quickly and adapt to our changing requirements” emery said at each of the major locations lexmark had already performed site surveys and pulled usage data from the original fleet of devices so that the new lexmark equipment would be designed to match volume demands and feature requirements once the new lexmark devices were installed lexmark staff trained anheuserbusch employees how to use the devices and new features and demonstrated how a single device could replace the requirements of four—and still have room to grow “having the data made it easier for our employees to embrace the solution and to get behind our cost savings and sustainability goals” emery said results with its new alllexmark output infrastructure in place anheuserbusch has been able to reduce the number of printers and devices by  percent—from  to  with the new optimized smaller fleet in place anheuserbusch anticipates saving tens of thousand of dollars annually on maintenance and consumables alone “by the time we take into account all the toner paper and maintenance on the old devices we are looking at savings close to seven figures a year” emery said furthermore the reduction in devices comes with new capabilities that will make it easier for employees to get their work done “as we told various teams yes we’re taking away four of your devices but here are the whizbang gizmos you get instead you can do more and you still have plenty of room to grow in terms of capacity” the big differentiator for us was lexmark’s willingness to partner with us and truly understand our business challenges and our goals our lexmark partnership is one in which both sides are looking out for each other and trying to make sure that the partnership is a long and valuable one jay emery director of workplace services it anheuserbusch inbev paper consumption has already shrunk by nearly seven theoretical gateway arches “from a volume perspective we are so far ahead of where we thought we’d be” emery said “with lexmark print release alone we’re on track to knock out  percent of wasted printing or two million pages per month down the road i think we can knock out another  percent to  percent through by continuing to partner with our higher usage departments such as legal and our people department” for emery working with lexmark provided an ideal opportunity to build a longterm relationship that has supported anheuserbush’s goals of eliminating administrative costs in favor of fueling business growth and innovation the big differentiator for us was lexmark’s willingness to partner with us and truly understand our business challenges and our goals” said emery “our lexmark partnership is one in which both sides are looking out for each other and trying to make sure that the partnership is a

the move is sure to stir the debate over its continued push into craft beer rich duprey tmfcop jun   at pm having acquired the countrys largest homebrew supplier northern brewer last year as a means of increasing its exposure to the craft beer market anheuserbusch inbev nyse bud has now launched a clever new marketing strategy to tie its growing portfolio of craft beers to home brewers northern brewer recently began offering starter kits to make homemade versions of some of anheuserbuschs most popular craft beer labels in your own kitchen including goose island brewing elysian brewing and golden road brewing and because its the very same recipes you would get if you bought the beer at the store or in a taproom its a subtle way of diluting the distinction between massbrewed craft and homebrewed beer  image source getty images one brewer to rule them all over the past few years anheuserbusch has made a cottage industry out of buying up craft brewers much to the consternation of many in the industry including boston beer nysesam founder and chairman jim koch who has decried both abs ambitions and those of the craft brewers themselves for selling out in addition to the three brewers above ab has also purchased blue point brewing  barrel brewing devils backbone brewing four peaks brewing camden town brewery breckenridge brewery and most recently wicked weed brewing it also started its own masscraft beer shock top picked up a handful of beer distributors and acquired both northern brewer and its sister operation midwest supplies home brewing is a fragmented industry and though its the biggest northern brewer accounted for just  of the industrys approximately  million in annual sales by buying its way into the field anheuserbusch ingratiates itself into the growth end of the beer market and home brewing is of particular note because it is where many if not most craft brewers got their start founders of both elysian and golden road began brewing at home however by offering starter kits for its craft beers labels ab is closing the loop on the cycle of beer industry growth gotta start somewhere in a video announcing the availability of a goose island porter starter kit northern brewer makes clear that if youre interested in drinking one of these beers your best bet is traveling to the chicago market to buy it thats why this is such a smart move for anheuserbusch beer lovers cant easily get to goose islands chicago taproom or one of elysians four restaurants in washington but they can brew up a batch in their kitchen the megabrewer certainly hopes for something of a halo effect for its other beers when it purchases a craft beer and by making it more broadly available it introduces more people to it than when it was just a local brand because of its size there are synergies for the craft brewers unavailable if they remained independent it also allows anheuserbusch to make its craft brand cheaper than its small rivals can yet its a dualedged sword because local is whats driving the craftbeer market today and making a label national may backfire a beer like karbach brewing that ab bought last year is popular in texas but may not resonate in oregon and the beer drinkers who made the local beers popular feel affronted by the sellout wicked weed brewing reportedly lost a number of supporters and partners when it agreed to be bought out by anheuserbusch its also operationally important for ab because massproduced beer sales have been falling steadily craft remains a growth center and the homebrew market as noted serves as the stepping stone from which craft brewers spring image source wicked weed brewing still brewing up trouble in addition to the three kits from the craft breweries it owns anheuserbusch makes available through northern brewer kits from several other brewers including dry dock brewing lakefront brewery and tallgrass brewing the difference between the kits though is that those from the ab brand are marketed under the brewery edition brand while the others are called its pro series tallgrass did enter a distribution agreement with ab back in   this blending of craft beer into the homebrew market is likely to raise more hackles on the necks of some but investors should consider anheuserbuschs savvy in bringing these two lines closer   rich duprey has no position in any stocks

and ratings of sixpoint’s beers from its website credit harrison hillthe new york times from the rooftop patio of his growing brewery in the southwestern elbow of brooklyn shane c welch the founder and “chief visionary” of sixpoint brewery appeared to have staked a nice corner of an intensely competitive beer marketbut the constant worry of being crowded out by the big brands like anheuserbusch inbev the world’s largest brewer intensified this month when it was revealed that zx ventures an incubator operated by abi had purchased a minority stake in a popular beer review website ratebeercomfor smaller breweries like sixpoint ratebeer had become an invaluable barometer for the marketability of their products reaching a global audience of likeminded enthusiasts there they could promote new items or events follow trends and interact with customers in forumsnow mr welch worries that the playing field has shifted“it purports to be an objective consumerdriven site” mr welch said “but there is a massive conflict of interest” advertisement continue reading the main story mr welch joined sam calagione the founder and president of the dogfish head brewery in delaware in asking that ratebeer promptly remove the reviews and ratings of their beers from its website as of friday ratebeer had not complied continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story their concerns echoed by other independent brewers ranged from whether individual ratings will truly be independent to the potential for favoritism in the placement of reviews on the site to the lack of transparency about the deal which was consummated in october but was only recently made publicin a telephone interview pedro earp the chief disruptive growth officer for zx ventures insisted that ratebeer would maintain its independence recognizing that “the whole success is going to depend on the credibility of the platform”as far as transparency mr earp said zx ventures typically did not disclose its investments“in hindsight we should have anticipated the controversy around that acquisition” he said “we should have been more upfront in addressing that concern”a pew research center survey in december found that  percent of adults read online customer ratings or reviews before purchasing a product for the first time yakov bart assistant professor of marketing at northeastern university said the platforms that provide these reviews had exploded in influence for businesses“it’s better than advertising” dr bart said “not only is it free but consumers trust it more than regular communications coming from firms or businesses”but he added “one can have doubts whether consumers are going to trust the platform after they realize it’s been acquired by a large brand”the lack of transparency could become problematic for abi if it does not quickly address its ownership arrangement so consumers can recognize it said marc edelman a professor of law at baruch college’s school of business advertisement continue reading the main story “one could make a reasonable argument that failing to disclose that information might constitute some form of misrepresentation” mr edelman saidhe added though that sixpoint and dogfish head would have a hard time forcing ratebeer to remove its reviews until they could prove that their products were somehow being wronged

viewed in context last fall abi which owns budweiser corona and stella artois among hundreds of other labels bought northern brewer one of the largest homebrewing supply businesses more recently abi added its th craft brewery wicked weed to its portfolio in the same month it was reported that it might be squeezing out other breweries from access to hop farms in south africa abi said the issue had more to do with low hop yields in the country this yearnow with the ratebeer purchase competitors say they worry that abi could potentially have access to customer data which could give it a competitive advantage however it is unclear whether abi will have access to the site’s datajoe tucker the site’s executive director said in an email that the site was an open platform and that it could not simply remove certain beers or breweries from review“ratebeer’s community is derived of beer lovers who appreciate the service we offer” mr tucker said “nothing about this investment changes who we are and what we provide we will just be able to give our community of beer drinkers an even better experience”still when mr calagione’s vice president of marketing neal stewart posted a statement on the dogfish head page on ratebeer explaining why the company wanted its reviews removed from the site the statement was deleted the next daymr tucker first chalked it up to a misunderstanding owing to vandalism that the site had experienced in recent days“our solution was to temporarily remove editing powers to brewers and restore all pages affected” he said “it wasn’t our intention to limit dogfish head’s ability to communicate freely with our audience” advertisement continue reading the main story later however mr tucker sent another email altering his explanation“the brewery pages are not the place for this discussion” he wrote “and per our terms of use the message was removed”dan kenary the founder and chief executive of harpoon brewery has also been critical of ratebeer’s new ownership situation his main concern is that abi could pressure ratebeer to put its products front and center on the site influencing a browser in the beer aisle who pulls out a phone to check reviews“they could do it in ways that consumers wouldn’t even know how their decisions are being influenced” mr kenary said “it’s all about transparency and authenticity — show enough respect to consumers to disclose this information”like mr calagione he has taken stock of the industry landscape and believes it is important to speak out“if we don’t do it nobody else is going to do it” mr kenary said “this market that is incredibly fun and vibrant where we’ve seen  breweries sprout up across the country is at some risk over time because of these big breweries’ size and control of distribution you will see choice starting to go away that is what we’re fighting for” continue reading the main story we’re interested in your feedback on this page tell us what you think related

to successfully grow through acquisitions abinbev was formed through the combination of inbev and anheuserbusch in  in  the company launched its uslisted shares since then abinbev has embarked on a number of transformative multibillion ma deals in this way it has followed a similar path as berkshire hathaway nysebrkb the result is that abinbev is now a global beer behemoth it generates high profit margins which allows the company to reward shareholders with a hefty dividend with that said it is not yet a member of the dividend achievers a group of  stocks that have raised their dividends for at least  consecutive years you can see the full dividend achievers list here but abinbev does have a solid  dividend yield this article will discuss why abinbev is an attractive stock for dividend income and growth business overview abinbev is the world’s largest brewer and sells its beer in more than  countries worldwide it has a massive product portfolio with more than  brands just a few of its most popular brands include budweiser bud light corona stella artois beck’s castle skol and there are many more in all abinbev has  individual brands that each generate  billion or more in annual sales the company has a global reach approximately  of its ebitda comes from outside north america source  annual report page  abinbev has amassed such a huge brand portfolio through various mergers and acquisitions it was first organized through the  billion merger of three separate brewing companies in —interbrew from belgium ambev from brazil and anheuserbusch from the us in  abinbev acquired the remaining portion of grupo modelo that it didn’t already own for  billion the deal gave abinbev full ownership of the crown jewel corona which is one of the company’s highestgrowth brands today last year abinbev acquired sabmiller for just over  billion the result is that abinbev is a global powerhouse it generated  billion of sales and  billion of earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda last year alone growth prospects at its core abinbev’s growth strategy is to make huge acquisitions of companies with strong brands and leadership positions in their respective categories this gave abinbev highquality brands which provide it with the ability to raise prices over time as a result of its acquisition spree abinbev’s flagship brands are budweiser stella artois and corona these brands dominate their respective home markets the us europe and mexico source  earnings presentation page  the “big three” brands allow for the greatest pricing power the three brands collectively grew revenue by  in  each brand generated strong growth last year with corona leading the way at  growth in addition big acquisitions provide abinbev with scale it can easily leverage its global distribution and squeeze out huge cost synergies to boost profit margins for example last year abinbev’s us business delivered its seventh consecutive year of profit margin growth segment ebitda rose  to  billion as profit margin expanded  basis points to  going forward abinbev expects to cut nearly  billion from its cost structure over the next three to four years as a result of its sabmiller deal source  earnings presentation page  it is highly likely that abinbev will continue its strategy of conducting enormous ma deals there have even been reports that abinbev could try to acquire cocacola nyseko in essence abinbev’s growth strategy can be summed up as if it ain’t broke don’t fix it abinbev has been so successful growing revenue and ebitda with acquisitions and costcutting that there is little reason why the company would not go after another  billion megadeal the next huge merger could be into another industry altogether such as soft drinks or food to provide abinbev with diversification competitive advantages  recession performance the beer industry is a highly competitive business consumption of beer has flatlined in the us as a result growth largely comes from taking market share from competitors the rise of smaller craft breweries over the past several years would normally be a significant competitive threat for an industry goliath like abinbev however abinbev simply uses its deep pockets to buy smaller fastgrowing competitors in recent years abinbev has purchased several craft brewers including goose island blue point elysian and golden road karbach and devils backbone deep pockets are one of abinbev’s many competitive advantages which have fueled its growth over the years another is its strong brand portfolio abinbev has a huge global beer portfolio and owns seven of the  most valuable beer brands in the world according to market research firm brandz this includes budweiser the most valuable beer brand in the world the combination of strong brands and a lean cost structure serves abinbev well when economic conditions deteriorate it is further aided by its business model beer is a very
