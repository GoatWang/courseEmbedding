be in amounts which will maintain as nearly as practicable the original percentage relationship among the principal amounts of securities of specified interest rates and ranges of maturities that existed on the initial date of deposit investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of the securities

impact the value of the securities this may especially be the case upon trust termination or in the course of satisfying large unit redemptions  objectives and bond selection the objective of a

of principal or high legal or event risk after the date of deposit a bond may cease to be rated or its rating may be reduced below the minimum required as of the date of deposit neither event requires

factors insurance guaranteeing the timely payment when due of all principal and interest on certain bonds in the trusts has been obtained from bond insurance company see insurance on the bonds risk factors all investments involve risk this section describes the main risks that can impact the value of bonds in your trust you should understand these risks before you invest if the value of the bonds falls the value of your units will also fall you can lose money by investing in a trust no one can guarantee that your trust will achieve its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period the information supplement contains a more detailed discussion of risks related to your investment current economic conditions the economic recession in the united states which began in  technically came to an end in june of  however the us and global economies continue to feel the effects of this recessionary period including increased unemployment and belowaverage levels of economic activity the us and other foreign governments have taken extraordinary steps to combat the effects of the economic crisis however the ultimate impact of these measures is unknown and cannot be predicted in december of  the us federal reserve announced it would begin tapering its quantitative easing program however there continues to be uncertainty concerning potential future changes to the federal funds rate following a period of near zero interest rates over the previous five years on august   standard  poor s rating services sp downgraded the longterm  sovereign credit rating of the united states of america to aa from aaa citing the prolonged controversy over raising the statutory debt ceiling and the related fiscal policy debate any substantial change in general market conditions may result in sudden and significant valuation increases or declines in your trust s holdings market risk is the risk that the value of the bonds in your trust will fluctuate this could cause the value of your units to fall below your original purchase price or below the par value market value fluctuates in response to various factors these can include changes in interest rates inflation the financial condition of a bond s issuer or insurer perceptions of the issuer or insurer or ratings on a bond even though the supervisor supervises your portfolio you should remember that no one manages your portfolio your trust will not sell a bond solely because the market value falls or the credit rating on a bond included in a blackrock trust or a variable rate trust is downgraded as is possible in a managed fund interest rate risk is the risk that the value of bonds will fall if interest rates increase bonds typically fall in value when interest rates rise and rise in value when interest rates fall bonds with longer periods before maturity are often more sensitive to interest rate changes given the historically low interest rate environment in the us risks associated with rising rates are heightened the negative impact on fixed income securities from any interest rate increases could be swift and significant with respect only to a variable rate trust because the interest rates on floating rate bonds adjust periodically to reflect current market rates falling shortterm interest rates should tend to decrease the income payable to a variable rate trust on its floating rate investments and rising rates should tend to increase that income however investments in floating rate obligations should also mitigate the fluctuations in a variable rate trust s net asset values during periods of changing interest rates compared to changes in values of fixedrate debt securities nevertheless changes in interest rates can affect the value of a variable rate trust s floating rate investments especially if rates change sharply in a short period because the resets of the interest rates on the investments occur periodically and will not all happen simultaneously with changes in prevailing rates certain bonds in a high yield trust may be subject to interest rate adjustments if either moodys investors service inc  moody s  sp s or fitch or in certain limited circumstances another ratings service downgrades the rating for such bond or upgrades the rating after such a downgrade the interest rates payable on certain bonds in a high yield trust may have already been increased due to past ratings downgrades any future credit rating improvements on such bonds may result in decreases to the interest rates payable on such bonds and consequently may adversely affect both the income you receive from the securities in a high yield trust and the value of your units on the other hand increases in a bonds interest rate related to decreases in such bonds credit rating may place additional financial strain on the bonds issuer which could result in further decreases in financial condition and further credit rating decreases additionally an increase in a bonds interest rate may increase the risk that the bonds issuer will prepay or call the bond before its stated maturity credit risk is the risk that a security s issuer is unable to meet its obligation to pay principal or interest on the security while interest and principal payments on ginnie mae securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the us government a gnma income portfolio and the units thereof are not guaranteed or insured by the us government or any government agency in addition neither the us government nor ginnie mae guarantees the market value or yield on ginnie mae securities prepayment risk is the chance that borrowers prepay their mortgage loans earlier than expected and in particular may affect the units of a gnma income portfolio this reduces the trust s life and future interest income any payment of mortgage debt before it is due is called prepayment most mortgage loans may be prepaid at any time by the borrower without penalty each mortgagebacked security payment includes a return of principal as well as interest prepayments of the entire mortgage occur when borrowers refinance or sell their homes they may refinance to consolidate debts or take advantage of lower interest rate mortgages as interest rates decrease the rate of refinancings may increase significantly thereby increasing the prepayment risk of mortgagebacked securities extra monthly principal payments made near the trust s inception may significantly reduce the interest amount paid by the borrower to the lender and therefore the future amount received by the trust your trust will distribute prepayments of principal to you but your future interest distributions will fall as a result of the prepaid principal you also might not be able to reinvest this principal at as high a yield this means that you could receive less than the amount you paid for your units if enough principal is prepaid on the securities in your trust your trust could terminate significantly earlier than expected  call risk is the risk that the issuer prepays or calls a bond before its stated maturity an issuer might call a bond if interest rates fall and the bond pays a higher interest rate or if it no longer needs the money for the original purpose if an issuer calls a bond your trust will distribute the principal to you but your future interest distributions will fall you might not be able to reinvest this principal at as high a yield a bond s call price could be less than the price your trust paid for the bond and could be below the bond s par value this means that you could receive less than the amount you paid for your units if enough bonds in your trust are called your trust could terminate early some or all of the bonds may also be subject to extraordinary optional or mandatory redemptions if certain events occur such as certain changes in tax laws the substantial damage or destruction by fire or other casualty of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used and various other events build america bonds qualified school construction bonds qualified energy conservation bonds and clean renewable energy bonds in particular are often subject various to extraordinary or mandatory redemption provisions see taxable municipal bondsbuild america bonds and taxable municipal bonds qualified school construction bonds qualified energy conservation bonds and clean renewable energy bonds below the call provisions are described in general terms in the redemption feature column of the portfolio section and the notes thereof in prospectus part i bond quality risk is the risk that a bond will fall in value if a rating agency decreases the bond s rating concentration risk is the risk that your trust is less diversified because it concentrates in a particular type of bond when a certain type of bond makes up  or more of a trust the trust is considered to be concentrated in that bond type the different bond types are described in the following sections a gnma income portfolio concentrates in mortgagebacked securities you should understand these securities before you invest these securities are described in detail in the section titled ginnie mae securities extension risk is the chance that an increase in interest rates or lack of refinancing opportunities can cause a corresponding increase in the trust s life due to a drop in expected prepayments of mortgagebacked securities as a result the securities in your trust and in particular any mortgagebacked securities in a gnma income portfolio may become more sensitive to rising interest rates and may decrease in value foreign securities risk investing in foreign securities typically involves more risks than investing in securities of united states issuers these risks can increase the potential for losses in the trust and affect its unit price these risks may include risks such as losses due to political economic and social developments international trade conditions foreign taxes including withholding taxes restrictions on foreign investments or exchange of securities foreign currency fluctuations or restriction on exchange or repatriation of currencies the political economic and social structures of some foreign countries may be less stable and more volatile than those in the us and investments in these countries may be subject to the risks of internal and external conflicts currency devaluations foreign ownership limitations and tax increases it is possible that a government may take over the assets or operations of a company or impose restrictions on the exchange or export of currency or other assets some countries also may have different legal systems that may make it difficult for the trust to exercise investor rights and pursue legal remedies with respect to its foreign investments diplomatic and political developments including rapid and adverse political changes social instability regional conflicts terrorism and war could affect the economies industries and securities and currency markets and the value of the trust s investments in nonus countries no one can predict the impact that these factors could have on the trust s portfolio securities foreign companies may not be subject to the same disclosure accounting auditing and financial reporting standards and practices as us companies thus there may be less information publicly available about foreign companies than about most us companies certain foreign securities may be less liquid harder to sell and more volatile than many us securities this means the trust may at times be unable to sell foreign securities in a timely manner or at favorable prices reduced diversification risk is the risk that your trust will become smaller and less diversified as bonds are sold are called or mature this could increase your risk of loss and increase your share of trust expenses high yield bond risk high yield trusts invest primarily in high yield bonds other trusts may hold bonds currently rated below investment grade following one or more downgrades high yield or junk bonds are frequently issued  view more similar
