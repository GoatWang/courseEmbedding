inc “endra” or the “company” was incorporated on july   as a delaware corporation   endra is developing a medical imaging technology based on the thermoacoustic effect that improves the sensitivity and specificity of clinical ultrasound   on may   the company effected a onefor reverse stock split the “reverse split” of the company’s common stock with no reduction in authorized capital stock in the reverse split every  outstanding shares of common stock became one share of common stock see note  below   all common stock and stock incentive plan information in these financial statements has been restated to reflect the reverse split   note  – summary of significant accounting policies   use of estimates   the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates   management makes estimates that affect certain accounts including deferred income tax assets accrued expenses fair value of equity instruments and reserves for any other commitments or contingencies any adjustments applied to estimates are recognized in the period in which such adjustments are determined   basis of presentation   the accompanying unaudited financial statements and related notes have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission the “sec” accordingly certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations in the opinion of management all adjustments consisting of normal recurring accruals considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included operating results for the threemonth period ended march   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ended december   the balance sheet at december   has been derived from the audited financial statements at such date for further information refer to the financial statements and footnotes thereto included in endra life sciences inc annual financial statements for the year ended december   included in amendment no  to the company’s registration statement on form s filed with the sec on may     cash and cash equivalents   the company considers all cash on hand and in banks including accounts in book overdraft positions certificates of deposit and other highlyliquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash and cash equivalents as of march   and december   the company had no cash equivalents   inventory   the companys inventory is stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value with cost primarily determined on a weightedaverage cost basis on the firstin firstout “fifo” method the company periodically determines whether a reserve should be taken for devaluation or obsolescence of inventory as of march   and december   no such reserve was taken          capitalization of fixed assets   the company capitalizes expenditures related to property and equipment subject to a minimum rule that have a useful life greater than one year for  assets purchased  existing assets that are replaced improved or the useful lives have been extended or  all land regardless of cost acquisitions of new assets additions replacements and improvements other than land costing less than the minimum rule in addition to maintenance and repair costs including any planned major maintenance activities are expensed as incurred   capitalization of intangible assets   the company records the purchase of intangible assets not purchased in a business combination in accordance with the asc topic    revenue recognition   the company recognizes revenue in accordance with the requirements of asc  which directs that it should recognize revenue when  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists contracts  delivery has occurred  the seller’s price is fixed or determinable per the customer’s contract and  collectability is reasonably assured based upon our credit policy for products sold to end users revenue is recognized when title has passed to the customer and collectability is reasonably assured and no further efforts are required future revenue from anticipated new products will follow this same policy   advertising expense   the cost of advertising is expensed as incurred advertising expense for the three months ended march   was approximately  advertising expense for the three months ended march   was approximately    income taxes   the company utilizes asc  “income taxes” which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income a valuation allowance is recorded when it is “more likelythannot” that a deferred tax asset will not be realized   the company generated a deferred tax asset through net operating loss carryforwards however a valuation allowance of  has been established due to the uncertainty of the company’s realization of the net operating loss carry forward prior to its expiration   research and development costs   the company follows asc  “research and development” research and development costs are charged to the statement of operations as incurred during the three months ended march   and  the company incurred  and  of expenses related to research and development costs respectively            net earnings loss per common share   the company computes earnings per share under asc subtopic  earnings per share “asc ” basic earnings loss per share is computed by dividing the net income loss attributable to the common stockholders the numerator by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding the denominator during the reporting periods diluted loss per share is computed by increasing the denominator by the weighted average number of additional shares that could have been outstanding from securities convertible into common stock using the “treasury stock” method unless their effect on net loss per share is antidilutive there were  and  potentially dilutive shares which include outstanding common stock options warrants and convertible notes as of march   and december     the potential shares which are excluded from the determination of basic and diluted net loss per share as their effect is antidilutive are as follows       march       december     options to purchase common stock               warrants to purchase common stock               convertible notes               potential equivalent shares excluded                 fair value measurements   disclosures about fair value of financial instruments require disclosure of the fair value information whether or not recognized in our balance sheet where it is practicable to estimate that value as of march   and december   the amounts reported for cash accrued liabilities and accrued interest approximated fair value because of their short maturities   in accordance with asc topic  “fair value measurements and disclosures” we measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a recurring basis asc topic  defines fair value established a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and expands disclosures about fair value measurements   fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date asc topic  established a threetier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  measurements and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level  measurements these tiers include     ● level  defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets         ● level  defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and         ● level  defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable          sharebased compensation   the company’s  omnibus incentive plan which has been approved by its board of directors permits the grant of share options and shares to its employees consultants and nonemployee members of the board of directors for up to  shares of common stock of which approximately  remain available to be granted the company records sharebased compensation in accordance with the provisions of the sharebased compensation topic of the fasb codification the guidance requires the use of optionpricing models that require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the option’s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock the fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes option valuation model and the resulting charge is expensed using the straightline attribution method over the vesting period the company has elected to use the calculated value method to account for the options it issued in  and  a nonpublic entity that is unable to estimate the expected volatility of the price of its underlying share may measure awards based on a “calculated value” which substitutes the volatility of appropriate public companies representative of the company’s size and industry as a bench mark for the volatility of the entity’s own share price currently there is no active market for the company’s common shares the company has used the historical closing values of these companies to estimate volatility which was calculated to be    stock compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of sharebased awards that were expected to vest during the period adjusted for estimated forfeitures the estimated fair value of grants of stock options and warrants to nonemployees of the company is charged to expense if applicable in the financial statements these options vest in the same manner as the employee options granted under each of the option plans as described above   beneficial conversion feature   if the conversion feature of conventional convertible debt provides for a rate of conversion that is below market value this feature is characterized as a beneficial conversion feature “bcf” a bcf is recorded by the company as a debt discount pursuant to asc topic  “debt with conversion and other options” in those circumstances the convertible debt is recorded net of the discount related to the bcf and the company amortizes the discount to interest expense over the life of the debt using the effective interest method   debt discount   the company determines if the convertible debenture should be accounted for as liability or equity under asc  liabilities — distinguishing liabilities from equity asc  applies to certain contracts involving a company’s own equity and requires that issuers classify the following freestanding financial instruments as liabilities mandatorily redeemable financial instruments obligations that require or may require repurchase of the issuer’s equity shares by transferring assets eg written put options and forward purchase contracts and certain obligations where at inception the monetary value of the obligation is based solely or predominantly on   ● a fixed monetary amount known at inception for example a payable settleable with a variable number of the issuer’s equity shares with an issuance date fair value equal to a fixed dollar amount     ● variations in something other than the fair value of the issuer’s equity shares for example a financial instrument indexed to the sp  and settleable with a variable number of the issuer’s equity shares or       ● variations inversely related to changes in the fair value of the issuer’s equity shares for example a written put that could be net share settled   if the entity determined the instrument meets the guidance under asc  the instrument is accounted for as a liability with a respective debt discount the company records debt discounts in connection with raising funds through the issuance of promissory notes see note  these costs are amortized to noncash interest expense over the life of the debt if a conversion of the underlying debt occurs a proportionate share of the unamortized amounts is immediately expensed          going concern   the company’s financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business the company has a limited operating history and had a cumulative net loss from inception to march   of  the company has a working capital deficit of  as of march   the company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenue sufficient to cover its operating costs and to allow it to continue as a going concern the accompanying financial statements for the period ended march   have been prepared assuming the company will continue as a going concern the company believes its cash resources are insufficient to meet its anticipated needs during the next twelve months the company will require additional financing to fund its future planned operations including research and development and commercialization of its products   the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it establishes a revenue stream and becomes profitable management’s plans to continue as a going concern include raising additional capital through sales of equity securities and borrowing however management cannot provide any assurances that the company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans if the company is not able to obtain the necessary additional financing on a timely basis the company will be forced to delay or scale down some or all of its development activities or perhaps even cease the operation of its business  the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations there is substantial doubt about the ability of the company to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the company is unable to continue as a going concern   recent accounting pronouncements   in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no  revenue from contracts with customers asu  is a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under current us gaap and replace it with a principle based approach for determining revenue recognition under asu  revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that

thereto in this form q this form q contains forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended that are intended to be covered by the “safe harbor” created by those sections forwardlooking statements which are based on certain assumptions and describe our future plans strategies and expectations can generally be identified by the use of forwardlooking terms such as “believe” “expect” “may” “will” “should” “could” “seek” “intend” “plan” “estimate” “anticipate” or other comparable terms all statements other than statements of historical facts included in this form q regarding our strategies prospects financial condition operations costs plans and objectives are forwardlooking statements examples of forwardlooking statements include among others statements we make regarding expectations for revenues cash flows and financial performance the anticipated results of our development efforts and the timing for receipt of required regulatory approvals and product launches forwardlooking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance instead they are based only on our current beliefs expectations and assumptions regarding the future of our business future plans and strategies projections anticipated events and trends the economy and other future conditions because forwardlooking statements relate to the future they are subject to inherent uncertainties risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control our actual results and financial condition may differ materially from those indicated in the forwardlooking statements therefore you should not rely on any of these forwardlooking statements important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those indicated in the forwardlooking statements include among others the following our ability to develop a commercially feasible technology receipt of necessary regulatory approvals our ability to find and maintain development partners market acceptance of our technology the amount and nature of competition in our industry our ability to protect our intellectual property and the other risks and uncertainties described in the risk factors and in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations sections of this form q we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forwardlooking statement whether written or oral that may be made from time to time whether as a result of new information future developments or otherwise   overview   we have commercialized an enhanced ultrasound technology for the preclinical research market and are leveraging that expertise to develop technology for increasing the capabilities of clinical diagnostic ultrasound to broaden patient access to the safe diagnosis and treatment of a number of significant medical conditions in circumstances where expensive xray computed tomography “ct” and magnetic resonance imaging “mri” technology is unavailable or impractical   since  we have marketed and sold our nexus  system which combines lightbased thermoacoustics and ultrasound to address the imaging needs of researchers studying disease models in preclinical applications sales of the nexus  system were approximately  million in  and  in  our nexus  system is used in a number of leading global academic research centers including stanford university the university of michigan shanghai jiao tong university and purdue university we expect to continue to sell our nexus  system to maintain a base level of revenue but believe the market potential for our clinical systems is much higher   building on our expertise in thermoacoustics we developed a nextgeneration technology platform — thermo acoustic enhanced ultrasound or taeus — which is intended to enhance the capability of clinical ultrasound technology and support the diagnosis and treatment of a number of significant medical conditions that currently require the use of expensive ct or mri imaging or where imaging is not practical using existing technology   unlike the nearinfrared light pulses used in our nexus  system our taeus technology uses radio frequency “rf” pulses to stimulate tissues using a small fraction of the energy transmitted into the body during an mri scan the use of rf energy allows our taeus technology to penetrate deep into tissue enabling the imaging of human anatomy at depths equivalent to those of conventional ultrasound the rf pulses are absorbed by tissue and converted into ultrasound signals which are detected by an external ultrasound receiver and a digital acquisition system that is part of the taeus system the detected ultrasound is processed into images using our proprietary algorithms and overlaid in real time onto conventional grayscale ultrasound images   we expect that the firstgeneration taeus application will be a standalone ultrasound accessory designed to costeffectively quantify fat in the liver and stage progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease or nafld which can only be achieved today with impractical surgical biopsies or mri scans subsequent taeus offerings are expected to be implemented via a second generation hardware platform that can run multiple clinical software applications that we will offer taeus users for a onetime licensing fee – adding ongoing customer value to the taeus platform and a growing software revenue stream for our company          each of our taeus platform applications will require regulatory approvals before we are able to sell or license the application based on certain factors such as the installed base of ultrasound systems availability of other imaging technologies such as ct and mri economic strength and applicable regulatory requirements we intend to seek initial approval of our applications for sale in the european union followed by the united states and china   financial operations overview   revenue   to date our revenue has been generated by the placement and sale of our nexus  system for use in preclinical applications   cost of goods sold   our cost of goods sold is related to our direct costs associated with the development and shipment of our thermoacoustic imaging systems placed in preclinical settings   research and development expenses   our research and development expenses primarily include wages fees and equipment for the development of our taeus technology platform and our proposed applications additionally we incur certain costs associated with the protection of our products and inventions through a combination of patents licenses applications and disclosures   sales and marketing expenses   sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising marketing and consulting expenses and headcount currently our marketing efforts for our preclinical business are through distributors in china the european union australia korea and the united kingdom our website and attendance of key industry meetings in connection with the commercialization of our taeus applications we expect to build a small sales and marketing team to train and support global ultrasound distributors as well as execute traditional marketing activities such as promotional materials electronic media and participation in industry conferences   general and administrative expenses   general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for our management and personnel and professional fees such as accounting consulting and legal          critical accounting policies and estimates   use of estimates   the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates   management makes estimates that affect certain accounts including deferred income tax assets accrued expenses fair value of equity instruments and reserves for any other commitments or contingencies any adjustments applied to estimates are recognized in the period in which such adjustments are determined   sharebased compensation   our  omnibus incentive plan which has been approved by our board of directors permits the grant of share options and shares to our employees consultants and nonemployee members of our board of directors for up to  shares of common stock we record sharebased compensation in accordance with the provisions of the sharebased compensation topic of the fasb codification the guidance requires the use of optionpricing models that require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the option’s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock the fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes option valuation model which uses certain assumptions related to riskfree interest rates expected volatility expected life of the common stock options and future dividends and the resulting charge is expensed using the straightline attribution method over the vesting period   stock compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of sharebased awards that were expected to vest during the period adjusted for estimated forfeitures the estimated fair value of grants of stock options and warrants to nonemployees is charged to expense if applicable in the financial statements   recent accounting pronouncements   see note  of the financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards   results of operations   three months ended march   and    revenues   we had no revenue for the three months ended march   and march            research and development   research and development expenses were  for the three months ended march   as compared to  for the three months ended march   an increase of  or  the costs include primary wages fees and equipment for the development of our taeus product line research and development expenses were unchanged from the same period for the prior year and consisted mostly of wages and employment related expenses   sales and marketing   sales and marketing expenses were  for the three months ended march   as compared to  for the three months ended march   a decrease of  or  the decrease was primarily due to reduced commissions paid on the sale of our nexus  system currently our marketing efforts for our preclinical business are through distributors in china the european union australia and the united kingdom our website and attendance of key industry meetings our future clinical business will involve hiring and training additional staff to support our sales efforts as we seek to complete the development and commercialization of our taeus applications we intend to build a small sales and marketing team to train and support global ultrasound distributors as well as execute traditional marketing activities such as promotional materials electronic media and participation in industry conferences   general and administrative   our general and administrative expenses for the three months ended march   were  a decrease of  or  compared to  for the three months ended march   general and administrative expenses decreased due to a decrease in headcount offset by onetime expenses related to the ipo our   wage and related expenses for the three months ended march   were  compared to  for the three months ended march   wage and related expenses in the three month period ended march   included  of stock compensation expense related to the issuance and vesting of options compared to  of stock compensation expense for  our professional fees for the three months ended march   were  compared to  for the three months ended march   we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase significantly as a result of our becoming a public company   net loss   as a result of the foregoing for the three months ended march   we recorded a net loss of  compared to a net loss of  for the three months ended march     liquidity and capital resources   to date we have generated only limited revenues from sales of our nexus  system we have funded our operations to date through private and public sales of our securities as of march   we had  in cash in may  we completed our initial public offering the “ipo” raising net proceeds of approximately  million after deducting offering expenses of approximately  in underwriting discounts commissions and expenses and approximately  in offering expenses payable by the company   the financial statements included in this form q have been prepared assuming the company will continue as a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business as reflected in the accompanying financial statements during the three months ended march   the company incurred a net loss of  used cash in operations of  and at march   the company had a stockholders’ deficit of  these and other factors raise substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the issuance of the financial statements the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern   operating activities   during the three months ended march   the company used  of cash in operating activities primarily as a result of its net loss of  offset in part by net changes in operating assets and liabilities of   in depreciation and amortization expense  in noncash stock compensation expense and additional warrants issued during the warrant exchange program of           during the three months ended march   the company used  of cash in operating activities primarily as a result of its net loss of  offset by amortization of discount of convertible debt of  sharebased compensation of   in depreciation and amortization expenses and net changes in operating assets and liabilities of    investing activities   there were no investing activities for the three months ended march   and    financing activities   during the three months ended march   financing activities provided  including  from common stock issued for cash and  in proceeds from notes payable   during the three months ended march   financing activities provided  in proceeds from issuance of convertible notes   funding requirements   we have not completed development of our taeus technology platform applications we expect to continue to incur significant expenses for the foreseeable future we anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially as we   ● advance the engineering design and development of our nafld taeus application   ● prepare applications required for marketing approval of our nafld taeus application in the european union and the united states   ● seek to hire a small internal marketing team to engage and support channel partners and clinical customers for our nafld taeus application   ● commence marketing of our nafld taeus application   ● advance development of our other taeus applications and   ● add operational financial and management information systems and personnel including personnel to support our product development planned commercialization efforts and our operation as a public company   we believe that our existing cash taking into account the net proceeds of our ipo will be sufficient for us to fund the development and regulatory approval and to prepare for the commercialization of our nafld taeus application in the european union it is possible that we will not achieve the progress that we expect because the actual costs and timing of completing the development and regulatory approvals for a new medical device are difficult to predict and are subject to substantial risks and delays we have no committed external sources of funds we do not expect that our existing cash will be sufficient for us to complete the commercialization of our nafld taeus application or to complete the development of any other taeus application and we will need to raise substantial additional capital for those purposes as a result we will need to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings debt financings corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements or other financing alternatives our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forwardlooking statement and involves risks and uncertainties and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors including the factors discussed in the section entitled “risk factors” and elsewhere in this form q we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect   until we can generate a sufficient amount of revenue from our taeus platform applications if ever we expect to finance future cash needs through public or private equity offerings debt financings or corporate collaborations and licensing arrangements additional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us or at all if adequate funds are not available we may be required to delay reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs or our commercialization efforts to the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities our stockholders may experience additional dilution and debt financing if available may involve restrictive covenants to the extent that we raise additional funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our technologies or applications or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us we may seek to access the public or private capital markets whenever conditions are favorable even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time          off balance sheet transactions   we do not have any off balance sheet transactions   item  q uantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk   the information required by item  is not required to be provided by issuers that satisfy the definition of “smaller reporting company” under securities and exchange commission rules   item  c ontrols and procedures   evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures   as of the end of the period covered by this form q management performed with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules ae and de of the securities and exchange act of  as amended the “exchange act” our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission’s forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures based on the evaluation our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that as of march   our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective   a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis we identified the following material weakness as of march   insufficient personnel resources within the accounting function to segregate the duties over financial transaction processing and reporting   to remediate our internal control weaknesses management intends to implement the following measures as finances allow   ● we will add sufficient accounting personnel or outside consultants to properly segregate duties and to effect a timely accurate preparation of the financial statements ● upon the hiring of additional accounting personnel or outside consultants we will develop and maintain adequate written accounting policies and procedures   the additional hiring is contingent upon our efforts to obtain additional funding and the results of our operations management expects to secure funds in the coming fiscal year but provides no assurances that it will be able to do so   changes in internal control over financial reporting   there was no change to our internal controls or in other factors that could affect these controls during the three month period ended march   that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting however our management is currently seeking resolutions to improve our controls and procedures in an effort to remediate the deficiency described above            part ii – other information   item   legal proceedings   we are not currently a party to any pending legal proceedings that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business or financial conditions we may however be subject to various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business from time to time   item a  r isk factors   investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk you should carefully consider the following risks and all other information contained in this quarterly report on form q including our financial statements and the related notes before investing in our securities the risks and uncertainties described below supplement or to the extent inconsistent supersede those disclosed in our final prospectus for our initial public offering as filed with the securities and exchange commission on may   the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face but include the most significant factors currently known by us that make investing in our securities speculative or risky additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently believe are not material also may become important factors that affect us if any of the following risks materialize our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose some or all of your investment   risks related to our business   we have a history of operating losses and we may never achieve or maintain profitability   we have a limited operating history upon which investors may evaluate our prospects we have only generated limited revenues to date and have a history of losses from operations as of march   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately  we will require additional capital to complete the commercialization of our planned taeus applications and to meet our growth and profitability targets we expect to expend significant resources on hiring of personnel payroll and benefits continued scientific and potential product research and development potential product testing and preclinical and clinical investigations intellectual property development and prosecution marketing and promotion capital expenditures working capital and general and administrative expenses we also expect to incur costs and expenses related to consulting laboratory development hiring of scientists and other operational personnel and expenses associated with the development of relationships with strategic partners   our thermo acoustic enhanced ultrasound or taeus technology is still in development and we do not have any applications for our taeus technology approved for sale applications for our taeus technology may never be approved generate significant revenue or become commercially viable our ability to generate significant revenues and ultimately achieve profitability will depend on whether we can obtain additional capital when we need it complete the development of our technology receive required regulatory approvals for our taeus applications and find customers who will purchase our future products or strategic partners that will incorporate our technology into their products even if we develop commercially viable applications for our taeus technology which may include licensing we may never recover our research and development expenses and we may never be able to produce material revenues or operate on a profitable basis   our efforts may never result in the successful development of commercial applications   based on our taeus technology   due to the limited tissue penetration capability of lightbased thermoacoustic technology we believe that there is a limited clinical market for our current nexus  product which is focused on laboratory specimen analysis as a result we are currently focused on the development of products based on our taeus technology we have not yet completed the development of any applications based on such technology our research and development efforts remain subject to all of the risks associated with the development of new products based on emerging technologies including without limitation unanticipated technical or other problems the inability to develop a product that may be sold at an acceptable price point and the possible insufficiency of funds needed in order to complete development of these products technical problems may result in delays and cause us to incur additional expenses that would increase our losses if we cannot complete or if we experience significant delays in developing applications based on our taeus technology particularly after incurring significant expenditures our business may fail          our success is substantially dependent on the success of applications for our taeus platform   to date we have generated only limited sales of our existing nexus  product and our ability to generate meaningful revenues in the future will depend on the successful development and commercialization of our taeus platform applications the commercial success of our taeus platform applications and our ability to generate revenues will depend on many factors including the following   ● our successful development of applications for our taeus technology such as those we intend to pursue for the diagnosis of nonalcohol fatty liver disease or nafld and the monitoring of thermal ablation surgery and the acceptance in the marketplace by physicians and patients of such applications   ● the successful design and manufacturing of a device or devices which enable the use of our taeus technology by physicians on their patients   ● receipt of necessary regulatory approvals   ● sufficient coverage or reimbursement by thirdparty payors   ● our ability to successfully market our products   ● our ability to demonstrate that our taeus applications have advantages over competing products and procedures   ● the amount and nature of competition from competing or alternative imaging products and   ● our ability to establish and maintain commercial manufacturing distribution and sales force capabilities   we have limited data regarding the efficacy of our taeus platform applications if our applications do not perform in accordance with our expectations we are unlikely to successfully commercialize our applications even if they receive regulatory approval   our success depends in large part on the medical and thirdparty payor community’s acceptance of our taeus applications as a result even if we receive regulatory approval for our applications we believe that we will need to obtain additional clinical data from users of our applications to persuade medical professions to use our applications we may conduct postapproval clinical testing to obtain such additional data clinical testing is expensive can take a significant amount of time to complete and can have uncertain outcomes we have not yet conducted any clinical studies and there can be no assurance that the results of any such studies will be positive our failure to conduct successful clinical studies could have a material adverse impact on our business   our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business predict our future results or forecast our financial performance and growth   we were incorporated in  and began commercializing our initial preclinical nexus  product in  our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business predict our future results or forecast our financial performance and growth if our assumptions regarding the risks and uncertainties we face which we use to plan our business are incorrect or change due to circumstances in our business or our markets or if we do not address these risks successfully our operating and financial results could differ materially from our expectations and our business could suffer          we may not remain commercially viable if there is an inadequate level of reimbursement by governmental programs and other thirdparty payors   medical imaging products are purchased principally by hospitals physicians and other healthcare providers around the world that typically bill various thirdparty payors including governmental programs  eg  medicare and medicaid in the united states private insurance plans and managed care programs for the services provided to their patients   thirdparty payors and governments may approve or deny coverage for certain technologies and associated procedures based on independently determined assessment criteria reimbursement decisions by payors for these services are based on a wide range of methodologies that may reflect the services’ assessed resource costs clinical outcomes and economic value these reimbursement methodologies and decisions confer different and sometimes conflicting levels of financial risk and incentives to healthcare providers and patients and these methodologies and decisions are subject to frequent refinements thirdparty payors are also increasingly adjusting reimbursement rates often downwards indirectly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services there can be no assurance that our products will be covered by thirdparty payors that adequate reimbursement will be available or even if payment is available that thirdparty payors’ coverage policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably   we will depend on third parties to design manufacture and seek regulatory approval of our taeus applications if any third party fails to successfully design manufacture and gain regulatory approval of our taeus applications our business will be materially harmed   we currently intend to outsource the design and manufacturing of applications utilizing our taeus technology rather than manufacture our taeus applications ourselves we will have limited control over the efforts and resources that any thirdparty original equipment manufacturer oem will devote to developing and manufacturing our taeus applications in addition we currently expect to depend on oems to acquire ce marks for the device or devices that they develop and manufacture which are necessary to permit marketing of those devices in the european union   an oem may not be able to successfully design and manufacture the products it develops based on our taeus technology may not devote sufficient time and resources to support these efforts or may fail in gaining the required regulatory approvals of our taeus applications the failure by an oem in its efforts to design manufacture or gain regulatory approval of our taeus applications could substantially harm the value of our taeus technology brand and business   if we are unable to manage the anticipated growth of our business our future revenues and operating results may be harmed   because of our small size growth in accordance with our business plan if achieved will place a significant strain on our financial technical operational and management resources as we expand our activities there will be additional demands on these resources the failure to continue to upgrade our technical administrative operating and financial control systems or the occurrence of unexpected expansion difficulties including issues relating to our research and development activities and retention of experienced scientists managers and technicians could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and our ability to timely execute our business plan if we are unable to implement these actions in a timely manner our results may be adversely affected   competition in the medical imaging market is intense and we may be unable to successfully compete   in general competition in the medical imaging market is very significant and characterized by extensive research and development and rapid technological change competitors in this market include very large companies with significantly greater resources than we have to successfully compete in this market we will need to develop taeus applications for particular applications that offer significant advantages over alternative imaging products and procedures for such applications   developments by other medical imaging companies of new or improved products processes or technologies may make our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive alternative medical imaging devices may be more accepted or costeffective than our products competition from these companies for employees with experience in the medical imaging industry could result in higher turnover of our employees if we are unable to respond to these competitive pressures we could experience delayed or reduced market acceptance of our products higher expenses and lower revenue if we are unable to compete effectively with current or new entrants to these markets we will be unable to generate sufficient revenue to maintain our business          changes in the healthcare industry could result in a reduction in the size of the market for our products or may require us to decrease the selling price for our products either of which could have a negative impact on our financial performance   trends toward managed care healthcare cost containment and other changes in government and private sector initiatives in europe the united states and china are placing increased emphasis on lowering the cost of medical services which could adversely affect the demand for or the prices of our products for example   ● major thirdparty payors of hospital and nonhospital based healthcare services could revise their payment methodologies and impose stricter standards for reimbursement of imaging procedures charges andor a lower or more bundled reimbursement   ● there has been a consolidation among healthcare facilities and purchasers of medical devices who prefer to limit the number of suppliers from whom they purchase medical products and these entities may decide to stop purchasing our products or demand discounts on our prices   ● there is economic pressure to contain healthcare costs in markets throughout the world and   ● there are proposed and existing laws and regulations in international and domestic markets regulating pricing and profitability of companies in the healthcare industry   these trends could lead to pressure to reduce prices for our products and could cause a decrease in the demand for our products in any given market that could adversely affect our revenue and profitability which could harm our business   we have limited selling marketing and manufacturing resources which may restrict our success in commercializing our taeus technology   we currently do not have a sales marketing customer support or manufacturing team dedicated to our taeus clinical applications to grow our business as planned we must expand our sales marketing customer support and manufacturing capabilities we must also establish satisfactory arrangements for the manufacture and distribution of our taeus applications which will involve the development of our commercial infrastructure andor collaborative commercial arrangements and partnerships we may be unable to attract retain and manage the specialized workforce and collaborative manufacturing and distribution arrangements necessary to successfully commercialize our products in addition developing these functions is time consuming and expensive we intend to partner with others to assist us with some or all of these functions however we may be unable to find appropriate third parties with whom to enter into these arrangements furthermore if we do enter into these arrangements these third parties may not perform as expected   if we experience problems in our relationships with our distributors our ability to sell our products could be limited   because we are a small company with limited resources we expect to depend on distributors to help promote market acceptance and demand for our products distributors that are in the business of selling other medical products may not devote a sufficient level of resources and support required to generate awareness of our products and grow or maintain product sales if our distributors are unwilling or unable to market and sell our products or if they do not perform to our expectations we could experience delayed or reduced market acceptance and sales of our products in addition disagreements with our distributors or nonperformance by these third parties could lead to costly and timeconsuming litigation or arbitration and disrupt distribution channels for a period of time and require us to reestablish a distribution channel   we have and may in the future form or seek additional strategic alliances collaborations or enter into licensing arrangements and we may not realize the benefits of such alliances collaborations or licensing arrangements   on april   we entered into a collaborative research agreement with ge healthcare under which ge healthcare has agreed to support our efforts to commercialize our taeus technology for use in an nafld application by among other things providing equipment and technical advice and facilitating introductions to ge healthcare clinical ultrasound customers this agreement does not commit ge healthcare to a longterm relationship and it may disengage with us at any time this agreement has a term of one year and is subject to termination by either party upon not less than  days’ notice on april   we and ge healthcare entered into an amendment to our agreement extending its term by one year to april            we intend in the future to form or seek additional strategic alliances create joint ventures or collaborations or enter into licensing arrangements with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our development and commercialization efforts with respect to our technologies and applications   any of these relationships may require us to incur nonrecurring and other charges increase our near and longterm expenditures issue securities that dilute our existing stockholders or disrupt our management and business in addition we face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners and the negotiation process is timeconsuming and complex if we license technologies or applications we may not be able to realize the benefit of such transactions further strategic alliances and collaborations are subject to numerous risks which may include the following   ● collaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to a collaboration   ● collaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of our technologies and applications or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results changes in their strategic focus due to the acquisition of competitive products availability of funding or other external factors such as a business combination that diverts resources or creates competing priorities   ● collaborators may delay clinical trials provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial stop a clinical trial abandon the development of an application repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of an application for clinical testing   ● collaborators could independently develop or develop with third parties products that compete directly or indirectly with our applications and technologies   ● a collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more applications may not commit sufficient resources to their marketing and distribution   ● collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our intellectual property or proprietary information in a way that gives rise to actual or threatened litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential liability   ● disputes may arise between us and a collaborator that cause the delay or termination of the research development or commercialization of our technologies and applications or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources   ● collaborations may be terminated and if terminated may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable applications or technologies and   ● collaborators may own or coown intellectual property covering our products that results from our collaborating with them and in such cases we would not have the exclusive right to commercialize such intellectual property   as a result if we enter into collaboration agreements and strategic partnerships or license our applications or technologies we may not be able to realize the benefit of such transactions if we are unable to successfully integrate them with our existing operations and company culture which could delay our timelines or otherwise adversely affect our business we also cannot be certain that following a strategic transaction or license we will achieve the revenue or specific net income that justifies such transaction any delays in entering into new strategic partnership agreements related to our applications could delay the development and commercialization of our technologies and applications in certain geographies or for certain applications which would harm our business prospects financial condition and results of operations          we intend to market our taeus applications if approved globally in which case we will be subject to the risks of doing business outside of the united states   because we intend to market our taeus applications if approved globally our business may be subject to risks associated with doing business globally accordingly our business and financial results in the future could be adversely affected due to a variety of factors including   ● changes in a specific country’s or region’s political and cultural climate or economic condition   ● unexpected changes in laws and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions   ● difficulty of effective enforcement of contractual provisions in local jurisdictions   ● inadequate intellectual property protection in certain countries   ● tradeprotection measures import or export licensing requirements such as export administration regulations promulgated by the united states department of commerce and fines penalties or suspension or revocation of export privileges   ● effects of applicable local tax structures and potentially adverse tax consequences and   ● significant adverse changes in currency exchange rates   we depend on our senior management team and the loss of one or more key employees or an inability to attract and retain highly skilled employees could harm our business   our success largely depends upon the continued services of our executive management team and key employees and the loss of one or more of our executive officers or key employees could harm us and directly impact our financial results our employees may terminate their employment with us at any time our executive management team has significant experience and knowledge of medical devices and ultrasound systems and the loss of any team member could impair our ability to design identify and develop new intellectual property and new scientific or product ideas additionally if we lose the services of any of these persons we would likely be forced to expend significant time and money in the pursuit of replacements which may result in a delay in the implementation of our business plan and plan of operations we can give no assurance that we could find satisfactory replacements for these individuals on terms that would not be unduly expensive or burdensome to us   to execute our growth plan we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel competition for skilled personnel is intense especially for engineers with high levels of experience in designing and developing medical devices and for sales executives especially with industry expertise we may experience difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have in addition we invest significant time and expense in training our employees which increases their value to competitors who may seek to recruit them if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel our business and future growth prospects would be harmed           our employees independent contractors consultants commercial partners and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements   we are exposed to the risk of fraud misconduct or other illegal activity by our employees independent contractors consultants commercial partners and vendors misconduct by these parties could include intentional reckless and negligent conduct that fails to comply with the us food drug and cosmetics act or the fdc act and similar laws of other countries and rules and regulations of the us food and drug administration or the fda and other similar foreign regulatory bodies provide true complete and accurate information to the fda and other similar foreign regulatory bodies comply with manufacturing standards we establish comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws in the united states and similar foreign fraudulent misconduct laws or report financial information or data accurately or to disclose unauthorized activities to us if we obtain european chinese or fda approval of any of our products and begin commercializing those products in europe china or the united states respectively our potential exposure under such laws will increase significantly and our costs associated with compliance with such laws are also likely to increase in particular the promotion sales and marketing of healthcare items and services as well as certain business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws designed to prevent fraud kickbacks selfdealing and other abusive practices these laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing discounting marketing and promotion structuring and commissions certain customer incentive programs and other business arrangements generally it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees and other parties and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations if any such actions are instituted against us and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights those actions could have a significant impact on our business including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions   misdiagnosis warranty and other claims initiated against us and product field actions could increase our costs delay or reduce our sales and damage our reputation adversely affecting our financial condition   our business exposes us to the risk of malpractice warranty or product liability claims inherent in the sale and support of medical device products including those based on claims that the use or failure of one of our products resulted in a misdiagnosis or harm to a patient such claims may cause financial loss damage our reputation by raising questions about our products’ safety and efficacy adversely affect regulatory approvals and interfere with our efforts to market our products although to date we have not been involved in any medical malpractice or product liability litigation we may incur significant liability if such litigation were to occur we may also face adverse publicity resulting from product field actions or regulatory proceedings brought against us claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts if we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability or related claims we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit distribution of our products even a successful defense would require significant financial and management resources regardless of the merits or eventual outcome liability claims may result in   ● decreased demand for our products    ● injury to our reputation and negative media attention    ● initiation of investigations by regulators    ● costs to defend the related litigation    ● a diversion of management’s time and our resources    ● substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients    ● product recalls withdrawals or labeling marketing or promotional restrictions    ● loss of revenue    ● exhaustion of any available insurance and our capital resources    ● the inability to commercialize a product at all or for particular applications and    ● a decline in the price of our securities          although we currently maintain liability insurance in amounts we believe are commercially reasonable any liability we incur may exceed our insurance coverage our insurance policies may also have various exclusions and we may be subject to a claim for which we have no coverage liability insurance is expensive and may cease to be available on acceptable terms if at all a malpractice warranty product liability or other claim or product field action not covered by our insurance or exceeding our coverage could significantly impair our financial condition in addition a product field action or a liability claim against us could significantly harm our reputation and make it more difficult to obtain the funding and commercial relationships necessary to maintain our business   our internal computer systems or those used by thirdparty manufacturers or other contractors or consultants may fail or suffer security breaches   despite the implementation of security measures our internal computer systems and those of our future manufacturers and other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses and unauthorized access although to our knowledge we have not experienced any such material system failure or security breach to date if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business operations to the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information we could incur liability and the further development and commercialization of our products could be delayed   unfavorable economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business   unfavorable changes in economic conditions including inflation recession or other changes in economic conditions may result in lower consumer healthcare spending as well as physician and hospital spending and availability of credit if demand for medical devices or budgets for capital improvements decline our revenue could be adversely affected additionally if our suppliers face challenges in obtaining credit in selling their products or otherwise in operating their businesses they may become unable to continue to offer the materials we use to manufacture our products which could result in sales disruption   we may face significant challenges if global economic conditions remain unstable or worsen including reduced demand for our products and services increased order cancellations longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies increased difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories increased price competition in our served markets increased prices in components as a result of higher commodities prices supply chain interruptions which could disrupt our ability to produce our products and increased risk of impairment of investments goodwill and intangible and longlived assets   the united kingdom’s vote to leave the european union will have uncertain effects and could adversely affect us   the united kingdom held a referendum on june   in which a majority of voters voted to exit the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” negotiations are expected to commence to determine the future terms of the united kingdom’s relationship with the european union including among other things the terms of trade between the united kingdom and the european union the effects of brexit will depend on any agreements the united kingdom makes to retain access to eu markets either during a transitional period or more permanently brexit could adversely affect european and worldwide economic and market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets including volatility in the value of the sterling and euro in addition brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the united kingdom determines which eu laws to replace or replicate any of these effects of brexit and others we cannot anticipate could adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows   risks related to intellectual property and other legal matters   if we are unable to protect our intellectual property then our financial condition results of operations and the value of our technology and products could be adversely affected   much of our value arises out of our proprietary technology and intellectual property for the design manufacture and use of medical imaging systems including development of our taeus applications we rely on patent copyright trade secret and trademark laws to protect our proprietary technology and limit the ability of others to compete with us using the same or similar technology third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property which could harm our business          we currently maintain a patent portfolio consisting of one current granted patent and twelve pending patent applications in the united states and foreign jurisdictions relating to our technology in addition we currently license eight granted patents and three pending patent applications in the united states and foreign jurisdictions we or our licensor may fail to maintain these patents may determine not to pursue litigation against entities that are infringing upon these patents or may pursue such enforcement less aggressively than we ordinarily would   policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult costly and timeintensive we may fail to stop or prevent misappropriation of our technology particularly in countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states proceedings to enforce our patent and other intellectual property rights in nonus jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business if we cannot prevent other companies from using our proprietary technology or if our patents are found invalid or otherwise unenforceable we may be unable to compete effectively against other manufacturers of ultrasound systems which could decrease our market share in addition the breach of a patent licensing agreement by us may result in termination of a patent license   if we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and knowhow the value of our technology and products could be adversely affected   in addition to our patent activities we rely upon among other things unpatented proprietary technology processes trade secrets and knowhow any involuntary disclosure to or misappropriation by third parties of our confidential or proprietary information could enable competitors to duplicate or surpass our technological achievements potentially eroding our competitive position in our market we seek to protect confidential or proprietary information in part by confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants and third parties while we require all of our employees consultants advisors and any third parties who have access to our proprietary knowhow information and technology to enter into confidentiality agreements we cannot be certain that this knowhow information and technology will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques these agreements may be terminated or breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any such termination or breach furthermore these agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and knowhow in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure to the extent that any of our staff was previously employed by other pharmaceutical medical technology or biotechnology companies those employers may allege violations of trade secrets and other similar claims in relation to their former employee’s therapeutic development activities for us   we may in the future be a party to intellectual property litigation or administrative proceedings that could be costly and could interfere with our ability to sell our taeus applications   the medical device industry has been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents trademarks trade secrets and other intellectual property rights and companies in the industry have used intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage it is possible that us and foreign patents and pending patent applications or trademarks controlled by third parties may be alleged to cover our products or that we may be accused of misappropriating third parties’ trade secrets other medical imaging market participants many of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in patent portfolios trade secrets trademarks and competing technologies may have applied for or obtained or may in the future apply for or obtain patents or trademarks that will prevent limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make use sell andor export our products or to use product names we may become a party to patent or trademark infringement or trade secret claims and litigation as a result of these and other third party intellectual property rights being asserted against us the defense and prosecution of these matters are both costly and time consuming vendors from whom we purchase hardware or software may not indemnify us in the event that such hardware or software is accused of infringing a third party’s patent or trademark or of misappropriating a third party’s trade secret   further if such patents trademarks or trade secrets are successfully asserted against us this may harm our business and result in injunctions preventing us from selling our products license fees damages and the payment of attorney fees and court costs in addition if we are found to willfully infringe thirdparty patents or trademarks or to have misappropriated trade secrets we could be required to pay treble damages in addition to other penalties although patent trademark trade secret and other intellectual property disputes in the medical device area have often been settled through licensing or similar arrangements costs associated with such arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties we may be unable to obtain necessary licenses on satisfactory terms if at all if we do not obtain necessary licenses we may not be able to redesign our taeus applications to avoid infringement   similarly interference or derivation proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by the us patent and trademark office or uspto may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions or other matters of inventorship with respect to our patents or patent applications we may also become involved in other proceedings such as reexamination inter partes review or opposition proceedings before the uspto or other jurisdictional body relating to our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of others adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our taeus applications or using product names which would have a significant adverse impact on our business          additionally we may need to commence proceedings against others to enforce our patents or trademarks to protect our trade secrets or knowhow or to determine the enforceability scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others these proceedings would result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel we may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded if any may not be commercially meaningful we may not be able to stop a competitor from marketing and selling products that are the same or similar to our products or from using product names that are the same or similar to our product names and our business may be harmed as a result   intellectual property rights may not provide adequate protection which may permit third parties to compete against us more effectively   in order to remain competitive we must develop and maintain protection of the proprietary aspects of our technologies we rely on a combination of patents copyrights trademarks trade secret laws and confidentiality and invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights any patents issued to us may be challenged by third parties as being invalid or third parties may independently develop similar or competing technology that avoids our patents should such challenges be successful competitors might be able to market products and use manufacturing processes that are substantially similar to ours we may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or other trade secrets by consultants vendors or former or current employees despite the existence generally of confidentiality agreements and other contractual restrictions monitoring unauthorized use and disclosure of our intellectual property is difficult and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate in addition the laws of many foreign countries will not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states consequently we may be unable to prevent our proprietary technology from being exploited abroad which could affect our ability to expand to international markets or require costly efforts to protect our technology to the extent our intellectual property protection is incomplete we are exposed to a greater risk of direct competition in addition competitors could purchase our products and attempt to replicate some or all of the competitive advantages we derive from our development efforts or design around our protected technology our failure to secure protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could substantially harm the value of our taeus platform brand and business   risks related to government regulation   failure to comply with laws and regulations could harm our business   our business is or in the future may be subject to regulation by various federal state local and foreign governmental agencies including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing employment and labor laws workplace safety environmental laws consumer protection laws antibribery laws importexport controls securities laws and tax laws and regulations in certain jurisdictions these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than those in the united states noncompliance with applicable regulations or requirements could subject us to investigations sanctions mandatory recalls enforcement actions adverse publicity disgorgement of profits fines damages civil and criminal penalties or injunctions and administrative actions if any governmental sanctions fines or penalties are imposed or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation our business operating results and financial condition could be harmed in addition responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of managements attention and our resources and substantial costs enforcement actions and sanctions could further harm our business operating results and financial condition          if we fail to obtain and maintain necessary regulatory clearances or approvals for our taeus applications or if clearances or approvals for future applications and indications are delayed or not issued our commercial operations will be harmed   the medical devices that we manufacture and market are subject to regulation by numerous worldwide regulatory bodies including the fda and comparable international regulatory agencies these agencies require manufacturers of medical devices to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing development testing manufacturing labeling marketing and distribution of medical devices devices are generally subject to varying levels of regulatory control based on the risk level of the device governmental regulations specific to medical devices are wideranging and govern among other things   ● product design development and manufacture   ● laboratory preclinical and clinical testing labeling packaging storage and distribution   ● premarketing clearance or approval   ● record keeping   ● product marketing promotion and advertising sales and distribution and   ● postmarketing surveillance including reporting of deaths or serious injuries and recalls and correction and removals   in the european union we will be required to comply with applicable medical device directives including the medical devices directive and the active implantable medical devices directive and obtain ce mark certification in order to market medical devices the ce mark is applied following approval from an independent notified body or declaration of conformity it is an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and compliance with applicable european medical devices directives we believe that our taeus applications will qualify for sale in the european union as class iia medical devices existing regulations do not require clinical trials to obtain ce marks for class iia medical devices however in  the european commission proposed a new regulatory scheme that if implemented will impose significant additional obligations on medical device companies expected changes include stricter requirements for clinical evidence and premarket assessment of safety and performance new classifications to indicate risk levels requirements for third party testing by government accredited groups for some types of medical devices and tightened and streamlined quality management system assessment procedures it is anticipated that this new regulatory scheme may be implemented prior to receipt of the ce mark for our nafld taeus application but we believe that applicable transition rules should allow us to avoid their application in that case however such new rules could impose additional requirements such as a requirement to conduct clinical trials on future ce mark applications we make   we are also required to comply with the regulations of each other country where we commercialize products such as the requirement that we obtain approval from the fda and the china food and drug administration before we can launch new products in the united states and china respectively   international sales of medical devices manufactured in the united states that are not approved by the fda for use in the united states or that are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards are subject to fda export requirements exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported frequently regulatory approval may first be obtained in a foreign country prior to application in the united states due to differing regulatory requirements however other countries such as china for example require approval in the country of origin first          before a new medical device or a new intended use for an existing product can be marketed in the united states a company must first submit and receive either k clearance or premarketing approval or pma from the fda unless an exemption applies the typical duration to receive a k approval is approximately nine to twelve months from the date of the initial k submission and the typical duration to receive a pma approval is approximately two years from the date of submission of the initial pma application although there is no guarantee that the timing will not be longer   we expect all of our products to be classified as class ii medical devices that may be approved by means of a k clearance in the past the k pathway for product marketing has required only proof of substantial equivalence in technology for a given indication with a previously cleared device recently there has been a trend of the fda requiring additional clinical work to prove efficacy in addition to technological equivalence and basic safety whether clinical data is provided or not the fda may decide to reject the substantial equivalence argument we present if that happens the device is automatically designated as a class iii device the device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous pma requirements or can request a riskbased classification determination for the device in accordance with the “de novo” process which may determine that the new device is of low to moderate risk and that it can be appropriately be regulated as a class i or ii device thus although at this time we do not anticipate that we will be required to do so it is possible that one or more of our other products may require approval through the k de novo process or by means of a pma   we may not be able to obtain the necessary clearances or approvals or may be unduly delayed in doing so which could harm our business furthermore even if we are granted regulatory clearances or approvals they may include significant limitations on the indicated uses for the product which may limit the market for the product therefore even if we believe we have successfully developed our taeus technology we may not be permitted to market taeus applications in the united states if we do not obtain fda regulatory clearance to market such applications delays in obtaining clearance or approval could increase our costs and harm our revenues and growth    in addition we are required to timely file various reports with the fda including reports required by the medical device reporting regulations that require us to report to certain regulatory authorities if our devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur if these reports are not filed timely regulators may impose sanctions and sales of our products may suffer and we may be subject to product liability or regulatory enforcement actions all of which could harm our business   if we initiate a correction or removal for one of our devices to reduce a risk to health posed by the device we would be required to submit a publically available correction and removal report to the fda and in many cases similar reports to other regulatory agencies this report could be classified by the fda as a device recall which could lead to increased scrutiny by the fda other international regulatory agencies and our customers regarding the quality and safety of our devices furthermore the submission of these reports has been and could be used by competitors against us in competitive situations and cause customers to delay purchase decisions or cancel orders and would harm our reputation   the fda and the federal trade commission or ftc also regulate the advertising and promotion of our products to ensure that the claims we make are consistent with our regulatory clearances that there are adequate and reasonable data to substantiate the claims and that our promotional labeling and advertising is neither false nor misleading in any respect if the fda or ftc determines that any of our advertising or promotional claims are misleading not substantiated or not permissible we may be subject to enforcement actions including warning letters and we may be required to revise our promotional claims and make other corrections or restitutions          the fda and state authorities have broad enforcement powers our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the fda or state agencies which may include any of the following sanctions   ● adverse publicity warning letters fines injunctions consent decrees and civil penalties   ● repair replacement refunds recall or seizure of our products   ● operating restrictions partial suspension or total shutdown of production   ● refusing our requests for k clearance or premarket approval of new products new intended uses or modifications to existing products   ● withdrawing k clearance or premarket approvals that have already been granted and   ● criminal prosecution   if any of these events were to occur our business and financial condition would be harmed   our taeus applications may require recertification or new regulatory clearances or premarket approvals and we may be required to recall or cease marketing our taeus applications until such recertification or clearances are obtained   most countries outside of the united states require that product approvals be recertified on a regular basis generally every five years the recertification process requires that we evaluate any device changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device and where needed conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance where recertification applications are required they must be approved in order to continue selling our products in those countries   in the united states material modifications to the intended use or technological characteristics of our taeus applications will require new k clearances or premarket approvals or require us to recall or cease marketing the modified devices until these clearances or approvals are obtained based on fda published guidelines the fda requires device manufacturers to initially make and document a determination of whether or not a modification requires a new approval supplement or clearance however the fda can review a manufacturer’s decision any modification to an fdacleared device that would significantly affect its safety or efficacy or that would constitute a major change in its intended use would require a new k clearance or possibly a premarket approval   we may not be able to obtain recertification or additional k clearances or premarket approvals for our applications or for modifications to or additional indications for our taeus technology in a timely fashion or at all delays in obtaining required future governmental approvals would harm our ability to introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner which in turn would harm our future growth if foreign regulatory authorities or the fda require additional approvals we may be required to recall and to stop selling or marketing our taeus applications which could harm our operating results and require us to redesign our applications in these circumstances we may be subject to significant enforcement actions   if we or our suppliers fail to comply with the fda’s quality system regulations or other regulatory bodies’ equivalent regulations our manufacturing operations could be delayed or shut down and taeus platform sales could suffer   our manufacturing processes and those of our third party suppliers will be required to comply with the fda’s quality system regulations and other regulatory bodies’ equivalent regulations which cover the procedures and documentation of the design testing production control quality assurance labeling packaging storage and shipping of our taeus applications we will also be subject to similar state requirements and licenses in addition we must engage in extensive recordkeeping and reporting and must make available our manufacturing facilities and records for periodic unannounced inspections by governmental agencies including the fda state authorities and comparable agencies in other countries if we fail such an inspection our operations could be disrupted and our manufacturing interrupted failure to take adequate corrective action in response to an adverse inspection could result in among other things a shutdown of our manufacturing operations significant fines suspension of marketing clearances and approvals seizures or recalls of our products operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions any of which would cause our business to suffer furthermore our key component suppliers may not currently be or may not continue to be in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements which may result in manufacturing delays for our product and cause our results of operations to suffer          our taeus applications may in the future be subject to product recalls that could harm our reputation   governmental authorities in europe the united states and china have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material regulatory deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture a governmentmandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of component failures manufacturing errors or design or labeling defects recalls of our taeus applications would divert managerial attention be expensive harm our reputation with customers and harm our financial condition and results of operations a recall announcement would negatively affect the price of our securities   healthcare reform measures could hinder or prevent our planned products commercial success   there have been and we expect there will continue to be a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system in ways that could harm our future revenues and profitability and the future revenues and profitability of our potential customers in the european union although there have not been any recent amendments to the relevant regulatory legislation there are ongoing discussions regarding amending the current regulatory framework for medical devices moreover because the medical devices directive requires only minimum harmonization in the european union member countries may alter their enforcement of the directives or amend their national regulatory rules we cannot predict what healthcare initiatives if any will be implemented by the european union or eu member countries or the effect any future legislation or regulation will have on us    in the united states federal and state lawmakers regularly propose and at times enact legislation that would result in significant changes to the healthcare system some of which are intended to contain or reduce the costs of medical products and services for example one of the most significant healthcare reform measures in decades the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education affordability reconciliation act or affordable care act was enacted in  the affordable care act contains a number of provisions including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs reimbursement changes and fraud and abuse measures all of which will impact existing government healthcare programs and will result in the development of new programs the affordable care act among other things imposes an excise tax of  on the sale of most medical devices including ours and any failure to pay this amount could result in the imposition of an injunction on the sale of our products fines and penalties   it remains unclear whether changes will be made to the affordable care act or whether it will be repealed or materially modified we cannot assure you that the affordable care act as currently enacted or as amended or discontinued in the future will not harm our business and financial results and we cannot predict how future federal or state legislative or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform will affect our business   there likely will continue to be legislative and regulatory proposals at the federal and state levels directed at containing or lowering the cost of healthcare we cannot predict the initiatives that may be adopted in the future or their full impact the continuing efforts of the government insurance companies managed care organizations and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of healthcare may harm   ● our ability to set a price that we believe is fair for our products   ● our ability to generate revenues and achieve or maintain profitability and   ● the availability of capital          if we fail to comply with healthcare regulations we could face substantial penalties and our business operations and financial condition could be adversely affected   even though we do not and will not control referrals of healthcare services or bill directly to medicare medicaid or other third party payors certain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients’ rights are and will be applicable to our business we could be subject to healthcare fraud and abuse and patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business other jurisdictions such as the european union have similar laws the regulations that will affect how we operate include   ● the federal healthcare program antikickback statute which prohibits among other things any person from knowingly and willfully offering soliciting receiving or providing remuneration directly or indirectly in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for or the purchase order or recommendation of any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the medicare and medicaid programs   ● the federal false claims act which prohibits among other things individuals or entities from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented false claims or knowingly using false statements to obtain payment from the federal government   ● federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters   ● the federal physician payment sunshine act created under the affordable care act and its implementing regulations which require manufacturers of drugs medical devices biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under medicare medicaid or the children’s health insurance program to report annually to the us department of health and human services or hhs information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members   ● hipaa as amended by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information and   ● state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws such as antikickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any thirdparty payor including commercial insurers   the affordable care act among other things amends the intent requirement of the federal antikickback statute and criminal healthcare fraud statutes a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in addition the affordable care act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal antikickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims act   efforts to ensure that our business arrangements will comply with applicable healthcare laws may involve substantial costs it is possible that governmental and enforcement authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes regulations or case law interpreting applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations if any such actions are instituted against us and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights those actions could have a significant impact on our business including the imposition of civil criminal and administrative penalties damages disgorgement monetary fines possible exclusion from participation in medicare medicaid and other federal and similar foreign healthcare programs contractual damages reputational harm diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment of our operations any of which could harm our ability to operate our business and our results of operations          compliance with environmental laws and regulations could be expensive failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could subject us to significant liability   our research and development and manufacturing operations may involve the use of hazardous substances and are subject to a variety of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to the storage use discharge disposal remediation of and human exposure to hazardous substances and the sale labeling collection recycling treatment and disposal of products containing hazardous substances in addition our research and development and manufacturing operations produce biological waste materials such as human and animal tissue and waste solvents such as isopropyl alcohol these operations are permitted by regulatory authorities and the resultant waste materials are disposed of in material compliance with environmental laws and regulations liability under environmental laws and regulations can be joint and several and without regard to fault or negligence compliance with environmental laws and regulations may be expensive and noncompliance could result in substantial liabilities fines and penalties personal injury and third part property damage claims and substantial investigation and remediation costs environmental laws and regulations could become more stringent over time imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations we cannot assure you that violations of these laws and regulations will not occur in the future or have not occurred in the past as a result of human error accidents equipment failure or other causes the expense associated with environmental regulation and remediation could harm our financial condition and operating results          risks related to owning our securities our financial results and our need for financing   our quarterly and annual results may fluctuate significantly may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business and may result in decreases in the price of our securities   our operating results will be affected by numerous factors such as   ● variations in the level of expenses related to our proposed products   ● status of our product development efforts   ● execution of collaborative licensing or other arrangements and the timing of payments received or made under those arrangements   ● intellectual property prosecution and any infringement lawsuits to which we may become a party   ● regulatory developments affecting our products or those of our competitors   ● our ability to obtain and maintain fda clearance and approval from foreign regulatory authorities for our products which have not yet been approved for marketing   ● market acceptance of our taeus applications   ● the availability of reimbursement for our taeus applications   ● our ability to attract new customers and grow our business with existing customers   ● the timing and success of new product and feature introductions by us or our competitors or any other change in the competitive dynamics of our industry including consolidation among competitors customers or strategic partners   ● the amount and timing of costs and expenses related to the maintenance and expansion of our business and operations   ● changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors   ● general economic industry and market conditions   ● the hiring training and retention of key employees including our ability to expand our sales team   ● litigation or other claims against us   ● our ability to obtain additional financing and   ● advances and trends in new technologies and industry standards          any or all of these factors could adversely affect our cash position requiring us to raise additional capital which may be on unfavorable terms and result in substantial dilution   if we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our securities may decrease   as a public company we are be required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls section  of the sarbanesoxley act of  the sarbanesoxley act requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and beginning with our annual report for the year ending december   provide a management report on our internal control over financial reporting which must be attested to by our independent registered public accounting firm to the extent we are no longer an “emerging growth company” as defined by the jumpstart our businesses act of  the jobs act   currently we have material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and as a result we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated we are in the process of designing and implementing our internal control over financial reporting which process will be time consuming costly and complicated however we are a small organization with limited management resources in addition to serving as our chief financial officer david wells provides financial consulting services to several other companies these other consulting services could prevent mr wells from dedicating sufficient time and attention to us which could limit our ability to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting   until such time as we are no longer an “emerging growth company” or a smaller reporting company our auditors will not be required to attest as to our internal control over financial reporting if we continue to identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting if we are unable to comply with the requirements of section  in a timely manner if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective or once required if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to attest that our internal control over financial reporting is effective investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our securities could decrease we could also become subject to stockholder or other thirdparty litigation as well as investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed the securities and exchange commission the sec or other regulatory authorities which could require additional financial and management resources and could result in fines trading suspensions or other remedies   we may not be able to secure financing on favorable terms or at all to meet our future capital needs and our failure to obtain financing when needed could force us to delay reduce or eliminate our product development programs and commercialization efforts   we believe that our current cash including the net proceeds from our initial public offering and expected revenues from operations will be sufficient for us to fund the development and regulatory approval and to initiate the commercialization of our nafld taeus application in the european union however  we expect that we will need to finance the full commercialization of this application in the european union and to complete the development of any other taeus application through public or private equity offerings debt financings corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements or other financing alternatives           to date we have financed our operations primarily through sales of our nexus  system and net proceeds from the issuance of securities we do not know when or if our operations will generate sufficient cash to fund our ongoing operations in the future we may require additional capital in order to i continue to conduct research and development activities ii conduct clinical studies iii fund the costs of seeking regulatory approval of taeus applications iv expand our sales and marketing infrastructure v acquire complementary business technology or products or vi respond to business opportunities challenges increased regulatory obligations or unforeseen circumstances our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forwardlooking statement and involves risks and uncertainties and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors including the factors discussed elsewhere in this “risk factors” section we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect our future funding requirements will depend on many factors including but not limited to   ● the costs timing and outcomes of regulatory reviews associated with our future products including taeus applications   ● the costs and expenses of expanding our sales and marketing infrastructure   ● the costs and timing of developing variations of our taeus applications and if necessary obtaining regulatory clearance of such variations   ● the degree of success we experience in commercializing our products particularly our taeus applications   ● the extent to which our taeus applications are adopted by hospitals for use by primary care physicians hepatologists radiologists and oncologists for diagnosis of fatty liver disease and the thermal ablation of lesions   ● the number and types of future products we develop and commercialize   ● the costs of preparing filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining enforcing and defending intellectual propertyrelated claims   ● the extent and scope of our general and administrative expenses   ● the progress timing scope and costs of our clinical trials including the ability to timely enroll patients in our planned and potential future clinical trials   ● the outcome timing and cost of regulatory approvals including the potential that the fda or comparable regulatory authorities may require that we perform more studies than those that we currently expect   ● the amount of sales and other revenues from technologies and products that we may commercialize if any including the selling prices for such potential products and the availability of adequate thirdparty reimbursement   ● selling and marketing costs associated with our potential products including the cost and timing of expanding our marketing and sales capabilities   ● the terms and timing of any potential future collaborations licensing or other arrangements that we may establish   ● cash requirements of any future acquisitions andor the development of other products   ● the costs of operating as a public company   ● the cost and timing of completion of commercialscale outsourced manufacturing activities and   ● the time and cost necessary to respond to technological and market developments   we may raise funds in equity or debt financings or enter into credit facilities in order to access funds for our capital needs any debt financing obtained by us in the future would cause us to incur debt service expenses and could include restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and pursue business opportunities if we raise additional funds through issuances of equity or convertible debt securities our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership of our company and any new equity securities we issue could have rights preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock general market conditions or the market price of our common stock may not support capital raising transactions such as a public or private offering of our common stock or other securities if we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it we may terminate or delay the development of one or more of our products or delay establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or other activities necessary to commercialize our products in addition if we raise additional funds through collaborations strategic alliances or marketing distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies future revenue streams or products or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us          if we are unable to raise capital when needed we may be required to curtail the development of our technology or materially curtail or reduce our operations we could be forced to sell or dispose of our rights or assets any inability to raise adequate funds on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operation and financial condition including the possibility that a lack of funds could cause our business to fail and liquidate with little or no return to investors   we may be subject to securities litigation which is expensive and could divert management attention   the price of our securities may be volatile and in the past companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been subject to an increased incidence of securities class action litigation we may be the target of this type of litigation in the future securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns which could seriously harm our business   we are an “emerging growth company” under the jobs act and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our securities less attractive to investors   we are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the jumpstart our business startups act of  or the jobs act and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including but not limited to not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section  of the sarbanesoxley act reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved  we cannot predict if investors will find our securities less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions  if some investors find our securities less attractive as a result there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the price of our securities may be more volatile   we will remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years after the date of our initial public offering although we will lose that status sooner if our annual revenues exceed  billion if we issue more than  billion in nonconvertible debt in a three year period or if the market value of our common stock that is held by nonaffiliates exceeds  million as of any june    if securities or industry analysts do not publish research reports about our business or if they issue an adverse opinion about our business the price of our securities and trading volume could decline   the trading market for our securities is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business we do not currently have and may never obtain research coverage by securities and industry analysts if no or few analysts commence research coverage of us or one or more of the analysts who cover us issues an adverse opinion about our company the price of our securities would likely decline if one or more of these analysts ceases research coverage of us or fails to regularly publish reports on us we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause the price of our securities or trading volume to decline    we have not paid dividends in the past and have no immediate plans to pay dividends   we plan to reinvest all of our earnings to the extent we have earnings in order to further develop our technology and potential products and to cover operating costs  we do not plan to pay any cash dividends with respect to our securities in the foreseeable future  we cannot assure you that we will at any time generate sufficient surplus cash that would be available for distribution to the holders of our common stock as a dividend     concentration of ownership among our existing executive officers directors and significant stockholders may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions   all decisions with respect to the management of the company will be made by our board of directors and our officers who beneficially own approximately  of our common stock as calculated in accordance with rule d promulgated under the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act this control could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of the company or changes in management which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the market price of the company’s securities or prevent stockholders from realizing a premium over the market price for their securities          we incur significant costs as a result of becoming a public company that reports to the sec and our management is required to devote substantial time to meet compliance obligations   as a public company listed in the united states we incur significant legal accounting and other expenses  we are subject to reporting requirements of the exchange act and the sarbanesoxley act as well as rules subsequently implemented by the sec and nasdaq that impose significant requirements on public companies including requiring the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices  in addition in  the doddfrank wall street reform and protection act or the doddfrank act was enacted  there are significant corporate governance and executive compensationrelated provisions in the doddfrank act that contribute to our legal and financial compliance costs make some activities more difficult timeconsuming or costly and also place undue strain on our personnel systems and resources  our management and other personnel need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives  in addition these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage  as a result it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified people to serve on our board of directors our board committees or as executive officers   a significant portion of our total outstanding shares of common stock is restricted from immediate resale but may be sold into the market in the near future this could cause the market price of our securities to drop significantly even if our business is doing well   sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur in the future these sales or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of securities intend to sell shares could reduce the market price of our common stock we currently have outstanding  shares of common stock of these outstanding shares approximately  are restricted under securities laws or as a result of lockup agreements but will be able to be resold in the near future we also intend to register all shares of common stock that we may issue under our equity compensation plans once we register these shares they can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance and once vested subject to  and day lockup periods under certain lockup agreements   future sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock including pursuant to our equity incentive plan could result in dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause the price of our securities to fall   we expect that significant capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations to the extent we raise capital by issuing common stock convertible securities or other equity securities our stockholders may experience substantial dilution and new investors could gain rights superior to our existing stockholders   our charter documents and delaware law may inhibit a takeover that stockholders consider favorable   certain provisions of our fourth amended and restated certificate of incorporation our “certificate of incorporation” and bylaws and applicable provisions of delaware law may delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in control or change in our management including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares or transactions that our stockholders might otherwise deem to be in their best interests  the provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws   ● authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval and to designate the rights preferences and privileges of each class if issued such preferred stock would increase the number of outstanding shares of our capital stock and could include terms that may deter an acquisition of us   ● limit who may call stockholder meetings   ● do not provide for cumulative voting rights and   ● provide that all vacancies may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office even if less than a quorum          in addition section  of the delaware general corporation law limits our ability to engage in any business combination with a person who beneficially owns  or more of our outstanding voting stock unless certain conditions are satisfied  this restriction lasts for a period of three years following any such person’s share acquisition  these provisions may have the effect of entrenching our management team and may deprive stockholders of the opportunity to sell their shares to potential acquirers at a premium over prevailing prices  this potential inability to obtain a control premium could reduce the price of our common stock   our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud   we are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the exchange act our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to management and recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the rules and forms of the sec we believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met   these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls accordingly because of the inherent limitations in our control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected   item  recent sales of unregistered securities use of proceeds from registered securities   convertible notes   in march  we extended our  offering of convertible promissory notes by  the extension was made available only to existing noteholders and  of the offering was subscribed the class of promissory notes converted into shares of our common stock immediately prior to the completion of our initial public offering at an effective conversion price of  per share after the onefor reverse stock split that the company effected on may   the “reverse split” except as otherwise noted in this quarterly report on form q all share numbers are presented on a post reverse split basis in connection with the issuances of the foregoing securities the company relied on the exemption from registration provided by section a of the securities act of  as amended for transactions not involving a public offering we used the funds received from the issuance of these convertible notes for working capital   use of proceeds from offering of registered securities   on may   our registration statement on form s as amended reg no  was declared effective by the sec and on may   our registration statement on form s reg no  became effective upon filing with the sec each such registration statement was filed in connection with our initial public offering pursuant to which we sold  units each consisting of one share of our common stock and a warrant to purchase one share of our common stock at a price to the public of  per unit which amount includes the full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional units the common stock and warrants comprising each unit are not immediately separable and will begin trading separately on july   which is the first day following the th day after the date of the final prospectus filed with the sec pursuant to rule b under the securities act on may   the “prospectus” or such earlier date as may be determined by national securities corporation as representative of the underwriters of the offering each warrant is exercisable for a share of our common stock at a price of  per share the offering closed on may   and the underwriters exercised their overallotment option as of may   as a result of which we raised net proceeds of approximately  million after deducting approximately  in underwriting discounts commissions and expenses and approximately  in offering expenses payable by us national securities corporation and dougherty  company llc were the underwriters for the offering no payments were made by us to directors officers or persons owning ten percent or more of our common stock or to their associates or to our affiliates other than payments in the ordinary course of business to officers for salaries and to nonemployee directors as compensation for board or board committee service
