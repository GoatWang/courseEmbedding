are synonymous with supercapacitors and electric doublelayer capacitors edlc activated carbon ultracapacitors offer faster charging and discharging of power better cycle life and greater reliability than traditional batteries ultracapacitors have two metal plate electrodes coated with activated carbon virtually all ultracapacitor manufacturers use activated carbon which must have a particularly high porosity and a low level of impurities such as that manufactured by millennium carbon these plates are immersed in an electrolyte solution one carboncoated electrode is positive and the other is negative when a voltage is applied across the electrodes a charge separation builds as positive and negative ions from the electrolyte accumulate on the surface of each carboncoated plate this charge separation creates a useful electric field between the electrodes due to their many benefits ultracapacitors are currently being utilized in thousands of applications and the market for ultra capacitors continues to accelerate  ultracapacitors have much lower energy density than batteries and their low energy density is in most cases the factor that determines the feasibility of their use

ultracapacitor ang storage medical connect faqs millennium carbon millennium carbonproduction process millennium carbon is a manufacturer of premium activated carbon from macadamia nutshell feedstock millennium carbon has a proprietary twostage process based on pyrolysis and steam activation the central element of millennium carbons technology is pyrolysis a thermal process by which hydrocarbon materials are depolymerized in an oxygenfree environment millennium carbon receives the macadamia nutshells screens the feedstock to eliminate unwanted debris and crushes the shells to increase surface area our speciallydesigned pyrolysis char reactor carbonizes the macadamia nutshells by heating the feedstock to approximately c in an inert atmosphere the pyrolysis process breaks the chemical bonds within the macadamia nutshells liberating a stream of pure carbon char material and a high temperature hydrocarbon gas the hydrocarbon gas is then cooled and filtered into usable energy in the form of condensed oil and noncondensed gases these energy streams produce power onsite to operate the facility through a megawatt steam turbineas a second stage of the production process the char moves through a rotary activation kiln in which the char is heated in the absence of oxygen and carbon is activated through a controlled mixing of the material with superheated steam the chemical reaction between the carbon and steam creates a highly porous carbon structure by removing carbon and impurities from lattice structure of the carbon material as a final step the activated carbon is acid washed and pulverized to meet to meet the specifications for highquality powdered activated carbon for our customersour existing plant and primary technology research and development center is located near the port of kawaihae on hawaii island the plant is fully permitted and the first of its kind in the united states the plant sits on a total of  acres of land and is designed to process approximately  tons of macadamia nutshells annually into our premium activated carbon the hawaii island economic development board is pleased to welcome millennium carbon to our community the company’s innovative production process creates value from the waste stream of macadamia nutshells produced in hawaii in an environmentallyfriendly way millennium carbon is working with government and private sector organizations to create new jobs and opportunities for hawaii residents we are glad to have millennium carbon in kawaihae hawaii   jacqui hoover  executive director  hawaii island

carbon that is an ideal adsorbent material for adsorbed natural gas ang and low pressure compressed natural gas cng storage applicationstodays conventional approaches to natural gas storage are compressed natural gas cng and liquid natural gas lng but both have drawbacks  high costs low storage efficiency and safety concerns ang storage using activated carbon is a favored alternative to these two storage methods ang storage provides better storage characteristics than highpressure cng storage because it is safer and far more efficient than cng  psi versus  psi ultrahigh surface area activated carbon stores natural gas storage systems at pressures substantially below those typically required for current cng systems and without the liquefaction and boiloff challenges of lng adsorbed natural gas is considered to be a better choice for vehicles than compressed natural gas because the adsorption system has the advantage of low storage pressureprofessor shuji himeno nagaoka
