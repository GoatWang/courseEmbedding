isabelle mateos y lago chief multiasset strategist at blackrock published march   comment share facebook twitter linkedin google plus email isabelle mateos y lago puts china in context showing just how important it has become for the global economy china’s debtdriven growth model is starting to reach its limits yet the country is also transitioning into a hightech more consumerdriven economy how this economic evolution plays out will have major ramifications for the global economy as my blackrock investment institute colleagues and i write in our new paper “china’s tricky transition signposts to watch in its economic evolution” the map and statistics below put china in context showing just how important it has become for the global economy economic trends development and policy vary greatly by region as evident in our new interactive map graphic comparing just a few economic and demographic metrics across provinces awareness of this heterogeneity is important to fully grasp the sheer scale of china’s development transformation data from the international monetary fund imf show that china accounted for a quarter of world gross domestic product gdp growth over the past  years yet its share of world gdp is smaller than it was two centuries ago according to the academic maddison project china’s hunger for global commodities and major pollution problems are well known but the heft of china’s digital economy is less familiar ecommerce revenues now make up nearly  of the world total while mobile payments were  times those in the us at  trillion  trillion yuan in  according to china’s iresearch and forrester research we believe china is taking appropriate steps to become a more servicesdriven consumptionbased economy achieving a smooth handoff to households and consumers from an industrialled growth model is never easy there is a reason why japan south korea and taiwan are rare examples of economies that avoided the socalled middleincome trap and successfully made the transition to become wealthy and servicesoriented the falloff in investment has caused chinese growth to slow and means that consumption holds the key to overall growth going forward greater urbanization is one of china’s top growth goals with the aim that nearly  of its  billion population live in urban areas by  compared with  in  according to a  world bank report this ongoing urbanization should feature vital reforms revamping the hukou household registration system to allow a greater rural shift to cities improving land rights offering more government pension and health care benefits and adopting more green technology thus infrastructure spending will still play a key role driving growth especially in the less developed central and western regions of the country as part of president xi jinping’s one belt one road initiative to boost ties with eurasia along old silk road routes china can reorient its vast consumer base in unique ways bernstein research highlights an fold surge in hybrid and electric auto sales in three years to nearly half a million by the end of  from a credit perspective a shift is under way some  of new lending is going to households thanks to mortgage demand  bis data show urbanization should play a major role which is why premier li keqiang has prioritized it so will taking the next big steps in shoring up a public pension and health system this should encourage more spending instead of rainyday savings that get channeled into unproductive investment in the meantime we are optimistic about china’s nearterm growth outlook in what is the year of the fire rooster in the chinese zodiac we see scope for china’s cyclical rebound to strengthen and believe the risk of a debt crisis is limited in the short run though there are other nearterm risks a potential trade war with the us could undercut the recovery while a sharp us dollar appreciation could lead to renewed capital outflows in addition risks of temporary credit crunches are rising as china’s central bank has started a targeted policy tightening to curb financial system leverage for now our proprietary gps gauge is pointing to a positive growth outlook in china just as supplyside reforms and capacity cuts improve industrial profitability the improving growth outlook is one reason why we are upbeat on chinese equities near term as a global trade pickup reinforces the domestic momentum the shift to more consumerled growth opens up opportunities for both domestic companies and global ones tapping into the chinese market we see opportunities on the nearterm investment horizon whether in stateowned enterprise soe reform the booming ecommerce sector or the fast adoption of green technologies to address environmental woes our bottom line we believe it would be unwise to ignore china’s possibilities given the sheer scale of its tricky transition the country is undergoing a transformation where the consumer is playing a greater role supported by an unprecedented rate of urbanization for all the risks we believe the potential within china should not be underestimated read our full paper for more about china’s growth outlook and economic evolution

writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate
