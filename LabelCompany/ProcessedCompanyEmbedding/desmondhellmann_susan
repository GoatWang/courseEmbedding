directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed

susan desmondhellmann from nature reviews drug discovery from uganda to san francisco the president of product development at genentech describes her chaotic career by her own admission susan desmondhellmann has had a chaotic career path but she believes that the skills and experience she has amassed along the way have allowed her to do whats really important to her  to get better drugs to cancer patients it is clear that she has tremendous respect and regard for cancer sufferers and as president of product development at genentech she really is making an impact on their treatment since joining the company in  she has been credited by genentech colleagues and outsiders alike as the key force behind the development of several innovative new anticancer drugs as an intern at the university of california in san francisco ucsf usa desmondhellmann became interested in cancer research and undertook a fellowship in oncology but unlike many of her peers who went into the lab she chose to do her research project in the clinic and obtained a masters degree in public health focusing on epidemiology and biostatistics around the same time there was a rise in hivassociated malignancies in san francisco and so she chose to investigate the epidemiological aspects of kaposis sarcoma on her return to the ucsf faculty the rockefeller foundation asked desmondhellmann and her husband an infectious diseases doctor at ucsf to move to uganda to study heterosexual transmission of hiv they jumped at the opportunity and spent  years researching and teaching at makere university in kampala it was a fantastic experience she says it was challenging but theres a wonderful medical community in uganda and we felt the work was important and meaningful arriving back at ucsf however desmondhellmann says things had changed we didnt have much of a career left truth be told feeling overwhelmed by starting from scratch with little mentorship or support at the university she and her husband moved to kentucky to do private practice but desmondhellmann soon became frustrated at the lack of treatment options for her cancer patients and was driven to do something about it i loved my patients but did not enjoy private practice i thought it was the wrong job for me we needed better weapons against cancer and i wanted to be a part of that so when bristolmyers squibb bms recruited her husband to work on one of their hiv drugs desmondhellmann joined the companys oncology team to work on the development of taxol for breast cancer there she felt she had finally found her true vocation i absolutely loved it it was a great fit for my skills i was working with marcel rozencweig renzo canetta and steve carter who in my mind were the architects of the chemotherapy i had been using in the clinic they really knew how to develop drugs and conduct clinical trials to get a cancer drug approved after  years of what she admits was a steep learning curve at bms desmondhellmann got the call from genentech fred desauvage and dan eaton had just identified thrombopoietin as a key mediator of making platelets and i was asked to take it into the clinic she recalls i was so struck by the beautiful research and how sciencedriven genentech was  and frankly it was also a chance to come back home so in  she and her husband moved back to california where she took up a clinical scientist position desmondhellmann thrived in the startup atmosphere of genentech and quickly worked her way up the executive ladder via several senior clinical positions before taking on her current role in march  she thinks her try anything attitude and passion for helping cancer patients are the reason for her success when i did a rotation in oncology i was struck by how wonderful and brave cancer patients are its a lifechanging moment for someone to be told they have cancer so i feel this incredible commitment to being part of something that can help them what advice would she give to others wanting to follow her career path do something youre passionate about and that challenges you ask yourself what will i learn from this every day i learn something new at genentech and even though i didnt have a very well laid out career path i think ive learned and benefited from everything i did desmondhellmann has been nominated as a woman to watch by the wall street journal and one of the most powerful women in business by fortune magazine does the frequent mention of being a woman in science become an irritation a fellow female vice president and i were often asked to have panel discussions of what its like to be a female scientist and we just dreaded them she says it just seemed silly and contrived but my feelings about it have evolved over the past several years and im now more willing to have people point out that its unusual to be a female senior executive in rd this willingness to be more visible comes from women telling her that they lacked female role models to aspire to i realized that  years ago when i was starting out there was no one for me to look up to instead she took inspiration from her parents her father a pharmacist encouraged her interest in science and medicine and she credits her mother a former english teacher with teaching her about leadership and the importance of good communication desmondhellmann says the only low point of her career was the heartbreaking decision to leave private practice but i promised my patients i would try my hardest to do my best for many many cancer patients instead she has certainly kept that promise but shes not done yet the sense that we have to do better hasnt changed she says because we have to improve things for cancer sufferers home  news  research highlights  research  reviews
