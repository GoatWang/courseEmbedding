to legal and regulatory proceedings in the ordinary course of its business the companys legal and regulatory matters include proceedings specific to the company and other proceedings generally applicable to business practices in the industries in which the company operates these matters are subject to many uncertainties and given their complexity and scope their outcomes cannot be predicted regulatory proceedings could also affect the outcome of one or more of the companys litigation matters furthermore it is often not possible to determine the ultimate outcomes of the pending regulatory investigations and legal proceedings or to provide reasonable ranges of potential losses with any degree of certainty some matters including certain of those referred to below are in very preliminary stages and the company does not have sufficient information to make an assessment of the plaintiffs claims for liability or damages in some of the cases seeking to be certified as class actions the

damages or other relief including punitive damages and equitable remedies which are difficult to quantify and cannot be defined based on the information currently available the company believes however that based on currently known information the ultimate outcome of all pending legal and regulatory matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the companys condensed consolidated financial position nonetheless given the large or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability of litigation it is possible that such outcomes could materially affect the companys condensed consolidated financial position or results of operations in a particular quarter or annual period the various businesses conducted by the

substitution further applicants have agreed to certain expense limits to ensure affected contractowners do not incur higher expenses as a result of a substitution for a period of twenty four  months after the substitution  applicants submit that the proposed substitutions meet the standards set forth in section c and assert that replacement of the old portfolios with the new portfolios is consistent with the protection of contractowners and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act specifically they argue that the substitutions will not result in the type of costly forced redemption that section c was designed to prevent rather applicants conclude that “any impact on the investment programs of affected contractowners should be negligible” and affirm the substitutions will have no impact on other aspects of the contracts including the annuity life or tax benefits they afford affected contractowners  section b applicants request that the commission issue an order pursuant to section b of the  act exempting them from the provisions of section a of the  act to the extent necessary to permit them to carry out the inkind substitution transactions

diluted and ii section b applicants agree to carry out the inkind transactions in conformity with all of the conditions of rule a and the procedures adopted thereunder except that the consideration paid for the securities being purchased or sold may not be entirely cash thus section b applicants conclude that the purposes intended by implementation of the rule are met by the terms of the inkind transactions  in support of this position section b applicants assert that the proposed inkind transactions will be effected based upon the independent current market price of the portfolio securities as specified in rule ab and will include only securities for which market quotations are readily available on the substitution date in accordance with rule ac section b applicants assert that the proposed inkind transactions will be consistent with the policy of each registered investment company and separate series thereof participating in the inkind transactions as recited in the relevant registered investment companys registration statement and reports as specified in rule ad the application states that no brokerage commission fee except for any customary transfer fees or other remuneration will be paid in connection with the proposed inkind transactions likewise section b applicants represent that trusts board of trustees has adopted and implemented the fund governance and oversight procedures as required by rule ae and f the application also states “pursuant to rule ae during the calendar quarter following the quarter in which any inkind transactions occur the trusts

greater or lesser minimum initial and subsequent purchase payments  at any time prior to annuitization the contract owner may select one of three annuity payment options each of which provides for a series of annuity payments commencing on the annuitization date each contract also provides for a death benefit if the annuitant dies during the accumulation period the death benefit if the annuitant dies prior to the annuitization date and prior to his or her eightysixth birthday is the greater of a the sum of all purchase payments made under the contract less any amounts surrendered b the sum of

to  the companies currently deduct such charges from a contract owners contract value either i at the time the contract is surrendered ii at annuitization or iii in those states that so require at the time purchase payments are made to the contract  the companies permit unlimited transfers among the funds under each of the subject contracts no fees or charges are currently imposed for such transfers the companies however reserve the right to impose a maximum fee of  per transfer under future contracts  the companies deduct during both the accumulation and annuitization periods administration charges of  for subject contract no  and  for subject contract no  of the daily net assets of the nationwide variable account and nationwide va separate accountb respectively nwl does not assess any administration charge with respect to subject contract no  the administration charge is an amount not greater than expenses without profit actually incurred and directly attributable to services provided by nwl and nwlaic respectively the companies assess the administration charges in reliance on rule a of the act and may with respect to future contracts that are substantially similar in all material respects to either subject contract no  or subject contract no  assess administration charges greater than those imposed under subject contracts nos  and  any such page  administration charges will be assessed in accordance with rule a b and the companies shall monitor the proceeds of the administration charge and other similar administrative or contract maintenance charges including any transfer fee to ensure that they do not exceed expenses without profit applicants represent that any administrative charge contract maintenance charge or transfer fee shall not be increased during the life of a contract the companies believe that the administration charges will yield an amount considerably less than the companies current and projected administrative costs  no sales charge is deducted from purchase payments made under the contracts however a contingent deferred sales charge cdsc may be assessed by nwl or nwlaic if part or all of the contract value is withdrawn currently a cdsc is only imposed under subject contract no  the cdsc is calculated by multiplying the purchase payments that are withdrawn by a percentage according to the following schedule  cdsc number of completed years from the date of purchase payment percentage                   for purposes of imposing the cdsc purchase payments are considered to be withdrawn on a firstin firstout basis and purchase payments are considered to be withdrawn before earnings thereon applicants believe that the proceeds from the imposition of the cdsc may not be sufficient to cover all sales expenses with respect to future contracts substantially similar in all material respects to subject contract no  applicants reserve the right to impose a cdsc up to  in accordance with rule cb  under subject contract no  each contract year the annuitant may withdraw without the imposition of a cdsc an amount equal to  of the total sum of all purchase payments made up to the time of withdrawal less any purchase payments previously withdrawn that were subject to the cdsc the cdscfree withdrawal privilege also may be exercised pursuant to a systematic withdrawal program under which the annuitant may withdraw each contract year without the imposition of a cdsc an amount up to the greater of a  of the total sum of all purchase payments made up to the time of withdrawal less any purchase payments previously withdrawn the  withdrawal privilege or b the specified percentage of the contract value based on the annuitants age as follows  percentage annuitants age of contract value  under    to    to    and over   if total amounts withdrawn in any contract year exceed the cdscfree amount as calculated in connection with the systematic withdrawal privilege the annuitant may only withdraw without the imposition of a cdsc an amount equal to the  withdrawal privilege the annuitant may elect to withdraw such cdscfree amounts only once each contract year  the companies intend to assess mortality and expense risk charges against the assets of the separate accounts the aggregate mortality and expense risk charges are equal for subject contracts nos  and  on an annual basis to  of the net asset value of the separate accounts of this amount  is attributable to mortality risks and  is attributable to expense risks with respect to subject contract no  nwl assesses a mortality risk charge equal on an annual basis to  of the net asset value of the separate accounts and does not assess an expense risk charge with respect to future contracts the companies reserve the right to assess a maximum mortality risk charge of  of the daily net assets of the separate accounts associated with future contracts subject to obtaining an appropriate sec order the mortality and expense risk charges are guaranteed not to increase for the duration of a contract  the mortality risk the companies assume is twofold a the annuity risk of guaranteeing to make monthly payments for the lifetime of the annuitant regardless of how long the annuitant may live and b assuming the risk of a guaranteed minimum death benefit the annuity risk is present in the form of annuity purchase rates that are guaranteed at issue for the life of the contract there is also the risk that the average life expectancy of the entire population may grow longer the companies assume an expense risk in connection with their guarantee that they will not increase annual contract charges regardless of actual expenses incurred  if the mortality and expense risk charges are insufficient to cover the actual costs of the mortality and expense risks the loss will be borne by the companies conversely if the mortality and expense risk charges prove more than sufficient the expense will be a profit to the companies in such a situation the profit will become part of the general account surplus of either nwl or nwlaic depending on which is the issuing company and may be used to compensate each company for unrecovered distribution expenses applicants legal analysis  applicants request an exemption under section c of the act from sections ac and c of the act to permit the deduction of mortality and expense risk charges from the assets of the separate accounts under the contracts  sections ac and c in relevant part prohibit a principle underwriter for or depositor of a registered unit investment trust from selling periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of all payments other than sales loads on such certificates are deposited with a qualified trustee or custodian within the meaning of section a and are held under arrangements that prohibit any payment to the depositor or principal underwriter except a reasonable fee as the commission may prescribe for performing bookkeeping and other administrative duties normally performed by the trustee or custodian the companies deduction of mortality and expense risk charges from the assets of the separate accounts may be deemed to be a payment prohibited by sections ac and c  section c of the act authorizes the commission by order upon application to conditionally or unconditionally grant an exemption from any provision of the act or any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act  applicants request an exemption under section c from sections ac and c to permit the issuance of contracts subject to the proposed mortality and expense risk charges applicants believe that the proposed mortality and expense risk charges on the subject contracts and page  any future contracts funded through existing or future accounts meet the standards of sections c applicants believe that any future request for relief with respect to any future contract would be substantively and materially the same as the relief sought herein applicants believe that the requested relief would eliminate the need for the filing of redundant exemptive applications or amendments thereby reducing administrative expenses maximizing efficient use of resources and thus promoting competitiveness in the variable annuity market the delay and expense of repeatedly seeking exemptive relief would impair the companies ability to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise  the companies believe that the level of the mortality and expense risk charges is within the range of industry practice for comparable annuity products and is reasonable in relation to the risks assumed under the contracts this representation is based upon the companies analysis of publicly available information regarding other insurance companies of similar size and risk ratings offering similar products the companies will maintain at their administrative offices made available to the sec upon request memoranda setting forth in detail the products analyzed in the course of and the methodology and results of their comparative review  the companies represent that in connection with future contracts substantially similar in all material respects to subject contracts nos  and  if a mortality and expense risk charge is imposed subject contract no  if only a mortality risk charge is imposed any mortality and expense risk charges assessed shall be within the range of industry practice for comparable annuity products and shall be reasonable in relation to the risks assumed under the contracts this representation will be based upon the companies analysis of publicly available information regarding other insurance companies of similar size and risk ratings offering similar products the companies will maintain at their administrative offices made available to the sec upon request memoranda setting forth in detail the products analyzed in the course of and the methodology and results of their comparative review  the companies believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that this distribution financing arrangement will benefit existing accounts and contract owners the basis of this conclusion is set forth in memoranda maintained by the companies at their administrative offices made available to the sec upon its request  applicants represent that with respect to future contracts that shall be substantially similar in all material respects to subject contracts nos   or  the companies shall determine that there is a reasonable likelihood that this distribution financing arrangement will benefit future or existing accounts and future contract owners the basis of this conclusion will be set forth in memoranda maintained by the companies at their administrative offices made available to the sec upon its request  applicants represent that investments of the separate accounts will be made only in investment companies that if they adopt any distribution financing plan under rule b under the act will have such plan formulated and approved by the investment companies boards of trustees or directors the majority of which will not be interested persons as defined in the act conclusion for the reasons set forth above applicants believe that the requested exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent
