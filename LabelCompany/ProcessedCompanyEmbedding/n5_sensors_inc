  home n sensors inc ceocfomembers login april   issue ceocfo magazine   gas and chemical sensor microchips providing realtime environmental monitoring capability to smart devices wearables iot devices and smart home systems     dr abhishek motayed founder and president   n sensors inc wwwnsensorscom   contact abhishek motayed  amotayednsensorscom   interview conducted by lynn fosse senior editor ceocfo magazine published  april     ceocfo dr motayed what is the idea behind n sensors dr motayed at n we leverage smart materials and cuttingedge engineering to bring smart sensors that provides gas detection capability for nextgeneration of smart and connected devices we wanted to develop reliable gas sensor chips that can bridge the gap that exists between need for environmental detection in smart devices and the mature sensor technologies that are available in the market   ceocfo what can the new sensors do  dr motayed the sensors that we have developed are essentially gas and chemical sensors inside a microchip think of a microchip doing computations and so forth in your cell phone and laptop and whatever other devices you have now imagine a chip like that inside all those devices that now have the ability to detect different air toxins or different air qualities features in your near surrounding that means using that you can now get realtime data on what is happening to your environment and how that affects or impacts your health safety and wellbeing whether you are in your home working at your office running outside working outside if you are an industrial worker our sensors can provide individuals with realtime information on the dangers present in the environment and also the longterm impacts on being in such environments information of that nature can not only improve individual safety but also can have profound impact on our longterm health   ceocfo how are you able to accomplish this what needs to be in that chip  dr motayed we have designed and perfected an architecture that allows us to combine the high performance of the nanomaterials with high throughput manufacturing that is commonly used in semiconductor manufacturing we combine them together to produce the ultrasensitive and very specific micro scale chemical sensors we put all of that together into a tiny chip the size of smaller than a postage stamp basically that is the heart of our chemical sensors using all of the innovations that we have done in different things like sensor design materials manufacturing packaging and algorithm development we have developed a really smart robust sensors but at a price point of a consumer device traditionally gas detection technology has been for industrial use high cost high maintenance and what we have done is to bring industrial grade detection capability to regular use � such as personal devices smart home systems and smart offices   ceocfo have similar concepts been tried dr motayed yes we do have competitors in the market what differentiates us from the competitors is the innovative architecture which is a patented ip that we have licensed it from one of the universities this architecture allows us to build sensors that are very selective precise and robust it provides the user with more reliable data and a longer operating sensor at a lower power and a single chip can read multiple gasses what that means for the end user is that our technology can provide timely data and they do not have to service or maintain the sensors frequently if you deploy our sensors in a system such as a smart home it can serve in multiple ways it can provide information on longterm trends such as how daily activities affect the air quality inside your home however it can also provide immediate alarms for dangerous situations for example if you have a carbon monoxide buildup or if you have a natural gas leak that is because our individual sensors can do multiple gasses so the end user is provided with more information and more value   ceocfo are you still in the development stage do you have products commercially available  dr motayed we have a product pipeline some of the designs are still in the development or prototyping stage some are more advanced we have some that are commercially available for customers to evaluate and design their systems around them some are still going through testing and evaluation so we have a product pipeline with products in different stages of development    ceocfo how do you get attention from the appropriate people have people been looking for something like this how do you get to the mainstream  dr motayed we have a strategy this is a new technology in order to gain traction we have to educate different tiers of your customers and endusers we have gone out to trade shows and demonstrated and exhibited our technology to get customer traction to get customers through the door show them what it can do when they integrate our sensors into their systems then we have done several evaluations with interested customers which led to further engagements our business model is almost an oem model where it is essential to engage the customer but also it is important to bring in the enduser in the loop this ensures we create a demand for the endproduct and functionality which in turn will create the demand for our components we have been working with different customers and end users at the same time to validate the need for these types of sensors and products and the data this product provides to the user   ceocfo what have you learned as you have started to work with different people what has changed from your original concept dr motayed definitely a lot has changed since the early days of n one of the cornerstones of lean startup methodology and lean manufacturing is that you develop a minimum viable product with minimum feature sets as fast as one can and with the least cost possible and get it to the customers have them evaluate it and then listen to the feedback and iterate rapidly some of the things we have learned from our customers are things like what kind of packages are needed for the chips for different applications what type of detection capability operational boundaries which are all essential information for success of a product for example when we started this we were thinking of packingin more sensors in one device and the logic was more is better however it turned out that most customers only wanted one or two gas sensors on one single chip insights into the customers� needs and what the market really wants is essential in developing a new product   ceocfo are you funded for your next steps are you seeking partnerships or investment dr motayed we have funding from the us government for our rd projects currently we have several sbir programs from the dept of homeland security and nasa recently we have raised a seed round of investment with blu venture investors leading the round however for the next staging of scaling up and addressing different markets and applications we are looking for strategic partnerships and funding that funding will help us execute the milestones needed for the next stages of growth scalingup of our production and for products that we have in the pipeline   ceocfo why does n sensors standout dr motayed n sensors� mission is to make the world a safer place using our smart sensors we are positioned perfectly to make a big impact into the next generation of iot devices connected devices smart home systems with our patented smart gas sensor technology that will enable the desperatelyneeded missing environmental sensing modality on all of these devices this represents a significant market and business opportunity if you consider billions of connected devices that are going to be manufactured and installed in smart homes smart cars wearables and industrial iot platforms n sensors� technology can be deployed in all of these applications which not only represents a significant return on investment for the investors but also a tremendous growth opportunity for n and the technology to address new and emerging markets worldwide   �at n we leverage smart materials and cuttingedge engineering to bring smart sensors that provides gas detection capability for nextgeneration of smart and connected devices�  dr abhishek
