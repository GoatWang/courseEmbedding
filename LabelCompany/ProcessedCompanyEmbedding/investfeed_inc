startup up and running comes the challenge of finding a reliable market data vendor with many different vendors available with a variety price ranges products and features investfeed started to become frustrated with the process of trying to choose a vendor that would fit their needs and requirements best we were looking for a service provider who would work with us on pricing as its very difficult for a startup to get off the ground says chernesky market data is the biggest expense for any fintech startup so we wanted to make sure that we picked the right vendor chernesky added solution after a

business washington post business page business news bankers ditch fat salaries to chase digital currency riches lulu yilun chen and camila russojul    pm etbloomberg  richard liu gave up a sevenfigure salary this month to get into one of the hottest financial instruments around right now initial coin offerings the former china renaissance dealmaker has since backed a clutch of cryptocoin sales that’ve raised millions  sometimes in seconds  often without a single productfrom hong kong and beijing to london accomplished financiers are abandoning lucrative careers to plunge into the murky world of icos a way to amass quick money by selling digital tokens to investors sans banks or regulators cut out of the action a growing cohort of banking professionals are instead applying their talents toward buying or hawking cryptocurrencythey’re going in with eyes wide open for liu who put together some of china’s biggest tech deals in his old job the chance to shape the nascent arena outweighs the dangers of a market crash or crackdown loosely akin to ipos icos have raised millions from investors hoping to get in early on the next bitcoin or ether and their unchecked growth over the past year is such that they’ve drawn comparisons to the first illfated dotcom boom yet with stratospheric bonuses largely a thing of the past the allure of an incandescent new arena far from financial redtape has proven irresistible to some“traditional investment banks and vcs need to monitor this space closely it could become very big” said the yearold partner at  million hedge fund fbg capital which has backed about  icos he’s off to a quick start getting in on this year’s largest sale tezos a smart contracts platform that raised  million to outstrip the average hong kong ipo size this year of around  million“unlike the traditional financial sector there are no ceilings or barriers there’s so much to imagine” he saidcritics say many icos are built on little more than hyperactive imaginations a cross between crowdfunding and an initial public offering they involve the sale of virtual coins mostly based on the ethereum blockchain similar to the technology that underpins bitcoin but unlike a traditional ipo in which buyers get shares getting behind a startup’s ico nets you virtual tokens  like minicryptocurrencies  unique to the issuing company or its network that means they grow in value only if the startup’s business or network proves viable attracting more people and boosting liquiditythat’s a big if and the sheer profusion of untested concepts has spurred talk of a bubble the us securities and exchange commission signaled greater scrutiny of the redhot sector when it warned on tuesday that icos may be considered securities though it stopped short of suggesting a broader clampdown the regulator however did reaffirm its focus on protecting investors part of the appeal of icos lies in the fact that  for now  anyone with a bold idea can raise money from anybody at least  icos have taken place this year raising more than  billion based on proposals from free wifi sharing to trading software without a single line of code it’s already exceeded earlystage venture capital financing with little more than an explanation of the adlite browser it envisioned brendan eich’s brave software scored  million for its basic attention token sale in under a minute in may“these icos are not selling shares which means their investors will have to count on the promise and reliability of the founders” said beijingbased chandler guo a bitcoin miner and angel investor who’s helped more than  icos list on cryptocurrency exchanges so “i don’t invest in any projects unless i know where they live and their mother lives”justin short who created electronic trading algorithms for bank of america corp before launching tradingrelated startup nous is preparing to launch his own sale of digital tokens to bankroll what he calls cryptoasset portfolio management a former wall street floor trader he likens the advent of icos to an episode half a billion years ago when many of the planet’s life forms came into existence“it’s a cambrian explosion of ideas but that means you have to put in your work to figure out which one is even likely to work” he saidcryptocoins bypass middlemen such as feeabsorbing banks and venture capital firms and offer access to fast money but that also means traditional checks and balances are absent the key may be to recognize which tokens serve an essential purpose to the selling startup’s network and thus will appreciate in value alongside rising adoptionformer hsbc forextrading architect hugh madden currently chief technology officer of hong kongbased anx international this month helped raise about  million for cryptocurrency exchange oax he likens icotoken ownership to a football club membership you don’t get special access but as the team gets better more people become fans and the price goes upwhen a football club “builds more relationships with other clubs gets more matches and generally enjoys wider adoption then more people want to be a part of it” the yearold said “there is no limit to participants but there is a limit to memberships that allow members to exert influence on the future direction of the club”with icos however the true price of membership can be impossible to gauge prominent bitcoin developers including peter todd have pointed to coding flaws in projects trading platform coindash said hackers made off with  million during its ico just this month hackers made off with nearly  million last week stealing ico funds from coindash swarm city æternity and others and a significant number of icos have been underpinned by mere protocols  operational frameworks with standard processes minus a business model“it’s very hard to value a protocol” said gavin yeung a former hong kongbased trader at deutsche bank ag who’s weighing an ico for his cryptocurrency index trading platform cryptomover “the protocol only becomes valuable if the number of users increase exponentially on the network so unless these protocols have substantial users or awareness these projects could end up with zero value”the rush of speculators and getrichquick schemes in the space has both yeung and madden expecting more regulatory scrutiny but the challenge is icos aren’t confined by geography for example oax’s token attracted  backers across a dozen jurisdictions from china to russia and the us “it’s very hard for regulators to have an isolated policy response that’s happening on a global crossborder basis” madden saidinterest in icos remains skyhigh ron chernesky started his career as a trader on wall street  years ago first on a trading floor and then running trading platform investfeed inc he’s now in the process of replacing us equities trading on his platform with digital currency trading and planned to conduct his own ico to raise  ether  worth roughly  million at current prices“we’re completely ditching the model that we’ve been doing for the past three years and now we’re looking at cryptocurrency” the yearold said “this is long term for us we see this as the new gateway to the millennial way of investing and where everything is going from here”perhaps liu the exchina renaissance executive compares the ico market to the first internet boom and bust when startups from webvan to petscom imploded and investors’ money went up in smoke yet it’s in part the opportunity to carve out a niche away from monolithic banking bureaucracy that’s lured him to this space“you want to be on a rocket ship” liu said “if you join early then every day you’re making history”updates with sec warnings in seventh paragraphwith assistance from yuji

prnewswire   investfeed a new york social investing platform now replacing equities with blockchain based assets is commencing their highly anticipated token generation event tge this sunday july  at am utc investfeed will conduct their tge over  days with a significant amount already committed from strategic investors the company founded in  by a pair of highly experienced wall street traders is aiming to be first to market to deliver an incentivized marketplace enabling the sharing of cryptocurrency investing ideas peer to peer insights market analytics crowd sentiment breaking news and integrated asset portfolioorder management contrary to current tge trends investfeed will be imposing a relatively low  ether hard cap for their tge where participants will be issued feed ift tokens immediately   ceo of investfeed ron chernesky said the token generation event is completely disrupting the way we think about capital raising and in so many ways is superior to the vc model we are all used to our team walked away from a  million usd traditional raise so that we could conduct a tge and better incentivize a growing cryptocurrency community while selling enough tokens to build out a revolutionary platform with a beta launching  days of closing the difference between investfeed and the majority of companies conducting tges is that we have imposed a low hard cap or maximum participation amount in the interests of responsibility openness transparency and honesty    investfeeds new platform will allow the cryptocurrency community to engage with likeminded investors and enthusiasts seeking market insights as well as providing startups and ico prospects an invaluable channel from which to gain exposure and drive interest in their projects once the platform is live

but have also altered the way we invest by shazir mucklai angel investorshazirmucklai write a comment credit getty images within the past ten years social networks have revolutionized not only the way we live but have also altered the way we invest these days investment advisors have started to use networks like facebook twitter and linkedin to initiate the buy signal and pull the trigger if you havent started using these networks to invest youre not maximizing your profits back in  the securities and exchange commission started allowing companies to use social media networks to communicate with investors from that point on companies started to release their quarterly reports and major corporate news on to these platforms many of the industrys top bloggers use social media to inform their followers about a stock and its movement social media functions as a way for investors to become aware of a companys news before it becomes stale investfeed is to investors what airbnb is to homes we built the first to market transparent crowdsourced social network which empowers investors to connect multiple brokerages and share their portfolio holdings and performance with the world there is some privacy since the actual dollar amounts are kept hidden this eliminates the need to depend on brokers advisors or roboadvisors and dont need to rely on message boards tv networks or social media platforms for investment ideas where peoples motives may not necessarily be genuine we aim to be the starting point of the stock market for finding reliable ondemand information our growth has been driven by the great value we offer to both professional and casual investors their mission is to give investors access an ondemand way to make investment decisions thats open transparent and crowdsourced in a way that will save retail investors  billion yearly in underperforming funds in the coming months we will develop a knowledge base api that developers can use to create next generation decentralized applications in artificial intelligence that leverages the wisdom of the crowd to beat the markets together the beauty of investfeed is that it provides seemingly endless options for investors to gather a wide breath of opinions and go entirely selfdirected crowdsourcing has been gaining steam for years and with recent developments in artificial intelligence were entering a second generation of crowdsourcing where data is more reliable and useful the crowd is proving to beat wall street estimates through smart crowd decisions in a fully transparent open and efficient environment everyone will now have the ability to contribute their views of each others portfolios in a structured format that will better represent the billion dollar wall street advisory industry between crowdsourced ideas offered for free and various flavors of artificial intelligence coming soon we may be predicting the future if you thought you might have a serious illness would you trust your health to a website or a platform that will provide feedback in seconds from a smart crowd investfeed the new twitter recently a new social network for investing has surfaced investfeed investfeed is changing the way investors make trading decisions and investfeed is revolutionizing the trading industry as a whole the long days are gone of running across the street to buy newspapers calling your broker and flipping on the tv to find uptodate news on companies firms and stocks that system is archaic disorganized and above all its costing time which makes it difficult to collect relevant information in realtime unless you are a professional many hedge funds and premier newsletter services have already started to shift their business over to investfeed at investfeed its all about transparency which in investfeeds opinion is the ability to simply put be honest investfeeds ceo and founder ronald chernesky comments the transparency of an investor or traders motives for example if a member says they are bullishbuying aapl and the position goes against them it will reflect in their overall portfolio on investfeed everyone on investfeed will be able to see this creating a transparent environment where no one can lie or try to deceive others about their actual results social investing got light back in  after the securities and exchange commission allowed companies to start tweeting while following opinions of someone else has a risk attached to it everything decision you take needs to be thoughtfully thought out in addition you always to back the information up with other sources and logical reasoning again transparency is the case the case in the past with social media has been millions of users login to twitter to check the status of a celebrity breakup or to get a chuckle out of a joke but now that social media has crossed the stage of infancy people have started to create an even wider use of it publiclytraded companies have even started to use their investors relations department to spread the information some companies have even started to use social media to launch their products from here on out the sharing of information will only increase and things will only become more transparent the opinions expressed here by inccom columnists are their own not those of inccom published on apr   investfeed inc we created the
