definitive rating assigned b sf reflects exchangeable class reflects interestonly class reflects loan specific class uhaul portfolio  ratings rationale the certificates are collateralized by  fixedrate loans secured by  properties the ratings are based on the collateral and the structure of the transaction moodys cmbs ratings methodology combines both commercial real estate and structured finance analysis based on commercial real estate analysis moodys determines the credit quality of each mortgage loan and calculates an expected loss on a loan specific basis under structured finance the credit enhancement for each certificate typically depends on the expected frequency severity and timing of future losses moodys also considers a range of qualitative issues as well as the transactions structural and legal aspects the credit risk of loans is determined primarily by two factors  moodys assessment of the probability of default which is largely driven by each loans dscr and  moodys assessment of the severity of loss upon a default which is largely driven by each loans ltv ratio the moodys actual dscr of x is higher than the  conduitfusion transaction average of x the moodys stressed dscr of  is inline the  conduitfusion transaction average of x moodys trust ltv ratio of  is higher than the  conduitfusion transaction average of  moodys also considers both loan level diversity and property level diversity when selecting a ratings approach with respect to loan level diversity the pools loan level includes cross collateralized and cross defaulted loans herfindahl index is  the transactions loan level diversity is inline with the herfindahl scores found in most multiborrower transactions issued since  with respect to property level diversity the pools property level herfindahl index is  the transactions property diversity profile is inline with the indices calculated in most multiborrower transactions issued since  moodys also grades properties on a scale of  to  best to worst and considers those grades when assessing the likelihood of debt payment the factors considered include property age quality of construction location market and tenancy the pools weighted average property quality grade is  which is inline with the indices calculated in most multiborrower transactions since  this deal is structured with supersenior aaa classes having  credit enhancement although the additional enhancement offered to the senior most certificate holders provides additional protection against pool loss the supersenior structure is credit negative for the carved out class as certificate which immediately supports the supersenior classes if the support certificate were to take a loss the loss would have the potential to be quite large on a percentage basis relative to moodys idealized aaa sf loss target thin tranches need more subordination to reduce the probability of default in recognition that their lossgiven default is higher given the composition of the subject pool moodys is unable to assign a aaa sf rating for a support certificate having a credit enhancement of  and  certificate thickness  detachment although the severity profile reflected by the certificates thickness is better than moodys idealized target for structured ratings the default profile reflected by the stated credit enhancement is commensurate with a aa sf rating the profile of each loss component in tandem is not strong enough to uplift class as to a aaa sf grade the principal methodology used in this rating was  moodys approach to rating us cmbs conduit transactions published in september  please see the credit policy page on wwwmoodyscom for a copy of this methodology moodys analysis employs the excelbased cmbs conduit model v which derives credit enhancement levels based on an aggregation of adjusted loan level proceeds derived from moodys loan level dscr and ltv ratios major adjustments to determining proceeds include loan structure property type sponsorship and diversity moodys analysis also uses the cmbs io calculator version  which references the following inputs to calculate the proposed io rating based on the published methodology original and current bond ratings and credit estimates original and current bond balances grossed up for losses for all bonds the ios references within the transaction and io type corresponding to an io type as defined in the published methodology moodys parameter sensitivities if moodys value of the collateral used in determining the initial rating were decreased by   and  the modelindicated rating for the currently rated aaa sf super senior class would be aaa aa and aa respectively for the aa sf rated class as would be aa aa and a respectively parameter sensitivities are not intended to measure how the rating of the security might migrate over time rather they are designed to provide a quantitative calculation of how the initial rating might change if key input parameters used in the initial rating process differed the analysis assumes that the deal has not aged parameter sensitivities only reflect the ratings impact of each scenario from a quantitativemodelindicated standpoint qualitative factors are also taken into consideration in the ratings process so the actual ratings that would be assigned in each case could vary from the information presented in the parameter sensitivity analysis these ratings a are based solely on information in the public domain andor information communicated to moodys by the issuer at the date it was prepared and such information has not been independently verified by moodys b must be construed solely as a statement of opinion and not a statement of fact or an offer invitation inducement or recommendation to purchase sell or hold any securities or otherwise act in relation to the issuer or any other entity or in connection with any other matter moodys does not guarantee or

willful misconduct or any other type of liability that by law cannot be excluded on the part of or any contingency beyond the control of moodys or any of its employees or agents including any losses arising from or in connection with the procurement compilation analysis interpretation communication dissemination or delivery of any information or rating relating to the issuer factors that would lead to an upgrade or downgrade of the rating the performance expectations for a given variable indicate moodys forwardlooking view of the likely range of performance over the medium term performance that falls outside the given range may indicate that the collaterals credit quality is stronger or weaker than moodys had previously anticipated factors that may cause an upgrade of the ratings include significant loan paydowns or amortization an increase in the pools share of defeasance or overall improved pool performance factors that may cause a downgrade of the ratings include a decline in the overall performance of the pool loan concentration increased expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans or interest shortfalls regulatory disclosures for further specification of moodys key rating assumptions and sensitivity analysis see the sections methodology assumptions and sensitivity to assumptions of the disclosure form moodys received and took into account one or more thirdparty assessments on the due diligence performed regarding the underlying assets or financial instruments in this transaction and the assessments had a neutral impact on the credit rating further information on the representations and warranties and enforcement mechanisms available to investors are available on httpwwwmoodyscomviewresearchdocaspxdocidpbssf the analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments as a second step moodys estimates expected collateral losses or cash flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement loss allocation and other structural features to derive the expected loss for each rated instrument as the section on loss and cash flow analysis describes moodys quantitative analysis entails an evaluation of scenarios that stress factors contributing to sensitivity of ratings and take into account the likelihood of severe collateral losses or impaired cash flows moodys weights the impact on the rated instruments based on its assumptions of the likelihood of the events in such scenarios occurring for ratings issued on a program series or categoryclass of debt this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation to each rating of a

it below commercial financing if you have never had to deal with commercial real estate financing you may find it intimidating that is certainly the case for most firsttime commercial borrowers commercial real estate mortgages are quite different from their residential cousins in terms of both complexity and cost but getting the facts before you apply for a loan should eliminate any fears about this fantastic business financing technique the basics of commercial real estate financing commercial real estate financing is very similar to residential mortgage lending in that real property is pledged as collateral against a loan to either buy or refinance the property a business may also borrow against the equity in property it owns which like its residential counterpart can take the form of a business line of credit or a lump sum payment for any business purpose commercial real estate mortgages generally require regular payments of principal and interest  commercial mortgage rates can be either fixed or variable  until the loan is paid in full moreover a commercial lender retains a security interest in the property throughout the loan term with the same right to foreclose if the borrower defaults as a residential lender what distinguishes commercial mortgage lending from residential lending are the characteristics of the property and the borrower unlike residential mortgages which are geared toward the individual and  unit residential dwellings commercial property financing is designed for business entities  both for profit and notforprofit  to mortgage nearly any type of retail office industrial multiunit  unit residential or just about any other commercially zoned real property because of these property and borrower characteristics commercial real estate mortgages are viewed as higher risk transactions by the lending industry the limited marketability of commercial property and higher risk of borrower default translates to less generous terms and more conservative underwriting by commercial mortgage lenders than those found in the residential arena if a lender has to take possession of a commercial property through foreclosure it will generally have much more difficulty selling it to recoup its money than it would a house to compensate for the greater risk commercial mortgage rates are substantially higher as are down payment requirements and loan terms are shorter typically a maximum of  years commercial mortgage lenders prefer a solid business borrower but for newer businesses or companies that cannot meet the required financial performance standards a personal guarantee of repayment from one or more of the firms principals may be used to compensate a final important difference between commercial real estate financing and the residential variety is that commercial real estate mortgages are more expensive to process and close not only are they much larger loans on average than residential mortgages but nearly every aspect of the due diligence phase  from valuation to title to underwriting  is more complicated and therefore more costly an illustration the vanilla commercial mortgage loan to help you understand how commercial mortgage lending works in practice here are the major characteristics of a standard vanilla commercial mortgage loan debt coverage ratio commercial real estate financing is based primarily on the income of the property rather than the borrower the lender will want evidence that the property will produce more than enough income to cover the mortgage payments generally commercial mortgage lenders require the property to produce from  to  times the monthly mortgage payment in net rental income for example if the monthly mortgage payment is  the property should be producing  to  after all expenses are paid down payment commercial mortgage loans typically require a borrower to put a minimum of  down a higher down payment may be required for certain properties that carry greater risk newer companies or those without a solid track record of consistent profitability prepayment penalties commercial real estate mortgages normally carry deescalating prepayment penalties that is a fee due to the lender if the loan is paid off within a certain period of time after it is made for example the fee might be  of the outstanding balance during the first year  the second year and so on with no penalty after the fifth year for obvious reasons prepayment penalties are a particularly important consideration for a business that may not wish to  or be able to  own the property long enough to avoid them although these characteristics illustrate a “standard” in commercial real estate mortgages you can find many lenders with flexibility in any of them generally deviating from a standard will entail an offsetting adjustment in others to compensate for the increased risk for example an upfront fee or higher interest rate might reduce or entirely eliminate a prepayment penalty while a personal guarantee from one or more company owners might reduce the required down payment where to go for commercial real estate financing commercial mortgage lending is widely available throughout the us the three most common sources of commercial real estate mortgages are  commercial mortgage backed securities regional banks private equity companies  ie life insurance companies  pension manager  hedge funds specialty finance companies  ie thirdparty conduit and hard money lenders commercial mortgage brokers naturally most business owners turn to banks  particularly ones with whom they have established relationships  for their commercial real estate financing on the one hand banks tend to offer the lowest commercial mortgage rates on the other they are the most rigid in their lending many banks will refuse loans on certain classes of property or exclude companies from specific industries they also require more documentation and may charge higher fees than other commercial mortgage lending sources conduit and hard money lenders can fund commercial mortgage loans with less documentation and more quickly than banks because their money comes from private sources insurance companies and commercial lines of credit they can be much more flexible in their lending you will find that hard money lenders in particular will loan money at lightning speed on virtually any type of property with much less stringent criteria for their borrowers  all at a cost hard money lenders charge significantly higher mortgage rates than banks for larger capital needs companies often turn to private equity companies private equity companies can provide critical commercial real estate financing on the total cost of a project the equity range is the difference between the total cost of the real estate and the amount the senior lender is willing to provide  normally no more than  percent of costs so for a  million project commercial mortgage lenders would typically loan no more than  million leaving  million in the equity range for the borrower to fund if the borrowing entity has  in cash to put into the project it could consider a mezzanine loan or an equity capital investment to come up with the remaining  million private equity companies are quite versatile and they can provide creative flexible financing solutions but they expect a good return on investment so their interest rates are considerably higher than those charged by commercial lenders commercial mortgage brokers dont fund loans directly instead a good broker will conduct a thorough assessment of your needs and research the programs offered by other commercial mortgage lending sources to find you the right mortgage solution with the most competitive rates and fees a good commercial mortgage broker will have established relationships with many different lenders offering a wide variety of lending programs giving you access to financing you might not be able to find on your own as an added benefit commercial mortgage brokers handle the tedious details of loan processing and packaging making an otherwise complex transaction less stressful and saving you much time and energy using just any commercial mortgage broker could cost you either in upfront fees a higher than market interest rate or both a good one though will orchestrate a smooth transaction with an optimal loan suited to your companys specific needs at a competitive rate with so many choices it is important that you shop around but the goal of your shopping should not be just to get the best rate as is the case in residential mortgages commercial mortgage rates and terms will vary from one lending source to the next but with such a big financial commitment at stake unless you have expertise in commercial real estate financing you need a trusted advisor to both help you understand and to guide you through the complex process that defines a commercial mortgage loan regardless of the source you ultimately use a little preparation before you begin your search for commercial real estate financing will go a long way towards reducing stress and assuring a good outcome preparation the key to a smooth commercial mortgage lending process when you are ready to begin your search for a commercial mortgage lender some advance preparation will serve you well the complex nature of commercial real estate financing means you cannot expect to rate shop multiple lenders with a few minutes on the telephone  at least not with any reliability any prospective lender you contact should ask you for the following information which is needed to give you an informed accurate decision about your companys ability to borrow and the approximate rates and terms you can expect  yeartodate profit  loss statement and balance sheet  three years business income tax returns  projected cash flow for the next  months  personal financial statement and resume for the principal property information  written business plan having these items available will not only make your task easier it will make it more likely you receive both an accurate quote and solid feedback on your loan request be wary of any prospective lender who will quote rates and terms without the required information you could be in for nasty surprises later commercial real estate financing is another of the business financing power tools available to your company unlike other types of credit for business which typically have less attractive terms and a relatively short repayment period commercial mortgage loans offer an excellent means to acquire property and manage risk with longterm asset based financing at attractive interest rates and with favorable tax treatment copyright   veteransbillrapponlinecom bill rapp terms
