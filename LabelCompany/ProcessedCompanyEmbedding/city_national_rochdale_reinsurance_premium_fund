read later copypaste link by artemis on may   in its first two years of operation the city national rochdale select strategies fund which has been launched as a us ’s act mutual insurance and reinsurance linked securities fund by a subsidiary of the royal bank of canada will target raising ils assets under management of  million in its first two years of operations the city national rochdale select strategies fund was registered with the sec earlier this year targeting a largely industry loss warranty ilw driven reinsurance linked investment strategy it had initially been registered as the city national rochdale reinsurance premium fund but was renamed the investment manager behind the fund is city national rochdale llc an indirect subsidiary of the royal bank of canada and we understand that the initial capital raising is now underway as we wrote previously the mutual fund is structured in an interval style and expects to invest a significant proportion of its assets in cartesian’s iris re vehicle hence the ilw focus so this is more of a partnership between royal bank of canada owned investment manager city national rochdale and experienced ils and reinsurance investment manager cartesian iris in its latest filing the investment manager reveals that the city national rochdale select strategies fund will have a target raising a maximum  million of assets under management for its first two years of operation this will be to prevent it raising more assets than it can match with attractive reinsurance linked investment opportunities and with the majority of the investments set to flow into cartesian’s reinsurer with now  of the fund’s assets expected to be invested in special purpose entities of the iris reinsurance ltd it means the matching of capital to risks can be more tightly controlled between city national rochdale and cartesian in total ilw’s are expected to make up around  or more of the fund’s allocation which given the limited size of the ilw market means that raising too much capital could be problematic as well given available opportunities may not match asset inflows hence capping the target for the fund’s assets under management at  million for the first two years is prudent further details on how the rochdale ils fund will interface with cartesian’s iris re have also been revealed iris re is expected to create at least thirteen new special purpose entities akin to segregated accounts which will be ringfenced pools of risk for the city national rochdale ils fund to invest in each of the special purpose entities generated by iris re will enter into ilw contracts with different risk profiles so providing a pillared approach to diversification for example florida wind all natural perils europe us wind japan earthquake etc this will provide geographic and risk diversification while other entities may only focus on contracts that trigger above a specific industry loss eg florida wind bn etc the city national rochdale select strategies fund will invest in equity linked notes of the iris re special purpose entities while another class of quota share notes may also be available for other hedge funds to invest which could be cartesian’s own strategies we’d expect for ils and reinsurance investment manager cartesian re the tieup with city national rochdale will offer it a way to bring additional assets into its strategies from mutual fund investors enabling it to write more risks while benefitting from fee income through the mutual fund city national rochdale benefits by working with a recognised ilw expert manager which also provides it with a differentiated mutual ils fund strategy as the only one currently available to predominantly focus on ilw derivative contracts rather than more broadly investing in collateralized reinsurance as the other available mutual funds do join artemis in singapore on july th  for ils asia tickets on sale here print pdfshare this

reinsurance fund renamed will invest in iris re share   read later copypaste link by artemis on february   city national rochdale llc’s insurancelinked securities ils and reinsurance linked investment mutual fund is set for launch by the investment advisor the city national rochdale select strategies fund expects to invest a significant proportion of its assets in cartesian’s iris re vehicle city national rochdale llc is a wholly owned subsidiary of city national bank which is in turn a wholly owned subsidiary of an entity named rbc usa holdco corporation which is a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of royal bank of canada the investment advisor filed a prospectus for an ils and reinsurance interval mutual fund last december the city national rochdale reinsurance premium fund but yesterday filed a registration statement with the sec for this differently named ’s act mutual ils fund it turns out that this is the same mutual fund strategy which has been renamed by rochdale to the city national rochdale select strategies fund but will continue to seek out returns from the reinsurance and insurancelinked securities ils market for its investors the newly renamed fund is still an interval fund so will offer liquidity opportunities to investors at intervals in order to control inflows and outflows from investors the city national rochdale select strategies fund will invest in “particular types of reinsurance investments providing exposure to the insurance risk of natural catastrophes such as hurricanes and earthquakes” the registration statement says the fund will invest “significantly” in structured reinsurance investments “such as equitylinked notes and preferred shares issued by insurance company segregated accounts or special purpose vehicles whose return is tied to underlying industry loss warranties andor catastrophe bonds” it explains under normal investment conditions instruments exposed to ilw’s are anticipated to make up around  or more of the fund’s allocation with equitylinked notes the major vehicle for gaining access to these instruments this is interesting as ilw’s are typically accessed directly but the city national rochdale fund is set to target them via another vehicle it seems the prospectus says “the fund expects to have indirect exposure exceeding  of the fund’s assets to ilws andor catastrophe bonds underwritten by iris reinsurance ltd” iris reinsurance ltd iris re launched in  was sponsored by global private equity investment firm cartesian capital group llc and is an affiliate of and managed by cartesian’s insurancelinked securities ils investment unit cartesian re iris re is a class  bermudian reinsurance vehicle which predominantly offers its collateralised reinsurance capacity in industry loss warranty ilw form although based on both index and parametric triggers so by investing in the equitylinked notes of iris re the city national rochdale mutual fund will achieve its goal of accessing the ilw market also of note is the fact that iris re issued a new class of nonvoting redeemable preferred shares and listed them on the bermuda stock exchange bsx back in april  the manager also said that it would report its modelled net asset value on a regular basis in november last year both of those facts may play into the emergence of this new fund as through a new share class with transparency in terms of reporting a mutual fund could invest in iris re and benefit from the exposure to its ilw portfolio while cartesian re can benefit from a new source of capital via mutual fund investors and the registered investment advisor marketplace the fund which will be offered to investors through registered investment advisors is going to have a cap on its assets under management for the first two years of  million which again is interesting but is perhaps something to do with the strategy of seeking to access the ilw market which has limited supply of course largely via cartesian’s iris re it does seem likely that cartesian capital and cartesian re are aligned with the launch of city national rochdale’s first ils fund with a type of mutually beneficial partnership arrangement behind the scenes although we should stress that we cannot confirm that at this time it’s just an assumption the city national rochdale select strategies fund’s portfolio managers are named as garrett r d’alessandro president chief executive officer and interim chief investment officer of city national rochdale and thomas h ehrlein a member of the investment advisors asset allocation committee and portfolio manager of its highyield alternatives fund so it would seem plausible that some of the moves made by cartesian re to list equity in its ilw focused reinsurance vehicle iris re and report the nav via the equity listing could help this rochdale mutual reinsurance fund access that market while bringing a new source of capital from the mutual fund investment arena to cartesian re’ ils strategies whether by design or happy coincidence the city national rochdale select strategies fund will bring new investors into iris re’s ilw strategies which will be a benefit for the manager for city national rochdale this strategy will offer it a way to bring a diversified catastrophe reinsurance focused investment strategy to its investorbase as well it will be fascinating to watch the fund build out as being a mutual it will be regularly reported via the sec print pdfshare this pageemaillinkedintwitterfacebookgoogle tagged as cartesian iris city national
