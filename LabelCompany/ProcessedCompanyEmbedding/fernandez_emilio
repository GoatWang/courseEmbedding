 connect with oup overview description table of contents author information emilio fernández pictures in the margins dolores tierney published by manchester university press spanish and latin american filmmakers mup the first english language study of this giant of world cinema explores the construction of fernández as both a national and nationalist auteur challenges auteurist readings of his films in order to make new arguments about the significance of fernández and his work examines the significance of fernándezs marginalization as a mixed race part white and part indigenous director emilio fernández pictures in the margins dolores tierney published by manchester university press spanish and latin american filmmakers mup description emilio fernández pictures in the margins is the first booklength english language account of emilio fernández  the most successful director of classical mexican cinema famed with creating films that embody a loosely defined mexican school of filmmaking however rather than offer an auteurist study this book interrogates the construction of fernández as both a national and nationalist auteur including racial and gender aspects eg as macho mexicano and indio it also challenges auteurist readings of the films themselves in order to make new arguments about the significance of fernández and his work the aim of this book is to question mexicos fetishisation of its own position on the peripheries of the global cultural economy and the similar fetishisation of fernándezs marginalisation as a mixed race part white and part indigenous director this book argues that as pictures in the margins classical mexican cinema and specifically fernándezs films are not transparent reflections of dominant post revolutionary mexican culture but annotations and reinscriptions of the particularities of mexican society in the postrevolutionary era show more emilio fernández pictures in the margins dolores tierney published by manchester

election huerta became minister of finance in the new governmenthuerta considered himself the natural successor to president obregón just as obregón had considered himself carranzas natural successor the murdered villa was seen as an ally of huerta who had publicly announced his candidacy for the presidency obregón however planned to remain in power by handpicking his successor a tradition that lasted throughout thcentury mexican politics when he named his anticlerical minister of the interior the former gen calles as his heir huerta rose up in a rebellion that eventually affected half of the mexican army like huerta a native of sonora and a former general in the mexican army calles had preceded him as governor and military ruler of their home state from  huerta thought his service and loyalty to obregón should have brought him the presidency but mexican presidents not allowed to succeed themselves and limited mostly to one term tried to extend their power by naming political puppets as successors calles would outdo obregón by controlling the mexican presidency outright or through puppets from  to the rebellion was a series threat to obregon but he was able to quash it by using loyal army units battalions of workers and farmers and intervention by the us by the time ended in march   generals and  soldiers were gone either killed in battle executed exiled or dismissed obregón banished huerta to exile in the us where he lived in los angeles supporting himself as a music teacher this was the cauldron of violence and nationalism in which the young fernandez came into his manhood he received a year prison sentence for his participation in the rebellion on the losing side escaping prison by following huerta into exile in los angeles fernández absorbed the rudiments of filmmaking as a bit player and extra working in hollywood in the s and early s with the election of lázaro cárdenas as president in  the huertista rebels were granted an amnesty huerta himself was recalled from exile by cárdenas in  and served in several posts including inspector general of foreign consulates and director general of civil pensions fernández returned to mexico in  and began working in the mexican movie industry as a screenwriter and actor his indian looks which gave him his nickname el indio also brought him his first lead role playing an indian in janitzio  due to his imposing physical presence and indian countenance el indio was cast as bandits charros cowboys and revolutionariesthe cárdenas government of  established the framework in which the golden age of mexican cinema could be realized the political system that dominated mexico for over half a century was consolidated during his regime the government incorporated trade unions campesino peasant organizations and middleclass professionals and office workers into the ruling party of the mexican revolution later the party of the institutional revolution or pri cárdenas oversaw the redistribution of millions of acres of land to peasants and the expansion of collective bargaining rights and wage increases to workerscárdenas and all subsequent prmpri presidents all presidents of mexico in the th century beginning with calles were prmpri members vicente fox was the first from outside the party in threequarters of a century maintained political control of mexico by granting favors and concessions to their constituencies inside the corporatist party structure in exchange for worker and campesino organizations delivering votes and suppressing discontent among their constituencies the prmpri itself created an organizational structure for the government that allowed citizens access to the political realm in the sense that they could interface with government agencies once inside the government machine seeking redress favors etc the nonconnected citizen was led through a maze of layers of bureaucracy that never permitted a satisfactory result citizens caught in the maze were eventually frustrated and discouraged but the ingenious if disingenuous system worked as it gave them inputjust no guaranteed output by frustrating them within an institutional structure the prmpri governmentsboth federal and statetook the fight out of them the prmpri sought to control frustration that had led to violence in the past particularly among the generals who had the power to destabilize the society and economy that government structure thus served as a homeostatic device for the peoples frustration relieving it and never allowing it to build up again into a revolutionary situationcárdenas most notable achievement arguably was the nationalization of mexicos oil industry after unsuccessfully trying to negotiate better terms with mexican eagle the holding company owned by royal dutchshell and standard oil of new jersey cárdenas nationalized mexicos petroleum reserves and expropriated the equipment of the foreign oil companies on march   a spontaneous sixhour parade broke out in mexico city to celebrate the event unlike fidel castros nationalization of foreign assets in cuba shell and sonj were compensated for their expropriated assets petróleos mexicanos pemex and the mexican model became a beacon for other oilproducing nations seeking to gain control over their own energy resources from foreign companies lázaro cárdenas was the only prmpri president who did not make himself rich after retiring as minister of defense in  the post he took after relinquishing the presidency he assumed a modest lifestyle he spent the last years of his life supervising irrigation projects and promoting education and free medical care for the poor this was the man who set the tone of the modern mexico that arose from the revolution and civil wars of the s who cleared the ground for the great economic boom of the s in which the golden age of mexican cinema reached its apogee the classic mexican cinema has mostly been ignored in the us due to the language barrier and a colonialist mindset suffused with racism when the mexican cinema has been addressed by those north of the border primary the focus fell on the brilliant cinematography of gabriel figueroa who shot films for john ford and john huston or on former hollywood star dolores del rio fernándezs reputation was so great that he even was appreciated in the us in his lifetime but his notoriety as a sort of wildman of the mexican movie industry and his appearance as an actor in sam peckinpahs the wild bunch  overshadowed his greatness as a director while mexico has often served as a locale for american filmsthe genres of sweet white young things imperiled by mexican bandits and of americans in revolutionary mexico to say nothing of zorro and the cisco kidhave been part of the yankee cinema since the east coastbased film companies began relocating to southern california in the early s gringo warner baxter won the second oscar ever awarded for best actor playing the cisco kid in a role originally intended for raoul walsh of all people mexico has been the site of such blockbuster films as viva villa  juarez  viva zapata  vera cruz  the professionals  and the wild bunch but except for they believed he was no saint  a johnnycomelately to the genre they seldom featured mexican actors in anything other than bit parts if at all with the exception of anthony quinn one of the few mexicanamericans to achieve superstar status mexican performers taken up by the hollywood industry such as ramon novarro rita hayworth john gavin and raquel welch were like halfmexican baseball great ted williams born in san diego deethnicized in a sort of cultural ethnic cleansing salma hayek who is of mixed mexican and lebanese parentage is arguably the first mexican since lupe velez and dolores del rio to cross over as a hollywood superstar and remain identifiably mexican even at the dawn of a new millennium she was urged by her hollywood agents to play up her arabic ethnicity even with antiarab feeling rife in hollywood and the us at largetheir reasoning was that no one would go see a mexican in movies since their cleaning ladies were mexicanuntil the s with como agua para chocolate  like water for chocolate mexican films themselves seldom strayed into yankee consciousness except for the rare one like the pearl  based on a novel by californian john steinbeck and a prizewinner at the venice film festival la perla was directed by fernandez the greatest director to come out of mexicos golden age of cinema the first mexican feature was released in  though production often was eclipsed by political and economic conditions there were documentaries made about the mexican revolution in the s but very few films were made in the s sergei m eisensteins trip to mexico in the early s to make que viva mexico  which remained unfinished due to his problems with his american backer upton sinclair injected a new enthusiasm into the mexican movie industrywhile most american film historians place the golden age firmly in the ssome specifically assigning it to the period  and others extending it until the midsthe golden age of mexican cinema properly stretches back to  peaks in the mids when the mexican cinema receives international recognition when two of fernandezs films won the grand prix at the cannes film festival and was nominated for the golden lion at the venice film festivals and terminates in the mids with the end of fernandezs film collaboration with cinematographer gabriel figueroa mateos fernando de fuentes the mexican movie industrys first great director inaugurated the golden age in  with two hits out on the big ranch  out at big ranch and lets go with pancho villa  lets go with pancho villa both were political message movies addressing the social and cultural issues lying at the heart of mexican revolution vamonos con pancho villa has the distinction of being the first feature produced at the mexican governmentsubsidized studio cinematográfica latino americana sa while allá en el rancho grande made tito guízar a star guizar eventually became the mexican movie industrys first superstar by playing in the comedias rancheras ranch comedies genre that were the most popular type of film in mexico in the s a hit with audiences throughout latin america comedias rancheras were set in an idyllic prerevolutionary mexico the vaudevillian mario moreno who became a latinamerican superstar under the name cantinflas made his shortsubject debut in  and would soon become the latinamerican film industrys leading comedian when he made his featurefilm debut in youre missing the point  there is the detail the cantinflas character is rooted in the image of the pelado or poor white trash and his character deflates respectable society through his sharp repartee peace ie a lack of overt domestic political turmoil laid the groundwork for the development of a truly popular indigenous cinema in the s and s the comedias rancheras and cantinflas comedies helped make the mexican cinema commercially viable with hollywood distracted by turning out propaganda and military training films during world war ii there was an opening in latin america that the mexican industry filled without competition from hollywood the mexican movie industry dominated latinamerican cinemas for most of the decade movie production tripled in the s compared to the previous decade the mexican film industry underwent a consolidation and developed a star system some of whom crossed over to achieve international recognition the peak of the golden age of mexican cinema came in the s spurred by rapid industrialization and a resulting affluence inequitably distributed caused by trade with the us as world war ii boosted american demand for mexican raw materials the mexican movie industry became the worlds largest producer of spanishlanguage films helped by the fact that the other large producers argentina and spain were headed by fascist governments though the mexican government was conservative and repressive in the s it encouraged the production of nationalist films during that helped articulate a mexican identity during the s mexican movie stars and directors became popular icons and some even became public figures with effective political influence among the movie stars blossoming during the decade were dolores del río pedro infante jorge negrete joaquín pardavé and maría félix while fernández and figueroa became globally known luis buñuel moved to mexico and would direct some of the countrys major movies in the following decademexican movies typically were genre pictures melodramas romances musicals comedies and horror which addressed all aspects of mexican society from love stories about the lumpen proletariat to dramas about the indians mexican movies are a mirror of mexican society including history thcentury dictator porfirio díaz and his court the revolution and villa and emiliano zapata obsessions both familial and erotic and mythology indian and bigcity culture mexican cinema did this using the classic genres of the the melodrama the comedy in its romantic musical and ranchera versions and slapstick and farce and even the horror film with its proximity to hollywood and the fact that many leading lights of the mexican cinema were familiar with hollywood production values the indigenous movie industry set a high standard for itself as it had to measure up to hollywood productfernández made his motion picture debut as an actor in chano uruetas el destino  but his early work in movies was in american westerns churned out by monogram director john p mccarthy including the bob steele programmers the oklahoma cyclone  the land of missing men  headin north  sunrise trail  and the tim mccoy hoss opera the western code  after playing a supporting player in enrico caruso jrs la buenaventura  he made his return to mexican pictures in  starring in heart of a bandit  and director fernando de fuentes cruz diablo fernándezs first film as a director was la isla de la pasión  in  which he also wrote and in which he played a bit part the movie starred pedro armendáriz who fernandez would cast in many of his films another favorite collaborator was his wife columba domínguez el indio rapidly gained a reputation as mexicos premier director making populist dramas his film maría candelaria xochimilco  put mexican film on the map when it won the grand prize at the cannes film festival in  the film has been variously praised as the highest triumph of mexican plastic arts on celluloid and as a titanic promise for strictly patriotic mexican cinema french film critic georges sadoul in his  book histoire général du cinema praised the film for its authentic portrayal of rural mexican life and for addressing race relationsthe film remains controversial in mexico over el indios aesthetic choices which emphasized the exotic and primitive and his representation of mexican indians which some critics believed was inauthentic or touristy the nationalistic fernández wanted to articulate an idea of what it meant to be mexican that was uniquely mexican and not influenced by hollywood whose films he felt were americanizing mexican cinema audiences terming his films autos sacramentales passion plays of mexicanidad director fernández wanted to create a mexican cinema that mexicanized mexicans the film stars dolores del rio the hollywood movie star who had returned to mexico after becoming disillusioned with the american movie industry as the daughter of a prostitute trying to survive just before the revolution set in the floating gardens of xochimilco in mexico city del rios character is shunned by the locals who are indigenous people her great desire is to marry her lover played by pedro armendáriz but their romance proves to be starcrossed fernándezs direction was flawless and figueroas blackandwhite cinematography was masterful the collaborators created one of the classics of not just mexican movies but of world cinema when el indio and figueroa were making maría candelaria they were part of a movement in which mexican filmmakers were consciously attempting to create an indigenous art cinema that could compete with hollywood product while simultaneously articulating a vision of mexicans that was rooted in the indigenismo and mestizophilia of mexican intellectuals josé vasconcelos the minister of education during the obregón administration was particularly influential due to his concepts of mexicanos en potencia and the cosmic race in vasconcelos philosophy the barbarous indian was redeemed by a modernization program based on education and by the assimilation of the indians with the caucausian europeans into la raza of mestizos mestizaje gabriel figueroa was conscious of the fact that he and fernández a creative team that became known as epoca de oro invented an idea of rural mexico that did not actually exist figueroa established himself as the leader in imagining a new postrevolutionary mexican consciousness though the vehicle of the visual image a painter in light figueroa learned his craft from gregg toland and edward tisse eisensteins cinematographer figueroa is credited with creating the classic mexican film aesthetic in collaboration with el indio and other film directors in over  movies he developed the classic imagery and aesthetic of mexican cinema which also influenced and was influenced by contemporary mexican artists figueroa pioneered an indigenous visual vernacular that affected the muralist movement and he has been referred to as the fourth of the most important mexican muralist after orozco diego rivera and david siqueiros siqueiros himself called figueroas cinematography murals that travelin their  films together between  and  el indio and figueroa created the idea of mexicanidad cinema while elevating the mestizaje mixed race identity as well as the status of the precolumbian culture the epic visual style they developed was indebted to eisensteins unfinished que viva mexico their style fetishized the mexican landscape through beautiful carefully composed stationary long shots for two decades mexican art cinema was identified with the films resulting from the fernándezfigueroa collaboration their films not only affected mexican audiences collective identity but they affected how their audiences both domestic and global viewed mexico and its historythe climax of maría candelaria was an homage to carlos navarros classic indigenista movie janitzio  the movie is evocative of the anticlerical struggles engendered by the revolution the secularization of the mexican state was begun with the  revolution continued with the  constitution and reached a violent apotheosis in the cristero rebellion of  when the president tried to crack down on the roman catholic church however the anticlericalism of the revolutionaries had to coexist with the cult of our lady of guadalupe the symbol that has proved the most powerful and enduring in creating a mexican national consciousness our lady has served as a symbol for political struggles from the thcentury wars of independence to the cristero wars on one level maría candelaria is a paean to the cult of the virgin mary a phenomenon which is present in much of the classical mexican cinema which likely is one of the reasons the films fernández and figueroa and others of the s and s proved so popular all over latin americain  fernández filmed an adaptation of john steinbecks novella the pearl in spanish and englishlanguage versions shot by figueroa and starring el indios favorite actor pedro armendariz la perla won el indio a nomination for golden lion at the venice film festival further solidifying fernandezs notoriety as a director and publicizing the mexican movie industry the film also won him the golden ariel for best picture at the  ariel awards the mexican equivalent of the oscars and fernández figueroa armendáriz and juan garcía won silver ariels for best direction cinematography actor and supporting actor respectively figueroa won a golden globe for best cinematography in  from the hollywood foreign press associationin  salón méxico  was released written and directed by fernández with cinematography by figueroa an urban melodrama the film was groundbreaking in that it helped usher in a new genre the cabaretera cabaret film racier and just as commercial as the familiar genre of rancheras which was then fading in popularity the movie recreates the atmosphere of the famous mexico city dance hall and won marga lópez an ariel award mexicos equivalent of the oscar for her role as the taxi dancer mercedes the movie featured a sensual soundtrack performed by the afrocuban music group son clave de oro by the end of the s emilio fernández was the most famous and prestigious director in all of latin america he would continue his reign as mexicos premier director into the mids when his powers began to decline and spanish émigré luis buñuel took over the title as the most famous directors and biggest stars aged or died mexican cinema began to decline commercially and the golden age of mexican cinema came to an end ironically buñuels mexican oeuvre strengthened as the national cinema went into decline and lage dor went into eclipsealthough fernández and figueroa last worked together in una cita de amor  which starred el indios halfbrother jaime fernández the collaboration was essentially over by the mids when they made la rosa blanca  and la tierra del fuego se apaga  their last great film together was la rebelión de los colgados  based on b travens rebellion of the hanged its englishlanguage title

passion winner of the international prize at the  cannes film festival la fièvre monte à el pao  the young one  which won a special mention at the  cannes film festival the exterminating angel  the exterminating angel and simón del desierto  simon of the desert of the golden age output new york times movie critic ao scott said there is a frankness in these films that would never have passed muster with the hays office the golden age had peaked in the s bolstered by the economic boom caused by the world war ii alliance with the us government support for the industry via statefunded studios the maturation of a star system and the rationalization of distribution and exhibition aside from buñuels pictures the postgolden age era saw indigenous cinema suffer through the s as the industry became more dependent on formulaic pictures and such popular genres as the santo the wrestler series during the s and s many cult horror and action movies were produced with professional wrestler el santo and hugo stiglitz being the biggest stars however the moribund s led to a revival of government support for the industry in the s which established the base for a revival of mexican art cinema in the s and s el indio continued directing films until  but when his collaboration with figueroa ended in  his reputation suffered as the artistry of his pictures declined he began acting more though he directed a picture every few years gradually the notoriety of his life began overtaking his reputation as a filmmaker el indio lived out the fantasy of perhaps every director when he shot a critic who had dissed one of his movies in the testicles a violent man he shot and killed a farm laborer which he claimed was in selfdefense convicted of manslaughter in  he served six months of a year sentence by the s fernandezs offscreen reputation as a violent man had led to his typecasting as brutal villains in many mexican and american films as an actor emiliano fernandez appeared
