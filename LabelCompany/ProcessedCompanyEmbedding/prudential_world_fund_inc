performance at a glance the prudential world fund  international stock series performed in line with its peers over the  months ended october   its strategy of focusing on companies whose earnings prospects are underappreciated by most investors helped the series in rising markets however in the summer months many investors reacted strongly to the possibility of a global recession stocks that already had been out of favor fell further than most other stocks in the rapidly dropping markets overall we had a modest gain in a difficult year cumulative total returns as of  download table one

dates class a b and c  class z   lipper average returns are for all funds in each share class for the one and fiveyear periods in the international fund category lipper since inception returns are  for class a b and c and  for class z based on all funds in each share class how investments compared as of  graph source lipper inc financial markets change so a mutual funds past performance should never be used to predict future results the risks to each of the investments listed above are different  we provide month total returns for several lipper mutual fund categories to show you that reaching for higher returns means tolerating more risk the greater the risk the larger the potential reward or loss in addition weve included historical year average annual returns these returns assume the reinvestment of dividends us growth funds will fluctuate a great deal investors have received higher historical total returns from stocks than from most other investments smaller capitalization stocks offer greater potential for longterm growth but may be more volatile than larger capitalization stocks general bond funds provide more income than stock funds which can help smooth out their total returns year by year but their prices still fluctuate sometimes significantly and their returns have been historically lower than those of stock funds general municipal debt funds invest in bonds issued by state governments state agencies andor municipalities this investment provides income that is usually exempt from federal and state income taxes us taxable money funds attempt to preserve a constant share value they dont fluctuate much in price but historically their returns have been generally among the lowest of the major investment categories pexrd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�rd peter f spano fund manager portfolio managers report the prudential world fund  international stock series invests primarily in equity securities of companies located outside the united states mercator uses a value investment style to identify stocks selling at low prices compared with their earnings potential to attain our primary goal of long term growth of capital there are special risks associated with foreign investments including political economic and social risks and potential illiquidity there can be no assurance that the series will achieve its investment objective value and patience we are value investors and buy stocks that we believe to be undervalued and hold them unless there is an unexpected deterioration until their strengths are recognized and the stock price moves up significantly value managers have to be very patient when investors panic as they did last summer they sometimes abandon the stocks of companies whose sources of earnings growth are not obvious we project the earnings of companies five years ahead and buy when they are bargains strategy session   our basic strategy does not change we search the foreign markets for companies that are selling below what we consider fair value and build our portfolio stock by stock in a favorable market we may see a stock rise to our price target quickly in todays unfavorable climate for value stocks many stocks we had bought inexpensively remained bargainpriced so our portfolio turnover was unusually low  less than  for the year because of the uncertain markets we allowed our average cash balance to rise higher than usual we believe analysts still havent fully appreciated the impact of asian events on europe we bought rio tinto a ukbased company with global metals mining operations the asian economic depression and potential slowdown in europe and north america have sharply reduced investor interest in the stocks of companies whose business is closely tied to the economic cycle a time honored value strategy is to buy economically sensitive stocks when they are cheap and take our gains when they are expensive in this economic cycle inventories appear low yet most commodity industries have refrained from building capacity these companies should do well when demand recovers but we have to be patient until then a similar theme underlies our purchase of saga petroleum a norwaybased oil production company the lowest oil prices in  years have led its price to fall to very low levels we added sony and matsushita electric to our small holdings in japan these are global companies that were inexpensive because of the poor state of japans economy and stock market portfolio composition sectors expressed as a percentage of net assets as of  graph pexth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th what went well  although we build our portfolio from the bottom up sometimes we see a theme recur a year ago we were reporting gains on banca fideuram an italian bank that had strong earnings on mutual funds and insurance sales the stock rose beyond our estimate of fair value so we took our profits and reinvested the proceeds in an undervalued bank with a similar story banca popolare di brescia it has excellent management and rapid growth of financial services products as it does a very good job of gathering assets through mutual fund sales we took a small part of our profits as the stock price rose sharply but held most of our shares because we think they do not yet reflect the full earnings growth potential of this bank bouygues on the other hand is a french conglomerate that we thought was undervalued and would benefit from a restructuring we bought it at a large discount to our estimate of the value of the underlying assets as our reporting period came to a close and afterward purchasers of large blocks of shares appeared as potential catalysts to the restructuring we benefited from a rise in the stock but are holding it as the share price rises toward a realistic value of bouygues components british telecom was our largest holding on october  recently the telecommunications industry has been a major source of global economic growth and it is relatively buffered from the economic cycle british telecom had been less than efficient but it reorganized and now can be a strong competitor and not so well  our value strategy leads us to hold many cyclical stocks  those whose prospects vary with the pace of economic growth as asian economies contracted threatening global growth many of our economically sensitive stocks suffered in particular some of our australian companies  such as csr limited and pioneer international  and alcan aluminum in canada did poorly as resource and metals businesses were hurt our peugeot shares suffered from the economic slowdown as concerns of a softening in consumer spending mounted the threat of a slowdown also hurt stork a capital equipment manufacturer in the netherlands the stock fell substantially through the spring and summer but has rebounded somewhat since then parmalat the italian food company changed its corporate strategy going into more mature markets and making a large number of acquisitions we no longer had confidence in our earnings projections and sold our shares at a small profit five largest holdings  british telecom plc telecommunications  bouygues construction  housing  banca popolare di brescia commercial banking  iberdrola sa electrical  gas utilities  pharmacia  upjohn health  personal care expressed as a percentage of net assets as of  looking ahead  mercator expects choppy times to continue for a while the earnings expectations of most securities analysts are too high to fit economists expectations of world economic growth so we think there will be more earnings forecasts adjusted downward value stocks may be under pressure a little longer the companies we own however are strong enough to weather a slowdown and they currently are very inexpensive when compared with our estimates of their longterm earnings the best stock values may soon be in asia but asian economies are so unstable that we dont feel confident of earnings projections there are signs that some asian countries are stabilizing over the coming year we should get a clearer view  pexth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th cautious optimism   portfolio manager peter spano is in for the long term q all of your  largest holdings are in europe shouldnt you be more diversified internationally a lets start with how we build our portfolio using our global network of independent analysts we project earnings of companies five years ahead we compare these estimates with the current share price then we build our portfolio stock by stock with the least expensive shares we ensure diversification with guidelines for maximum exposure in any one country or industry but dont have any minimum requirements if a country or industry offers no value opportunities we wont buy there nonetheless we generally are in  to  different countries we were in  on october  and rarely have more than  of our assets in any one industry on october  about twothirds of our assets were in european countries our largest country investment was  in the united kingdom but the uk makes up  of the worlds nonus developed markets as measured by morgan stanley capital internationals eafe index our secondlargest focus was  in switzerland compared with its eight percent of the eafe index we think the global economic situation still is uncertain over the next year european countries have the most secure growth outside the united states so we own perhaps more in europe than we usually would even there however we expect competition from lowcost asian producers will change the nearterm playing field some european companies will not be able to control their destiny the way they have in the past we have to watch the situation on a companybycompany basis q you had very little invested in japan which is a large part of the worlds economy why a the key is earnings visibility we have to have confidence in our longterm earnings projections for a company the companies we own in japan  hitachi matsushita electric and sony  have worldwide businesses and we do not expect them to require dramatic restructuring to meet global productivity standards japanese industry must undergo a structural transformation after which the companies may be much stronger we are not yet in a position to see how that process will play out companies that depend on the japanese domestic market will have uncertain futures until consumers feel more confident in the economy q are we heading for a global recession a we dont think so but it is a possibility that we must consider as global growth clearly is slowing we are cautious investors and there is more of a real threat to the global economy than there has been in a very long time that said most economists are not predicting a recession in the united states or europe we believe the most likely outcome is lower growth followed by a recovery and we will be buying firms that will be wellpositioned for the future it is a time for cautious optimism  pexth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th presidents letter december     photo dear shareholder as  draws to a close the news from the financial markets is decidedly mixed after a series of sharp selloffs in late summer some stock prices began to rebound in early fall helped by three interest rate cuts by the federal reserve there was other good news us treasuries and western european bonds appreciated during the year as investors fled troubled asian markets and other emerging markets the us economy remained strong with steady growth and low inflation the periods of uncertainty we experienced in  illustrate why it is important to manage your expectations and diversify your portfolio keep a good perspective experienced mutual fund investors understand that financial markets will always rise and fall  thats what markets do although past performance may not be indicative of future results stocks and bonds have over time consistently produced attractive returns that have kept ahead of inflation in fact investors who remained focused on the long term and did not sell during summers volatility were rewarded stock prices as measured by the standard  poors  index recovered strongly in november regaining lost ground and even setting a new record high diversify diversify diversify because asset classes seldom move in lockstep owning a mix of stock bond and money market mutual funds can help lessen the effects of a market downturn over time in fact a welldiversified portfolio may retain or perhaps even gain value during times of uncertainty were here to help how diversified is your portfolio your prudential professional will be glad to review your current allocations he or she will recommend adjustments based upon your goals market conditions risk tolerance and potential investment opportunities thank you for your confidence in prudential
