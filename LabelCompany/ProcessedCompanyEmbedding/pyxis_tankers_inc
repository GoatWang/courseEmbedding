pure play product tanker company today announced unaudited results for the three months ended march   summary for the three months ended march   our time charter equivalent revenues were  million which resulted in a net loss of  million or a loss per share basic and diluted of  and our ebitda see nongaap measures and definitions below was  million we reached preliminary agreement to extend the maturity of approximately onethird of the outstanding principal of our debt until september  valentios valentis our chairman and ceo commented our results for the first quarter of  reflected a continuation of a challenging chartering environment spot and period charter rates were volatile during the quarter but improved slightly overall especially for modern ecoefficient tankers modest demand growth reduced high inventories of refined products in storage and improved voyage activity however we expect chartering activity to continue to be choppy for most of  but believe in a longer term improvement starting in late  due to attractive market fundamentals such as significantly lower scheduled deliveries of new build medium range tankers mrs combined with projected solid growth in consumption and exportoriented refinery cargoes consequently we intend to continue to maintain our mixed chartering strategy as of may   we had two vessels on time charter and the balance of our fleet on spot charters which positions us to take advantage of improving rates when they occur overall we continue to be pleased with our disciplined costeffective operating structure for example in the first quarter of  we saw a fleetwide improvement in our daily vessel operating expenses as compared to the same period in  as of march   our net debt stood at  million and the weighted average interest rate was approximately  during the first quarter of  in may  one of our lenders agreed subject to execution of customary documentation to extend the maturity of the loans with respect to two of our vessels which represents approximately  million of our outstanding debt for an additional four years to september  once this amendment is in place the first scheduled balloon payment with respect to our bank debt will be due in the second quarter of  which enhances our financial flexibility as part of our strategic plan pyxis tankers continues to focus on acquisition opportunities the longterm economics are attractive for the acquisition of a quality secondhand mr with current vessel prices substantially below year averages  results for the three months ended march   and  for the three months ended march   we reported a net loss of  million or  basic and diluted loss per share compared to a net income of  million or  basic and diluted earnings per share for the same period in  for the first quarter of  our ebitda was  million a decrease of  million from  million for the same period in  the decrease in net income was primarily due to a  million decrease in time charter

revenues of  million for the three months ended march   represented a decrease of  million or  from  million in the comparable period in  the decrease during the first quarter of  was attributed to lower time charter equivalent rates as well as to a decrease in total operating days voyage related costs and commissions voyage related costs and commissions of  million for the three months ended march   represented an increase of  million or  from  million in the comparable period in  the increase was primarily attributed to greater spot charter activity which incurs voyage costs vessel

means of evaluating and understanding how our management evaluates operating performance this nongaap measure should not be considered in isolation from as a substitute for or superior to financial

average daily revenue performance of a vessel on a per voyage basis tce is not calculated in accordance with us gaap we utilize tce because we believe it is a meaningful measure to compare periodtoperiod changes in our performance despite changes in the mix of charter types ie spot charters time charters and bareboat charters under which our vessels may be employed between the periods our management also utilizes tce to assist them in making decisions regarding employment of the vessels we calculate tce by dividing voyage revenues after deducting voyage related costs and commissions by operating days for the relevant period voyage related costs and commissions primarily consist of brokerage commissions port canal and fuel costs that are unique to a particular voyage which would otherwise be paid by the charterer under a time charter contract vessel operating expenses opex per day are our vessel operating expenses for a vessel which primarily consist of crew wages and related costs insurance lube oils communications spares and consumables tonnage taxes as well as repairs and maintenance divided by the ownership days in the applicable period we calculate fleet utilization by dividing the number of operating days during a period by the number of available days during the same period we use fleet utilization to measure our efficiency in finding suitable employment for our vessels and minimizing the amount of days that our vessels are offhire for reasons other than scheduled repairs or repairs under guarantee vessel upgrades special surveys and intermediate drydockings or vessel positioning ownership days are the total number of days in a period during which we owned each of the vessels in our fleet available days are the number of ownership days in a period less the aggregate number of days that our vessels were offhire due to scheduled repairs or repairs under guarantee vessel upgrades or special surveys and intermediate drydockings and the aggregate number of days that we spent positioning our vessels during the respective period for such repairs upgrades and surveys operating days are the number of available days in a period less the aggregate number of days that our vessels were offhire or out of service due to any reason including technical breakdowns and unforeseen circumstances  recent daily fleet data           amounts in
