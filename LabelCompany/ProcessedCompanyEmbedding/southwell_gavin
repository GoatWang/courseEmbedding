hiiqs first quarter  results our first quarter performance demonstrated continued strong demand for our products and solid execution we are very pleased with our performance record first quarter revenues grew by  yearoveryear to  million additionally adjusted ebitda and adjusted earnings per share both increased yearoveryear adjusted ebitda for the first quarter was  million up  yearoveryear adjusted eps for the first quarter was  up from  in the first quarter of  sales of our individual and family plans or ifps continued to accelerate throughout the open enrollment period we had record policies in force at the end of q   policies which represents a  yearoveryear increase we continue to drive top line growth and bottom line results with strong disciplined execution our entire organization continues to embrace a dynamic healthcare industry and we continue to execute our strategy to provide affordable healthcare solutions to consumers im proud of our accomplishments during the first quarter and i look forward to continued success throughout  and beyond our success in the first quarter is a direct result of our work on our key strategic areas of focus these areas include firstly maintaining industry leadership in product innovation we create quality affordable and efficiently administered health insurance products to meet the needs of consumers and we continue to believe that the current macro political environment is favorable to our ability to innovate affordable health insurance products secondly strong sales growth through our licensed agent thirdparty call centers as well as innovative products we support our thirdparty distributors by investing in resource and technology in our customer service compliance and call center quality teams and expect to continue to lead our market in this regard throughout  and thirdly our focus on scalability and leverage we have a sophisticated technology driven platform with demonstrated operating leverage which we will continue to enhance whilst controlling our cost base during the first quarter we added several additional hospital indemnity plans to our industry leading lineup these products provide additional diversity and value to our product portfolio we also added new supplemental plans and continue to improve our bundling capabilities increasing the value proposition for our consumers we continued to execute on our plan to deliver scalability in our operations as i previously discussed the heart of our operating model is our highly scalable technology driven quote by print platform it provides  realtime transaction type of services this platform drives our scalability as a cloudbased administrator fulfilling the needs of our consumers our agents and our carriers its a foundation of our differentiated distribution channel including call centers and our emerging broker network and it is also a backbone of our directtoconsumer website agilehealthinsurancecom now id like to provide an update on the rule issued by department of health and human services or hhs related to shortterm medical insurance or stm under the obama administration hhs issued a rule change in  stm policies to be no more than  months in duration and requires that specific language be used to explain noncompliance with the affordable care act as well as providing a  months stm allowing consumers to reapply we believe strong demand continues to exist for the stm product and other affordable health insurance options and we will continue to provide innovative and affordable health insurance products the hhs rule limiting stm to  months and yet allowing reapplies was implemented on april   with respect to our stm sales yearoveryear sales increased during the month of april our fixed indemnity product we refer to as hospital indemnity or limited medical has become increasingly more popular with consumers we believe that hospital indemnity addresses many of the consumers affordable health insurance needs and the total addressable market opportunity maybe even greater than that of stm with respect to the potential repeal and replace of the affordable care act or obamacare we have prepared product and marketing strategies for the various potential outcomes consumers come to us looking for solutions to their affordable healthcare needs and we intend to continue to provide affordable solutions and we believe we are uniquely positioned for future regulatory change we are working with various states as they review our numerous carriers and distributors compliance with state insurance regulations we are proactively communicating and cooperating with all applicable regulatory agencies and we have provided a detailed action plan to regulators that summarizes the companys enhanced compliance and control mechanisms it is too early to determine whether any of these regulatory examinations will have a material impact on the company we look forward to working with state and federal insurance regulators to ensure consumers continue to have access to health insurance products that meet their personal and financial needs the sum of our outlook for full year  our goals are straightforward top line growth with adjusted ebitda growing faster than revenue the drivers are bestinclass products our use of data compliant distributors while achieving marketleading customer satisfaction throughout  we will continue expansion of our thirdparty call center distribution both adding new distributors and increasing organically sales at our existing distributors we will continue to invest in our technology platform including agilehealthinsurancecom to enhance our scalability and maintain our competitive advantage we will also be adding additional bestinclass ifp and supplemental products in  to keep driving value for our consumers based on our strong first quarter we are increasing our full year guidance for both revenue and earnings we are increasing our expected  revenue to  million to  million and we are increasing our adjusted ebitda to between  million and  million or approximately  to  increase yearoveryear and nongaap earnings per share between  and  we expect that our strongest sales quarters for  will be q and q consistent with last year and that aggregate customer acquisition cost at agile included in sga expense will be higher during our seasonally stronger sales quarters due to the upfront nature of recognizing these marketing costs for accounting purposes were off to a strong start to  and we are optimistic about the future hiiq is uniquely positioned to take advantage of the growing demand for affordable health insurance solutions we appreciate your time today thank you for your interest in our company and id like to turn the call over to mike hershberger our chief financial officer michael hershberger thanks gavin and good morning everyone as gavin mentioned  is off to a strong start record revenue record adjusted ebitda and record policies in force at the end of q we have executed on several strategic initiatives that contributed to the acceleration of sales and profit during the open enrollment period that ended january   and should contribute sustained growth throughout the remainder of  and beyond we will continue to invest in what we consider to be attractive growth opportunities in  we anticipate continued leverage of our sga throughout the year id like to share with you some of the key highlights from the first quarter of  our first quarter revenues were  million an increase of  compared to last year and  sequentially our total policies in force increased to a record  at the end of the first quarter up  yearoveryear and  sequentially we experienced strong growth in our shortterm medical and hospital indemnity plans that we refer to as individual and family plans or ifps with the strongest growth occurring in our hospital indemnity plans additionally we continue to add new products to our portfolio that help us to continue to meet the affordable health insurance needs of our members total submitted ifp policies for the quarter were up  yearoveryear and  sequentially total sga expenses were  million for the first quarter of  up  million yearoveryear and breaking down the q sga expenses approximately  million were spent on marketing leads and advertising  in stock compensation expenses and another  in transaction severance restructuring and other charges the remaining core of our sga for q was  million or  of revenue compared to  of revenue in q  and  in q of  the driver of this metric continues to be our highly scalable technology platform integrating carriers and distributors while allowing consumers to quote their policy buy their policy print their insurance card and electronically secure health insurance coverage were also seeing improved leverage in sga resulting from continued scrutiny of all sga spend we expect continued improvement in our ratio of core sga to revenue throughout  ebitda was  million in the first quarter of  compared to  million in the same period in  first quarter  gaap earnings per diluted share was  compared to  in q of  and a loss of  sequentially included in our gaap earnings was a  tax benefit that resulted from the early adoption of an accounting policy related to sharebased payment transactions turning to our nongaap metrics adjusted ebitda and adjusted earnings per share increased both yearoveryear and sequentially adjusted ebitda for the first quarter was a record  million compared to  million in q  and  million sequentially we continued to execute on our plan to grow our top line revenue and control our sga spend adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenue increased to  for q  compared to  in q  and  sequentially adjusted eps for the first quarter was  compared to  in q  and  sequentially we believe that our nongaap metrics of adjusted ebitda and adjusted earnings per share provide a meaningful measure of our financial performance we provided a reconciliation of our gaap metrics to our nongaap metrics in our earnings press release that was published last night we continue to make secured shortterm loans to our distributors based on actual sales that we refer to as advanced commissions these advanced commissions assist our distributors with upfront policyholder acquisition costs and provide them with working capital we recover the advanced commissions from future commissions earned by the distributors on premiums collected over the period in which the policies renew in the first quarter we experienced a  million decrease in advanced commission loans that we provide to our distributors for a total of  million outstanding at march   we expect our advanced commission balance to remain at similar levels throughout  cash and shortterm investments totaled  million at the end of the first quarter of  up  million during the quarter and we had no debt during the quarter we expect to generate cash flow from operations throughout  based on our first quarter results and projections for the remainder of the year we are raising all of our  guidance metrics we now expect revenue to range from  million to  million adjusted ebitda to range from  million to  million and nongaap earnings per share to range from  to  our earnings reflect continued strong operational results and improved scalability offset by accelerated product development and implementation expenses and our expected upfront recognition of our consumer acquisition costs at agilehealthinsurancecom we believe that we are well positioned to continue our success in the dynamic individual health insurance marketplace we expect to deliver strong results through our continued expansion of innovative products continued expansion of our distribution networks including both existing and new distributors maximizing our ecommerce opportunity providing bestinclass customer service and continued scalability driven by our technology thank you for your time today and now wed like to open up the call for questions operator questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question is coming from mark argento of lake street capital mark argento quick question for you in terms of  it looks like shortterm continues to perform fairly nicely but also possible indemnities picking up as well could you break down the mix in terms of the growth in the quarter michael hershberger thanks mark appreciate the question so as we look forward  as we look back on the first quarter we saw a more robust growth with our limited medical than we did with shortterm major medical i would say that there were  if we look at the total  probably in the  to  range limited medical over shortterm major medical gavin southwell yes which is a great theme for us so we saw growth across both products which were happy with but we continue to see a theme of hospital indemnity or limited medical product growing at a more accelerated rate than the stm product but of course were happy to reassure everybody that we prepared for the rule change for stm that came in place on the april  and we had greater sales in april  than we had in prior year so good news across both of those kind of core products mark argento so just so i understand obviously both grew but you said  maybe you could just  the  versus  kind of reconcile that again for me michael hershberger sure yes  of our ifps were limited medical in the first quarter and about  were shortterm major medical mark argento and then i think gavin you had mentioned in your prepared remarks about new distribution partners or new distributors coming on to the platform could you elaborate on that a little bit gavin southwell yes we had a lot of success in attracting new distribution to add to our existing partners so from our existing partners weve seen good organic growth which were very happy with and weve been very happy with some additional distribution that weve also added what id flag is winning new distribution and getting them physically set up on to our platform and trained is a quick process we have invested a lot in our technology platform and getting people up and running is pretty quick what we do after that is we want to make sure that the distribution is meeting our compliance standards which are higher than anybody else in our industry and so we track them very closely over that initial period live the number of sales the number of cancellations the number of customer service calls theres a lot of different metrics in there so we wait a period of time after weve added new distribution and weve ensured that the partnership is working the way that we want before we bake in the impact  the upside into our figures which is of course is the right thing to do because we want to have some certainty that its panning out the way that we planned so weve had some good success we havent built that into the figures and i think as we go through  wed expect to see some good upside there operator our next question is coming from richard close of canaccord genuity richard close gavin i was wondering if you could comment a little bit on the risk premium back to the carriers as a percentage of premium equivalents that was  it came in a lot better than what we were looking for and i think yearoveryear improvement there can you just talk a little bit about that gavin southwell im going to hand over to michael hershberger to take the first part of that and then ill kind of give a summary comment at the end so hersh michael hershberger thanks richard and as we continue to look forward into  were looking at not only our sga spend controlling our sga spend but were looking at all different kinds of revenues so as we continue to work with our carrier partners we work to identify not only those products that are optimal for the consumer but those products that are optimal for hiiq as well richard close would you expect similar levels throughout the rest to the year or how should we think about that gavin southwell theres a couple of different parts here so we started a process of working with carriers and really trying to get as much benefit out of them as possible first a consumer in terms of expanding out the coverages that were available and secondly for hiiq in terms of what we were able to retain from a commercial point of view so that process hasnt finished well continue to kind of work through carriers and the impact of that will filter through in  and into  and we expect to see meaningful positive impact to our financials as we go through  and  the other side is as we have a continued rise in sales at agilehealthinsurancecom the pricing there and the makeup of those products is slightly different so i think as we go through this process and we see those figures come through well provide a greater narrative so people can understand exactly what those drivers are but the short answer is yes wed expect to see continued improvement certainly through  and  richard close okay next question i guess hersh is on the advanced commissions and obviously a lower level of advanced commissions positive on the cash flow front can you just walk us through that line item and how we should think about that why is that going down and what exactly that means when theyre going down michael hershberger sure just kind of as a recap advanced commissions are secured distributor financing so we make loans from timetotime to our distributors not all distributors want advances and so that there is not a ratio with respect to advanced commissions to sales so its certainly not a reflection on our sales the way that we look at it is we look at it as certainly as a generating additional cash flow were looking at advanced commissions to remain fairly constant throughout  richard close has anything changed there you just mentioned that some of your distributors dont take advanced commissions has anything else changed with respect to that and why thats going to be relatively flat as you experience revenue growth gavin southwell well i guess for my part over the last  months we had questions from people coming in around advances growing and the balance that was there so we looked at okay can we use our carriers balance sheet they have gigantic balance sheets why dont we use some of those their cash in order to give advances to distributors who want it so we implemented that which allowed us to kind of reduce the growth in advances at a slower rate than we were increasing our revenue so we see that as a positive and the other side is were fortunate in that weve attracted some excellent very large grown up distribution who have less of a need for advances than perhaps other distribution and so for us there isnt a kind of direct intrinsic link between growth in advances and revenue we think its a good thing to have advances it certainly can help and it can drive growth it works for a lot of our distribution it doesnt work for everybody we have the ability to take cash from carriers really what we wanted to show is as a business were in a really good cash position compared to where this business has been historically were generating a very large amount of cash our cash position keeps improving timeovertime and as a management team we wanted to be able to kind of focus on that metric so i hope i gave some color because i think historically you would have seen more of a link between that balance and the revenue and i think weve taken some steps to kind of remove that direct link were not trying to lessen the positive nature of advances it does generate an income for us it does make distribution sticky but its not as directly linked as it has been historically so i hope thats helpful i think that gives a bit of color richard close and i guess my last question would be just to dive into the comments that the first quarter and the fourth quarter are seasonally strongest i know you dont give quarterly guidance i think the streets at revenue of  million in the second quarter adjusted earnings around  and just curious if youre comfortable with those numbers putting that into the context of you say in the first quarter and the fourth quarter are strongest gavin southwell yes i mean were in a nice position in the business here we sell policies in quarter one and in april that we know are going to last throughout  and some into  so we have a unique position compared to a lot of businesses where we can kind of see forward and got a long runway in order to kind of get a guide as to how future quarters are looking and thats great as a management team so were really happy with q and q weve had record quarters record results across the board and we think that sets us up really well for the rest of the year theres a lot of noise were in a pretty dynamic market theres noise again today and last night weve had this for several months now and i think weve responded to it very well i look at our market i look at our competitors and i feel that were very well positioned not just for  but i think building into  as well so youre right we dont give quarterly guidance but we have just raised our full year guidance for  on both revenue and adjusted earnings and we do have a history of outperforming richard close so theres no reason why there would be a big step down in earnings in the second quarter gavin southwell no we just really wanted to flag that there has been a seasonality in prior periods in q and q and because were on such a growth path and people can see that we have great sequential growth as well as yearoveryear growth i think we were just highlighting that we can have a great  and  we dont necessarily always have to have sequential growth as well so its still the right thing to kind of flag that to people because not everybody understands that some of the market dynamic thats there so its really just trying to be as helpful as possible for the audience operator our next question is coming from mike grondahl of northland capital markets michael grondahl could you expand a little bit on your comments about april post the hhs rule change was that better than sort of your internal expectations if sales were up yearoveryear gavin southwell we wanted to give guidance to april it felt amiss to talk about q everyone was aware that a new rule change came in april  and we talked about it a lot so we wanted to be able to say look we saw a very healthy april in terms of performance that was there to echo some of my previous comments we feel that were very well positioned were very happy with the yeartodate in this business we do a lot of preplanning weve got the access to giant amounts of data not just from our business but we deal with over  distributors we have over  carriers theres a lot of analytical work thats there we have brokers who are involved and we also of course have healthpocket which gives us an oversight of every available product and of course we have the online business as well so we spend a lot of time looking at whats happening on a daily sales point a weekly sales point a monthly sales point and constantly adjusting our models for different scenarios so i think weve got a good view of how  is playing out and were really happy with q and also with april michael grondahl got it secondly you provided an update kind of on your progress with new distributors could you also touch on any progress youre making with new carriers gavin southwell when we attract a new carrier and we  in our market as we announce record quarters and we keep growing the way that we are we are aware that were fairly uniquely positioned in our market and were very visible and so having attracted some new carriers were going through a process of launching products and getting them out there to our distribution and getting that established and so we looked at putting out press announcements to talk about some of the carriers that wed added and we decided instead well save that until after weve kind of gone through this beddingin period so i think from our side we made some great progress with carriers id like to give some more detail but from a commercial point of view as we said before we think  is a great opportunity for this business so the focus for us is lets focus on getting these products to the consumer wholl really benefit from the work weve done to provide broader coverages than you can historically get from these products and the consumer really needs that right now in this market and lets focus on that side and then i think well talk about it once we can see the impact of those products coming into our financials so im sorry not to give more color it simply with  theres an opportunity were laser focused on executing on this year and thats the priority michael grondahl got it got it and then lastly did you see sort of the last quarter or  any change in kind of the retention of your policies or the duration of your policies for stm limited medical or the supplements gavin southwell yes ill start and ill hand over to hersh so there are some favorable signs in there in terms of our product mix so were seeing the hospital indemnity of a limited medical product grow at a more accelerated rate than stm and that has a greater lifetime value and so that has a material positive impact on our book of business and so thats  i mean we are very happy with internally we became a lot more obsessed with our data and whats happening within our book of business so were doing a lot of around retention and the ability for products to be able to last longer and thats by product by carrier across the piece and so that impacts the bundles that were putting together and providing the distributors as we add distribution as we add carriers this work kind of builds upon itself so id say that were absolutely seeing some positive signs in terms of retention the length of time is increasing in terms of products that are staying the impact of that hitting our figures it will filter through again kind of through  and  and we wont see the full benefit but thats a good place to be well see kind of incremental gains as we move through the piece michael hershberger that was great color on that and i would also add maybe our really laser focus on improved customer service and providing these bestinclass products have really been the function of that is the improved duration of our products gavin southwell no thank you i did want to comment on that we spend a lot of time we invested a lot of time and energy in  we added significant resource to our customer service and to our compliance departments we added some very senior market people and a lot bodies so our customer service response time is down to  seconds if you call our customer service in our market the average is way way way above that we have a compliance team thats of a very significant size compared to businesses that have a far greater scale to ourselves and we have a complaint ratio which is at  so we do have complaints but were at such a low level it rounds down to  something and thats a great position to be in and we do that very deliberately one is its the right thing to do this is individual health insurance and treating the consumer the right way trying to help them understand what is a complex process and its a very personal product to buy its very important that its the right thing to do but from a commercial point of view if you can improve customer satisfaction and you can improve retention the impact that has on your data and your stats and feeding through to your financials is very meaningful so we did that work in  were building on that and well see the impact flowing through in  and  so there wont be any additional cost for this year we already absorbed that cost in  and we were very happy with s financials i just really wanted to give that flavor of sort of our approach and our view as to what weve done to kind of build out this business and prepare ourselves for the future position ourselves for the opportunity thats ahead of us operator operator instructions our next question is coming from steven halper of cantor fitzgerald steven halper could you just talk about your views on the competitive environment in the shortterm medical area especially after the changes that were implemented as of april  gavin southwell yes happily the position that we have is favorable to perhaps our competition in that we have several carriers who provide stm products to our business on our technology platform and we have the ability to decide to choose which product goes to which distribution and so when a regulatory change like that is announced we work with each carrier in order to come up with the best solution for the consumer and that means that we had a lot of interested parties a lot of aligned interests and it means that we were able to design solutions to the consumer which meant that they were no worse off under the new legislation taking place on the st of april than they were prior to that so the way that we did that the way we designed it we believe is unique in the stm market and it’s to do with the carriers agreeing to treat claims to kind of look through the periods so that it doesnt have a detrimental effect to the consumer by having  month policies and we think thats great for the consumer so we feel very proud that we were able to do that and it gives us a competitive advantage so what we saw is a distribution out there who had previously worked with carriers who were able to come up with similar solutions much more open to working with a business like ours than perhaps previously so i think theres a bigger point here as well is that the stm change was a real change crystallized and that happened in our market that could have had an impact on our business and were happy to say that change happened and april we were ahead of prior year and q we have record results across the board leading up to it so i think it gives a bigger insight into our ability to adapt to change and so i think we absolutely have a competitive advantage in the stm market and i think once people understand that and then we can talk to them around look heres whats happening with our customer service and our compliance which are market leading heres our technology platform which allows you to significantly improve your ease of doing business heres our approach to supplemental products and how this can help you as a distributor improve your sales and your retention and all of that good stuff and so that rule change if anything really helped us kind of highlight the things that we often talk about which is our ability to innovate and our ability to leverage these multiple carrier relationships so we are very satisfied with how that whole process played out and so thats why we wanted to talk a little about april to kind of reassure people look this is an actual change that happened and this is how we responded and were very proud of that operator our next question is coming from frank sparacino of first analysis frank sparacino gavin just wanted to go back to some of the earlier commentary around distribution capacity and try to get a sense of the additions your making this year in terms of how much additional capacity and i realize theres still productivity gains that you had within the existing channel but just trying to get a sense of how much growth you think well have there gavin southwell ill be slightly careful because we  i think that weve attracted a new distribution that certainly has the potential to be significant and i think that once weve created new relationships there is that kind of beddingin period and once we get past that period and we know that  and theres no reason why it shouldnt of course but we are very kind of pragmatic here is once we can see the compliance metrics are operating the way that we want that the customer experience is working out the way that we need it to happen and all of those other things thats when well start kind of building the impact on that distribution to our financials so id say that i think theres great potential there were very happy with the progress we have made in that regard its a competitive market its a dynamic market and i think were well positioned and thats why weve been able to have this success so we are happy to talk about it but in terms of giving specific guidance its probably a little early for that but certainly as we go through  well be able to refer to it in a lot more detail so i hope thats helpful i know its not the  i hope thats helpful operator at this time id like to turn the floor back over to mr southwell for any additional or closing comments gavin southwell thank you very much overall we have a proposed rule that already hit our market and weve overcome all the kind of attention that currently is on healthcare in the us i really just wanted to make the overarching point that our strategy hasnt changed we are a consumer advocate and weve made significant investment in technology and resource to provide market leading customer service and compliance and by building on that and our enhanced use of data and our ability to work with leading carriers as well as distribution all across the nation i think were very well positioned for future growth and the need for affordable products the health insurance market in our market is only rising so whenever we look at changes happening in our market we feel very confident about our ability to execute against our plan and we think that shown by our performance in  certainly in the last two quarters so i just wanted to thank you for your time and your interest in our business and we look forward to speaking again to you operator ladies and gentlemen thank you for your participation

adjusted earnings per share of  also exceeding our guidance of  to  during the fourth quarter we had several onetime events occur including the retirement of our former ceo and the release of our deferred tax asset that originally occurred during our ipo in  and these resulted in a negative ebitda and gaap earnings per share for the quarter our cfo mike hershberger will provide more details on the impact of these oneoff events this quarters strong financial performance reflected robust selling trends especially during the aca open enrollment period that began on november  we had record policies in force at the end of   policies which represents a  yearonyear increase during the quarter we also set a new record for submitted policies  representing a  yearonyear increase the enhancement of our distribution system including our direct to consumer division agilehealthinsurancecom helped us to accelerate sales in the most recent open enrollment period looking forward to  we expect to continue to grow and achieve more scalability in our operations our fullyear guidance for  for revenue is between  million and  million which is a  to  increase yearoveryear our nongaap metric of adjusted ebitda will grow  to  yearoveryear which is  million to  million and adjusted earnings per share to grow  to  which is  to  throughout  we have exceeded our expectations and we are optimistic about the future the core strength of our company is our technology platform the heart of our operating model is a highly scalable technologydriven quotebuyprint platform it provides a

distribution model including call centers and our direct to consumer capability specifically agilehealthinsurancecom by adding new products to our portfolio and leveraging our proven technology platform we remain confident in our ability to continue driving profitable growth increased communication of the benefits of our ifp plans to our consumers and distributors is another key initiative in  we believe that our plans are the best solution for about  of the consumer seeking individual plans thats a  billion market and growing the team at healthpocket is leading that initiative we also plan to expand our call center distribution and continue to invest in our technology platform including agilehealthinsurancecom this will enhance the scalability and maintain our competitive advantage in quarter four  agilehealthinsurancecom powered by the team at healthpocket sold approximately  shortterm medical policies this represents  of the ifp policies sold during the quarter yearoveryear agile nearly doubled their sales and grew to be our largest distributor we continued to focus on scalability during the quarter quarter four core sga was  of revenue which is better than  in quarter three and significantly healthier than a year ago when core sga was at  of revenue our improved margins and our technology platform allowing the consumer insurance carriers and distributors to efficiently interact drives our scalability during the quarter we also continued our disciplined focus and solid execution on our key strategic levers product innovation distributor development online

health insurance products to meet the needs of consumers these products provide important solutions for consumers when they cannot obtain or afford the aca and we have the solutions for them we believe that the current macro political environment is favorable to our ability to innovate affordable health insurance products we continue to help support our thirdparty distributor sales grow in a

limited risk excellent customer service strong agent support tools and processes to ensure not only compliance but transparency with our regulatory partners and we expect to continue to lead our market throughout  now id like to provide an update on the rule issued by the department of health and human services or hhs related to shortterm medical insurance under the obama administration hhs issued a rule change in  that limits stm policies to be no more than three months in duration and require that specific language be used to explain noncompliance with the aca as well as providing a threemonth stm with allowing consumers to reapply while we are disappointed that hhs has decided to implement changes to this product as it will further limit consumer options for affordable health insurance we believe strong demand continues to exist for the stm product and other affordable health insurance options and we will continue to provide innovative and affordable health insurance products our fixed indemnity product which we refer to as hospital indemnity has become more popular with consumers throughout  we believe that hospital indemnity addresses many of the consumer needs previously filled through stm policies but now with the hhsimposed limitations on stm the demand for hospital indemnity will likely increase and we believe the total market opportunity may be even greater than that of stm we are currently working with various states as they review our numerous carriers and distributors compliance with state insurance regulations we are proactively communicating and cooperating with all applicable regulatory agencies and we have provided a detailed action plan to regulators that summarizes our companys enhanced compliance and control mechanisms its too early to determine whether any of these regulatory examinations will have a material impact on the company we look forward to working with state and federal insurance regulators to ensure consumers continue to have access to health insurance products that meet their personal and financial needs throughout  we have exceeded expectations and we are optimistic about the future with the proposed hhs rule as well as regulatory scrutiny in our industry our strategy for  has not changed we are a consumer advocate our investment in technology and resource to provide marketleading customer service and compliance along with our enhanced use of data and our continued ability to work with leading carriers means we are wellpositioned for future growth while succeeding in our mission of providing affordable and innovative health insurance and related products to the consumer improved communication of the benefits of our ifp plans to our consumers and distributors is a key initiative we believe that our plans are the best solution for about  of the consumers currently seeking a solution a  billion market and growing well continue to expand our distribution and continue to invest in our technology platform including agile to enhance our scalability and maintain a competitive advantage we appreciate your time today thank you for your interest in our company and id like to turn the call over to mike hershberger our chief financial officer michael hershberger thanks gavin and good morning everyone as i review the financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year  id like to highlight a few key points we are pleased with our revenue growth policies in force and adjusted ebitda during the quarter as gavin mentioned we have several strategic initiatives underway that contributed to the acceleration of sales and profit during the open enrollment period at the end of  and should contribute to sustained growth through  and beyond we will continue to invest in what we consider to be attractive growth opportunities in  our fourth quarter revenues were a record  million increasing by  compared to last year and  sequentially for the year our revenues were  million an increase of  over  exceeding our latest guidance of  million to  million our total policies in force increased to a record  at the end of the fourth quarter up  yearoveryear and  sequentially we saw strong growth in our ifp plans as well as supplemental products as a reminder supplemental products are generally included as a bundle along with the ifp products as we continue to meet our members health insurance needs our supplemental products generally have a longer lifespan than the corresponding ifps total submitted policies for the fourth quarter were up  yearoveryear and  sequentially providing visibility of future revenue in the upcoming quarters we experienced strong growth from our existing distribution channels in both submitted policies and policies in force sequentially and yearoveryear our fastest growing distributor during the quarter continued to be our online direct to consumer division agilehealthinsurancecom agile began selling policies during the second quarter of  and our sales through agile continued to accelerate yearoveryear as consumers sought affordable health insurance online during the fourth quarter agile sold  shortterm medical policies nearly doubling the submitted policies from q  throughout  we continued to leverage and drive scalability in our operations and q was no exception our core sga for the quarter that is total sga less marketing leads and advertising stock compensation and nonrecurring costs as a percentage of revenue was  in q  compared to  in q  and  sequentially core sga for  as a percentage of revenue improved yearoveryear from  in  to  in  the driver of this metric continues to be our highly scalable technology platform integrating carriers and distributors while allowing consumers to quote their policy buy their policy print their insurance card and electronically secure health insurance coverage ebitda was negative  million in the fourth quarter of  compared to negative  in the same period in  ebitda was unfavorably impacted by several onetime events in the fourth quarter including severance related to our former ceo and coo which had a cumulative impact of approximately  million this expense was a combination of cash severance of  million and stock compensation of  million additionally we had a onetime noncash release of our valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets the release was triggered in part by the companys projections of future taxable income due to this release we recognized a corresponding liability for our tax receivable agreement obligation resulting in a onetime noncash unfavorable impact of  million to ebitda the cumulative negative impact of ebitda of these events in the fourth quarter was approximately  million for the year ebitda was  million in  compared to  million in  fourth quarter  gaap earnings per diluted share was a  loss compared to a  gain in q of  and a  gain sequentially fullyear  gaap earnings per diluted share of  compares favorably to  in  gaap earnings per diluted share was also impacted by the onetime events in q including the severance of our former ceo and coo which had a cumulative negative impact of  per diluted share and the release of our deferred tax asset which had a negative impact of  per diluted share the cumulative unfavorable impact of these onetime events in the fourth quarter was approximately negative  per diluted share turning now to our nongaap metrics adjusted ebitda and adjusted earnings per share increased both yearoveryear and sequentially adjusted ebitda for the fourth quarter was  million compared to  million in q  and  million sequentially fullyear  adjusted ebitda was  million compared to  million in  adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenue increased to  for q compared to  in q  the fullyear  adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenue was  compared to  in  adjusted eps for the fourth quarter was  compared to  in q  and  sequentially fullyear adjusted eps was  compared to  in  we exceeded our fullyear guidance of  to  for this metric we believe that our nongaap metrics of adjusted ebitda and adjusted earnings per share provide a meaningful measure of our financial performance weve provided a reconciliation of our gaap metrics to our nongaap metrics in our earnings press release that was published last night we continue to make secured shortterm loans to our distributors based on actual sales that we refer to as advanced commissions these advanced commissions assist our distributors with their cost of acquisition and provide them with working capital we recover the advanced commissions from future commissions earned by the distributor on premiums collected over the period in which the policies renew in the fourth quarter we experienced a  million increase in advanced commission loans that we provide to our distributors for a total of  million outstanding at yearend cash and shortterm investments totaled  million at the end of the fourth quarter of  up  million from the prior year in  we generated greater than  million of cash net of financing in the fourth quarter we paid off the remaining  million of our bank line of credit ending the year with no debt looking forward to  we expect to generate between  million and  million in revenue for the full year which is an expected growth rate of between  and  yearoveryear we expect to generate adjusted ebitda thats a new metric were providing guidance on this year of between  million and  million and adjusted earnings per share of  to  both expanding faster than our revenue growth our earnings reflect continued strong operational results and improved scalability offset by accelerated product development and implementation expenses and our upfront cost of acquisition at agilehealthinsurancecom  was a very productive year for health insurance innovations team the addition of gavin southwell as our ceo has provided significant energy and momentum heading into  we expect to deliver strong results through our continued expansion of innovative products continued expansion of our distribution networks including both existing and new distributors maximizing our ecommerce opportunity providing bestinclass customer service and continued scalability driven by our technology thank you for your time today and now wed like to open up the call for questions operator questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question today is coming from mike grondahl a private investor please proceed with your question mike grondahl congratulations on the quarter first question is really just could you talk a little bit about the competitive environment and what youre seeing as it relates to shortterm medical and hospital indemnity or limited medical gavin southwell its a great opportunity for us in  i think the way that we positioned our business at that affordable side of the market has proven to be a very wise move i think that if you look at health insurance overall a lot of people who perhaps chose to head a lot more down the aca route and were perhaps expecting a different administration are now adjusting that position and i think we are very wellpositioned to have an opportunity to potentially partner with people who want to be more in our side of the market and i think we are very wellpositioned to take advantage of potential changes coming from this new administration we often get asked about if there will be new entrants to a market and if that will impact us i am happy for there to be competition i think we have always been an innovative business i think we are ambitious in terms of what we want to achieve and so competition is okay but i think if people out there are making strategic decisions a good way to do more in this market is to partner with a business like ourselves and i think that brings a great opportunity that hopefully we can execute on throughout  mike grondahl got it in terms of your kind of outlook for margins how are you thinking about driving further scale in the business what does it need to do that is it just revenue growth policy growth gavin southwell there are a couple of parts to that and of course we are very satisfied with the progress weve made to date the first thing is we talk a lot about our scalable model the investment weve made in technology here means for the growth that weve created we havent had to add a lot of additional people and additional resource in order to administrate those additional volumes and so that scalability really just shined through and as we look through to  the investments in resources have already been made they were made in  we added significantly to customer service and compliance because we want to lead the market in both functions so that was a deliberate strategic choice but in  we dont need to add any cost in order to handle bigger volumes the second part is as we continue to grow our ability to work with our carriers and unlock some of the value thats within this business will also allow us to keep enhancing those margins and thats very exciting my background is ive worked with carriers and ive worked a lot in kind of delegated authority on both sides from an intermediary and from a carrier side and so for us enhancing our use of data will help us to work a lot better with our carriers and really try to unlock some of that value and all of that will help our margins mike grondahl got you and then last question i believe with open enrollment recently here that december th is kind of one of the strongest days in that  period just because thats the day you need to sign up to get coverage january st so assuming the fourth quarter the december quarter was pretty backend loaded in looking at your guidance for  does it embed in there that the first quarter could be the strongest quarter of the year gavin southwell quarter four was a fantastic quarter for us as a business i mean we used the word record a lot in our release and were very proud of what happened in that quarter and the year overall quarter one historically if you look in previous years has been a big quarter for this business i think with the change in administration going into december there was a question as to will that impact consumer choice and consumer behavior and ultimately it didnt and december was great i think what weve tried to do is we were asked a lot in  about regulatory change the stm rule was a surprise to our market and everybody had to really really work with that and i think weve got a great answer i think were very wellpositioned so aware that we see a real potential for tailwinds to our business and we see a lot of positive signs from the administration around regulatory change that will benefit our business we are not baking that into our numbers until weve crossed the ts and dotted the is because we spent a long time talking about regulatory change in  and i know were going to be talking about it in  so i think we can show really good solid growth particularly around adjusted ebitda and i think weve got the potential for some real favorable tailwinds but lets confirm that and lets get this quarter under our belt and then if we need to adjust and provide more information then of course we will and to us having been through this in  and it feels like were coming to the end of it it just feels like that was the right way to approach it michael hershberger sure and id like to add maybe something that was a good summary gavin id like to add that you are exactly right mike that the strong fourth quarter especially at the end does provide visibility into the future of our revenues as we recognize the revenue as the consumer pays on their policy so it certainly provides us with a really strong visibility going into  and what we have decided as a company is not to provide guidance by quarter but certainly as a whole for  we are very comfortable with our guidance numbers mike grondahl got it okay thanks a lot guys operator your next question today is coming from mark argento from lake street capital please proceed with your question mark argento couple of questions first off i know as you referred to just given or referred to earlier the shift in regulatory environment now one of the things that you guys were contemplating last year was the addition of more products into the portfolio how are you thinking about the product portfolio going into  have you launched or are you planning on launching some new products gavin southwell great question so we worked very hard in  with a number of new carriers big globally recognized carriers we are very happy to partner with and we built out a number of new products some of which launched towards the end of  and one of which is launching in the next kind of  to  days where it gets very exciting for us is on kind of the hospital indemnity side we have some products which have broader coverages than these products have historically had over the last  years and also for all of ph the business because of a lot of the good work we have done around our use of data and the value proposition we can give to carriers it means that on a per policy basis we are better off than we were with previous hospital indemnity products and so i think you put those things together i think thats very useful for us we have a number of other kind of addon products ancillary products which we refer to we now sell more ancillaries than we do core products and thats really been a phenomenon of  and that will really prove out in  and again choosing the right ancillary products to match to the core product and being able to bundle that together using our proprietary technology is a real benefit to this business and i think well see those benefits really coming through as we move through the year because obviously as margins improve the impact – as hersh nicely described if we do a lot of sales in q that filters through throughout the year mark argento great and then kind of dovetailing off of that obviously again a lot of regulatory change but in trumps speech the other night to congress he talked about really opening the borders to healthcare across state lines when you look at your platform in particular the agile platform the online platform and the technology there is that flexible enough could you pivot could you go after even a bigger opportunity if it presented itself given how quickly things are changing in the regulatory environment gavin southwell absolutely i mean if we – weve compared every proposal thats been put forward and we have tried to look for commonality and if we pick potential changes that would be an advantage to us that we think would provide a material benefit we can kind of monetize opening up those borders is certainly very helpful and wed find that a real tailwind the platform the agile platform we want to talk about it in two ways we are very pleased with its performance in  it grew very quickly its doubled in size but there is so much more we can do with that platform we deliberately built that platform on very new and very modern technology to allow us to be able to add products and adjust products very quickly and so we are already looking at adding additional types of product and i think youll see that continuing as we go through  i mean i have worked with bigger organizations and ive been happy with how quickly we could make it changes but in this business we can make sameday changes in terms of turning things in or off and we can get entirely new products up and running and then we can have our distribution trained on it very very nimbly so for us as we kind of transition through this year thats an exciting time for us im happy to be sat in this seat as we go through any sort of transition thats out there i hope i answered the question there mark argento thats helpful and then my last question in regards to i think you said in your prepared remarks that you have expanded or at least are investing in your thirdparty distribution platform maybe you could talk a little bit about if you have added the number of seats or the number of parties that you are working with there and how big of a focus will that be here going forward gavin southwell so we have both sides of the coin are kind of good news here we worked with first of all our top  and then our top  distributors that we kind of picked up up and coming existing people and we saw some really great organic growth a lot of our distribution is exclusive to us they use our proprietary system and they use our advanced commissions to really drive their own acquisition costs and so its a great partnership so on the first side of it weve had some great organic growth that we are very happy with and we see that continuing because as we get a better understanding and a deeper understanding of our partners we can kind of pick and choose where we want to focus our time and thats very valuable to us and also i think as we really invested in our customer service and our compliance along with our technology and a lot of those compliance and customer servicings are technologybased in terms of the control point thats a real valueadd and so we are able to add additional distribution and we have an opportunity this year where we have the potential to add additional distribution to our network there are some great businesses out there who we dont currently partner with who wed look to do more with throughout the year and if we can thats fantastic and if not thats okay too but there is both sides of the coin from an organic side and from adding new distribution weve had good news on both sides in  and we see that continuing through  mark argento great thanks guys congrats on a solid quarter operator our next question is coming from greg peters from raymond james please proceed with your question gregory peters i just wanted to step back gavin in your comments you talked about the investment in compliance you made last year and it seemed like you were suggesting you didnt have any incremental expense on a yearoveryear basis that really needed to be made can you provide some color around the type of investment you made in compliance and why really there is no incremental need for that investment going forward gavin southwell yes so part of my background is i was a chief risk officer on both a carrier side and on a broker side so throughout my career and in my previous role as a coo i have always had risk management and compliance and operations customer service all kind of reporting to me and so i really understand the importance of those functions and i dont see it as just a cost of doing business i think if youre really good at this especially in such a highly regulated market i think thats a real valueadd i think that can really help with your sales and i think that all of our partners our carriers certainly appreciate that were protecting their brand and i think our distribution the more we can support them with that i think thats useful so from a compliance side we brought in some very highquality people we are working with an exinsurance commissioner since the beginning of  we have added kind of a higher quality more expensive type of staff to our team to really show the importance we see in that area and now we have done that we dont need to build on that further in  s cost will be consistent with what we did in  so i think its partly because i have been around for about a year and my view is that being able to say that our customer service has gone from  minutes to a couple of seconds in terms of answering the phone i think that is an impressive thing and something that helps us from a commercial point of view and also its the right thing to do in this type of market so just from an investor point of view there isnt going to be any significant additional costs in  i think we made those in  and we started up with a great result gregory peters excellent and from your past experience the multistate examination this isnt a multiyear process they dont take very long correct i mean should we get resolution of that pretty quickly or am i misreading that gavin southwell so in  we did wanted this process to conclude i mean its a process thats focused on a carrier we used to deal with and who we no longer deal with and our involvement is specifically relating to that carrier the two meetings in  one at the beginning of quarter two and one in quarter three and we are anticipating that resolution will absolutely be within  but it is taking longer than we had hoped from our side we have a great story to tell and we have shared that and we are working very closely with everybody to try and expedite the process as best we can i think the fact that we have been able to attract a very wellknown visible insurance commissioner to work with us and really represent our business shows how we think this is going to evolve and conclude and so its kind of i kind of think it is what it is we are in a very highly regulated industry and we are doing our best but of course its in everyones interest to try and conclude this as quickly as we can but you are right it shouldnt be too much longer gregory peters right perfect and then just switching over the revenue when you talk about the new products when we think about the commission revenue from the ifp products versus the supplemental products can you talk about the balance of which has higher margins and when you bring on these new products is the commission revenue comparable with the existing or is it lower commission revenue just give us sort of a state of the union on the revenue mix michael hershberger sure mike hershberger here cfo so a really good question greg so as we look at our sales of our ifps and gavin talked about this that we bundle in a supplemental product that we believe is an advantage to the consumer so what we are able to do really as a company and this is really a competitive advantage is go out and identify those best products for the consumers so what we try to do is come up with a whole plate of options for the consumers and generally when you think about our ifps if you think about maybe our ifps as our core products its about – the supplemental products are about a to or to ratio with respect to the premiums that we collect in that ballpark and certainly we have all different kinds of products and we are continually driving continually trying to drive increased margins on them gavin southwell yes id also add in that a big focus of  as we have really drilled into our numbers is we are very much focused on trying to unlock the value in the products so id say that i think the premium to the consumer is remaining pretty static in terms of what theyre going to be paying in  versus  and i think that our business mix per policy is improving in  versus in  and the way we do that is a combination of the ifp products having new deals at an enhanced rate versus prior years and looking very closely at how we bundle these products together because we have several options if you take a dental product we have several options for that and so if we can select having done this for several years a product thats better for the consumer and because of their larger volumes we can negotiate and we can unlock some value in there then thats a winwin for everybody in the chain and some of this information we talk about and other is fairly commercially sensitive because we are in a chain with our distribution and our carriers but hopefully that gives some good insight into kind of how weve approach in  and throughout  what id say is the data analytics we are investing oneoff capex costs small to moderate capex cost side at in enhancing software to really continue that process and keep trying to unlock that value which is where you see adjusted ebitda growing faster than our revenue and we think thats a trend well see in  and  gregory peters great thanks for the color guys operator our next question today is coming from frank sparacino from first analysis please proceed with your question frank sparacino maybe just following up on an earlier question as it relates to margins given the agile business model with the upfront expenses im trying to get a sense of where that business is kind of relative to the overall business from an ebitda margin standpoint i assume its much lower but just wanted to get some color there gavin southwell so the way we present our numbers we dont segment out the agile business on that basis what we did in  is we focused on growing that business in a very kind of controlled manner and i think in  we anticipate that growth continuing and were going to focus on the profitability of that business because as it keeps growing thats a logical strategic area to focus on the great thing about that business and where we dont see a conflict with our other distribution is the demographic of people who buy online versus the demographic of people who buy through our other distribution channels just differ so that means we are getting access to a whole new group of people and so for us a huge opportunity in  is getting to the consumer i often get asked if people understand the price point of these products and the coverages to that why arent they buying them and its because they dont know about it so trying to educate the consumer through our healthpocket brand trying to reach the consumer through agile – and youll notice on agile theres significantly more carriers on there now than there was at the same time last year that will continue to increase the types of products i think will continue to increase and i think but as we go through  well look internally at potentially if we need to give additional information on that and if thats something thats going to be helpful but its not something we currently provide so i hope that color is useful im trying to answer the question as best i can but it isnt something that we currently split out frank sparacino thank you gavin and maybe lastly just coming back i guess i want to better understand you talked about this in terms of one of the proposed republican ideas is to sell insurance across state lines and just trying to figure out how that positively impacts the business and what really changes for you gavin southwell so first of all statebystate insurance as a theme i think can make a lot of sense for a lot of good reasons somewhere like oklahoma is very different to somewhere like new york and im kind of stating the obvious but i understand why there would be different approaches to such a giant dispersed place but along with that the other side of it is that the big administrative burden in terms of the statebystate approach in terms of just the admin the paperwork and kind of cost associated and the overdifferent kind of oneoff type changes in nuances you have to make so any kind of simplification of that is certainly helpful and so i think that its a helpful change until that happens for us – look we have got very powerful proprietary technology and right now it works just fine but anything that simplifies that would be helpful some of the other things coming out which are worth highlighting is if you look at what is being talked around with tax so currently there is a tax penalty for buying nonaca products and there is a lot of information out there and it looks very likely that that tax penalty is going away but it isnt  certain exactly how that will work and exactly how that will impact our business very similar to the state line piece so my view on this is i see both of these as a potential benefit and a potential tailwind but until we understand exactly what the impact is going to be and how much of a benefit it would be because the state line thing could be okay that makes our lives a little bit easier or actually thats something a bit more fundamental so lets kind of bottom that out before we bake that into our numbers and thats the approach that we took our view is whether this change occurs or not we think that we have got a great opportunity to meet and hopefully exceed expectations as we did through  but you are absolutely right its a great example we are watching all this stuff very closely we have as much information on it as i think anybody can have we have as many people advising us as i think is possible and we just want to be sure of the impact before we kind of give a final answer so i hope thats helpful frank sparacino it certainly is thank you guys great results gavin southwell thank you very much appreciate it operator thank you we have reached the end of our question and answer session id like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments gavin southwell i wanted to thank everybody for joining us we are very happy to talk about quarter four and  and our expectations for  i think what we are creating here is very exciting and we enjoy and we
