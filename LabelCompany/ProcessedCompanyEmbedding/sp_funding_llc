programs active in the location of the project all funding solutions require an experienced development team a shovel ready or fully approved project verified developer equity liquidity and detailed project information including our project submission form executive summary business plan financial projections thru the funding and repayment periods and concise strategies for construction marketing advertising management and exit for the lender so if your project makes sense in todays economy is fully documented tell us your plans requirements and time frames and we can discuss specific funding solutions utilizing our mortgage funds and those of specific verified lenders seeking your project type size and location depending on the exact lender program we will use including our inhouse funding solutions you may need an appraisal dated within the last six months showing the current market value of the site a future value or to be when built value may also be necessary larger fundings sometimes require third party feasibility studies and each lender may have other requirements based on your project its components and your plans detailed developer resumes are always needed verification of the funds you have invested to date and draw schedules showing your required funding amounts as the project is built monthly thru the full construction and loan repayment will be developed in the funding process approved by the lender and developer together and will become your construction draw schedule our sources include direct funding by our firm verified banking relationships in the us europe asia panama and the uk the programs available are straight debt joint venture combination programs and in some cases saleleaseback projects you can typically include the land acquisition or payoff of existing debt and all hard and soft costs to bring the project to a stabilized position where the sales and income from the project is capable of servicing the debt in full and continuing the development we can also arrange permanent funding for the income producing elements of your project once fully stabilized every project every developer is unique and our funding solutions are designed with the right lender the right program the right solution structured to your project and requirements more program information is available in the columns to the right debt programs lenders today have foreclosed on all of the real estate projects they can carry on their balance sheets and still meet reserve requirements imposed by the governing bodies in their location like the federal reserve in the usa that does not mean that funding is impossible but it does mean that they are more selective have tighter funding parameters and great projects with all of the pieces in place are going to be funded as a direct fund we often receive  projects per month and only the best of the best will receive straight debt offers to fund you will find out very quickly that lenders including solutions know as much as you do about your location your region and your competition they know what costs fees and sale prices are realistic and your project documentation needs to be in line with the other projects they have funded are examining or own you must demonstrate that your project is carefully planned conceived and that you have the confidence to have invested your own funds prior to contacting them if you have zero of your funds invested lenders are not going to invest their funds liquidity or cash on hand is definitely going to be required and varies widely based on funding size location and loan to costs we all see the scams and schemes and so do the lenders once the lender has proven their ability to fund proven their history of funding and issued an approval be prepared to pay a fee of some form in direct verification costs or an escrow for the same to move from application to the closing table fees are always an issue but at the proper time with the right program they are a reality if your local bank in your hometown requires an appraisal a title exam credit reports property inspection background check and many other verifications to fund a condo down the street it is not realistic to expect a lender to fund a condo project in another country at zero costs developers that insist on paying absolutely nothing until funding will never get to the closing table and any program stating that is a scam pure and simple that being said our direct in house debt fund considers projects with  to  down payment and typical private equity and or bank programs require  down payment or higher on a project by project basis these down payments are paid at funding in the traditional closing our program and others will require you to demonstrate your ability via a proof of funds or escrow of some form once approved our project investigation and interviews with the developer will result in a candid discussion of our program and requirements your ability to match yourself your project and your ability to engage and close once your project is fully verified approved and engaged with our program we will openly discuss the funding our legal and accounting funding history abilities and costs if you or your project do not fit our inhouse criteria we may have third party fund sources available to highly qualified projects or those exceeding  million usd our program does not have any form of upfront bogus fee of any form we underwrite the project internally at our expense with our employees and contractors once we determine the project is of interest we will issue general terms and conditions via a funding proposal which openly discusses the program timing documentation and verifications needed and our site visitinspection we are paid at funding period we either perform or we do not get paid joint ventures in todays climate many developers are pursuing a joint venture funding with a lender and many lenders are only offering joint venture typically the project is placed into a trust or special purpose holding corporation the project is funded for  to  of the development costs with the developer and lender participating in profits jv programs are available with the lender holding from  to  depending on the size time frame costs loan to costs and loan to value of the project equity invested prior to the funding is often a determining factor and will reduce the equity requirement to the lender programs vary widely and lenders may be strictly hands off receiving monthly or quarterly reports to lenders involved in most aspects of the project day to day joint venture funding is going to require in most cases your ability to prove your staying power to the new funding partner a lender funding your project will require you to demonstrate financial reserves or ability to complete the project in the event costs increase or sales decrease from the projections you provide as the old saying goes the best laid plans can go astray is true so if they enter into a funding agreement with you they will certainly require you to demonstrate the liquid assets to maintain your position post funding this guarantee can be as simple as providing your financial statement showing your ability and as complex as a required escrow or deposit to insure the completion of construction and sell out of the project joint ventures take many forms and will usually involve repayment of the funding amount at a reduced or lower interest as compared to debt the down payment requirements are typically much less at a range of  to  our firm provides direct joint venture funding via our private investment trust and we work with other lenders as well in asia and europe seeking qualified projects for co investing and ownership the underwriting and verification process equals debt funding and in some cases is actually more stringent since the fund is your partner and lender real estate

project funding in a world starving for renewable energy with costs of traditional power generation tied to expensive black oil or natural gas solutions project funding is direct to multiple lenders and our own funding programs for verified renewable energy projects globally most funding solutions start at  million usd and go up to no limit and are available in any stable location biodiesel wind solar waste to energy thermal hydroelectric just about any renewable energy project can be funded energy funding falls into two distinct categories of projects being funded with multiple solutions available in both categories many of the projects we work on daily offer the lender a strong governmental or corporate guarantee by an end purchaser of the power being generated if this purchase agreement usually referred to as the off take or ppa agreement is absolute without a cancellation or termination clause of any form and the purchaser is a credit rated corporation or government entity rated bb or better by standard  poors or moodys we have multiple funding solutions in straight debt joint venture or saleleaseback that can fund the project  quickly at favorable terms the funding term will usually match the term of the ppa agreement for the power generated to  years on a project by project basis for projects that cannot supply a guaranteed off take with a rated power purchaser the rules of the game are similar to those for real estate projects liquidity equity and strength of the developer will take the place of the off take or ppa agreement you will usually be looking at a funding program requiring some form of bonding to provide the collateral a lender is going to need to fund the project costs and requirements are going to be similar to a real estate project and can generally be included in the funding provided any project presenting a new technology patented technology or a process that can be duplicated many times in various locations will also attract attention to both straight debt joint venture and sale leaseback funding solutions we have qualified funding programs with huge amounts of investment funding available earmarked specifically for qualified renewable energy interested in an out right purchase joint venture or sale leaseback sale lease programs the sale lease funding options often used with companies seeking to finance equipment receivables and inventory have been adopted by several major energy funding programs to fund qualified projects once approved the lender actually buys your project for the required funding amount necessary to make the project a reality they then lease the project at completion back to the developer and the developer sells the product or energy produced makes a lease payment to the lender on an agreed to term and at the end of the lease term receives the project back or has the right to purchase it at a pre determined price our ability to arrange this type of funding is strictly limited to the credit rating of the off take purchaser and usually requires a minimum rating of bb the overall costs can be equal to or better than a traditional mortgage or joint venture but will keep the capital of the developer available for multiple projects multiple locations etc most of these programs also start at  million usd and go to any size for a qualified project these lenders are generally large institutional investors with very large appetites seeking developers capable of doing multiple projects annually for many years to come they are often able to provide construction engineering etc as part of the package developer programs if youre a renewable energy developer and can obtain an absolute purchase agreement or off take agreement from a credit rated purchaser for your power biodiesel etc we can directly fund  of the costs of your project for as many projects as you can operate in any global location the world is choking on garbage costs of power generation go up every day and the demand for clean renewable energy is endless world wide with the right off take agreement and the right purchaser we have institutional fund sources with literally billions in available cash reserves ready willing and able to partner with you under straight debt joint venture and sale leaseback funding options any major city in the world is producing tons of trash daily for waste to
