bidders with respect to sales of posters posters for the most part were printed in large format on the cheapest possible paper and with an expected life of two to three months on billboards they were ephemeral by definition and not intended to withstand the test of time therefore in grading a posters condition the standards and criteria of the print collector cannot be used the most important element in grading a posters condition is its appearance as defined by the lines colors and overall design condition in this catalogue is noted according to a rating system which has been accepted by most poster dealers the following ratings are used with an appropriate  or  to indicate slightly better or worse condition condition a designates a poster much in the same state as when it was printed the colors are fresh there is no signifcant paper loss or tears but there may be some slight blemish creases or scuffng condition b designates a poster in good condition some restoration including repaired tears or slight overpainting may have been done but it is not visibly apparent there may be discoloration andor fading condition c designates a poster that is showing the effects of time andor heavy restoration fading and discoloration may be more pronounced restoration folds creases and flaking may be visible and there may be paper loss or obvious restored losses within these guidelines we have done our best to describe any flaws defects and restorationwhether apparent or not however the above condition ratings are subjective prospective purchasers should satisfy themselves as to condition if you have any questions regarding these posters please feel free to call for additional information or for a condition report we encourage you to examine the posters
