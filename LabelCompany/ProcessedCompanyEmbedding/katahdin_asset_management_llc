application the complete application may be obtained via the commissions web site either at httpwwwsecgov​rules​iareleasesshtml or by searching for the file number or for an applicant using the company name box at httpwwwsecgov​search​searchhtm or by calling   applicants representations  the applicant a delaware limited liability company is a multigenerational singlefamily office that provides services to the family and descendants of joseph a jeffrey  “ja jeffrey” through the provision of services to jeffrey llc a delaware limited liability company and to the jeffrey company an ohio corporation “tjc” the securities of each of jeffrey llc and tjc are  owned directly or indirectly by the descendants of ja jeffrey the managing member of jeffrey llc is tjc unless otherwise defined herein capitalized terms have the same meaning as defined in the family office rule  the applicant provides a wide array of services both advisory and nonadvisory to and conducts the daytoday operations of jeffrey llc and tjc with the applicants own employees neither jeffrey llc nor tjc having employees of its own subject to the direction of the board of directors of tjc the “board” tjc is managed by the board a majority of the members of which are family members as defined in paragraph d of rule ag the “family office rule” with ja jeffrey being the “common ancestor” for this purpose the applicant is wholly owned and controlled by the same individual who is tjcs chief executive officer and who also is a family member  the applicant represents that i each of the persons served by the applicant is a family client ie the applicant has no clients other than family clients as required by paragraph b of the family office rule ii the applicant is owned and controlled in a manner that complies in all respects with paragraph b of the family office rule and iii the applicant does not hold itself out to the public as an investment adviser as required by paragraph b of the family office rule  the applicant represents that jeffrey llc currently relies on an exception from the definition of investment company pursuant to section c of the investment company act of  as amended the “ica” jeffrey llc would like to offer to additional family clients the opportunity to invest in jeffrey llc subject to securities law compliance including complying with applicable federal and state exemptions from the registration of its securities the applicant states that the  beneficial owner limitation of section c of the ica would cause family friction by denying to many family clients the opportunity to invest in jeffrey llc the applicant states that there are approximately  family members accordingly on march   jeffrey llc filed an application with the commission pursuant to section c of the ica requesting an exemption from all of the provisions of the ica and all rules and regulations thereunder such exemption would permit jeffrey llc to allow all family clients the opportunity to invest in jeffrey llc without imposing on jeffrey llc the costs of registering under and complying with the ica  the applicant represents that in the event jeffrey llc were to exceed the  beneficial owner limitation of section c of the ica the applicant would continue to meet the three general conditions of the family office rule set forth in item  above with the exception that jeffrey llc would not qualify as a family client as more fully described below the applicant represents that the assets owned start printed page beneficially by family members andor family entities including assets beneficially owned by family members andor family entities indirectly through jeffrey llc will account for at least  of the assets for which the applicant provides services  the applicant represents that the membership interests of jeffrey llc “units” have not been and will not be offered or sold to the public the applicant states that under jeffrey llcs limited liability company agreement sales or other transfers of units for value to any purchaser other than to jeffrey llc itself are prohibited the applicant further states that transfers for value to existing members or other family clients are prohibited the applicant represents that a market never will develop for units applicant represents that the exit strategies available to a family client will be to surrender units for redemption by jeffrey llc at fair market value or to gift or contribute units to other family clients investors are permitted to redeem their units at the end of each calendar quarter  the applicant represents that tjc since  has relied on an exception from the definition of investment company pursuant to section c of the ica as of december   however virtually all of tjcs assets consist of managing member units of jeffrey llc which jeffrey llc has determined are not securities applicant represents that tjc no longer is required to rely on section c of the ica and does not require an exemption from the provisions of the ica applicants legal analysis  section a of the advisers act defines the term “investment adviser” to mean “any person who for compensation engages in the business of advising others either directly or through publications or writings as to the value of securities or as to the advisability of investing in purchasing or selling securities or who for compensation and as a part of a regular business issues or promulgates analyses or reports concerning securities    ”  the applicant currently complies with the family office rule and thus the applicant is not considered to be an “investment adviser” under section a of the advisers act in the event that jeffrey llc were to exceed the  beneficial owner limitation of section c of the ica and thereby no longer would be excepted from the definition of “investment company” under the ica the applicant would not comply with the family office rule exclusion from the term “investment adviser” because the applicants “client” jeffrey llc would not qualify as a family client under paragraph dxi of the family office rule the applicant does not qualify for any of the exemptions from registration as an investment adviser set forth in section b of the advisers act and because the applicant has regulatory assets under management of more than  million the applicant is not prohibited from registering with the commission under section aa of the advisers act therefore absent relief the applicant would be required to register as an investment adviser under section a of the advisers act  the applicant submits that in the event jeffrey llc were to exceed the  beneficial owner limitation of section c of the ica the applicants relationship with jeffrey llc would not change the nature of the applicant into that of a commercial advisory firm in support of this argument the applicant notes that the applicant would continue to be held entirely by family clients and the applicant would continue not to hold itself out to the public as an investment adviser the applicant represents that jeffrey llc would continue to be managed and controlled by tjc which in turn is managed by the board a majority of the members of which are family members  the applicant states that in requesting the order the applicant is not attempting to expand its operations or engage in any level of commercial activity to which the advisers act is designed to apply further in the event jeffrey llc receives from the commission an order exempting jeffrey llc from all of the provisions of the ica and all rules and regulations thereunder given the conditions of such exemptive order which are designed to alleviate the policy concerns implicated by expanding jeffrey llc beyond one hundred investors the applicant submits that there is no practical difference from a regulatory standpoint between i a pooled investment vehicle created exclusively for the benefit of and wholly owned by family clients that is “excepted from the definition” of “investment company” under the ica and ii such a pooled investment vehicle that is by virtue of a commission order exempt from all the provisions of the ica and all rules and regulations thereunder  the applicant also submits that there is no public interest in requiring the applicant to be registered under the advisers act the applicant is a private organization that was formed to be the “family office” for descendants of ja jeffrey the applicants clients are jeffrey llc and tjc the applicant has no clients other than family clients applicant represents that such services would not change or be affected in the event jeffrey llc were to exceed the  beneficial owner limitation of section c of the ica  the applicant argues that although the family office rule largely codified the exemptive orders that the commission had previously issued before the enactment of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the commission recognized in proposing the family office rule that the exact representations conditions or terms contained in every exemptive order could not be captured in a rule of general applicability the commission noted that family offices would remain free to seek a commission exemptive order to advise an individual or entity that did not meet the proposed “family client” definition and that certain situations may raise unique conflicts and issues that are more appropriately addressed through an exemptive order process where the commission can consider the specific facts and circumstances than through a rule of general applicability  the applicant notes that the commission has issued orders subsequent to the adoption of the family office rule and that each of those orders treated the applicant as a family office even though the applicant was providing services to persons who did not fall within the definition of “family client” the applicant submits that those orders recognized unusual circumstances in which an entity provided services to such persons while remaining focused on a single familys needs the applicant maintains that its unusual circumstances—providing services to an entity that currently qualifies as a family client because it is excepted from the definition of “investment company” under the ica but would not be so excepted if it were to exceed  beneficial owners—would not change the nature of the applicants operations into that of a commercial advisory business and that an start printed page exemptive order is appropriate based on the applicants facts and circumstances  for the foregoing reasons the applicant requests an order declaring it to be a person not within the intent of section a of the advisers act the applicant submits that the order is necessary and appropriate in the
