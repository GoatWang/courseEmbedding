of the esophagus bronchus and trachea the company’s novel cellframe™ technology is engineered to stimulate the body’s signaling pathways and natural healing process to regenerate and restore organ function our cellframe technology is based on over  years of scientific progress in the fields of tissue engineering cell biology and material science cellframe technology combines the best attributes of a synthetic scaffold with tissue engineering and cell biology to create what may be a revolutionary method of addressing organ damage biostage has been developing its new generation of organ implants as a platform capable of being used in the esophagus and main airways trachea and bronchi the current platform based on our cellframe technology represents a complete reengineering of our earlier organ scaffold and cell technology to better stimulate the regenerative properties of each of these organs biostage’s cellframe technology platform is used to create organ specific cellspan implants recent large animal data showed promising results as our cellframe technology applied to the esophagus achieved the regeneration of esophageal tissue the company is currently expanding its preclinical data in collaboration with mayo clinic and intends to submit the cellspan esophageal implant ind with the fda in the third quarter of  and begin firstinman studies in the fourth quarter of

biostage look for it to rise again  biostage inc nasdaqbstg  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»biostage look for it to rise againmay  about biostage inc bstg spencer osborne growth value special situations momentumsummarycompany announced positive news on esophagus regeneration product and will seek human trialscompany reported a  million or  per sharestocked spiked to  before selling off to below boistage nasdaqbstg announced its q corporate update as well as an update on its preclinical program for esophagus regeneration biostage is a biotech firm concentrating on research and development in the area of tissue regeneration using a patients own cells the reaction of the street to the call likely has many people scratching their heads from a business perspective the numbers should not have been a surprise most of the biostage business is in a research and development phase research and development costs money and losses should be expected the financial results the company reported a net loss of  million or  per share this was a slight improvement from the  million that was lost in q of  research and development costs were  million selling general and administrative costs came in at  million and improvement from the  million spent in the year prior cash used in operating activities increased to  million in the first quarter of  as compared to  million in the first quarter of  cash on hand at march   was  million the company continues to have in place its  million  month stock purchase agreement with aspire capital fund llc the clinical update the clinical update offered by the company was highly encouraging the update included discussion of preclinical data including the complete regeneration of a segment of the esophagus from its collaborative largeanimal study of its cellspan organ implants with mayo clinic according to management the study has clearly demonstrated in a predictive largeanimal model the ability of biostage cellspan organ implants to successfully stimulate the regeneration of sections of esophagus that had been surgically removed for the study the study utilized cellspan esophageal implants consisting of a proprietary biocompatible synthetic scaffold seeded with the recipient animals own stem cells were surgically implanted in place of the esophagus section that had been removed study animals were returned to a solid diet just two weeks after implantation surgery the scaffolds which provide the framework for cell regeneration are intended to be in place only temporarily the scaffolds were later retrieved via the animals mouth in a nonsurgical endoscopic procedure after  months a complete epithelium and other specialized esophagus tissue layers were fully regenerated animals in the study demonstrated weight gain and appear healthy and free of any significant side effects including a few that are now more than  days post implantation and are receiving no specialized care biostage views their research results as a watershed event for the company and indicated that it strongly feels that its procedures science and products are validated management believes that it now possesses sufficient data to initiate good laboratory practice glp studies to demonstrate that its technology personnel systems and practices are sufficient for advancing into clinical trials glp studies are required to advance to an investigation new drug ind application with the us fda which would seek approval to initiate clinical trials for biostage cellspan esophageal implants in humans biostage currently expects to complete its ind filing by yearend  what that means to investors given that there was no real surprise in the financials and that the preclinical update was very positive the stock price reaction in the hours after the call was a bit odd the stock closed yesterday at  per share and opened trading today at  the stock has sold off ever since the call it went below the  mark by early afternoon the strong selloff actually presents a compelling upside opportunity based on four near term catalysts  the company has indicated that it is proceeding to initiate glp studies and intends to get fda approval on an ind for human trials by the end of   the company did not really speak to the concept of garnering orphan status in my opinion the companys technology and treatment has a high probability of getting that status cancer of the esophagus is highly terminal and current treatments are highly invasive the importance of orphan status is that it could streamline the path in clinical trials as well as get a product to market more quickly  peer review data publication when a company can publish its data in respected medical journals the doubters out there will have less doubt peer review removes a level of speculation and actually confirms the science concepts and potential the company discussed publishing its data getting published in the right place could be a big driver of the equity  fda acceptance of ind application once the company applies for approval to initiate human trials the future of the company will hinge on garnering approval if the fda allows human trials to commence the street will have little doubt about the company being on the correct path some risks  investors may be concerned with the cash position of the company but there exists a facility that allows the company to tap into  million with aspire some investors may characterize such a deal as an atm facility in essence the company can sell up to  million dollars worth of stock with aspire being a guaranteed buyer these stock sales can happen at any time and while dilutive to the existing holders are limited in nature to a value that is predetermined as long as you consider these possible shares in your own due diligence you should not see any real surprise in my opinion the atm will need to be utilized in   biostage is a small company with a small market cap and small number of outstanding shares this can create volatility that may shake the confidence of the average investor more than it should on down days and boost confidence more than it should on up days  failure of concept in my opinion the odds of failure are less today than they were back in november large animal studies offer some real world results that give true indications of what we can expect to see in human studies large animals have passed the  day mark with what are apparent no complications if a complication arises prior to any human studies the company programs could get sidelined as stated biostage is a speculative play that can have volatility if you believe in the technology and that human trials will start then seek an opportunity to buy your stake with the full understanding
