father is my hero i’ve never met a smarter wittier and more thoughtful person whom i try my best and fail to emulate each day in business my hero is richard branson no one else has started so many successful companies in so many different fields his passion for extreme sports is something i can relate to and aside from donald trump i don’t think anyone has better hair what’s the single best piece of business advice that helped shape who you are as an entrepreneur today and why try to always stay evenkeeled do not get too excited when things are going great and don’t get down when things don’t work out as planned entrepreneurship is full of a lot of ups and downs but moving forward is all that really matters what’s the biggest mistake you ever made in your business and what did you learn from it that others can learn from too i went too big too quickly i brought on an account that i knew i could not support but i relied on others to come through in the time of need with an investment the investment took six months longer than promised and we lost the vendor so do not count your chickens before they hatch and do not rely on others to come through for you what do you do during the first hour of your business day and why i always start by going to my local coffee shop for a large dark roast redeye and then i scroll through my emails sometimes i have  new ones a day to see what takes priority then i begin tackling my plans i set for the day from the night or week before while attending to those most crucial emails what’s your best financialcashflow related tip for entrepreneurs just getting started keep general and administrative expenses very low as long as possible don’t take a salary or a very big one until you can afford it don’t rent expensive space or put money into trivial things that don’t directly increase the value of your business until your business has significant value i worked my first year with no salary and the following two below minimum wage it was not until i raised over  million that i took a salary and not until then that i brought on anyone who deserved a high salary i find you can get a lot done by being scrappy so by the time you take a real salary your investors feel you deserve much more and are shocked by how far you’ve gotten with such low cash burn rate to date quick what’s one thing you recommend all aspiring or current entrepreneurs do right now to take their biz to the next level start it so many people have ideas but only a very few actually take the action to bring it to market — whether that means designing your app having prototypes of your consumer goods made or bringing on your first clients in a service industry stop discussing and start doing what’s your definition of success how will you know when you’ve finally “succeeded” in your business success for me will be giving my investors a return on their investment and improving myself as an entrepreneur and person if i can make some money in doing so as well i won’t complain more like this article by yec meet isaac jr olowolafe president of dream maker corp by yec meet joe gagliese cofounder at viral nation inc by yec meet sam
