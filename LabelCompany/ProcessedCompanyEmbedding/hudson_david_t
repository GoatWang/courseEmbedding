the following questions were compiled by subscribers to the whitegold forum and asked by its moderator binga on may   binga i have your permission to tape record this is that correct david david hudson thats correct binga first question besides your columbus ohio lecture scheduled for july do you have any appearances scheduled for the future david hudson where did you hear that binga you know me i have my thumb in just about everything youre appearing on sunday july  arent you david hudson yes i am but im not trying to spread the word i dont want to get a fan club to show up there what do they call themselvesthe psychotronics the psychotronic people have asked me to come there and it works out well for me to go at that time so i will be speaking there on sunday but its not going to be anything all that different from what you have already heard binga do you have any other appearances scheduled for the future that you know of david hudson thats it binga you probably get a lot of mail how have you been handling your mail as far as reading it and answering letters david hudson i read everything i do not answer anything if people want to be sure i know something they can put it in writingi do read everything unless its like books or something that dont relate to what im doing if its a book i lay the book aside and i may get to it in time but i am extremely busy right now binga so you dont answer anybody but you do read everything david hudson yes i do read everything assure them that i do read everything if its a letter i read the entire letter look at who its from and everythingbut i do not answer them in writing i may call them believe it or not i am keeping every one of these letters they are all here ive got about nine boxes here of letters binga next question involves the egyptian rite of ascension there is some confusion as to whether it involves gold or iridium david hudson the egyptian rite of passage i dont know for sure what it involved all i can go by is what is written in the text and they said it was gold binga do you have what text you got that out of david hudson have you read the oldest book of the dead and the binga yes it is available online david hudson have you read it binga not word for word david hudson read it binga ok its in there david hudson right binga so do you know whats involved to take a full course there is some confusion as to whether it is  days at  mg or  months at  mg david hudson i know that they were involved in the  day ritual just like the hebrews were apparently it is taken over  days but the actual conversion does seem to take nine months so its like thats the period of receiving the semen in your body but it does take nine months to totally occur binga so you dont know what the dosage is david hudson you know this is what we are studying right now it appears it is at least  mg though binga every day david hudson yes binga and then its preceded by a  day fast and then you begin the  mg david hudson right part of the work were doing as far as perfecting of the bodyand i can tell you right now it does require  mg as far as cancerthat we are finding out from all our cell culture studies binga and the course could run at least  days and it could take up to  months david hudson thats correct binga ok so its just depending on the person and whats going on david hudson yes binga there was a question as to how much gold would it take the market value or weight to make enough ormes materialim assuming the gold to complete a full course david hudson well we dont make it from gold we only do that to demonstrate that the white powder does come from gold but its very expensive and very timeconsuming we actually get our gold from the natural ore binga the tailings david hudson well its a natural metal deposit and not tailings its never been mined binga oh so this is like out of a vein david hudson no its a volcanic upheaval immense binga its sort of like what these other naturally occurring people are claiming they are getting theirs from too david hudson right its exactly what these naturally occurring people are claiming binga oh it is so its the same stuff thats just been processed david hudson nowe are starting with rock we are doing exactly what they are trying to do binga they are just digging it out of the ground and putting it in bottles from what i understand there is no processing to it david hudson now that shows how stupid they are they need to spend about  million dollars and learn how to separate it from each other thats the products they call isis white powder gold or etherium goldthats what they are doing from what i understand they are getting it from actually a dry lake bed and they are just scooping the white powder up off of the dry lake bed binga we are getting ahead of things here im going to skip over that we will come back to that subject later i have some questions about that the next question do you receive any information via channeling or direct communication with light beings david hudson not that i want to claim no binga so i guess the next question if so in what form do the appear is not applicable the next set of questions refer to the following portion of your dallas appearance and i will just quote it it was a question i would like to know if you are consuming the substance yourself right now and your answer was because i was the discoverer i felt i should take the material first i started fasting and we didnt know how much to take i was taking the gold in very low amounts my wife on about the third day became aware that i was taking it and she just went ballistic you would have to meet my wife she is a very special lady but she had been reading all the alchemical texts from st germaine and all about peoples hair falling out and their teeth falling out and their skin peeling off and she just said you will not take this material without my permission and out of respect for my wife i stopped taking the material she literally made me eat to break the fast and since that time we have now five people one in texas who are taking it in the high amounts they are people who basically had no wife or children and no prior commitment and therefore were not afraid of it but no i have not taken it just in very very low amounts could you elaborate on the portion that says since that time we now have five people one in texas who are taking at high amounts david hudson well that was in the early part of the year we actually ended up with about nine people who took it in high amounts binga were they taking iridium rhodium or gold david hudson iridium rhodium no one else has ever taken the gold binga from the portland appearance my wife just said you will not take it anymore and my wife is my partner and i will not take it without my wifes permission but my wife is taking it now in the low amounts for arthritis and shes very pleased with the results and i think very soon shell say all right dave its okay we can do it together and then ill take it david hudson my wife is still taking it believe it or not binga what is she taking david hudson rhodium and iridium she is taking  mg a day her nails are dramatically growing faster she is very pleased because she likes having very nice nails and she is feeling better binga how is she taking it david hudson orally binga is she doing it sublingually david hudson no it is just ingestion in the stomachjust a capsule binga is she any closer to giving her permission david hudson i think if i wanted to do it right now she would ok it binga as far as the iridium david hudson what you got to understand is this is a commitment you know you have to change your whole life style i mean it will change like it or not and i have made a commitment to build this plant and i have to get this plant built no one else can do it so my whole focus now is on getting this plant built when its built and on line and working then i will take it binga and we are talking the gold here right or are we talking rhodium iridium david hudson ill take the rhodium iridium first i think you have to perfect your body before you make it permanent okay i just think you need to adjust this whole thing about seeing the angels and communicating with the spirits and all this you got to get used to it i think binga yes its not something you just decide you are going to do one day david hudson i think its heavy duty stuff i think a person really needs to think about it before they do it binga yes im finding that more and more even with faced with the choices of taking this other material lets just say that it did perform the way they sayi feel that i need to be here at present  here because i have work to do and maybe later i will take it depending on whats going on lets see no one has taken the gold when you took little amounts did you take gold david hudson yes it was binga did you have any affects david hudson i dont know you tell me binga i didnt know you before that you may be psychic for all i know david hudson i do just seem to have information i dont know where it comes from i accept it it seems to be correct it seems to be accurate and there is a lot of things i do know but people will become very uncomfortable if i start talking about this i have to get this plant built thats what i can tell you binga how much did you take over that three day perioddid you measure it david hudson we dispersed it in water i had a jug of water that i was drinking from that contained the gold probably  or  mg total binga and it was in a onegallon jug david hudson water yeah binga has anyone to date completed the full iridiumrhodium course david hudson no binga is anybody scheduled to david hudson i dont know what the full course is binga well has anybody gone nine months david hudson no one has ever taken it past six months binga there are people who are obviously taking it nowfor a variety of reasons david hudson no binga nobody is taking it david hudson no one is taking it for philosophical reasons now binga we are skipping to another questionbecause in your january newsletter you mention that two people have purchased large quantities of white powder for ingestion david hudson that is correct but it is not gold binga i thought we were talking iridiumrhodium david hudson iridiumrhodiumno no one is taking it there is some people who have taken it in high amounts for their own personal reasons but they cant just say dave ive got to have it give it to me binga to your knowledge no one has taken it for nine months its only been six months david hudson you know the material is too expensive first of all i feel embarrassed asking the amount of money it takes and they feel embarrassed paying it so the best thing to do is just wait until the plant is on line and then it will be very inexpensive and lots of it binga well the reason i asked that question is that there are some people who would like to get first person anecdotal information from people who have taken the material david hudson all of the medical studies we are doing i think will show the information they are going to need and then what they should do is just ease into it very gently themselves binga when will you be able to make that information available david hudson well i am sharing it im just not giving you the names of the people this next newsletter is going to have more specific information will actually have the names of the companies that are doing the testing and some of the results also got some charts that show and they are doing studies on healthy tissue as well as cancer tissue they are finding there seems to be no adverse affect on healthy tissue binga are you going to be giving the amounts that are administered david hudson these are cell culture studies and you know this sounds like science but in fact this is whats happening these are living cellstaken out of the body and are grown in these cell cultures binga we are waiting for that information and thats great david hudson that is very significant information binga absolutely because what has been going on now is we get all these accounts that are third and forthperson hearsay and you never know who is saying what about anything and what is true and whats not david hudson if i seem a little conservative easing into thisyou know you have got to be conservative with it binga well if you dont then well get down the line and people will go yeah well what about this and what about the blind studies and what about you know its not that you have to prove yourself but people will want to have things substantiated using the scientific method thats what most of the people consider david hudson you got it ill be sure i have all of it binga thats what im dealing with on a daytoday basis david hudson if they cant get it from me they are going to hit you over the head binga well no i cant tell them what i dont know thats one of the big rules you know we cant talk about things we dont have first hand information or experiential informationbecause thats how rumors get started and thats how misinformation gets perpetuated and im simply not going to be a part of that you mentioned an arizona guy back in the dallas lecturethat he had become really disturbed that he lived in north phoenix david hudson if you have listened to the tapes i made down there florida i do discuss that thoroughly whats happened to him binga i was there david hudson play the tape again binga okay ive got a note here tampa are we ever going to be able to talk with people who have taken this stuff david hudson i will be giving you the names of the people doing the research the people who took it initially with methat was illegal so you know i really incriminate myself if i give specific things with that but the work thats being reproduced under nih auspices and the doctors who are working with the cell cultures and all thati will be giving you all their names when i have the written reports in my hands and anybody can call them to confirm it you know did you actually do this was this the result you sawyou know because ill have the documents in my hands i can tell people that when i have the documents in my hands binga if you wouldnt mind if you would check with them if they could set up an email address for questions david hudson you know these people are research people they are not in the business of answering so it would be best rather than everybody call these peopleone person or two people call and then make the information available binga well i would rather answer email than have to take a phone call i personally wouldnt post the email address unless they gave their permission but if they are of the mind to do thatjust say email to them and see if they are willing david hudson ive never done it i know nothing about it binga you know nothing about no computers im going to drag you into this whether you like it or not david hudson i need to give that to you too the new number for the ormes llc area code   fax number   this is the number for science of the spirit memberships they are sending out all these letters that everybody is going to scream about in the next two weeksto all the people who have the ious this number is answered from    weekdays see im going to quit taking these calls before long binga are you david hudson yeah only people who have medical problems will i talk to you would be surprised of the people who listen to these tapes and still want to get memberships they are still calling me mod note as of june  there were  of the  sosf memberships were still available on the date of this interview there were  iouspostdated checks and  people on the waiting list letters indicating a payment deadline of july  have been mailed but as sosf receives a large amount of mail daily it is hard to estimate the number of memberships still available if any until after the july  deadline has passed binga are you considering putting a warning on the packaging of this material david hudson nope binga caution dont operate heavy machinery especially if you are having kundalini experiences david hudson by the time membership starts getting this material i think we will be very conversant on the subject of this material and there seems to be no adverse affects so whatever they do with it is totally up to them they can dump it in the river or they can swallow it all at one intake i dont care they will have to pump their stomach to get rid of it binga when do you anticipate getting it out david hudson im still looking at march or april of next year it will be online around the first of the year the equipment is going to start arriving in the next week all the floors are painted the buildings are up the asphalt is laid the security fences are up security gates electricity is to the property we are just going to bring whatever electricity we need to run everything binga did you get the death rays out too david hudson yes i did i know how to do that and know how not to do it binga so whats going on with the clinical studies you said that they are doing cell testing on cultures david hudson yeah they reproduced it the nih has reproduced it merck industries has reproduced it the place under the rhodium chloride which is the form the rhodium goes to when taken in the stomach rhodium chloride when it is placed in the presence of the cancer cells it causes the cancer cells to slow down their activity by  and that means that they are actually acting like a healthy tissue not cancer tissue binga so it brings it down to a level where they are acting normally david hudson thats correct and that has never been seen by any cancer researchers you know what they are looking at is killing cancer tissue and not hurting healthy tissue this doesnt kill anything this just slows it down until it acts normal it seems to have no affect at all on healthy tissue and they are very intrigued with this how is it working because there seems to be no chemistry involved binga so it seems that cancer cells are sped up cells david hudson yes they are normal cells that have literally been altered in some way and this seems to be correcting it now they are measuring the reproduction of the amino acids and all that are being produced in the dna when a cell divides and they are determining what really is going on the dna level basically you have got to understand they cannot grow a healthy tissue over an extended period of time in cell cultures they can grow cancer cells very easily and so what they have done is to study the healthy tissues to see what affect it had but they are not doing long term studies they are working in cancer because they can grow it they are working on liver cancer breast cancers all different kinds of cancers i have a whole list of them here binga are they doing aids research too david hudson they are also doing aids hiv research in new york binga thats on cell cultures also david hudson no the hiv is just the people binga do they have anything to report yet david hudson i should have that paperwork next week and i intend to have it in the next newsletter binga boy this is going to be a juicy newsletter david hudson its just going to grow on you heavier and heavier binga with graphs and charts and email addresses david hudson we are getting real cocky now we are getting enough people to reproduce these results we are getting it all documented i will slowly but surely release this binga so are you supplying them with the material or are they making it on their own david hudson yes i am giving it to hiv patients at no charge im giving it to the research people at no charge binga so they are just using your stuff david hudson that is correct binga how long have the tests been going on with the cancer research its been a while david hudson about five months now binga when are they going to release the information to the public david hudson the private researcher who did it initially and found how to put it into the solution has sent the material out to other universities and cancer research clinics to reproduce the work and he is now getting back reports on their findings also and they are finding the very same thing that he found and so now i am getting documentation and paperwork now i can start talking about it binga once you do that are you going to try to go through normal channels like with the fda david hudson well this is not analyzable so you cant go through normal channels but there is nothing wrong with having all the scientific data binga and you are still going to maintain that it is a religious rite david hudson if you could lay on your hands and cure cancer and every time you go in and lay on your hands you could cure cancer and doctors come in and confirm this person has cancer you lay on your hands and they confirm he doesnt have cancer that may not be science but it has been confirmed scientifically that it works binga the key is that they cant tell how it works and if they could tell how then they would kick it over to the fda david hudson right they dont know how this works they dont even know what it is that they are testing and they are also running blanks they are also running the same cell culture under the very same condition except that there is none of the ormes there and it doesnt work and they are running standard rhodium trichloride commercially and it doesnt work like this works binga you arent concerned that somebody isnt going to step in from the powers that be and david hudson no i welcome it first they have to tell me what it is they are wanting but thats why i have to be careful and dont divulge too much too fast but we are getting some very powerful results and like it or not when it comes down towill this hurt me what will happen physiologically when i take it in the macro amount basically it perfects the body and there seems to be no adverse affect at all this should really be a comfort to people who are willing to take it now whats going to happen psychologically whats going to happen to their intuition binga thats just the beginning of that david hudson oh yeah and you know i could tell you that physically there will be no damage but emotionally boy this is going to get heavy duty real quick binga you had made some references to dna modification by sysplatinum do you have a reference for that david hudson right binga there is a subscriber who works with tumor immunology who would like to read up on that david hudson yeah he should get a copy of platinum metals review platinum metals review is published quarterly by johnson matthey over in london binga do you have a particular issue david hudson every issue has a whole section on use of precious elements in cancer just tell him to get the last  years of platinum metals review go to a good university and if they dont have it inter library loan it binga do you know what the exact mechanism is at work when the dna relaxes and recombines david hudson no we do not and that is what we want to understand because they have confirmed that the cell is over here and the rhodium is over there and yet relaxation seems to occur and they want to know how is this occurring well i tell you it is through a resonant vibration that we call the spirit thats what philosophical people call it when we understand what the mechanism is we will be right in the middle of the whole philosophy i guarantee it binga and there is my next question do you have tangible proof of the light bodys existence david hudson we have indirect confirmation of it we are seeing the results and affects of it and we are studying what goes on with it but i dont think you ever can actually see it or measure it because i think its two waysequal and opposite and cannot be measured its the same thing as superconductivity superconductivity cannot be directly measured binga the effects can be measured david hudson thats right indirectly you can see all the effects but directly there is no direct measurement because there is no differential therefore no instrumentation will deflect so we are caught with the very same problem as measuring superconductivity binga so could you speculate that maybe there would be a way of measuring it just wouldnt involve electromagnetic forces david hudson well the neat thing about it is you can actually make these white powders and seal hem in an ampoule and then bring them out into the atmosphere in a sealed ampoule so there is no air interacting with it and literally when it passes near the body and enters your aura it literally floats so we now have an aura detector and no one has ever been able to come up with a machine that interacts with the aura now we have an aura detector binga there was some speculation that this material can be used as a psionic amplifier which i guess it would be the same kind of thing not a detector as much but it would allow a detector toand i may be getting into an area that i cant sustain in intelligent conversation david hudson it would be inappropriate for me to comment on that i dont know enough about it is the psionic detector anything like the sciatic nerve binga i dont think so from my understanding psionics is subtle energy field work and being able to detect subtle energy david hudson there is a difference be psychiatry and cell biology i would rather stay with the cell biology binga we have plenty of other questions that may be of more importance and you may have already said all you could say on this but i was just curious as to your current status on your nih alliance david hudson the nih funding goes to bastyr university and it is administered to them bastyr university simply oversees the doctors who have registered with them and keeps track of the patients who are working under the doctors super vision thats all they do they do not administer anything they simply keep records and document whats going on binga so they dont know whats going on other than this person is signed up to david hudson well i have been up there and they know it involves my material and this doctor is working with me they know that it is not on record binga so you have one guy who is working and this is the aids project david hudson thats correct we are going to have so much hard information on thatsee the next year they will proceed with those things that seem to be working best binga are you currently doing any genetic research david hudson yeah thats what all these people in cancer research arethey are geneticists the man who actually found this first is a man who literally takes the dna apart and puts the genes where he wants them and puts them back together and he is speaking in europe right now last week and this week he is speaking over there on the problems of the genetic changes in the engineered materials that are coming on the market and the potential changes that occur in our dna due to those dna changes binga has he already spoken david hudson he is speaking in copenhagen britain rome all over the place binga would you be able to say who he is and where he is speaking david hudson no i promised him anonymity for a few more weeks all they got to do is find out about those conferences where these hearings are going on he spoke over her at the hearing in canada the week before last this week and next week he is going to go over on wednesday binga what is he speaking on again david hudson they are having hearings over there on the use of engineered genetic material in food stuffs hearings all over the common market counters whether to allow it and to license it and to put it on the market whether you should tell the public about it or let them just slip it in and he is just saying that he believes that the public should be made aware that this is genetically engineered material you should let them decide whether they want it but dont make them think its the very same thing they have been eating for thousands of years because its not of course the people monsanto and people like this who are making it dont want the public to know about it if it gets on the market then you got no choice you got to have this stuff binga so this is the same man thats doing the cancer research david hudson he is the one that did the initial cancer research yes he is very prominent and very articulate and very wellrespected in that community he used to work with the nih everybody knows him people could put twoandtwo together and figure out who he is binga the next two questions call for speculation several of us are wondering if perhaps ormes does nothing but rather there are nonphysical entities feeding us this info through you and that consuming white powder gold enables them to manipulate the mind thereby causing the symptoms in the user that are attributed to ormes this may be for their own agenda whether it be for good or evil this could also be said for the existence of chakras and kundalini flow perhaps they are using the scientific and philosophical info to fool the best scientific minds on the planet into thinking that it is the ormes that is creating these effects david hudson obviously this person is not a member of the science of spirit foundation and i strongly encourage them not to become a member until they can reconcile this in their own self binga if ormes was the manna of the children of israel during their  years of wandering in the desert why didnt they exhibit any of the effects of it history shows that they maintained their negative characteristics even though they used manna for many years how do you explain this and i have some references from the dallas lecture that says and i will paraphrase ityou will have a new name when you ingest this and you will be a different person when you become filled with the spirit when you become filled with the chrism you are not the same person you were before david hudson right yeah i wasnt there when the hebrew people were supposedly communing the god binga you werent david hudson no i wasnt but i believe when you carefully study the story of moses you find out that there is actually two books there is the one when god dwelt with them at the time of sinai and there is another book and if you carefully study the story of the exodus there is actually two texts here written by two completely separate authors i dont know and i cannot say whether or not moses actually existed okay i cant say that i dont know that he really existed i believe that he symbolizes and the exodus symbolized a time when god dwelt with the people and i think after sinai it symbolized a time when god withdrew from the people i think this is in all the ancient texts you read all of them talk about a time when the gods lived here and dwelt with us and we knew the gods and then a time when the god left and then we were here by ourselves and i think thats a symbolic meaning of the story of the exodus i think its like many other things in the early part of the bible its truth and its accurate as far as the nature of the story but it doesnt mean that every piece of it is recorded history and so i really just think every person has to read it for their own self dont ask meread it themselves read the books that i presented dont judge me judge the books let them stand on their own merits i told everybody you can have twenty people standing on four corners of an intersection and have two cars run together and have an accident walk around and interview everyone standing there who saw the accident and there is twenty people and you will have   different versions binga you may have  different versions they may change their minds after they hear the person next to them david hudson so you know what i do is i read the texts and when i begin to see text from india texts from china japan text from turkey text from hebrew text from africa they all basically tell the same conceptual stories then i say these are coincidences so you know im not saying its so im saying boy its interesting and we see that these aspects of it all are correct when the accident occurs you interview all the people but basically they will all agree on several things first of all there is two cars they ran together there is something that everybody agrees on now beyond that you find out that you find out that everybody has their own perspective and bias so you have to take all that with a grain of salt people should approach this that what i am working with is like taking an iron pill and you know you get up to certain levels of iron and it begins to be toxic and you have a problem well we are finding there is no toxicity so i think its part of proper health and nutrition to have this in their body all these elements help protect the organs and help us perform as we should okay that we know what else does it do i just find it intriguing that this possibility might exist and what we have tested thus far indicates that it is happening binga if just  of what youre saying happens its a miracle david hudson yes it is and so im saying is it not enough we are going to have fuel cells is it not enough we are going to have metaloceramics and turbulent turbo propulsion system is it not enough we are going to cure cancer and hiv are these not enough must you have philosophical also binga we want biolocation david hudson okay i hear you we will show you i think how this will happen and how it can be done i think this material will dramatically assist you in doing that but i cant prove it at this time so it is better that i dont represent that its going to do this binga there are currently products on the market which reportedly contain monatomic have you tested these products david hudson which ones binga etherium gold isis white powder gold david hudson i tested isis white powder ive tested etherium ive tested manitol  none of them contain any gold binga acemannan david hudson acemannan does not contain any gold but it contains  rhodium binga maharishi amrit kalash david hudson i dont have the numbers but it is quite high in rhodium and iridium both binga what process did you use to test it david hudson that was done at miu they actually did the analysis with my supervision i was showing them how to do quantitative analysis upon natural products and they actually have the numbers not me binga so you did a bench mark test with all those other materials david hudson no with the amrit kalash i just said give me some material that you use for medicinal purposes for cancer or for hiv and they said well that would be amrit kalash i said fine lets take some of it and it looks like lets scoop some of it up and do an analysis on it and we ran it about a week and a half we did quantitative separation of rhodium and iridium and theres a bunch binga the highest you found in anything david hudson oh no the acemannan is the highest we found in anything we are talking about probably  maybe of both rhodium and iridium in the amrit kalash binga as opposed to your  david hudson thats correct or opposed to  like acemannan of the rhodium binga oh so  vs  david hudson yes acemannan is a very very special product thats why when mcdaniels was there in dallas i acknowledged his work binga are you aware there is a guy in canada making some david hudson making what binga acemannan david hudson no and im not aware of that material im only aware of carrington laboratorys material binga is it possible to measure parts per million with the analysis you did on the etherium david hudson well on their label they claim they have  parts per million if they are analyzing it the way they claim it is a metallic and therefore a poison okay if it is really there by the way they analyze work it is not doing any good in your body binga so there is no way to check this spectroscopically and analyze the monatomics david hudson thats right there is no way they are doing it i absolutely guarantee it binga what is the way you analyze for monatomics david hudson thats part of the proprietary process you chemically do the analysis binga are there any labs that are qualified to analyze at this point david hudson not that i have been able to hire i have been to the best binga and nobody is capable of doing it david hudson they can be taught i paid some to do it and taught them but they had to sign confidentiality agreements they cant do it now commercially binga so how did you do it at miu you just told them how to do it david hudson yes i stayed there with them and walked them through the whole process binga so when you tested the etherium and isis you tested it i guess with your own lab david hudson yes my own master chemist binga do you have any comments about etherium other than it doesnt have monatomics in it and its toxic if monatomics are being assayed in the manner they describe david hudson many people who have used it claim that it does help their meditations okay the people who are serious mediators all i can tell you is like marijuana will also help their meditations you know i do not know what is really there i know that it does not contain monatomic gold binga you dont know if it contains iridium or rhodium either david hudson i can absolutely guarantee as far as the precious elements in the monatomic form there is zilch there you will get more drinking one glass of carrot juice every two or three days then you get taking their material binga that reminds me on this seneca grape juice thingwe talked about that before it registers really high in monatomics but you said the sugar offsets whatever benefit you might get so carrot juice is probably the best david hudson yes that is my opinion mod note i really wish that id thought to ask him why sugar offsets the benefits binga here is a question that references the dallas lectureand i dont want to read it all it just says where things burn off at different rates the question is though where do  david hudson dont believe that given the information i gave you at the dallas lecture that people can actually figure out how do this on their own there is a whole bunch more going on here that i didnt tell you about binga the question is where do the normal metallic forms of these elements read david hudson that was what i was telling youwhere they read get a copy of the book which is called the analytical chemistry of the platinum group elements by ginsburg and look under spectroscopic section and you will find all the references binga and this is what you were quoting in the dallas lecture david hudson right binga next question there are a couple of different things one in portland where you are talking about the white gold fusing into glass david hudson yes binga in portland you say at is at  and from the uk patent it says that its at  and the question is whats the exact temperature david hudson white gold melts at  but we are doing all this under a controlled atmosphere in a tube furnace and you have to get above the temperature that it physically melts  is when gold melts but you heat a furnace to  with gold and it wont melt you have to go above it so if i tell people  in a patent at  it will melt at  you get it to melt as long as you get it under a vacuum system it will melt and you should know that i have a fourtube furnace six foot long tubes eight inch tubes and each one has huge vacuum pumps on each tube so i can actually pull vacuums on this while im heating it thats my production furnace its custom made for ibm costs  million they ran it for a week and a half and shut it down they sold their facilityand i ended up getting it it is such an immense machine i had to build a separate building just to put the machine in it binga and the people who were selling it said well we dont know what it is but it sure is pretty david hudson they knew what it was they got eight or ten of them here but this one is far bigger than any its just not the kind of thing that people in research need it has automatic feeders that actually feed the boats full of material in and yet they never touch the boat the boat never touches the tube it actually feeds it in and suspends it in there on the feeder all while in a vacuum and you can feed your gases in and they are being vacuumed out as fast as you are feeding them in so they never create an atmosphere they are actually on a negative pressure all the time it is quite fantastic twentyfive feet long about  high i just cant believe i got the thing whoa its a brand new machine binga its better than getting a pony for christmas david hudson the guy that is setting it all up for me said dave buy it i would ask  to  for it thats used binga and they hadnt used it a week and its in perfect condition david hudson extra tubes with it and everything all the equipment ive got here with all its glasslined tanks if you can imagine a  gallon steel tank glasslined where would you find such a thing binga joel  jerrys deep discount david hudson you know stouffer chemical up in the bay area is moving to georgia and are shutting down their labs and everything they had was for sale reactors chemical storage tanks glasslined pipes valves everything they are just scrapping it out salvage i bet you i bought thirty glasslined tanksand where do you find glasslined tanks binga not at walmart ill tell you david hudson everybody has gone to plastic now im heating these acids and so not only does it have to be chemically resistant but it has to be high temperature when you walk in this building you are going to say my god my godwhat is dave doing in here david hudson its going to look like a petroleum refinery binga now i know you talked before about monatomics being nontoxic how did you determine that monatomics are not toxic david hudson well just from the work we have done with it the people who have taken it there have been no adverse affects and now with the cancer studies going on they have determined there is no adverse affects the doctors who are doing it say dave you know we would have no reservations about having someone take it you put precious metals into these cell cultures and they literally kill the cells in that area and this stuff has no affect at all on healthy tissues none at all binga so i guess the monatomic osmiumeven though osmium is toxic on a metallic level wouldnt be a consideration david hudson yeah you just dont want to be heating it and distilling it because this osmium tetraoxide is still poisonous and it will affect the ocular tissue if you heat it and volatize it but in the form you will be getting it and the way you people will handle it is no problem binga what levels of temperature are we talking about as far as heating it david hudson oh like  degrees binga so its not like if you left it in your car david hudson no binga there is a question as to the phone number for argon national laboratories or where they are david hudson united states government national research facility if they cant find that one i feel sorry for them if they call the argon directory assistance in argon illinois and ask for argon national laboratories they will get a number binga and mike mcnallen  david hudson is not at argon national binga no hes mit metallurgical chemist i understand that do you have a phone number is he still at mit david hudson certainly i do binga is he at mit still david hudson no hes not he is in the chicago area binga okay well thats about all im going to get out of you on that one david hudson you got it binga i can tell when the holes getting dry you mentioned in several places that nitrous oxide and also short wave uv light will despin the monatomic platinum group elements into their metallic form david hudson thats not correct thats not what i said david hudson ultraviolet light will yes binga will nitrous oxide david hudson no thats the wrong word for your information its nitric oxide its not n its not no its no its called nitric oxide binga okay so nitric oxide will despin the monatomic platinum group elements into their metallic forms david hudson it will take them from the highspin state back to the lowspin state they are still monatomic it kills the atoms in your body thats what people have to understand it kills the atoms in their body and no longer flows the light in that area binga the nitric oxide does david hudson the nitric oxide does okay when it kills it it also does something else when it kills it a one million electron volt photon is produced and that is gamma level and it is always absorbed by the binding atom that is binding it but the electron pair that is annihilated is not now under the control of the ormes material it is now under the control of nitric oxide and so the nitric oxide now becomes radioactive carbon  binga in the body david hudson in the body so nitrogen  becomes radioactive carbon  in the body when it kills the highspin state back to low spin state this is how they date corpses when they find a corpse  years old they date it by radioactive carbon binga yes carbon dating david hudson because they know that radioactive carbon  appears in living beings and when they die it stops being produced this is whats going on onepercent of the air you breathe is nitric oxide you must breathe oxygen to live and yet in doing it you are dying binga oh i love that david hudson and that is a paradox isnt it thats the way it works and these atoms are continually dying in your body and you are getting a few more every time you eat the right stuff but you are not getting as much as are dying binga so its a deficit thing david hudson you only got  years and you are gone the light is actually so diminished that it literally quits flowing and then stops and you are dead now if you could put these atoms back into the body to offset those that are being pinned then you literally correct the dna in all the cells it could be back like it was when you were a teenager and you can live for  years binga so you are banking it basically david hudson thats it binga okay we have already covered the status of the production facility and you said in march or april you will start with the distribution david hudson right ninety days after it becomes online then we will be able to tally up divide it up and send it out to members binga and how much finished product per day are you anticipating david hudson we are looking at least  mg mod note estimated perdiemper membership distribution of the monatomic gold is  mgs gold and  mgs monoatomic iridium and rhodium binga thats a daily total david hudson so you will get a shipment of  times that amount binga how do you intend to distribute it is it going out quarterly ups david hudson yes quarterly and it will go by ups right now unless we can think of somebody who is cheaper binga and in what forms will it come in will it be separated gold iridium david hudson all separated in individual containers depending on the amounts that you are getting it will be in individual containers and identified as such it will be orme ruthenium orme osmium orme platinum orme palladium orme rhodium orme iridium and orme gold binga so what are you supposed to do with all those other elements what do they do david hudson well thats what we are studying and we will be telling people as we get the results binga oh so it will be like you get the red powder and the green powder david hudson they are all gray to white now if we were making the chloride then they get dramatically different but i believe that it is altogether possible for people who need it for medicinal purposes they will want it in the chloride form because even though when it absorbs in the body it lets go of the chloride it does act as a dispersing agent and makes your body  capable of absorbing all of it whereas if you take it as a powder all the rhodium gets absorbed most of the iridium doesnt so as we develop these results we will be sharing that with the membership also binga in the chloride form is it a liquid david hudson no the chloride form is a dry powder but like rhodium is a red powder gold is an orangy red iridium is a green it is actually a crystalline material binga so you just ingest it david hudson yes but you can put that in water and dissolve it binga how soon in the future will everyone on the planet be taking this material david hudson within three years binga that quickly david hudson yes you just watch just see what happens the momentum is just going to build continually binga when you show up on dateline thats when its going to hit the fani know there are some bad boys out there david hudson they wont understand it theyll say hes just off his rocker binga why didnt you sell metallic gold to finance your production facility david hudson thats what i tried to do originally and when i finally learned how to do it my partners were not able to deliver the money thats why i had to sue them and it was only the beginning of last year when i was in total bankruptcy myself i finally won the judgment against these guys but i have no money myself i had nothing a year ago nothing i didnt have a home i didnt have anything how do you built a plant with nothing so im building a pilot system with these donations now remember this is a pilot system but it is going to produce one ton a day of material we will have finished product coming out binga how many other facilities are you going to build david hudson you watch this thing is going to go binga what is your connection to the rockefellers david hudson they had me to the rockefeller center i met with bootsy galbreith and peter chris  i forgot his name anyway the head of the rockefeller foundation about this bootsy was in awe of this and came out here to arizona and spent about a week writing up all my paperwork for me she took it back to peter chris who is in charge of both david and lawrences money but she told me peter was a onepage guy if it has more than one page he wont read it she came back with about eight or nine inches of folders and documents and peter chris would never look at it after about two weeks she said dave i dont think hes ever going to read it and i said send it back bootsy so she sent it back and they have nothing on me now ok binga some people have mailed checks and had them cashed and then they havent heard anything and hadnt gotten any newsletters do you know what thats about david hudson if that has happened and its been over say a month and a half tell them to give us a call preferably call the number i just gave you and if they have a copy of that check where they can send us a copy and its endorse by us and they are not listed we will get them listed most of these people just send a check and it has only been two or three weeks and they havent received anything so they get all nervous what i have done now that all the memberships are sold im holding issuing any memberships until i got these letters out then i told my son to go ahead and take the first  because i know we will have that many who will forfeitand go ahead and send them their receipt but to not get crazy on this to hold back to be sure what number we have binga you stated before that you were going to give away the ormes material david hudson thats correct yes we are we will solicit a donation but if you dont have the money then well give it to you binga how do you think that will affect the people of the foundation who have paid for the material david hudson everybody had to have listened to tapes or heard my presentation so i told everybody on the tape they are saying dave we want to help build this plant if we dont get it built nobody gets anything a lot of them say they dont care whether they even have a membership they just want to help the project well the membership will get it about a year earlier than the general public thats what most people want they just want it now the general public will be offered it and people will not be drawn to it i people who come here present themselves and ask for the material and they say dave ive given all my money to the poor and the needy i dont have any money yet they drive up in a brand new rolls royce and tell me they dont have any money i know its not true i think you will see it will all resolve itself okay binga you stated that you cant sell the material why is that david hudson you cant sell the ormes product binga because of the foundation david hudson well there is all sorts of legal reasons too but its not correct youre selling the spirit and the spirit is not to be sold this is just a substance that literally receives the spirit vibration and brings it into our material body you cannot sell that that is something that is far greater than money you go to the wealthiest man in the world and ask him if he would like to live another year or if he wants his money and he will say god where do i sign you can have all my money so whats money worth we are going to be making  a day on the balance of the material  is going to the membership  im setting aside to give away i will give more if people need it binga well the whole concept of money wealth and ownership is going to go out the window anyway david hudson thats right and every bit of my money whatever it might be goes to an offshore trust that then is all set up to be given away anyway so if anybody worries what im getting its all going for medical research it isnt really going for dave hudson personally binga somebody is asking about that nasa where you can scrape off the tissue out of the cheek of the astronauts david hudson ask joe champion about it joe got upset when i said that too he said where did you find that out davenobody is supposed to know that i read about that in one of the books i had it is known now okay and just ask joe and he will tell you and he can add to the story a little bit binga has your information been published by any mainstream physics journals david hudson not that im aware of binga will it occur in the near future david hudson im being asked by a professor bochrist to come back down there he says they are having a cold fusion conference strictly on the subject of the asymmetric deformed highspin state and he is wanting to talk to me they may get this published i dont know binga would you be interested in collaborating with hal puthoff david hudson if puthoff was interested in it but i dont want people pushing puthoff to do it i think it is more appropriate to have somebody like these guys on the cold fusion come forward with it they have the credentials but they are being poohpoohed right now they have something at stake i think its more appropriate to introduce it as the highspin state this whole subject is now in all the journals everybody is talking about the highspin state of these atoms now binga whats the current state of the fuel cell research david hudson you know the fuel cell research is basically all proven its in place right now ge westinghouse all these people have it most of the patents have run out the best people right now is ballard research up in vancouver we have not contacted them because when we arrive we are going to bring a bucket of material and just say mount it in the electrodes for us we will contract with them and do it but right now if you want to check them out ballard research in vancouver is by far the most advanced people right now in the solid polymer electrolyte technology binga do you see it as something that is going to be suppressed david hudson the energy power research institute which does all the advanced testing for all the commercial utility companies has concluded that fuel cells are the power system of the s this is  they are ready right now the japanese have built the plants they are online all were waiting for is the catalyst binga somebody i know has some buckets of it david hudson when we arrive they are going to welcome us they are going to say who are you and were going to say we are the guys with the buckets binga okay we are down to the last thing and the last one is more of a suggestion which deals with something that this person sees as a genuine obstacle for the commercial success of the rhodium plant and how it would affect all of those interested in seeing your work succeed should this problem go unsolved the concept occurred to him the instant he heard you speaking at the portland appearance here is what he says you mentioned in your july  portland presentation that there is a nine month delay involved in reducing the monatomic state to metal david hudson yeah i have just successfully found a way of doing it in about fifteen seconds binga does it involve nuclear magnetic resonance david hudson no it did not binga do you want to elaborate on it david hudson no we do not the gentleman who has built it has run it and its working and he called and told me what he was doing an i said i can tell you exactly what to do and i told him what he was doing in detail and he said thats correct and i assumed it can be done that way but i hadnt proved it and he has done it built it it cost him  million but hes done it so i bought the equipment and we are going to be building that also binga do you want to hear this guys suggestion david hudson what binga have you considered using nmr to add energy to the carbon atom in the complex as a means of transferring energy into the system david hudson yes we have and we can actually resonate the nucleus for a period of time and then switch it to the next frequency that the nucleus would resonate and literally take it up in energy stepbystep by doing that and yes we have followed it and it would have to be a complete research project from ground zero to learn how to do it and we figured out a way to donow in about  seconds now and we are building this equipment binga okay so youre all set then david hudson yes mother nature does it over time but then we just hit it and its there binga now we have talked about this before but i wondered if you changed your mind about including information on a web page david hudson we have not changed our mind binga the answer is still no david hudson right right no binga would you give permission to post past newsletters to the forum david hudson i would rather not there has got to be a reason for being members and so only when all the memberships are gone there is no hope then i will consider it okay binga there was another questioni must have skipped it are you still writing your book david hudson i havent been doing anything on it but it will be written and will be published by the time the plant is in production and marketing to the general public binga would you be interested in answering another set of questions at some point david hudson not really i wasnt interested in this only because its you i wouldnt do it for anybody else mod note this concludes the phone interview with david hudson although i am a member of sosf and helped bring david to tampa i am in no way officially connected to hudson or his organizations as such i docanwill not speak

i came across a new product in my vocabulary hudson reed and after looking at their website i fell in love with their classic faucets the price is very good but my husband is extremely picky about good faucets and leaking so in everyones opinion are these faucets worth the money i am comparing them to standard kohler moen and american standard that dont leak i luv the look very much and must convince my husband that they wont leak so please tell me your experience with them email commentbookmarklike comments  thank you for reporting this comment undo sweeby that beautiful hudson reed faucet was one i picked up on ebay for   seriously actually i got two of them for  because the first one that arrived had a small nick in one of the handles so i wrote to hr asking for a replacement handle they sent me a replacement faucet with most gracious apologies for my trouble insisting that i keep both as it wasnt fair to ask me to ship it back and the nick was small enough that i decided to use the second faucet anyway rather than buy another one though i hear they are probably made in china they appear to be very well made  heavy nice surfaces smooth turning action no plastic parts the made in china theory certainly makes sense given the price though i saw no evidence of that in the workmanship and hubby  who is also very picky  was favorably impressed he did the plumbing and agrees with those who say you have to read the instructions and the instructions are lousy  but otherwise really likes the faucets would i buy them again for a lavatory faucet absolutely the risk simply isnt that great you can put a drip pan in the vanity if youre nervous and a lavatory faucet is easy to replace down the road if need be we also used one of their exposed valve shower fixtures and are very happy with it since we bought ours which is also very nice and heavy  works great the price has been cut nearly in half so i cant see how it could be exactly the same item for that reason alone id have trouble recommending it while i had some reservations before buying mine for the price difference between the hr and the rohl i figured the chance was worth taking plus if it didnt work well since the valve was surface mounted rather than inside a wall again  the risk was lower   likes    bookmark     march   at pm thank you for reporting this comment undo dreamywhite thank you for your quick response do you or does your husband know if they are made of the solid brass construction like kohler the website does not state much and i asked  questions on their website last evening with no response as of yet i need to also know if the rough in valve comes with the wall mounted tub filler again the website does not state unless i am missing something we have a regular but extra large tub going in and then a walk in shower which i already purchased the kohler faucets for i just luv the look of the hd topaz faucets and want to get  to match the tub filler im just scared cuz if they turn out to be like a generic brand like pp or something my hubby is not going to be happy he just spent  hours fixing an old faucet last evening that was a generic brand im glad to hear that your husband did the plumbing and mine will also these are the prettiest ones for the money i must admit here is a link that might be useful hudson reed wall mounted tub filler  like    bookmark

your exposed shower systemi have been researching these and trying to find one that fits my budget the hudson reed systems are at a price that also makes me concerned they are too good to be true they state they are made of brass i know that you expressed concern the quality has changed since you purchased yours but can you tell me how you like the handshower of the one you currently have would the handshower be sufficient to use on its own wout the rainshower head mrs limestone has a sign of the crab shower system that she likes except she said that the handshower does not have enough pressure she said she is not sure whether thats due to the handshower itself or her plumbing is your system thermostatic i have been swooning over your recent batrhoom pictures and then i saw your recent post

reviews to see if their customer service feedback is still fabulous the handshower is amazing not just good but amazing the best ive ever experienced i use the rain shower head for most of my shower but switch to the handheld for rinsing shampoo out of my hair its a strong powerful spray and the fixture itself also feels solid and heavy now we do have a good dedicated water supply and i generally shower at odd hours so that may be a factor but the handheld itself is really nice i hate those little flimsy ones  like    bookmark     march   at pm thank you for reporting this comment undo

at pm thank you for reporting this comment undo jpmvan i took a chance and ordered an exposed hudson reed thermostatic shower valve similar to sweebys it is the  version which has a slightly different look that is very similar to the restoration hardware version i have not installed it yet or taken it apart to see how it works but im very impressed with the appearances the valve is very heavy solid brass and the chrome plating on all the parts is perfect the other elbow fittings and couplings and shower rose are all also quite solidly made of brassmetal with a nice chrome finish im impressed by the little details like the lever handle on the valve and the hand grip on the shower handset are porcelain instead of plastic the only exposed piece of plastic is a nonessential wall mounted hose organizer for the hand shower that i dont plan on using the hr valve has an adjustable mount for the hand shower that installs on the exposed pipes whereas the restoration hardware valve has a wall mount bracket the restoration hardware installation instructions are an excellent reference even for the hudson reed  im guessing this style of shower valve was invented ages ago and the basics havent changed much the hudson reed instructions are confusing on so many levels and the rh instructions make it all instantly clear other differences the hr faucet has backflowcheck valves and filters on the hotcold supply going into the valve there is no check valveantisiphon on the shower rose or hand shower the restoration hardware has filters on the supply lines and then check valves on the showerhand shower price was excellent about th of restoration hardware  like    bookmark     april   at am thank you for reporting this comment undo sweeby so glad to hear that jpmvan mines still working perfectly  so no complaints about hudson reed from me on the installation of the shower fittings the one key piece of information to remember is that the hr fittings use englishmetric sizes which arent the same as north american essentially the inside the wall parts will be north american sizes but the fixture itself will be metric when they sell to north american customers hr sends transition pieces where the us parts meet the metric  so if you can keep in your head which sizing system each part is in  then its easier  like    bookmark     april   at pm thank you for reporting

thank you for reporting this comment undo jpmvan i never got around to following up after my install so here it is the exposed  shower valve installed without a hitch with compression fittings that match us  copper pipe works well too and looks amazing installed the installation instructions were more confusing than useful although the diagrams did help if youve done any plumbing at all youll be ok just using some common sense and the diagram it also helps to fit it all together before installing my kit came with a bunch of adapters and fittings i didnt need which added to the puzzle since its an exposed valve and the spacing seems to be standard for these im not too worried about repairreplacement i havent tried it but it looks like it can be taken apart easily if needed  like

shower as well i was wary about buying something from overseas at first but ive since bought more bathroom faucets and bathroom hardware from hudson reed everything that ive come across is solid brass construction with chrome plating and they ship with stainless steel mounting screws so there isnt anything that will rust they use ceramic disc valves which last much longer than gate valves youre not going to find a lot of hudson reed products around here but they are the equivalent of kohler or american standard in the uk they have a  year warranty over there and i think its  years for us residents near as i can figure that has more to do with our higher water pressures being harder on components nevertheless thats a longer warranty than ill get with kohler which is what ive used for pretty much everything else in my house i like to tinker so some of the minor issues that came with mine were easily fixed although most others would have returned them my mixer on the shower had a slow drip i followed the uk instructions unlike the us website theirs shows a full exploded diagram and took the cover plate off tightened the main assembly with a channel lock and the leak was fixed what can i say  its british i like it those compression fittings freaked me out a little since ive only ever used solder or threaded joints and i had nightmares of them bursting loose they have been perfect i am confident that my hardware will outlast me compression fittings are foreign to most home owners in the us but its pretty commonplace elsewhere its natural to avoid them if youre not comfortable with them but it doesnt make them junk just different kind of like diesel cars if youre a diyer this might not be the right decision for you if youre going to have them installed check with your plumber if you get a funny look move on theyll find every excuse to not install it or install it improperly so to reiterate i respectfully disagree with the assessments that hudson reed products are junk i believe that theyre well built although they might not always be properly assembled i appreciate the irony of the statement but what im saying is that once everything is assembled correctly they are awesome just my two cents this post was edited by northwoodsfox on wed aug   at   like    bookmark     august   at pm thank you for reporting this comment undo hsheffield have the

an expensive valve from hudson reed because i thought it was a higher quality product wrong after  months of work and  building a spa bathroom with  shower heads i finally got to test out the showers one is significantly cooler than the other i called tech support to find out what i have to do to get them to be the same temp and the guy said to me oh no you cant run them at the same time what if you do then one will be much cooler than the other i am furious why would i ever buy a dual shower valve and only run one device obv they know this valve will not supply consistent temps to both devices but on the product desc it says if you run the both you may experience a loss in pressure it does not say you will have one hot shower head and one luke warm shower head if it did obv i would not have bought it when i asked to speak to someone of authority i was told that nobody was available to speak to me so hear i am with a beautiful bathroom with a huge walk in tiled shower and this

plumber realized that the main handle that turns the water on and off was not included ok mistakes happen there are a lot of pieces and parts to these things weve had similar situations occur where a part is broken or missing you call customer service they say so sorry well send you the missing part or replacement end of story no not hudson reed we called first thing in the morning over to england and the gentleman we first spoke to about our hudson reed thermostatic shower system missing part was so indifferent and rude that he basically said we were out of luck and our only option was to spend another  and buy another hudson reed thermostatic shower system it was past the  day return policy and there was absolutely nothing he could do he transferred us to a woman who also said that it was beyond the return policy we should have inspected our hudson reed thermostatic shower system when it arrived to make sure all the parts were there who does this it is there job to inspect their products before they ship them the hudson reed thermostatic shower system contains a ton of pieces and parts and there is no part list included in their nightmare they call instructions as you can see from my photo where there are pictures they dont match the hudson reed thermostatic shower system we purchased it also looks like someone printed the instructions off the internet and they are crooked on the page and still contain the printer crop marks and file name very unprofessional for a hudson reed thermostatic shower system that costs so much after absolutely no attempt at taking responsibility for not including all the parts—really they most important part because now we cant turn any of the water on in our bathroom until we have this part to our hudson reed thermostatic

internetonly company sadly the person who bought my last house had a leak with an hr shower fixture heres what she wrote back to me after i gave the model number  contact for hr it took about  calls to them to try to clarify what the problem was and order the part i had a determined engineerplumber who took things apart and realized that the advice we were being given was incorrect not sure if

citation httpdxdoiorg   translator disclaimer citations metrics reprints  permissions get access doipdfneedaccesstrue abstract in the last few decades product placement has matured and become more sophisticated branded products are no longer just placed they are woven into entertainment content making a stronger emotional connection with the consumer the outcome is a concept the advertising industry is calling branded entertainment a convergence of advertising and entertainment this article considers whether or not branded entertainment is a new technique or just another form of product placement by tracking the evolution of product placement and from an analysis of the two concepts it is suggested that branded entertainment is a new term to describe a more contemporary sophisticated use of product placement a conceptual framework for understanding the various forms of product placement is presented and this highlights the key influences on the effectiveness of this fastgrowing marketing phenomenon the important management issues related to product placement are considered issues related to measurement control and ethics the article then concludes with recommendations for
