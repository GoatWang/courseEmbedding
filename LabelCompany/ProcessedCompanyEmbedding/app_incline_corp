administrative and professional fees if  of the offered shares are sold we will not receive sufficient proceeds to cover the costs of our offering and will have no funds available to allocate to our business plan as proposed we will need to seek additional sources of capital to fund liabilities and in order to execute our business plan the funds from this offering will not be used to pay mr elmquist for his services to the company whether provided prior to during or subsequent to the offering there can be no assurance that the company will raise any funds through this offering and if a limited amount of funds are raised the company will use such funds according to its best judgment in accordance with the “use of proceeds” chart this discretion is not unlimited and any such change in the use of proceeds as discussed above would be restricted to a proportionate reduction in funds allocated to each specific item listed and would not differ materially from the “use of proceeds” chart above to the extent our offering proceeds do not cover any professional fees incurred by the company we anticipate paying for any such expenses out of any additional funding or revenues we receive if we require additional funding we will seek such funds from friends family and business acquaintances in order to continue our operations as with any form of financing there are uncertainties concerning the availability of such funds on terms acceptable to us as we have not received any firm commitments or indications of interest from our friends family members or business acquaintances regarding potential investments in our company it is a competitive market to get discovered by consumers amongst the millions of already existing apps and it is also a challenge to convince people to buy an application there are approximately  million apps in the apple ios platform source httpwwwstatistacomstatisticsnumberofappsavailableinleadingappstores  our company will compete in various application categories and therefore will have both applications as competitors as well as companies like ours that own and operate several applications soundvine’s competitors include various other sound apps for vine including soundboard vsounds vboard best of vine funny soundboard vring and another approximately  apps in that sector our ability to compete successfully will depend in part on the quality of our products size of our database of users as well as our marketing efforts and our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry these factors include the introduction of new technologies changes in consumer preferences demographic trends economic conditions and marketing strategies of competitors as a result of competition we may be required to  increase overall spending to continue to purchase new competitive applications to offer to users  continually assess and evaluate our admob account to ensure we are maximizing profits from advertisers  increase our marketing budget and other user acquisition costs company description app incline corporation was incorporated in the state of nevada on june   we are a development stage company that engages in the purchase of mobile applications and subsequent managing of their hosting operations and advertising we plan to both offer free adsupported apps which have an option to purchase to avoid ads and receive more features our business model is based on our belief that the future of mobile app monetization will be profitable in an adsupported model our revenue will be therefore based primarily on our advertisers and secondarily on the sale of the paid for app option although apple was the first to provide apps for sale in  since then google play amazon app store blackberry world nokia windows phone store windows store and samsung apps have subsequently launched apps for sale source httpsenwikipediaorgwikimobileapp our business model is based on our belief that the mobile app market will continue to grow app incline’s business plan includes purchasing existing mobile applications that have been created launched and are generating low revenue to date we plan to purchase applications we research and believe to have potential for growth and ad revenue we find the applications to purchase on wwwflippacom as well as through private sellers we do not plan to change an application’s name once we purchase it or change any of the programming app incline does not intend to pay programmers to create and code new applications we intend to spend marketing dollars to market our apps to increase revenue we were only recently incorporated in june of  and have begun operations we have launched our website purchased our first application called soundvine and are generating minimal revenues to date we have not commenced advertising or substantive operations thus we believe that conducting this offering will allow the company added flexibility to raise capital in todays financial climate there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our attempt to sell  of the shares being registered hereunder however we believe that investors in todays markets demand more transparency and by our registering this offering and becoming a reporting company we will be able to capitalize on this fact while we believe that our limited reporting requirements will satisfy most investors seeking transparency in any potential investment we still caution that simply because we have a registration statement declared effective the company will not become a “fully reporting” company but rather we will be only subject to the reporting requirements of section d of the securities exchange act of  accordingly except during the year that our registration statement becomes effective these reporting obligations may be automatically suspended under section d if we have less than  shareholders at the beginning of our fiscal year and our required disclosure is less extensive than the disclosures required of “fully reporting” companies since inception our operations have consisted of incorporating our company opening a bank account formulating our business plan launching our website researching and purchasing our first application opening the apple developer account in which the app will run organizing the hosting and operations of the app and its ad account the company intends to begin substantive operations within  months after we obtain a notice of effectiveness of this offering and our initial plan of operations calls for the company to begin marketing our purchased applications and buying new applications we hope to realize our full plan of operations by raising money through the sale of our securities as contemplated within this offering we believe that if we are able to raise the full amount of funds contemplated herein we would be able to fully launch our company and properly market our applications we will design a full marketing strategy to gain awareness and ultimately obtain a larger audience  our headquarters are located at  longbranch ave grover beach ca  telephone number  our website is

section the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements you should also review the other available information referred to in the section entitled �where you can find more information� in this prospectus and any amendment or supplement hereto company overview app incline corporation �aic� or the �company� was incorporated in the state of nevada on june   we are a development stage company that engages in the purchase of mobile applications and subsequent managing of their hosting operations and advertising we plan to both offer free adsupported apps which have an option to purchase to avoid ads and receive more features��our business model is based on our belief that the future of mobile app monetization will be profitable in an adsupported model our revenue will be therefore based primarily on our advertisers and secondarily on the sale of the paid for app option��our website is wwwappinclinecom adam elmquist who is currently our sole officer and director has been with our company since inception in a management role��our headquarters are located at  longbranch ave grover beach ca  although apple was the first to provide apps for sale in  since then google play amazon app store blackberry world nokia windows phone store windows store and samsung apps have subsequently launched apps for sale source httpsenwikipediaorgwikimobileapp our business model is based on our belief that the mobile app market will continue to grow��app incline�s business plan includes purchasing existing mobile applications that have been created launched and are generating low revenue to date��we plan to purchase applications we research and believe to have potential for growth and ad revenue��we find the applications to purchase on wwwflippacom as well as through private sellers��we do not plan to change an application�s name once we purchase it or change any of the programming��app incline does not intend to pay programmers to create and code new applications we intend to spend marketing dollars to market our apps to increase revenue we were only recently incorporated in june of  and have begun operations��we have launched our website purchased our first application called soundvine and are generating minimal revenues to date��we have not commenced advertising or substantive operations thus we believe that conducting this offering will allow the company added flexibility to raise capital in todays financial climate there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our attempt to sell  of the shares being registered hereunder however we believe that investors in todays markets demand more transparency and by our registering this offering and becoming a reporting company we will be able to capitalize on this fact while we believe that our limited reporting requirements will satisfy most investors seeking transparency in any potential investment we still caution that simply because we have a registration statement declared effective the company will not become a �fully reporting� company but rather we will be only subject to the reporting requirements of section d of the securities exchange act of  accordingly except during the year that our registration statement becomes effective these reporting obligations may be automatically suspended under section d if we have less than  shareholders at the beginning of our fiscal year and our required disclosure is less extensive than the disclosures required of �fully reporting� companies for example we are not subject to disclose in our form k risk factors unresolved staff comments or selected financial data pursuant to items a b  respectively since inception our operations have consisted of incorporating our company opening a bank account formulating our business plan launching our website researching and purchasing our first application opening the apple developer account in which the app will run organizing the hosting and operations of the app and its ad account���the company intends to begin substantive operations within  months after we obtain a notice of effectiveness of this offering and our initial plan of operations calls for the company to begin marketing our purchased applications and buying new applications we hope to realize our full plan of operations by raising money through the sale of our securities as contemplated within this offering we believe that if we are able to raise the full amount of funds contemplated herein we would be able to fully launch our company and properly market our applications we will design a full marketing strategy to gain awareness and ultimately obtain a larger audience although our sole officer and director has only recently become interested in the mobile application industry and does not have any professional training or technical credentials in the development and maintenance of such a company he does have the experience of being a part of a small team of account managers who were responsible for over  companies throughout north america��there mr elmquist helped expand the company�s user base through research and development create databases of companies in the electrical hvac green energy audit and renewable energy fields and created and distribute email marketing campaigns through email blasts��we have retained one qualified websitesoftware developer who has built and is maintaining our website and is occupying himself with the details of the hosting accounts and operations and ad accounts for our applications we also plan to hire  qualified marketing person if we are successful in raising capital through this offering we do not have any verbal or written agreements regarding the retention of any qualified personnel to date �  � although the company has no market for its common stock management believes that the company will meet all requirements to be quoted on the otc market and even though the company�s common stock will likely be a penny stock becoming a reporting company will provide us with enhanced visibility and give us a greater possibility to provide liquidity to our shareholders we are currently a development stage company and to date have low recorded revenues accordingly our independent registered public accountants have issued a comment regarding our ability to continue as a going concern please refer to the footnotes to the financial statements until such time that we are able to establish a consistent flow of revenues from our operations which is sufficient to sustain our operating needs management intends to rely primarily upon debt financing to supplement cash flows if any generated by our products we will seek out such financing as necessary to allow the company to continue to grow our business operations and to cover such cost excluding professional fees associated with being a reporting company with the securities and exchange commission sec we estimate such costs to be approximately  for  months following this offering the company has included such costs to become a publicly reporting company in its targeted expenses for working capital expenses and intends to seek out reasonable loans from friends family and business acquaintances if it becomes necessary at this point we have been funded by our sole officer and director and have not received any firm commitments or indications from any family friends or business acquaintances regarding any potential investment in the company our current cash and working capital is not sufficient to cover our current estimated offering expenses of  which include those fees associated with obtaining a notice of effectiveness from the sec for this registration statement we hope that we will be able to secure additional financing and complete this offering within the coming months upon obtaining effectiveness we will conduct the offering contemplated hereby and anticipate raising sufficient capital from this offering to market and grow our company we believe that the maximum amount of funds generated from the offering will provide us with enough proceeds to fund our plan of operations for up to twelve months after the completion of this offering assuming we generate nominal revenues we may still require additional financing to fund our operations past the twelvemonth period following the completion of this offering if the maximum amount of funds is not raised while our ability to generate revenue is not correlated directly to the amount of shares sold by us under this offering our potential to generate revenue can be affected by our marketing and advertising strategies and the amount of personnel the company employs these factors are directly related to the amount of proceeds we receive from this offering which corresponds to the number of shares we are successful in selling under this offering see �use of proceeds� chart we believe we can begin generating higher revenues within the first three months following the successful completion of this offering as we are a startup company it is unclear how much revenue our operations will generate however it is our hope that our revenues will exceed our costs our revenues will be impacted by how successful and well targeted the execution of our marketing campaign the general condition of the economy and the number of users we will attract for a further discussion of our initial operations plan of operations growth strategy and marketing strategy see the below section entitled �description of business� neither the company nor mr elmquist or any other affiliated or unaffiliated entity has any plans to use the company as a vehicle for a private company to become a reporting company once app incline becomes a reporting company additionally we do not believe the company is a blank check company as defined in section a of rule  under the securities act of  as amended because the company has a specific business plan and has no plans or intentions to engage in a merger or acquisition with an unidentified entity �  � summary of this offering the issuer � app incline corporation � � � securities being

secondary market might develop or that a public market for our securities may be sustained even if developed the absence of a public market for our stock will make it difficult to sell your shares � we intend to apply to the otcbb through a market maker that is a licensed broker dealer to allow the trading of our common stock upon our becoming a reporting entity under the securities exchange act of  � � � duration of offering � the shares are offered for a period not to exceed  days unless extended by our board of directors or an additional  days � � � number of shares outstanding before the offering � there are  shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of the date of this prospectus held solely by our chairman president chief executive officer and secretary mr adam elmquist � � �

value at an offering price of  per share for net proceeds after offering expenses to the company at  the full subscription price will be payable at the time of subscription and any such funds received from users in this offering will be released to the company when subscriptions are received and accepted � � � use of proceeds � if the maximum amount of funds are raised we intend to fund our operations and then implement our business plan if we sell  or less of our shares under the offering we will have to seek out additional capital from alternate sources to pay our offering costs as well as further capital in order to execute our business plan if such funds are not available our business would likely fail and any investment would be lost no assurance can be given that the net proceeds from the total number of shares offered hereby or any lesser net amount will be sufficient to accomplish our goals � � � risk factors � an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk you should carefully consider the risk factors set forth under the �risk factors� section herein and the other information contained in this prospectus before making an investment decision regarding our common stock �  � risk factors an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk you should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this prospectus before investing in our common stock if any of the following risks occur our business operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed currently shares of our common stock are not publicly traded in the event that shares of our common stock become publicly traded the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment in the event our common stock fails to become publicly traded you may lose all or part of your investment risks related to the offering as there is no minimum for our offering if only a few persons purchase shares they will lose their investment without the company being able to make a significant attempt at implementation of its business plan since there is no minimum amount of shares that must be sold directly by the company under this offering if a limited number of shares are sold we may not have enough capital to fully implement our plan of operations if we are able to sell  or less of the offered shares the proceeds would not be enough to cover our anticipated offering expenses of approximately  as such we may not be able to meet the objectives we state in this prospectus or eliminate the �going concern� modification in the reports of our auditors as to uncertainty with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern if we fail to raise sufficient capital we would expect to have insufficient funds for our ongoing operating expenses any significant lack of funds will curtail the growth of our business and may cause our business to fail��if our business fails investors will lose their entire investment we are a development stage company with no operating history and may never be able to carry out our plan of operations or achieve any significant revenues or profitability��at this stage of our business even with our good faith efforts potential investors have a high probability of losing their entire investment we are subject to all of the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise and we have not generated any revenues to date any profitability in the future from our business will be dependent upon the success of our applications and therefore the advertising revenue generated which are subject to numerous industryrelated risk factors as set forth herein accordingly we may not be able to successfully carry out our business plan and any investor may lose their entire investment we are conducting this offering without an underwriter and may be unable to sell any shares this offering is selfunderwritten that is we are not going to engage the products of an underwriter to sell the shares��we intend to sell our shares through our president and chief executive officer who will receive no commissions or other remuneration from any sales made hereunder he will offer the shares to friends family members and business associates however there is no guarantee that he will be able to sell any of the shares unless he is successful in selling all of the shares and we receive the maximum amount of proceeds from this offering we may have to seek alternative financing to implement our plan of operations we may not be able to further implement our business strategy unless sufficient funds are raised in this offering our inability to raise additional funds could cause investors to lose their investment additionally we may have to seek additional capital through the sale of additional shares or other equity securities which would result in additional dilution to our stockholders we may not realize sufficient proceeds from this offering to further business development or to provide adequate cash flow for planned business activities at december   we had cash on hand of  and accumulated a deficit of  we have generated low revenue from our operations to date at this rate we expect that we will not be able to continue operations without obtaining additional funding or beginning to generate revenue we do not currently have any arrangements for financing and our obtaining additional financing will be subject to a number of factors including general market conditions investor acceptance of our plan of operations and initial results from our business operations there is no assurance that any additional financing will be available or if available on terms that will be acceptable to us failure to raise additional financing will cause us to go out of business if this happens you could lose all or part of your investment if our resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain a credit facility the sale of additional equity securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt product obligations and could result in operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations we cannot assure you that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all �  � because mr adam elmquist currently owns  of our outstanding common stock investors may find that corporate decisions influenced by mr elmquist are inconsistent with the best interests of other stockholders mr elmquist our sole officer and director currently owns  of the outstanding shares of our common stock and upon completion of this offering will own  of our outstanding common stock if the maximum number of shares are sold accordingly mr elmquist will have a significant influence in determining the outcome of all corporate transactions or other matters including mergers consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets and also the power to prevent or cause a change in control while we have no current plans with regard to any merger consolidation or sale of substantially all of our assets the interests of mr elmquist may still differ from the interests of the other stockholders there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern at december   the company has generated minimal revenue has no certainty of earning revenues in the future and has a working capital deficit and an accumulated deficit of  since inception these factors among others raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern our ability to generate future revenues will depend on a number of factors many of which are beyond our control these factors include general economic conditions market acceptance of our apps and revenues generated by ads��due to these factors we cannot anticipate with any degree of certainty what our revenues will be in future periods as such our independent registered public accountants have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern this opinion could materially limit our ability to raise additional funds by issuing new debt or equity securities or otherwise you should consider our independent registered public accountant�s comments when determining if an investment in the company is suitable you may have limited access to information regarding our business because we are a limited reporting company exempt from many regulatory requirements and our obligations to file periodic reports with the sec could be automatically suspended under certain circumstances the company will not become a fully reporting company but rather will be subject to the reporting requirements of section d of the securities exchange act of  as of effectiveness of our registration statement of which this prospectus is a part we will be required to file periodic reports with the sec who will be immediately available to the public for inspection and copying see �where you can find more information� elsewhere in this prospectus except during the year that our registration statement becomes effective these reporting obligations may be automatically suspended under section d if we have less than  shareholders at the beginning of our fiscal year we currently have fewer than  shareholders and if we continue to have fewer than  shareholders we will be exempt from the filing requirements as required pursuant to section  of the securities exchange act and will not be required to file any periodic reports including form q and k filings with the sec subsequent to the form k required for the fiscal year in which our registration statement is effective further disclosures in our form k that we will be required to file for the fiscal year in which our registration statement is effective is less extensive than the disclosures required of fully reporting companies specifically we are not subject to disclose in our form k risk factors unresolved staff comments or selected financial data pursuant to items a b  respectively if the reports are not filed or are less extensive than those required of fully reporting companies the investors will have reduced visibility as to the company and its financial condition in addition as a filer subject to section d of the exchange act the company is not required to prepare proxy or information statements and our common stock will not be subject to the protection of the ongoing private regulations additionally the company will be subject to only limited portions of the tender offer rules and our officers directors and more than ten  percent shareholders are not required to file beneficial ownership reports about their holdings in our company and will not be subject to the shortswing profit recovery provisions of the exchange act further more than five percent  holders of classes of our equity securities will not be required to report information about their ownership positions in the securities this means that your access to information regarding our business will be limited risks related to our business key management personnel may leave the company which could adversely affect the ability of the company to continue operations the company is entirely dependent on the efforts of our ceo and president because of the time and effort that he devotes to the company he is in charge of overseeing all development strategies supervising anyall future personnel including any consultants or contractors that we engage to assist in developing our marketing and the future research and choice of subsequent applications to purchase the loss of him or other key personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the company does not maintain �key person� life insurance on its officers directors or key employees our success will depend on the performance of mr elmquist and our ability to attract and motivate other key personnel presently the company�s president has other outside business activities and as such he is not devoting all of his time to the company which may result in periodic interruptions or business failure our sole officer and director mr elmquist has committed to devote approximately  hours per week to our operations our operations may be sporadic and occur at times when mr elmquist is unavailable which may lead to the periodic interruption in the implementation of our business plan such delays could have a significant negative effect on the success of the business �  � the lack of public company experience of our sole officer and director could adversely impact our ability to comply with the reporting requirements of us securities laws � � our sole officer and director mr elmquist lacks public company experience which could impair our ability to comply with legal and regulatory requirements such as those imposed by sarbanesoxley act of  he has never been responsible for managing a publicly traded company and he has had limited experience with accounting and financial matters as the sole officer and director of a public company mr elmquist�s responsibilities include complying with federal securities laws and making required disclosures on a timely basis mr elmquist may not be able to implement programs and policies in an effective and timely manner that adequately respond to such increased legal regulatory compliance and reporting requirements including establishing and maintaining internal controls over financial reporting additionally mr elmquist�s limited financial and accounting experience may affect his ability to develop effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting any such deficiencies weaknesses or lack of compliance could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  which is necessary to maintain our public company status if we were to fail to fulfill those obligations our ability to continue as a us public company would be in jeopardy in which event investors could lose their entire investment in our company the companys current cash flow and access to capital compared to the fees being earned by the companys soleofficer and director may adversely affect our future performance and operations our soleofficer and director mr elmquist entered into an employment agreement effective july   whereby he is paid a monthly management fee of  in exchange for his services to the company however such fees are currently being accrued and deferred until such time that the company is in a position as determined in mr elmquist�s sole discretion to begin making any such payments however should the company begin generating limited revenue or raising funds hereunder mr elmquist may determine that such payments should be used to pay his accrued and deferred salary any such decision would negatively affect our cash flows and would adversely affect the company the app industry is relatively new and has experienced growth over a short period of time and it is uncertain whether this market will continue to develop or whether it can be maintained if we are unable to successfully respond to changes in the market our business could be harmed the application sector in which we intend to operate has grown significantly in the last  years since its inception source httpsenwikipediaorgwikimobileapp given the limited history of sales in this industry it is difficult to predict whether this market will continue to grow or whether it can be maintained additionally we expect that the market will evolve in ways that may be difficult to predict in the event of these or any other changes to the market our success will depend on our ability to successfully adjust our strategy to meet the changing market dynamics if we are unable to do so our business could be harmed and our results of operations subject to a material negative impact we have a rapidly evolving business model and our proposed products could fail to attract or retain users or generate revenue because we are a development stage company we have a rapidly evolving business model and are regularly exploring the development of our marketing strategy and the introduction of our proposed applications with respect to which we may have limited experience in addition our potential users may not respond favorably to our apps once launched��if our applications fail to engage users and therefore advertising companies will not want to advertise on our apps we may fail to earn enough revenue to justify our investments in purchasing further applications��and thusly our business may be materially and adversely affected our ability to increase our user base and revenue will depend heavily on our ability to choose and purchase applications that are adopted by users daily if we fail to acquire users to use our apps our business will be harmed we must acquire users that download our app in order to generate advertising revenue and achieve profitability we cannot assure you that the revenue or gross profit from advertisers will ultimately exceed the cost involved with acquiring new applications to add to our offering if consumers do not perceive our app to be of use thusly advertisers will not bid for ads on our apps and revenue will be harmed we believe that many of our new users will originate from social media campaigns word of mouth and other nonpaid referrals from existing users once we establish a user base if our efforts to satisfy our users are not successful we may not be able to acquire new users in sufficient numbers to continue to grow our business further we believe that the level of communication among users will influence our success �  � our business is highly competitive competition presents an ongoing threat to the success of our business the market for generating advertising revenue on mobile apps we believe to be a growing revenue stream we intend to use admob this advertising platform includes google advertisers as well as realtime bidding rtb buyers via the doubleclick ad exchange advertisers compete for ad placement in applications the more popular our app becomes the more the advertisers compete and are willing to bid as more advertisers compete to show their ads in our app they pay higher cpms in order to win out over their competition�our initially acquired app soundvine with which we launched this company we are competing with other apps in this sector for ad revenue specifically for soundvine we will be competing with apps that offer sounds for vinecom we anticipate that most if not all of our competitors will have greater name and brand recognition and access to greater amounts of capital and established relationships with a larger base of current and potential users because of their size and bargaining power our competitors may be able to maintain their users due to loyalty and comfort vs change their behavior and be motivated to purchase from a different source��therefore we will not gain the advertising revenue to sufficiently operate our business we cannot assure you that we will be able to manage the growth of our company effectively we plan to experience growth in demand for our apps once we are able to successfully market them our business plan is based on the belief that our number of users will increase once we begin marketing the growth and expansion of our business and app offerings could place significant demands on our management and our operational and financial resources we will need to manage multiple relations with users web tech and marketing person to effectively manage our growth we will need to continually implement operational plans and strategies government regulation on applications is evolving and unfavorable changes or failure by us to comply with these regulations could substantially harm our business and results of operations in  government regulatory agencies began trying to regulate and curate apps particularly medical apps source yetisen a k martinezhurtado j l et al  the regulation of mobile medical applications lab on a chip   dxdoiorgclce��we do not know the future of mobile applications and what government regulation will exist and this uncertainty could harm our operations failure to comply with federal and state privacy laws and regulations or the expansion of current or the enactment of new privacy laws or regulations could adversely affect our business a variety of federal and state laws and regulations govern the collection use retention sharing and security of consumer data the existing privacyrelated laws and regulations are evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations in addition various federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies may expand current or enact new laws regarding privacy matters we will post privacy policies and practices concerning the collection use and disclosure of user data on our apps several internet companies have incurred penalties for failing to abide by the representations made in their privacy policies and practices in addition several states have adopted legislation that requires businesses to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices to protect sensitive personal information and to provide notice to consumers in the event of a security breach any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any datarelated consent orders federal trade commission requirements or orders or other federal or state privacy or consumer protectionrelated laws regulations or industry selfregulatory principles could result in claims proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others or other liabilities which could adversely affect our business in addition a failure or perceived failure to comply with industry standards or with our own privacy policies and practices could result in a loss of users or merchants and adversely affect our business our business will depend on our ability to be successful in social media our marketing model is based on the belief that social media is an important part of marketing for applications with the competitive market of mobile apps our business model is based on the belief that social media can help us level the playing field to some extent with larger more known apps with more marketing dollars than we have available as a benefit less money will be required to acquire app users whose costs can add up social media provides regardless of size or financial resources the ability to build an audience over time if used correctly we believe social media can help us create users and fans whose promotional strength and wordofmouth can make up for the fact we do not plan to compete marketing dollar for marketing dollar with larger rival apps with a large more expensive mobile advertising campaign we will be subject to paymentsrelated risks we plan to accept payments via apple where we have established a developer account we have housed soundvine app there and through this system our payments are received and transferred directly into app incline bank account we are subject to risk if apple�s system is subject to failure in addition users who choose to buy the app to avoid ads and access more features these payments as well will come via apple �  � risks relating to the common stock the company�s stock price may be volatile in the event the company is successful in listing its common stock on a national exchange the market price of the company�s common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various potential factors many of which will be beyond the company�s control including the following � applications purchased by the company or its competitors � additions or departures of key personnel � the company�s ability to execute its business plan � operating results that fall below expectations � industry developments � economic and other external factors and � periodtoperiod fluctuations in the company�s financial results in addition the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies these market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of the company�s common stock as a public company we will incur substantial expenses upon declared effectiveness of this registration statement by the sec we will become subject to the information and reporting requirements of the us securities laws the us securities laws require among other things review audit and public reporting of our financial results business activities and other matters recent sec regulation including regulation enacted as a result of the sarbanesoxley act of  has also substantially increased the accounting legal and other costs related to becoming and remaining an sec reporting company if we do not have current information about our company available to market makers they will not be able to trade our stock the public company costs of preparing and filing annual and quarterly reports and other information with the sec and furnishing audited reports to stockholders will cause our expenses to be higher than they would be if we were privatelyheld in addition we are incurring substantial expenses in connection with the preparation of this registration statement these increased costs may be material and may include the hiring of additional employees andor the retention of additional advisors and professionals our failure to comply with the federal securities laws could result in private or governmental legal action against us andor our sole officer and director which could have a detrimental effect on our business and finances the value of our stock and the ability of stockholders to resell their stock finra sales practice requirements may limit a stockholder�s ability to buy and sell our stock the financial industry regulatory authority �finra� has adopted rules that relate to the application of the sec�s penny stock rules in trading our securities and require that a brokerdealer have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that user prior to recommending the investment prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their noninstitutional users brokerdealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the user�s financial status tax status investment objectives and other information under interpretations of these rules finra believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some users the finra requirements make it more difficult for brokerdealers to recommend that their users buy our common stock which may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity and liquidity of our common stock further many brokers charge higher transactional fees for penny stock transactions as a result fewer brokerdealers may be willing to make a market in our common stock reducing a shareholder�s ability to resell shares of our common stock we may be exposed to potential risks resulting from new requirements under section  of the sarbanesoxley act of  in addition to the costs of compliance with having our shares listed on the otcbb there are substantial penalties that could be imposed upon us if we fail to comply with all regulatory requirements in particular under section  of the sarbanesoxley act of  as a smaller reporting company our management will be required to provide a report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting beginning with our second annual report and we will not be required to provide an auditor�s attestation regarding such report we have not assessed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls over financial reporting and we expect to incur additional expenses and diversion of management�s time as a result of performing the system and process evaluation testing and remediation required in order to comply with the management certification requirements additionally investors should be aware of the risk that management may assess and render the company�s internal controls ineffective which could have a material adverse effect on the company�s financial condition or result of operations �  � if a market for our common stock does not develop shareholders may be unable to sell their shares a market for our common stock may never develop we intend to contact an authorized otc markets marketmaker for sponsorship of our securities on the otc markets however there is no guarantee that our shares will be traded on the bulletin board or if traded a public market may not materialize if our common stock is not traded on the otc markets pink sheet or qb tier or if a public market for our common stock does not develop investors may not be able to resell the shares of our common stock that they have purchased and may lose all of their investment the company�s common stock is currently deemed to be �penny stock� which makes it more difficult for investors to sell their shares the company�s common stock is currently subject to the �penny stock� rules adopted under section g of the exchange act the penny stock rules apply to companies whose common stock is not listed on the nasdaq stock market or other national securities exchange and trades at less than  per share or that have tangible net worth of less than  these rules require among other things that brokers who trade penny stock to persons other than �established users� complete certain documentation make suitability inquiries of investors and provide investors with certain information concerning trading in the security including a risk disclosure document and quote information under certain circumstances many brokers have decided not to trade penny stocks because of the requirements of the penny stock rules and as a result the number of brokerdealers willing to act as market makers in such securities is limited if the company remains subject to the penny stock rules for any significant period it could have an adverse effect on the market if any for the company�s securities if the company�s securities are subject to the penny stock rules investors will find it more difficult to dispose of the company�s securities the elimination of monetary liability against the company�s existing and future directors officers and employees under nevada law and the existence of indemnification rights to the company�s existing and future directors officers and employees may result in substantial expenditures by the company and may discourage lawsuits against the company�s directors officers and employees the company�s articles of incorporation contain specific provisions that eliminate the liability of directors for monetary damages to the company and the company�s stockholders further the company is prepared to give such indemnification to its existing and future directors and officers to the extent provided by nevada law the company may also have contractual indemnification obligations under any employment agreements it may have with its officers and directors the foregoing indemnification obligations could result in the company incurring substantial expenditures to cover the cost of settlement or damage awards against directors and officers which the company may be unable to recoup these provisions and resultant costs may also discourage the company from bringing a lawsuit against existing and future�directors and officers for breaches of their fiduciary duties and may similarly discourage the filing of derivative litigation by the company�s stockholders against the company�s existing and future�directors and officers

than ads on the mobile web  on apps vs only  on the mobile web source httpwwwforbescomsitesroberthofstudymobileadsactuallydoworkespeciallyinapps � the first app the company purchased is under the

in this industry and participate in the market share �  � industry overview apps are usually available through application distribution platforms which began appearing in  and are typically operated by the owner of the mobile operating system such as the apple app store google play windows phone store and blackberry app world some apps are free while others must be bought for apps with a price

calendar contacts stock market and weather information however public demand and the availability of developer tools drove rapid expansion into other categories as with other software the explosion in number and variety of apps made discovery a challenge which in turn led to the creation of a wide range of review recommendation and curation sources including blogs magazines and dedicated online

all the applications are functioning and when they are not to quickly fix the problem to get the app back up and running we hope to be in a phase of rapid growth our president will have to work hard to keep all components of our business on track �  � marketing strategy we plan to begin our marketing strategy using social media we plan to focus on two key factors when marketing our applications to users � paying for applications � many applications are free some have a price tag although we plan to initially offer applications for free and earn monies on advertising on the app the market shows there is room to expand into charging for apps  of app downloaders report they have paid for an app�� say the highest they have paid is  or less�� have paid more than  for an app out of all people who download apps the groups most likely to pay for them are men adults age  and older college graduates adults with household incomes of  and those living in urban cities���source

apps by having all marketing based primarily in social media which has low cost �� deploy our capital more effectively by hiring a firm or an individual that has a good track record and specializes

application there are approximately  million apps in the apple ios platform source httpwwwstatistacomstatisticsnumberofappsavailableinleadingappstores ��our company will compete in various application categories and therefore will have both applications as competitors as well as companies like ours that own and operate several applications � � soundvine�s competitors include various other sound apps for vine including soundboard vsounds vboard best of vine funny soundboard vring and another approximately  apps in that sector our ability to compete successfully will depend in part on the

further we will use  of our net proceeds for working capital including administrative and professional fees if  of the offered shares are sold we will not receive sufficient proceeds to cover the costs of our offering and will have no funds available to allocate to our business plan as proposed we will need to seek additional sources of capital to fund liabilities and in order to execute our business plan the funds from this offering will not be used to pay mr elmquist for his services to the company whether provided prior to during or subsequent to the offering there can be no assurance that the company will raise any funds through this offering and if a limited amount of funds are raised the company will use such funds according to its best judgment in accordance with the “use of proceeds” chart this discretion is not unlimited and any such change in the use of proceeds as discussed above would be restricted to a proportionate reduction in funds allocated to each specific item listed and would not differ materially from the “use of proceeds” chart above to the extent our offering proceeds do not cover any professional fees incurred by the company we anticipate paying for any such expenses out of any additional funding or revenues we receive if we require additional funding we will seek such funds from friends family and business acquaintances in order to continue our operations as with any form of financing there are uncertainties concerning the availability of such funds on terms acceptable to us as we have not received any firm commitments or indications of interest from our friends family members or business acquaintances regarding potential investments in our company it is a competitive market to get discovered by consumers amongst the millions of already existing apps and it is also a challenge to convince people to buy an application there are approximately  million apps in the apple ios platform source httpwwwstatistacomstatisticsnumberofappsavailableinleadingappstores  our company will compete in various application categories and therefore will have both applications as competitors as well as companies like ours that own and operate several applications soundvine’s competitors include various other sound apps for vine including soundboard vsounds vboard best of vine funny soundboard vring and another approximately  apps in that sector our ability to compete successfully will depend in part on the quality of our products size of our database of users as well as our marketing efforts and our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry these factors include the introduction of new technologies changes in consumer preferences demographic trends economic conditions and marketing strategies of competitors as a result of competition we may be required to  increase overall spending to continue to purchase new competitive applications to offer to users  continually assess and evaluate our admob account to ensure we are maximizing profits from advertisers  increase our marketing budget and other user acquisition costs company description app incline corporation was incorporated in the state of nevada on june   we are a development stage company that engages in the purchase of mobile applications and subsequent managing of their hosting operations and advertising we plan to both offer free adsupported apps which have an option to purchase to avoid ads and receive more features our business model is based on our belief that the future of mobile app monetization will be profitable in an adsupported model our revenue will be therefore based primarily on our advertisers and secondarily on the sale of the paid for app option although apple was the first to provide apps for sale in  since then google play amazon app store blackberry world nokia windows phone store windows store and samsung apps have subsequently launched apps for sale source httpsenwikipediaorgwikimobileapp our business model is based on our belief that the mobile app market will continue to grow app incline’s business plan includes purchasing existing mobile applications that have been created launched and are generating low revenue to date we plan to purchase applications we research and believe to have potential for growth and ad revenue we find the applications to purchase on wwwflippacom as well as through private sellers we do not plan to change an application’s name once we purchase it or change any of the programming app incline does not intend to pay programmers to create and code new applications we intend to spend marketing dollars to market our apps to increase revenue we were only recently incorporated in june of  and have begun operations we have launched our website purchased our first application called soundvine and are generating minimal revenues to date we have not commenced advertising or substantive operations thus we believe that conducting this offering will allow the company added flexibility to raise capital in todays financial climate there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our attempt to sell  of the shares being registered hereunder however we believe that investors in todays markets demand more transparency and by our registering this offering and becoming a reporting company we will be able to capitalize on this fact while we believe that our limited reporting requirements will satisfy most investors seeking transparency in any potential investment we still caution that simply because we have a registration statement declared effective the company will not become a “fully reporting” company but rather we will be only subject to the reporting requirements of section d of the securities exchange act of  accordingly except during the year that our registration statement becomes effective these reporting obligations may be automatically suspended under section d if we have less than  shareholders at the beginning of our fiscal year and our required disclosure is less extensive than the disclosures required of “fully reporting” companies since inception our operations have consisted of incorporating our company opening a bank account formulating our business plan launching our website researching and purchasing our first application opening the apple developer account in which the app will run organizing the hosting and operations of the app and its ad account the company intends to begin substantive operations within  months after we obtain a notice of effectiveness of this offering and our initial plan of operations calls for the company to begin marketing our purchased applications and buying new applications we hope to realize our full plan of operations by raising money through the sale of our securities as contemplated within this offering we believe that if we are able to raise the full amount of funds contemplated herein we would be able to fully launch our company and properly market our applications we will design a full marketing strategy to gain awareness and ultimately obtain a larger audience  our headquarters are located at  longbranch ave grover beach ca  telephone number  our website is wwwappinclinecom full description the ipo profiles may contain historical

whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record if you miss a filing deadline you risk being fined or shut down our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents sort through junk mail and keep your information private is a corporation right for me it depends on many

whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record if you miss a filing deadline you risk being fined or shut down our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents sort through junk mail and keep your information private is a corporation right for me it depends on many
