nowgo»cellectar biosciences hype versus sciencemay  about cellectar biosciences clrb aaron faulkner longshort equity contrarian tech internetfree market millenial summaryon friday clrb rose over  on news that its phospholipid ether analogs as cancertargeting drug vehicles had received their us patent and trademark numbersdespite only recently becoming nasdaq compliant clrb saw over m shares frantically traded during the rally speculators are investing on the hopes the company can maintain stockholders equitywith three analogs in clinical trials the company may be building a profitable business around their technology unlike some of you i am not an expert in the vast knowledge repository of information that is needed to make snap decisions regarding the latest news emotions can kick in when we feel threatened by uncertainty and that can lead to rash decisions when that happens some of us tend to buy or sell a stock with logical reasoning behind our sentiment but show an irrational reasoning for our trade like when a promising biotech company with three product candidates in various phases of clinical trials happens to announce a bit of preemptive good news because i feel that the type of poor discipline that leads daytraders to losses is better met with due diligence when making a longterm decision here is my take away on cellectar biosciences incnasdaqclrb cellectar is developing a portfolio of product candidates that are built on a cancer celltargeting delivery and retention platform at the foundation of this technology is a single chemical core structure clr this compound works as a scaffolding for other therapeutic and diagnostic agents to be attached establishing xenograft tumor models from the patients own tumor tissue is thought to preserve the original tumors attributes based on this accepted theory xenografts are used to offer researchers relevant data into clinical outcomes when analyzing the efficacy of different cancer therapies radioiodinated clr has been evaluated in over  xenograft and spontaneous transgenic tumor models cellectars scientist have developed phospholipid ether analogs as a cancertargeting drug vehicle the delivery system can potentially find cancer cells and stop them from metabolizing while leaving nonmalignant cells alone the company claims that their platform is both scalable and compelling due to the wide spectrum of product candidates and their potential application while in clinical trials the company is attempting to demonstrate the proofofconcept behind its three alkyl phosphocholine analogs sourcephospholipid ether analogs for the detection of colorectal tumors the delivery system takes advantage of a unique characteristic of cell membranes phospholipid bilayerenriched lipid rafts these lipid rafts are thought to serve as the doorway through the cholesterolrich cell walls solid tumors can contain an overabundance of phospholipidethers relative to normal cells clrb is attempting to capitalize on the differences between phospholipid levels between cancerous cells and their healthy counterparts clr  research has demonstrated the practical and promising potential of this analog for applications in fluorescenceguided tumor surgery clr  a diagnostic pet imaging agent currently in phase  of an openlabel imaging trial for patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent glioblastoma clr  a molecular radiotherapeutic agent which has shown significant tumor growth reduction and survival benefit from a single injection in a wide range of human tumor xenograft models the phase i clinical trial has revealed images that demonstrate the effectiveness of iclr between  and  days after administration the areas of increased signal intensity shown in the image correspond to previously known areas of metastatic colon cancer in both lungs guide t  tumor hheart iclr demonstrated that during its phase  clinical trial that the compound could be targeted against multiple myeloma mm is an incurable monoclonal proliferation of plasma cells that affects  americans each year  new cases of mm are diagnosed additionally  deaths are attributed to this condition annually cellectars analogs may be able to provide for an unmet need relapsed disease such as mm presents the speculative investor an opportunity for growth through cellectars pipeline is this company worth investing in yet annual quarterly      income statement revenue      operating income      net income      earnings per share      diluted average shares      balance sheet current assets      non current assets      total assets      current liabilities      total liabilities      stockholders equity      cash flow cash from operations      capital expenditures      free cash flow      in millions except eps currency in usd data source one false flag attracting investors is the companys positive eps in q  this was due to the restructuring of previously underwritten warrants and their treatment as derivatives for q  the company reported a gain on derivative warrants of  compared to a gain of  reported in q  these amounts represent the change in fair value outstanding warrants which are classified as liabilities because they contain a downround antidilution provisions i believe uninformed investors may have a false impression that the fundamentals are solid when in reality the company is desperate for working capital we estimate that our available cash and cash equivalents should fund the companys planned operations into the first quarter of  additional capital will be required to complete our planned clinical and preclinical development q  earnings call transcript clrb data by ycharts clrbs market cap declined from  million in  to  million in  to complicate things further the volatility in the shares makes for evaluating this company a nightmare no guarantees have been given in regards to the patents in my opinion i do not feel that the preliminary news release of the companys expected patent award to justify a position i also believe that clrb is rallying on the claims that there will be more announcements regarding cellectars rd until securing the capital needed for  it is unclear if the preclinical and clinical development of the analogs will continue although this volatility may not be a bad sign for shortterm traders looking to scalp a profit it does make timing a long position a gamble i would stay away from this stock until the company has actually been issued its patents if at that point the company has stabilized its financial position a long entry may be justified in terms of supporting the rally to  the technology just isnt there yet my advice beware of what comes next but be prepared to act i do believe now is the time to pay attention to clrb because the earnings potential in the pipeline as of now clrb only has one of its three analogs that is in phase ii clinical trials it will not be until the end of phase iii that the company may see potential revenue ideally my long position would be initiated after a pullback from this current rally shares purchased between  and  could serve as a value based core position for longterm growth if the company can continue to stay compliant with nasdaq by keeping the shares above  and stockholders equity at current levels thank you for reading

announced preclinical data from three abstracts demonstrating the utility of the company’s lead compound clr  for use in a variety of tumor types in singledose and multidose regimens the abstracts were published as part of the  asco annual meeting proceedings in the first study  mice were injected with glioma brain tumor cells umg investigators then injected two doses of clr  µci and  µci on day  and day  respectively or a control group of iclr  n per group the expected fold increase in tumor burden observed in the control arm over the fourweek study was reduced by  in the clr  arm with additional survival benefit in fact the two doses of clr  provided a  increase in survival over a single dose of clr  in the same model the second study involved female mice receiving two doses of clr  approximately  µci and approximately  µci at days  and  respectively as well as a control group of iclr  n per group following injection of female mice with a mes sadx cell line human uterine sarcoma this model was selected because of its high level of expression of resistance mechanisms these tumor cells exhibit specifically pgp efflux pumps that eject many chemotherapeutics from the cell the active treatment group clr  experienced a  reduction of the expected fold increase in tumor burden observed in the control group this resulted in nearly doubling the survival time for the mice receiving two doses of clr  the final study entailed the injection of mice with caki cell line human clear cell carcinoma common in renal cancer once tumor size reached a predetermined volume these mice received either a single dose of clr  approximately µci or a control of iclr  n per group the control group showed exponential growth at  days postinjection while the treatment group experienced a reduction in the initial tumor volume through day  postinjection and had the same initial tumor volume at day  postinjection by day  the control group increased fold compared to the treatment group
