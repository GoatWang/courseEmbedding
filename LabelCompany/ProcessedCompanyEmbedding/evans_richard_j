visits to wales during his childhood inspired both an interest in history and a sense of otherness evans has said that one reason he was drawn to the study modern german history in the late s was his identification of parallels between the policies of the vietnam war and german imperialism he admired the work of fritz fischer whom he credits with inspiring him to study modern german history career as a historianedit evans first established his academic reputation with his publications on the second reich period of german history in the early s evans travelled to germany to research his dissertation a study of the feminist movement in germany in the first half of the twentieth century it was later published as the feminist movement in germany – in  evans followed his study of german feminism by another book the feminists  which traced the history of the feminist movement in north america australasia and europe in the period – a theme of both books was the weakness of german middle class culture and its inordinate stress on such military values as hierarchy deference and obedience for this reason evans argued that both liberalism and feminism failed in germany while flourishing elsewhere in the western world evans main interest is social history and he is much influenced by the annales school he largely agrees with fischer that nineteenth century german social development paved the way for the rise of nazi germany although evans takes pains to point out that this outcome was not inevitable but one among many possibilities for evans the values of the thcentury german middle class contained the already germinating seeds of national socialism evans studied under fischer in hamburg in – but he came to disagree with the bielefeld school of historians who argued for the sonderweg thesis that saw the roots of germany’s political development in the first half of the th century in a failed bourgeois revolution in  following a contemporary trend that opposed the previous great man theory of history evans was a member of a group of young british historians who in the s sought to examine german history during the imperial period from below these scholars highlighted the importance of the grassroots of politics and the everyday life and experience of ordinary people history is about people and their relationships it’s about the perennial question of ‘how much free will do people have in building their own lives and making a future evans has said he says he sought the creation of a new school of peoples history which was a result of a trend that has taken place across a whole range of historical subjects political opinions and methodological approaches and has been expressed in many different ways in  as editor of a collection of essays by young british historians entitled society and politics in wilhelmine germany he launched a critique of the ‘topdown’ approach of the bielefeld school associated with hansulrich wehler and jürgen kocka in regards to the wilhelmine germany with the historians geoff eley and david blackbourn evans instead emphasized the selfmobilization from below of key sociopolitical groups as well as the modernity of national socialism in the s evans organized ten international workshops on modern german social history at the university of east anglia that did a good deal to refine these ideas to pioneer research in this new historical field and in six collections of papers present it to an anglophone readership among evans major research works are death in hamburg  a study of class conflict and liberal government in nineteenthcentury germany using the example of hamburg’s cholera epidemics and applying statistical methods to the exploration of social inequality in an industrializing society and rituals of retribution  a study of capital punishment in german history applying structural anthropological concepts to the rituals of public execution up to the midnineteenth century and exploring the politics of the death penalty until its abolition by the gdr in  in death in hamburg evans studied the cholera outbreak in hamburg in  which he concluded was caused by a failure in the medical system to safeguard against such an event another study in german social history was tales from the german underworld  where evans traced the life stories of four german criminals in the late th century namely a homeless woman a forger a prostitute and a conman in rituals of retribution evans traced the history of capital punishment in germany and using the ideas of michel foucault philippe ariès and norbert elias as his guide argued that opposition to the death penalty was strongest when liberalism was in the ascendancy and support for capital punishment coincided when the right was in the ascendancy thus in evans view capital punishment in germany was never a mere matter of law being disinterestedly applied but was rather a form of state power being exercised in addition evans examined such subjects as belief in witchcraft torture the last words of the executed the psychology of mobs varying forms of execution from the thirty years war to the s profiles of executioners cruelty and changing views towards the death penalty in the s evans was a conspicuous figure in the historikerstreit a controversy surrounding the historical work and theories of german historians ernst nolte joachim fest andreas hillgruber michael stürmer hagen schulze imanuel geiss and klaus hildebrand all of whom evans considered german apologists attempting to whitewash the german past evans views on the historikerstreit were set forth in his  book in hitlers shadow in that book evans took issue with noltes acceptance of the commissar order as a legitimate military order with noltes argument that the einsatzgruppen massacres of ukrainian jews were a justifiable preventive security response to partisan attacks his description citing viktor suvorov of operation barbarossa as a preventative war forced on hitler by an impending soviet attack and his complaints that much scholarship on the shoah expressed the views of biased jewish historians evans characterized noltes statements as crossing the line into holocaust denial and he singled out noltes rationalization that since the victors write history the only reason why nazi germany is seen as evil is because it lost the war evans also denounced as an attempt to justify the holocaust noltes claim that chaim weizmanns letter of  september  to neville chamberlain promising that the jewish agency would support the war effort constituted jewish declaration of war on germany that justified the preemptive internment of jews in concentration camps in his  book in hitlers shadown evans also criticised the intentionalist theories of hillgruber and hildebrand and criticized stürmers laudatory biography of otto von bismarck with its excessive focus on political history and overlooking of social conditions as a regression to the outmoded great man theory of history for his part evans praised ian kershaw who wrote that the road to auschwitz was built by hate but paved with indifference namely that the german people were by and large indifferent towards the holocaust in hitlers shadow also criticized the historical writings of robert conquest hugh thomas gertrude himmelfarb and geoffrey elton whom he considered part of a neoconservative historical trend in the same book evans endorsed martin broszats call for the historicization of the third reich as a rational approach to nazism and a gain to history evans book in defence of history defends the discipline of history against postmodernist skepticism of its value the limitations of our ability to understand and learn from the past notwithstanding it is still possible he argues to understand much about past ways of life evans suggests that the spread since the mids of postmodernist theories which declare that history is a construct and depict the rationalist tradition of the west as a form of oppression had done much to increase the appeal of holocaust denial role as an expert witness in irving v lipstadtedit see also irving v penguin books and lipstadt evans is probably best known to the general public in the role of an expert witness for the defence in the highprofile libel case of david irving against the american historian deborah lipstadt in  irving v lipstadt lipstadt was sued for libel by irving after she referred to him as a holocaust denier and an ardent follower of adolf hitler in her  book denying the holocaust lipstadt further accused irving of distorting evidence and manipulating documents to serve his own purposesas well as skewing documents and misrepresenting data in order to reach historically untenable conclusions particularly those that exonerate hitler evans acted as an expert witness for the defence in the case starting in the autumn of  evans along with thomas skeltonrobinson and nik wachsmann two of his phd students closely examined irvings work they found instances in which he had used forged documents disregarded contrary evidence selectively quoted historical documents out of context and miscited historical records thus misrepresenting historical evidence in order to support his prejudices evans subsequently proved to be a powerful witness in lipstadts ultimately successful defence in his expert witness report he wrote not one of irvings books speeches or articles not one paragraph not one sentence in any of them can be taken on trust as an accurate representation of its historical subject all of them are completely worthless as history because irving cannot be trusted anywhere in any of them to give a reliable account of what he is talking or writing about  if we mean by historian someone who is concerned to discover the truth about the past and to give as accurate a representation of it as possible then irving is not a historian the crossexamination of evans by irving was noted for the high degree of personal dislike between the two men such was the degree of dislike that irving challenged evans on very minor points such as evans doubting the fairness of a  german plebiscite in which the nazi regime received  of the vote a subject that much engaged irving and evans in a debate was a memo by the chief of the reich chancellery hans lammers to the reich justice minister franz schlegelberger in which lammers wrote that hitler ordered him to put the jewish question on the backburner until after the war evans chose to accept the interpretation of the memo put forward by eberhard jäckel in the s irving chose to interpret the memo literally and taunted evans by saying it is a terrible problem is it not that we are faced with this tantalizing plate of crumbs and morsels of what should have provided the final smoking gun and nowhere the whole way through the archives do we find even one item that we do not have to interpret or read between the lines of but we do have in the same chain of evidence documents whichquite clearly specifically show hitler intervening in the other sense in response evans stated no i do not accept that at all it is because you want to interpret euphemisms as being literal and that is what the whole problem is every time there is an euphemism mr irving  or a camouflage piece of statement or language about madagascar you want to treat it as the literal truth because it serves your purpose of trying to exculpate hitler that is part of  the way you manipulate and distort the documents in a  interview evans described to the canadian columnist robert fulford his impression of irving after being crossexamined by him as he irving was a bit like a dim student who didnt listen if he didnt get the answer he wanted he just repeated the question his findings and his account of the trial were published in his  book lying about hitler history holocaust and the david irving trial which was published as telling lies about hitler in the united states in  the high court rejected irving’s libel suit and awarded costs to the defence evans involvement in the trial was included in the  film denial in which he was played by british actor john sessions the third reich trilogyedit richard j evans  main article the third reich trilogy between  and  evans published a threevolume history of the third reich drawing on years of experience as a leading scholar of german history evans produced what some historians call the most extensive and comprehensive history of the rise and fall of hitler’s regime ever produced by a single scholar reviewer peter mansoor says the third reich at war is a superb piece of scholarship that is likely to emerge as the definitive account of life and death inside hitlers blood soaked third reich robert citino says read together the three volumes constitute a remarkably comprehensive treatment of the origins course and death of the hitler regime and are likely to be standard works for a long time to come ed ericson says evans masterfully interweaves testimony that has come to light in the intervening decades with learned judgments from hundreds of authors to create a balanced and thoughtful narrative this book therefore will assuredly become the definitive work on the third reich at war the first volume the coming of the third reich how the nazis destroyed democracy and seized power in germany published by penguin in  shows how a country torn apart by the first world war the terms of the treaty of versailles hyperinflation and the great depression moved towards an increasingly authoritarian solution the book explains in detail adolf hitlers appointment as chancellor in january  and how the nazis transformed germany into a one party dictatorship the first volume featured highly favorable words of praise from evanss friend ian kershaw on its cover the second volume the third reich in power    how the nazis won over the hearts and minds of a nation published by penguin in  covers the years of nazi rule between  and  the final chapter examines the road to the second world war but the real focus is on life inside nazi germany one of the great strengths of this volume is the way evans allows small stories of key individuals to illustrate many of the key social economic and cultural events of the period richard overy described this instalment of the trilogy as magisterial the third volume the third reich at war how the nazis led germany from conquest to disaster published by penguin in  looks at major developments from  to  including the key battles of the second world war a vivid moving and detailed account of the mass murder enacted during the holocaust and hitlers dramatic downfall in berlin in  in an october  review of the third volume for the times bestselling historian antony beevor writes with this third volume richard evans has accomplished a masterpiece of historical scholarship  he has produced the best and most uptodate synthesis of the huge work carried out on the subject over the past decades aspects of it however were sharply criticised by tim snyder walter reich former director of the united states holocaust memorial museum in washington d c states about the thirdvolume of the trilogythe third reich at war if any work of accurate history has a chance to correct the distortions of public memory this is it regius professor of modern historyedit in  evans was appointed regius professor of modern history at cambridge university in  the word modern was removed from the title by royal decree the post is a royal appointment in the gift of the prime minister of the day and dates back to  previous holders of the title have included john dalbergacton  herbert butterfield  geoffrey elton  patrick collinson  and quentin skinner  evans is the first historian to have to apply for the post and be interviewed by a board of electors including cambridges vicechancellor alison richard and representatives of the history faculty and the university as well as external assessors from yale harvard oxford and london the board selected a shortlist of four each of whom was asked to give a presentation to the entire cambridge history faculty the shortlist of four was then reduced to two whom the board interviewed resulting in the boards recommendation of evans to the prime minister and in the issue of a royal warrant for his appointment as well as serving as regius professor evans has served as chairman of the history faculty since october  his term of office ended on  september  evans is used to combining administration with research at birkbeck college london where he worked before cambridge he acted as master of the college when baroness blackstone left suddenly to become tony blairs first higher education minister on  january  he was elected to the position of president of wolfson college cambridge to take up office on  october  tv and media appearancesedit evans has appeared regularly on a number of tv documentaries related to adolf hitler and the third reich he recently appeared on a major tv documentary on the history channel which examined the valkyrie bomb plot against hitler in july  which was the subject of a hollywood film starring tom cruise as of  he has made  appearances on the

is known as an excellent public speaker and often appears regularly as a keynote speaker at universities and schools and at conferences for academics and students around the world debate with the british education secretaryedit in  evans was involved in a debate with michael gove the british education secretary about the content and style of history teaching and the way that the curriculum is structured and how the first world war should be portrayed writing in the daily mail gove accused evans in particular of distorting history with regard to britains role in the war evans countered that gove was engaging in the defamation of academic historians and narrow tubthumping jingoism evans stated that he agreed with goves statement about the ruthless social darwinism of the german elites the pitiless approach they took to occupation their aggressively expansionist war aims and their scorn for the international order all made resistance more than justified evans wrote hes gove right about the elites but misses the point that they werent able to carry the majority of the german people with them the largest political party the social democrats was opposed to annexations and had long been critical of the militarism of the elites he also ridiculed gove’s suggestion that the first world war was “just” and fought by men committed to defending the western liberal order pointing out that britains ally tsar nicholas ii was far more despotic than even the kaiser and that  of british adult males were not allowed to vote evans also wrote that gove was wrong that only leftwing historians believe that britain was wrong to fight germany in world war i noting that such conservative historians as niall ferguson and alan clark have been quite vocal in expressing the belief that britain should have remained neutral in  criticismedit in  evans became involved in a polemical exchange of letters with peter baldwin after agreeing with leif jerram in cosmopolitan islanders  that students in britain could find a richer selection of courses on the histories of other countries in british universities than students from other countries could in their own countries honours and

social inequality in an industrializing society and rituals of retribution  a study of capital punishment in german history applying structural anthropological concepts to the rituals of public execution up to the midnineteenth century and exploring the politics of the death penalty until its abolition by the gdr in  in death in hamburg evans studied the cholera outbreak in hamburg in  which he concluded was caused by a failure in the medical system to safeguard against such an event another study in german social history was tales from the german underworld  where evans traced the life stories of four german criminals in the late th century namely a homeless woman a forger a prostitute and a conman in rituals of retribution evans traced the history of capital punishment in germany and using the ideas of michel foucault philippe ariès and norbert elias as his guide argued that opposition to the death penalty was strongest when liberalism was in the ascendancy and support for capital punishment coincided when the right was in the ascendancy thus in evans view capital punishment in germany was never a mere matter of law being disinterestedly applied but was rather a form of state power being exercised in addition evans examined such subjects as belief in witchcraft torture the last words of the executed the psychology of mobs varying forms of execution from the thirty years war to the s profiles of executioners cruelty and changing views towards the death penalty in the s evans was a conspicuous figure in the historikerstreit a controversy surrounding the historical work and theories of german historians ernst nolte joachim fest andreas hillgruber michael stürmer hagen schulze imanuel geiss and klaus hildebrand all of whom evans considered german apologists attempting to whitewash the german past evans views on the historikerstreit were set forth in his  book in hitlers shadow in that book evans took issue with noltes acceptance of the commissar order as a legitimate military order with noltes argument that the einsatzgruppen massacres of ukrainian jews were a justifiable preventive security response to partisan attacks his description citing viktor suvorov of operation barbarossa as a preventative war forced on hitler by an impending soviet attack and his complaints that much scholarship on the shoah expressed the views of biased jewish historians evans characterized noltes statements as crossing the line into holocaust denial and he singled out noltes rationalization that since the victors write history the only reason why nazi germany is seen as evil is because it lost the war evans also denounced as an attempt to justify the holocaust noltes claim that chaim weizmanns letter of  september  to neville chamberlain promising that the jewish agency would support the war effort constituted jewish declaration of war on germany that justified the preemptive internment of jews in concentration camps in his  book in hitlers shadown evans also criticised the intentionalist theories of hillgruber and hildebrand and criticized stürmers laudatory biography of otto von bismarck with its excessive focus on political history and overlooking of social conditions as a regression to the outmoded great man theory of history for his part evans praised ian kershaw who wrote that the road to auschwitz was built by hate but paved with indifference namely that the german people were by and large indifferent towards the holocaust in hitlers shadow also criticized the historical writings of robert conquest hugh thomas gertrude himmelfarb and geoffrey elton whom he considered part of a neoconservative historical trend in the same book evans endorsed martin broszats call for the historicization of the third reich as a rational approach to nazism and a gain to history evans book in defence of history defends the discipline of history against postmodernist skepticism of its value the limitations of our ability to understand and learn from the past notwithstanding it is still possible he argues to understand much about past ways of life evans suggests that the spread since the mids of postmodernist theories which declare that history is a construct and depict the rationalist tradition of the west as a form of oppression had done much to increase the appeal of holocaust denial role as an expert witness in irving v lipstadtedit see also irving v penguin books and lipstadt evans is probably best known to the general public in the role of an expert witness for the defence in the highprofile libel case of david irving against the american historian deborah lipstadt in  irving v lipstadt lipstadt was sued for libel by irving after she referred to him as a holocaust denier and an ardent follower of adolf hitler in her  book denying the holocaust lipstadt further accused irving of distorting evidence and manipulating documents to serve his own purposesas well as skewing documents and misrepresenting data in order to reach historically untenable conclusions particularly those that exonerate hitler evans acted as an expert witness for the defence in the case starting in the autumn of  evans along with thomas skeltonrobinson and nik wachsmann two of his phd students closely examined irvings work they found instances in which he had used forged documents disregarded contrary evidence selectively quoted historical documents out of context and miscited historical records thus misrepresenting historical evidence in order to support his prejudices evans subsequently proved to be a powerful witness in lipstadts ultimately successful defence in his expert witness report he wrote not one of irvings books speeches or articles not one paragraph not one sentence in any of them can be taken on trust as an accurate representation of its historical subject all of them are completely worthless as history because irving cannot be trusted anywhere in any of them to give a reliable account of what he is talking or writing about  if we mean by historian someone who is concerned to discover the truth about the past and to give as accurate a representation of it as possible then irving is not a historian the crossexamination of evans by irving was noted for the high degree of personal dislike between the two men such was the degree of dislike that irving challenged evans on very minor points such as evans doubting the fairness of a  german plebiscite in which the nazi regime received  of the vote a subject that much engaged irving and evans in a debate was a memo by the chief of the reich chancellery hans lammers to the reich justice minister franz schlegelberger in which lammers wrote that hitler ordered him to put the jewish question on the backburner until after the war evans chose to accept the interpretation of the memo put forward by eberhard jäckel in the s irving chose to interpret the memo literally and taunted evans by saying it is a terrible problem is it not that we are faced with this tantalizing plate of crumbs and morsels of what should have provided the final smoking gun and nowhere the whole way through the archives do we find even one item that we do not have to interpret or read between the lines of but we do have in the same chain of evidence documents whichquite clearly specifically show hitler intervening in the other sense in response evans stated no i do not accept that at all it is because you want to interpret euphemisms as being literal and that is what the whole problem is every time there is an euphemism mr irving  or a camouflage piece of statement or language about madagascar you want to treat it as the literal truth because it serves your purpose of trying to exculpate hitler that is part of  the way you manipulate and distort the documents in a  interview evans described to the canadian columnist robert fulford his impression of irving after being crossexamined by him as he irving was a bit like a dim student who didnt listen if he didnt get the answer he wanted he just repeated the question his findings and his account of the trial were published in his  book lying about hitler history holocaust and the david irving trial which was published as telling lies about hitler in the united states in  the high court rejected irving’s libel suit and awarded costs to the defence evans involvement in the trial was included in the  film denial in which he was played by british actor john sessions the third reich trilogyedit richard j evans  main article the third reich trilogy between  and  evans published a threevolume history of the third reich drawing on years of experience as a leading scholar of german history evans produced what some historians call the most extensive and comprehensive history of the rise and fall of hitler’s regime ever produced by a single scholar reviewer peter mansoor says the third reich at war is a superb piece of scholarship that is likely to emerge as the definitive account of life and death inside hitlers blood soaked third reich robert citino says read together the three volumes constitute a remarkably comprehensive treatment of the origins course and death of the hitler regime and are likely to be standard works for a long time to come ed ericson says evans masterfully interweaves testimony that has come to light in the intervening decades with learned judgments from hundreds of authors to create a balanced and thoughtful narrative this book therefore will assuredly become the definitive work on the third reich at war the first volume the coming of the third reich how the nazis destroyed democracy and seized power in germany published by penguin in  shows how a country torn apart by the first world war the terms of the treaty of versailles hyperinflation and the great depression moved towards an increasingly authoritarian solution the book explains in detail adolf hitlers appointment as chancellor in january  and how the nazis transformed germany into a one party dictatorship the first volume featured highly favorable words of praise from evanss friend ian kershaw on its cover the second volume the third reich in power    how the nazis won over the hearts and minds of a nation published by penguin in  covers the years of nazi rule between  and  the final chapter examines the road to the second world war but the real focus is on life inside nazi germany one of the great strengths of this volume is the way evans allows small stories of key individuals to illustrate many of the key social economic and cultural events of the period richard overy described this instalment of the trilogy as magisterial the third volume the third reich at war how the nazis led germany from conquest to disaster published by penguin in  looks at major developments from  to  including the key battles of the second world war a vivid moving and detailed account of the mass murder enacted during the holocaust and hitlers dramatic downfall in berlin in  in an october  review of the third volume for the times bestselling historian antony beevor writes with this third volume richard evans has accomplished a masterpiece of historical scholarship  he has produced the best and most uptodate synthesis of the huge work carried out on the subject over the past decades aspects of it however were sharply criticised by tim snyder walter reich former director of the united states holocaust memorial museum in washington d c states about the thirdvolume of the trilogythe third reich at war if any work of accurate history has a chance to correct the distortions of public memory this is it regius professor of modern historyedit in  evans was appointed regius professor of modern history at cambridge university in  the word modern was removed from the title by royal decree the post is a royal appointment in the gift of the prime minister of the day and dates back to  previous holders of the title have included john dalbergacton  herbert butterfield  geoffrey elton  patrick collinson  and quentin skinner  evans is the first historian to have to apply for the post and be interviewed by a board of electors including cambridges vicechancellor alison richard and representatives of the history faculty and the university as well as external assessors from yale harvard oxford and london the board selected a shortlist of four each of whom was asked to give a presentation to the entire cambridge history faculty the shortlist of four was then reduced to two whom the board interviewed resulting in the boards recommendation of evans to the prime minister and in the issue of a royal warrant for his appointment as well as serving as regius professor evans has served as chairman of the history faculty since october  his term of office ended on  september  evans is used to combining administration with research at birkbeck college london where he worked before cambridge he acted as master of the college when baroness blackstone left suddenly to become tony blairs first higher education minister on  january  he was elected to the position of president of wolfson college cambridge to take up office on  october  tv and media appearancesedit evans has appeared regularly on a number of tv documentaries related to adolf hitler and the third reich he recently appeared on a major tv documentary on the history channel which examined the valkyrie bomb plot against hitler in july  which was the subject of a hollywood film starring tom cruise as of  he has made  appearances on the bbc radio  programme in our time he also appears regularly on start the week and often writes reviews of history books on his specialist era in major newspapers and periodicals he is also a noted lecturer and gives numerous keynote lectures at international conferences around the world and also at student conferences as part of his remit to take history to a wider audience beyond academia he is known as an excellent public speaker and often appears regularly as a keynote speaker at universities and schools and at conferences for academics and students around the world debate with the british education secretaryedit in  evans was involved in a debate with michael gove the british education secretary about the content and style of history teaching and the way that the curriculum is structured and how the first world war should be portrayed writing in the daily mail gove accused evans in particular of distorting history with regard to britains role in the war evans countered that gove was engaging in the defamation of academic historians and narrow tubthumping jingoism evans stated that he agreed with goves statement about the ruthless social darwinism of the german elites the pitiless approach they took to occupation their aggressively expansionist war aims and their scorn for the international order all made resistance more than justified evans wrote hes gove right about the elites but misses the point that they werent able to carry the majority of the german people with them the largest political party the social democrats was opposed to annexations and had long been critical of the militarism of the elites he also ridiculed gove’s suggestion that the first world war was “just” and fought by men committed to defending the western liberal order pointing out that britains ally tsar nicholas ii was far more despotic than even the kaiser and that  of british adult males were not allowed to vote evans also wrote that gove was wrong that only leftwing historians believe that britain was wrong to fight germany in world war i noting that such conservative historians as niall ferguson and alan clark have been quite vocal in expressing the belief that britain should have remained neutral in  criticismedit in  evans became involved in a polemical exchange of letters with peter baldwin after agreeing with leif jerram in cosmopolitan islanders  that students in britain could find a richer selection of courses on the histories of other countries in british universities than students from other countries could in their own countries honours and

welsh parentage and educated at forest school jesus college oxford ma and st antonys college oxford dphil in a  interview he stated that frequent visits to wales during his childhood inspired both an interest in history and a sense of otherness evans has said that one reason he was drawn to the study modern german history in the late s was his identification of parallels between the policies of the vietnam war and german imperialism he admired the work of fritz fischer whom he credits with inspiring him to study modern german history career as a historianedit evans first established his academic reputation with his publications on the second reich period of german history in the early s evans travelled to germany to research his dissertation a study of the feminist movement in germany in the first half of the twentieth century it was later published as the feminist movement in germany – in  evans followed his study of german feminism by another book the feminists  which traced the history of the feminist movement in north america australasia and europe in the period – a theme of both books was the weakness of german middle class culture and its inordinate stress on such military values as hierarchy deference and obedience for this reason evans argued that both liberalism and feminism failed in germany while flourishing elsewhere in the western world evans main interest is social history and he is much influenced by the annales school he largely agrees with fischer that nineteenth century german social development paved the way for the rise of nazi germany although evans takes pains to point out that this outcome was not inevitable but one among many possibilities for evans the values of the thcentury german middle class contained the already germinating seeds of national socialism evans studied under fischer in hamburg in – but he came to disagree with the bielefeld school of historians who argued for the sonderweg thesis that saw the roots of germany’s political development in the first half of the th century in a failed bourgeois revolution in  following a contemporary trend that opposed the previous great man theory of history evans was a member of a group of young british historians who in the s sought to examine german history during the imperial period from below these scholars highlighted the importance of the grassroots of politics and the everyday life and experience of ordinary people history is about people and their relationships it’s about the perennial question of ‘how much free will do people have in building their own lives and making a future evans has said he says he sought the creation of a new school of peoples history which was a result of a trend that has taken place across a whole range of historical subjects political opinions and methodological approaches and has been expressed in many different ways in  as editor of a collection of essays by young british historians entitled society and politics in wilhelmine germany he launched a critique of the ‘topdown’ approach of the bielefeld school associated with hansulrich wehler and jürgen kocka in regards to the wilhelmine germany with the historians geoff eley and david blackbourn evans instead emphasized the selfmobilization from below of key sociopolitical groups as well as the modernity of national socialism in the s evans organized ten international workshops on modern german social history at the university of east anglia that did a good deal to refine these ideas to pioneer research in this new historical field and in six collections of papers present it to an anglophone readership among evans major research works are death in hamburg  a study of class conflict and liberal government in nineteenthcentury germany using the example of hamburg’s cholera epidemics and applying statistical methods to the exploration of social inequality in an industrializing society and rituals of retribution  a study of capital punishment in german history applying structural anthropological concepts to the rituals of public execution up to the midnineteenth century and exploring the politics

such as evans doubting the fairness of a  german plebiscite in which the nazi regime received  of the vote a subject that much engaged irving and evans in a debate was a memo by the chief of the reich chancellery hans lammers to the reich justice minister franz schlegelberger in which lammers wrote that hitler ordered him to put the jewish question on the backburner until after the war evans chose to accept the interpretation of the memo put forward by eberhard jäckel in the s irving chose to interpret the memo literally and taunted evans by saying it is a terrible problem is it not that we are faced with this tantalizing plate of crumbs and morsels of what should have provided the final smoking gun and nowhere the whole way through the archives do we find even one item that we do not have to interpret or read between the lines of but we do have in the same chain of evidence documents whichquite clearly specifically show hitler intervening in the other sense in response evans stated no i do not accept that at all it is because you want to interpret euphemisms as being literal and that is what the whole problem is every time there is an euphemism mr irving  or a camouflage piece of statement or language about madagascar you want to treat it as the literal truth because it serves your purpose of trying to exculpate hitler that is part of  the way you manipulate and distort the documents in a  interview evans described to the canadian columnist robert fulford his impression of irving after being crossexamined by him as he irving was a bit like a dim student who didnt listen if he didnt get the answer he wanted he just repeated the question his findings and his account of the trial were published in his  book lying about hitler history holocaust and the david irving trial which was published as telling lies about hitler in the united states in  the high court rejected irving’s libel suit and awarded costs to the defence evans involvement in the trial was included in the  film denial in which he was played by british actor john sessions the third reich trilogyedit richard j evans  main article the third reich trilogy between  and  evans published a threevolume history of the third reich drawing on years of experience as a leading scholar of german history evans produced what some historians call the most extensive and comprehensive history of the rise and fall of hitler’s regime ever produced by a single scholar reviewer peter mansoor says the third reich at war is a superb piece of scholarship that is likely to emerge as the definitive account of life and death inside hitlers blood soaked third reich robert citino says read together the three volumes constitute a remarkably comprehensive treatment of the origins course and death of the hitler regime and are likely to be standard works for a long time to come ed ericson says evans masterfully interweaves testimony that has come to light in the intervening decades with learned judgments from hundreds of authors to create a balanced and thoughtful narrative this book therefore will assuredly become the definitive work on the third reich at war the first volume the coming of the third reich how the nazis destroyed democracy and seized power in germany published by penguin in  shows how a country torn apart by the first world war the terms of the treaty of versailles hyperinflation and the great depression moved towards an increasingly authoritarian solution the book explains in detail adolf hitlers appointment as chancellor in january  and how the nazis transformed germany into a one party dictatorship the first volume featured highly favorable words of praise from evanss friend ian kershaw on its cover the second volume the third reich in power    how the nazis won over the hearts and minds of a nation published by penguin in  covers the years of nazi rule between  and  the final chapter examines the road to the second world war but the real focus is on life inside nazi germany one of the great strengths of this volume is the way evans allows small stories of key individuals to illustrate many of the key social economic and cultural events of the period richard overy described this instalment of the trilogy as magisterial the third volume the third reich at war how the nazis led germany from conquest to disaster published by penguin in  looks at major developments from  to  including the key battles of the second world war a vivid moving and detailed account of the mass murder enacted during the holocaust and hitlers dramatic downfall in berlin in  in an october  review of the third volume for the times bestselling historian antony beevor writes with this third volume richard evans has accomplished a masterpiece of historical scholarship  he has produced the best and most uptodate synthesis of the huge work carried out on the subject over the past decades aspects of it however were sharply criticised by tim snyder walter reich former director of the united states holocaust memorial museum in washington d c states about the thirdvolume of the trilogythe third reich at war if any work of accurate history has a chance to correct the distortions of public memory this is it regius professor of modern historyedit in  evans was appointed regius professor of modern history at cambridge university in  the word modern was removed from the title by royal decree the post is a royal appointment in the gift of the prime minister of the day and dates back to  previous holders of the title have included john dalbergacton  herbert butterfield  geoffrey elton  patrick collinson  and quentin skinner  evans is the first historian to have to apply for the post and be interviewed by a board of electors including cambridges vicechancellor alison richard and representatives of the history faculty and the university as well as external assessors from yale harvard oxford and london the board selected a shortlist of four each of whom was asked to give a presentation to the entire cambridge history faculty the shortlist of four was then reduced to two whom the board interviewed resulting in the boards recommendation of evans to the prime minister and in the issue of a royal warrant for his appointment as well as serving as regius professor evans has served as chairman of the history faculty since october  his term of office ended on  september  evans is used to combining administration with research at birkbeck college london where he worked before cambridge he acted as master of the college when baroness blackstone left suddenly to become tony blairs first higher education minister on  january  he was elected to the position of president of wolfson college cambridge to take up office on  october  tv and media appearancesedit evans has appeared regularly on a number of tv documentaries related to adolf hitler and the third reich he recently appeared on a major tv documentary on the history channel which examined the valkyrie bomb plot against hitler in july  which was the subject of a hollywood film starring tom cruise as of  he has made  appearances on the bbc radio  programme in our time he also appears regularly on start the week and often writes reviews of history books on his specialist era in major newspapers and periodicals he is also a noted lecturer and gives numerous keynote lectures at international conferences around the world and also at student conferences as part of his remit to take history to a wider audience beyond academia he is known as an excellent public speaker and often appears regularly as a keynote speaker at universities and schools and at conferences for academics and students around the world debate with the british education secretaryedit in  evans was involved in a debate with michael gove the british education secretary about the content and style of history teaching and the way that the curriculum is structured and how the first world war should be portrayed writing in the daily mail gove accused evans in particular of distorting history with regard to britains role in the war evans countered that gove was engaging in the defamation of academic historians and narrow tubthumping jingoism evans stated that he agreed with goves statement about the ruthless social darwinism of the german elites the pitiless approach they took to occupation their aggressively expansionist war aims and their scorn for the international order all made resistance more than justified evans wrote hes gove right about the elites but misses the point that they werent able to carry the majority of the german people with them the largest political party the social democrats was opposed to annexations and had long been critical of the militarism of the elites he also ridiculed gove’s suggestion that the first world war was “just” and fought by men committed to defending the western liberal order pointing out that britains ally tsar nicholas ii was far more despotic than even the kaiser and that  of british adult males were not allowed to vote evans also wrote that gove was wrong that only leftwing historians believe that britain was wrong to fight germany in world war i noting that such conservative historians as niall ferguson and alan clark have been quite vocal in expressing the belief that britain should have remained neutral in  criticismedit in  evans became involved in a polemical exchange of letters with peter baldwin after agreeing with leif jerram in cosmopolitan islanders  that students in britain could find a richer selection of courses on the histories of other countries in british universities than students from other countries could in their own countries honours and distinctionsedit  fellow of the

traces the rise and fall of german military might the mobilization of a “people’s community” to serve a war of conquest and hitler’s campaign of racial subjugation and genocide already hailed as “a masterpiece” william grimes in the new york times and “the most comprehensive history… of the third reich” ian kershaw this epic trilogy reaches its terrifying climax in this volumeevans interweaves a broad narrative of the war’s progress with viscerally affecting personal testimony from a wide range of people  from generals to frontline soldiers from hitler youth activists to middleclass housewives the third reich at war lays bare the dynamics of a nation more deeply immersed in war than any society before or sincefresh insights into the conflict’s great events are here from the invasion of poland to the battle of stalingrad to hitler’s suicide in the bunker but just as important is the recreation of the daily experience of ordinary germans in wartime staggering under pressure from allied bombing and their own government’s mounting demands upon them at the center of the book is the nazi extermination of europe’s jews set in the context of hitler’s genocidal plans for the racial restructuring of europeblending narrative description and analysis the third reich at war creates an engrossing picture  at once sweeping and precise  of a society rushing headlong to selfdestruction and taking much of europe with it it is the culmination of a historical masterwork that will remain the most authoritative work on nazi germany for years to come listen to previous volumes in richard j evans third reich trilogy  richard j evans p gildan media corp what the critics say masterful…evans demonstrates a fluent style and a sweeping grasp of the third reich’s history and of the enormous historical literature…evans narrates the reich’s end in gripping fashion as the allies closed in on germany evans’s fellow historians as well as a broader public will listen to

wonderful the first thing to say about this entire series is that all  books form a wonderful history of the third reich it also seems important to mention that this volume is a history of the third reich during the war not the luftwaffe kriegsmarine or wehrmacht so there is only limited coverage of the actual battles rather this book concerns itself mostly with government policy concerning those living inside germany itself and the occupied territories it is very detailed and i found some sections on the extermination camps very emotionally painful to get through the book also does not cover some areas that i would like to have heard about for example how were allied soldiers who were minorities treated in prison camps did the wehrmacht follow the geneva convention rules or not what was the relationship between the wehrmacht and the ss since the book is about government policy these areas were not covered in any detail regardless this book as well as the preceding two volumes form an invaluable history and should be required reading for anyone who wants to know about the second world war in europe i also agree with another reviewer who suggested that these books along with shirers rise and fall of the third reich should both be read since they are complimentary highly recommended more less  of  people found this review helpful   doc charlotte nc  doc charlotte nc  member since  helpful votes  ratings reviews   followers following   overallperformancestory just do it this review is for the entire series my contribution to the pile of reviews starts with the observation that the work cannot be compared to any other book about wwii or really any other history im tolerably well read in the area and this set of books is uniqueat the outset i found the narrator troublesome but just as i have found on long walks as i progressed i realized that his delivery fit the material nothing hurried nothing emotional nothing dramatic if youve been to the viet nam memorial in dc youll know what i mean it isnt the individual names but the total list it isnt the granduer of the monument it is the monumental display of horror you too will get over it and then take comfort in the methodical recitation of what happened to all the unwanted particularly the jewish peoplesome of the reviews complained about the relatively short shrift given to military history and some technological flaws there are excellent military histories that cover this ground readers of this book only need that material for contextual reference for instance the history of the period were just passing through isnt about the individual money scams the individual mortgages and speculations or the indivdual stories of growing disparities in income and assets rather it is about the how these individual events came about to overwhelm the financial system as a whole so it is with nazi germanyfor as long as this book is around it will be difficult for people to deny the holocaust and it will be difficult to repeat what hitler and his followers were able to do just read it more less  of  people found this review helpful   die falknerin  die falknerin  painter musician bibliophile helpful votes  ratings reviews   followers following   overallperformancestory finishing the trilogy personally i was more interested in the time periods covered in the first two volumes than i am in the war period but i found the third reich at war to be as wellwritten meaningful and interesting as the previous books once again i am grateful for evans resourceful use of primary research materials i enjoy his writing style and way of presenting a complicated series of events i found the entire series to be profoundly depressing but how could it be otherwise considering the content still i feel evans dealt with the subjects in a fair evenhanded way without resorting to hyperbole or underplaying the horror sean pratts narration got on my last nerve this time i could barely tolerate him in the first two volumes anyone less suited to pronouncing the german language i cannot imagine unless its betty boop he cannot manage even basic german place names to someone who speaks german listening to him is like fingernails on a chalkboard his pacing is atrocious i will never no matter how interesting the book might be listen to anything he reads again but i have no regrets the trilogy was fantastic and i plan to get copies in hardcover more less  of  people found this review helpful   joe kansas city mo united states  joe kansas city mo united states  member since  i read science biographies

what do you say about a book as finely researched as meticulously executed as solidly paced as informative and horrifying and shocking as the third reich at war it is a masterpiece and all i can say to richard j evans is thank you this is an exceptional book that begins with the invasion of poland and ends with the nuremburg trials you can read it alone or as part of the larger series the coming of the third reich and the third reich in power it is a fantastic series and this book is its pinnacleit is not a history of wwii as that has been done many times instead this is a story of the third reich their leadership at home their policies and their wartime strategies there is of course military history here and there is a history of the holocaust both of these sections are told in finite and powerful detail but this is also the story of germany and its fall into absolute ruin read these books they are researched written paced and read with perfection more less  of  people found this

evans is great and you really should read them in order  however that is not required i will say the rise and fall of the third reich is a much easier to follow and more entertaining book and its reader is on a level that this book reader could never hope to obtain i would highly recommend that book over this series if you could only have one however i think youd be best served to listen to both this series gives more of an indepth at the day to day lives of germans and helps you have a better understanding of the war in general and how germany became the place it didi give it a high recommend which would be much higher if it wasnt read by such an amateur the reader is extremely poor and does a great disservice to this book after about  hours between the  books i think i finally started to get used to him so i wasnt as annoyed by the readers inability to know when to pause in a sentence and his extremely monotone voice overall however the reader is awful and has no business doing so much as reading a line power point presentation more less  of  people found this review helpful   alex deltona fl united states  alex deltona fl united states  member since  helpful votes

narration is flawless five stars more less  of  people found this review helpful   amazon customer  amazon customer  helpful votes  ratings reviews   followers following   overall great history well spoken but i cannot understand why a history of this quality would have such affectations both from the writer and the narrator the author in his preface says hes going to anglicize certain german words for ease of understanding mein kampf becomes my struggle and der fuehrer becomes the leader these two german terms are so well known that its hard to listen to their being spoken this way the leader is often confusing which leader are we talking about now the narrator has done a great job with german and other language terms but there are glaring mistakes for example the reichstag is not pronounced as tag as in license tag but as tahg with a soft g almost a ch sound other such gaffs should have been caught in the editing all this makes for a feeling of amateurishness marring an otherwise superb history all three volumes are topical and sequential but not a narrative history with in depth treatments of many important topics like the origins of racial policy and the economics of the reich how did hitler pay for rearmament its easy engrossing listening that explains a great deal about how a well educated population could be psychically captured by a lunatic its a lesson that will endure more less  of  people found this review helpful   jon meridian id united states  jon meridian id united states  member since  history enthusiast with military and legal background helpful votes  ratings reviews   followers following   overallperformancestory now the rest of the story would you recommend this audiobook to a friend if so why definitely this book does a masterful job describing not only the blow by blow accounts of the war but also the home front of nazi germany the most interesting aspect was the accounts of life in germany immediately after the warbrbrpeople like me who have an interest in this area of history were brought up believing that the nazis were a small minority who did not enjoy the support of the german people furthermore the german people had no idea about what was happening in the death camps this book shatters that myth and destroys the long professed alibi of the german people that it was all the ss and nazis who committed atrocities brbrthe accounts of the wehrmachts interaction with the civilian population in eastern europe and russia strips away any pretense that the ss were the only bad guys in the warbrbrone criticism i have of the book is that the author is a too kind to soviet russia and discounts many atrocities that they committed keeping that in mind it was a good read more less  of  people found this review helpful

i appreciated the effort and research required to portray the reality of the horror people suffered during the post world war i up to the end of world war ii experienced at worst it was sometimes too graphic for too long that tends to dull the senses what did you like best about this story the horror of war is not to be liked at best we can learn and remember not to repeat it how did the narrator detract from the book in every possible way i have never listened to three books  read successively by the same reader  that were read with such sad neglect of proper pausing intonation and whatever other crimes a narrator can be guilty of one would have thought or hoped that there had been an overseer of sorts who might have been able to guide the narrator if it had been my books i listened to the series of three  i might have torn my heart out i often had to rewind to get the correct meaning when a sentence ended in midair so to speak i hardly think the author inserted all those unappropriated commas and fullstops did the third reich at war inspire you to do anything yes to avoid the narrator at all cost any additional comments this book and its twi predecessors were done an insult  of  people found this review helpful e wood green united kingdom  overallperformancestory excellent loved this and the  previous books in the seriesi learnt a little bit more about the nazis

rather than about germany at war its a social account primarily rather than a military one have you listened to any of sean pratt’s other performances how does this one compare performance was very

the third reich at war as with previous two books in this trilogy the writting was perfect easy to follow and narration without any faults perfect combination of great book and great reader what other book might you compare the third reich at war to and why there are so many books one could compare this book with on the market but hands down this one best for me as i rather like story of the little people here on audible there is a bit outdated but still great book by american correspondent william l shirer one of the best books written by somebody who actually was there it is called the rise and fall of the third reich and while not completely up to date on quite a few facts and with some obvious onesided beliefs which are now known to be incorrect it is also a great listen it is also worth to read albert speers memoirs as while now known to be full of half truths and complete lies it does portray the era pretty well there are many of the diaries and letters which were later published by themselves and which evans uses in this trilogy and they are all great background read  of  people found this review helpful report inappropriate content if you find this review
