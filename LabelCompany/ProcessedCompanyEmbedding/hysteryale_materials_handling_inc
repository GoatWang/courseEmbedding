americas segment which includes the north america latin america and brazil markets increased  to  million in the first quarter of  from  million in the first quarter of  mainly as a result of an increase in unit shipments  unit shipments increased by approximately  units over the first quarter of  driven primarily by shipments of the companys new class  internal combustion engine standard truck and increased shipments of highercapacity  to  ton class  trucks as well as higher shipments of class  and class  trucks partly offset by fewer shipments of class  big trucks  an increase in parts sales and favorable foreign currency movements also contributed to the revenue increase operating profit in the americas increased substantially to  million in the first quarter of  compared with  million in the prior year quarter primarily as a result of improved gross profit and lower selling general and administrative expenses mainly due to the absence of  million of acquisitionrelated costs recognized in   gross profit increased  million primarily as a result of production efficiencies driven by higher unit volumes favorable currency movements of  million and improved pricing partly offset by modest increases in material costs the company expects the americas market in  to be comparable to the strong market experienced in   as a result of these market conditions as well as anticipated market share increases unit shipments revenues and parts sales are expected to increase over the remainder of  compared with the same period in  due to an increase in sales of higherpriced class   and  electric trucks and class  internal combustion engine trucks  revenues are expected to increase in each of the remaining  quarters over the prior year comparable quarter with a much smaller improvement expected in the second quarter operating profit in the americas segment is also expected to increase over the remainder of  compared with   this improvement is largely due to an expected increase in sales volumes of highermargin units and the new class  internal combustion engine standard truck as well as an expected increase in product pricing higher parts volume and favorable currency movements partially offset by material cost inflation and higher operating expenses emea revenues in the emea segment which includes operations in the europe middle east and africa markets increased  to  million in the  first quarter from  million in the first quarter of   the revenue increase was predominantly driven by an increase in unit shipments of  units primarily related to shipments of the new class  internal combustion engine standard truck and an increase in unit shipments of class  electricrider trucks partially offset by fewer shipments of class  big trucks  unfavorable currency movements of  million from the translation of sales into us dollars partially offset the increase in revenues despite an increase in revenues emeas operating profit declined to  million in the first quarter of  from  million in the first quarter of  as an increase in operating expenses primarily due to higher marketing costs more than offset modestly improved gross profit  benefits realized in gross profit from higher shipments and related production efficiencies were almost fully offset by unfavorable currency movements of  million the strong us dollar is expected to continue to have an unfavorable but moderating impact on the emea results in  in  moderate overall growth in the emea market is expected to be driven by strength in the eastern and western europe and middle east and africa markets  units and parts revenues are expected to increase over the remainder of  due to the expected stronger overall market conditions and anticipated market share gains driven by sales of higherpriced electric trucks and class  internal combustion engine trucks  greater revenue growth is anticipated in the  second quarter compared with the prior year with an anticipated moderation in growth during the second half of the year compared with the strong second half of  operating profit in the emea segment is expected to decrease over the remainder of  compared with the same period in  as the anticipated favorable impact of improvements in unit and parts revenues and improved pricing is expected to be more than offset by higher operating expenses and material cost inflation  during the remaining  quarters the operating profit decreases are expected to be substantially larger than in the first quarter japic revenues in the japic segment which includes operations in the asia and pacific markets including china increased to  million in the first quarter of  from  million in the first quarter of   revenues increased mainly as a result of an increase in unit shipments of approximately  units primarily in class  internal combustion engine lift trucks including big trucks and higherpriced class  electric trucks japic generated a lower operating loss of  million in the first quarter of  an improvement of  million from the operating loss of  million in the first quarter of   the improvement was primarily the result of higher gross profit attributable to favorable currency movements of  million increased unit sales volumes of highermargin lift trucks and improved pricing partly offset by higher material costs despite a large increase in the china market in the first quarter of  the overall japic market for fullyear  is expected to be comparable to  with moderate improvements in all but the japan and pacific markets  as a result of the continued implementation of the companys strategic initiatives revenues and operating results are expected to improve during the remainder of  particularly in the second half compared with the same period in  driven by increased unit and parts volumes and improved pricing overall lift truck outlook hysteryale remains focused on gaining market share in its lift truck business through the continued implementation of its key strategic initiatives of understanding customer needs providing the lowest cost of ownership over the lifecycle of the truck enhancing its independent distribution increasing its warehouse market position increasing the companys success in the asia markets increasing its big truck market position strengthening its sales and marketing organization and leveraging its solutions and technology drivers to meet customer needs the company is developing new products in many segments that are expected to support its market share growth  shipments began on the new standard  ton class  internal combustion engine lift truck and the companys new european  ton pedestrian pallet stacker late in the fourth quarter of   in april  the company launched its new economy reachstacker big truck dedicated to highvolume containerhandling applications in defined markets  as these new products gain traction and other new products in the pipeline are introduced these new products are expected to help increase market share improve revenues and enhance operating margins in  and in the long term in  the global lift truck market is expected to grow modestly compared with  sales volumes and unit and parts revenues in the lift truck business are expected to increase during the remainder of  compared with the same period in   the fullyear increase is expected to be more than the anticipated market growth rate due to anticipated market share gains resulting from the companys new products and the continued implementation of its other share gain initiatives  however as a result of the strong first quarter revenue growth in the second quarter is expected to be more modest with growth expected to increase again in the second half of the year operating profit is expected to increase in  over  as a result of enhanced margins through pricing net of material cost increases while maintaining headcount near current levels  however a more modest operating profit improvement is anticipated in the second half of  compared with  primarily as a result of the substantial operating profit increase in the first quarter of  combined with an anticipated softer third quarter  overall fullyear  net income is expected to increase moderately over  as anticipated benefits from the improvement in operating profit are expected to be partially offset by a higher income tax rate and the absence of tax benefits recognized in  commodity costs declined throughout  but are expected to increase in  from the low  levels  commodities particularly steel remain volatile and sensitive to changes in the global economy and the company will continue to monitor these closely bolzoni results for the first quarter of  bolzoni which was acquired by

results include  million of onetime purchase accounting adjustments and  million of expenses related to the amortization of acquired assets bolzoni outlook the majority of bolzonis revenues are generated in the emea market primarily eastern and western europe and to a lesser degree in the north america market  as a result of anticipated growth in the emea markets recent major customer commitments and the implementation of sales enhancement programs bolzonis fullyear  revenues are expected to increase modestly over its revenues for the twelve months ended march   in addition to the anticipated increase in revenues and the expected operating leverage resulting from the sales growth the implementation of several key strategic programs are expected to generate substantial growth in bolzonis operating profit and net income in  compared with operating profit and net income for the twelve months ended march    in addition the absence of onetime purchase accounting adjustments recognized in  will contribute to the improvement in results  however acquisitionrelated amortization costs are ongoing and expected to be approximately  million each quarter based on currency conversion rates nuvera results nuvera reported revenues of  million an operating loss of  million and a net loss of  million for the first quarter of  compared with revenues of  million an operating loss of  million and a net loss of  million for the first quarter of   this also compares favorably to revenues of  million an operating loss of  million and a net loss of  million for the fourth quarter of  revenues increased compared with the prior year quarter as nuvera installed  nuvera® hydrogen generator formerly powertap® units during the first quarter of   in the first quarter of
