father nostalgically in letters after alexanders death in  he was also very close to his mother as revealed in their published letters to each other his paternal grandparents were emperor alexander ii and maria alexandrovna marie of hesse born princess marie of hesse and by rhine his maternal grandparents were king christian ix and queen louise of denmark nicholas was of primarily german and danish descent his last ethnically russian ancestor being grand duchess anna petrovna of russia  daughter of peter the great tsar nicholas ii of russia with his physically similar cousin king george v of the united kingdom right in german military uniforms in berlin before the war  nicholas was related to several monarchs in europe his mothers siblings included kings frederik viii of denmark and george i of greece as well as the united kingdoms queen alexandra consort of king edward vii nicholas his wife alexandra and wilhelm ii german emperor were all first cousins of king george v of the united kingdom nicholas was also a first cousin of both haakon vii of norway and maud of wales as well as king constantine i of greece nicholas and wilhelm ii were in turn second cousinsonceremoved as each descended from king frederick william iii of prussia as well as third cousins as they were both greatgreatgrandsons of tsar paul i of russia in addition to being second cousins through descent from louis ii grand duke of hesse and his wife princess wilhelmine of baden nicholas and alexandra were also third cousinsonceremoved as they were both descendants of king frederick william ii of prussia tsar nicholas ii was the first cousinonceremoved of grand duke nicholas nikolaevich to distinguish between them the grand duke was often known within the imperial family as nikolasha and nicholas the tall while the tsar was nicholas the short in his childhood nicholas his parents and siblings made annual visits to the danish royal palaces of fredensborg and bernstorff to visit his grandparents the king and queen the visits also served as family reunions as his mothers siblings would also come from the united kingdom germany and greece with their respective families it was there in  that he had a flirtation with one of his english first cousins princess victoria in  nicholas also accompanied his parents and younger brother twoyearold george on a twomonth semiofficial visit to england in london nicholas and his family stayed at marlborough house as guests of his uncle bertie and aunt alix the prince and princess of wales where he was spoiled by his uncle tsesarevichedit tsarevich nicholas in japan  on  march  following the assassination of his grandfather tsar alexander ii nicholas became heir apparent upon his fathers ascension as alexander iii nicholas and his other family members bore witness to alexander iis death having been present at the winter palace in saint petersburg where he was brought after the attack for security reasons the new tsar and his family relocated their primary residence to the gatchina palace outside the city only entering the capital for various ceremonial functions on such occasions alexander iii and his family occupied the nearby anichkov palace in  nicholass comingofage ceremony was held at the winter palace where he pledged his loyalty to his father later that year nicholass uncle grand duke sergei alexandrovich married princess elizabeth daughter of louis iv grand duke of hesse and his late wife princess alice of the united kingdom who had died in  and a granddaughter of queen victoria at the wedding in st petersburg the sixteenyearold tsarevich met with and admired the brides youngest surviving sister twelveyearold princess alix those feelings of admiration blossomed into love following her visit to st petersburg five years later in  alix had feelings for him in turn as a devout lutheran she was initially reluctant to convert to russian orthodoxy in order to marry nicholas but later relented eventually in  nicholas along with his younger brother george and their cousin prince george of greece set out on a world tour although grand duke george fell ill and was sent home partway through the trip nicholas visited egypt india singapore and bangkok receiving honors as a distinguished guest in each country in april  while traveling through the city of otsu japan nicholas was the victim of an assassination attempt the incident cut his trip short returning overland to st petersburg he was present at the ceremonies in vladivostok commemorating the beginning of work on the transsiberian railway in  nicholas traveled to london on behalf of his parents to be present at the wedding of his cousin george duke of york to mary of teck queen victoria was struck by the physical resemblance between the two cousins and their appearances confused some at the wedding during this time nicholas had an affair with st petersburg ballerina mathilde kschessinska despite being heirapparent to the throne however nicholass father failed to prepare him for his future role as tsar he attended meetings of the state council however as his father was only in his forties it was expected that it would be several years before nicholas would take the throne sergei witte russias finance minister saw things differently and suggested to the tsar that nicholas be appointed to the siberian railway committee alexander argued that nicholas was not mature enough to take on serious responsibilities to which witte replied that if he was not introduced to state affairs nicholas would never be ready to understand them alexanders assumptions about living a long life and having years to prepare nicholas for becoming tsar would be proven wrong as by  alexander iii was suffering from ill health engagement accession and marriageedit see also wedding of nicholas ii and alexandra feodorovna in april  nicholas joined his uncle sergei and aunt elizabeth on a journey to coburg germany for the wedding of elizabeths and alixs brother ernest louis grand duke of hesse to their mutual first cousin princess victoria melita of saxecoburg and gotha other guests included queen victoria wilhelm ii german emperor the victoria princess royal kaiser wilhelms mother and queen victorias eldest daughter nicholass uncle the prince of wales and the brides parents the duke and duchess of saxecoburg and gotha once in coburg nicholas proposed to alix but she rejected his proposal being reluctant to convert to orthodoxy but the kaiser later told her she had a duty to marry nicholas and to convert as her sister elizabeth had voluntarily done in  thus nicholas and alix became officially engaged on  april  nicholass parents initially hesitated to give the engagement their blessing as alix had made poor impressions during her visits to russia they gave their consent only when they saw tsar alexanders health deteriorating queen victoria also initially opposed to the match for though she had no objections against nicholas personally she evidently disliked russiacitation needed official engagement photograph of nicholas ii and alexandra april  that summer nicholas travelled to england to visit both alix and the queen the visit coincided with the birth of the duke and duchess of yorks first child the future king edward viii along with being present at the christening nicholas and alix were listed amongst the childs godparents after several weeks in england nicholas returned home for the wedding of his sister xenia to a cousin grand duke alexander mikhailovich sandro by that autumn alexander iii lay dying upon learning that he would live only a fortnight the tsar had nicholas summon alix to the imperial palace at livadia alix arrived on  october the tsar insisted on receiving her in full uniform from his deathbed he told his son to heed the advice of witte his most capable minister ten days later alexander iii died at the age of fortynine leaving twentysixyearold nicholas as emperor of russia that evening nicholas was consecrated by his fathers priest as tsar nicholas ii and the following day alix was received into the russian orthodox church taking the name alexandra feodorovna with the title of grand duchess and the style of imperial highness nicholas ii and family nicholas may have felt unprepared for the duties of the crown for he asked his cousin and brotherinlaw grand duke alexander what is going to happen to me and all of russia though perhaps underprepared and unskilled nicholas was not altogether untrained for his duties as tsar nicholas chose to maintain the conservative policies favoured by his father throughout his reign while alexander iii had concentrated on the formulation of general policy nicholas devoted much more attention to the details of administrationcitation needed leaving livadia on  november tsar alexanders funeral procession—which included nicholass paternal aunt queen olga of greece and the prince and princess of wales—arrived in moscow after lying in state in the kremlin the body of the tsar was taken to st petersburg where the funeral was held on  november tsar nicholas ii and empress alexandra with their first child  nicholas and alixs wedding was originally scheduled for the spring of  but it was moved forward at nicholass insistence staggering under the weight of his new office he had no intention of allowing the one person who gave him confidence to leave his side instead nicholass wedding to alix took place on  november  which was the birthday of the dowager empress marie feodorovna and court mourning could be slightly relaxed alexandra wore the traditional dress of romanov brides and nicholas a hussars uniform nicholas and alexandra each holding a lit candle faced the palace priest and were married a few minutes before one in the afternoon reignedit coronation by valentin serov nicholas iis imperial monogram silk imperial crown of russia  coronation gift to nicholas ii nicholas ii of russia as tsarevich in  despite a visit to the united kingdom in  where he observed the house of commons in debate and seemingly impressed by the machinery of constitutional monarchy as well as a similar positive appraisal of the us congress on an official visit to the united states as tsesarevich nicholas turned his back on any notion of giving away any power to elected representatives in russia shortly after he came to the throne a deputation of peasants and workers from various towns local assemblies zemstvos came to the winter palace proposing court reforms such as the adoption of a constitutional monarchy and reform that would improve the political and economic life of the peasantry in the tver address although the addresses they had sent in beforehand were couched in mild and loyal terms nicholas was angry and ignored advice from an imperial family council by saying to them  it has come to my knowledge that during the last months there have been heard in some assemblies of the zemstvos the voices of those who have indulged in a senseless dream that the zemstvos be called upon to participate in the government of the country i want everyone to know that i will devote all my strength to maintain for the good of the whole nation the principle of absolute autocracy as firmly and as strongly as did my late lamented father on  may  nicholass formal coronation as tsar was held in uspensky cathedral located within the kremlin the silk imperial crown of russia was used as an official coronation gift of the russian empire nicholas ii was the first and only monarch to be presented with such a monumental coronation gift it was not intended as ceremonial regalia but as private imperial property a memento to his coronation in celebration on  may  a large festival with food free beer and souvenir cups was held in khodynka field outside moscow khodynka was chosen as the location as it was the only place near moscow large enough to hold all of the moscow citizens khodynka was primarily used as a military training ground and the field was uneven with trenches before the food and drink was handed out rumours spread that there would not be enough for everyone as a result the crowd rushed to get their share and individuals were tripped and trampled upon suffocating in the dirt of the field of the approximate  in attendance it is estimated that  individuals died and roughly  were injured the khodynka tragedy was seen as an ill omen and nicholas found gaining popular trust difficult from the beginning of his reign the french ambassadors gala was planned for that night the tsar wanted to stay in his chambers and pray for the lives lost but his uncles believed that his absence at the ball would strain relations with france particularly the  francorussian alliance thus nicholas attended the party as a result the mourning populace saw nicholas as frivolous and uncaring during the autumn after the coronation nicholas and alexandra made a tour of europe after making visits to the emperor and empress of austriahungary the kaiser of germany and nicholass danish grandparents and relatives nicholas and alexandra took possession of their new yacht the standart which had been built in denmark from there they made a journey to scotland to spend some time with queen victoria at balmoral castle while alexandra enjoyed her reunion with her grandmother nicholas complained in a letter to his mother about being forced to go shooting with his uncle the prince of wales in bad weather and was suffering from a bad toothache the first years of his reign saw little more than continuation and development of the policy pursued by alexander iii nicholas allotted money for the allrussia exhibition of  in  restoration of gold standard by sergei witte minister of finance completed the series of financial reforms initiated fifteen years earlier by  the transsiberian railway was nearing completion this helped the russians trade in the far east but the railway still required huge amounts of work initiatives in foreign affairsedit in foreign relations nicholas followed the policies of his father strengthening the francorussian alliance and pursuing a policy of general european pacification which culminated in the famous hague peace conference this conference suggested and promoted by nicholas ii was convened with the view of terminating the arms race and setting up machinery for the peaceful settlement of international disputes the results of the conference were less than expected due to the mutual distrust existing between great powers nevertheless the hague conventions were among the first formal statements of the laws of war in  nicholas ii and the famous russian diplomat friedrich martens were nominated for the nobel peace prize—for the initiative to convene the hague peace conference and contributing to its implementation ecclesiastical affairsedit in  nicholas threw himself into an ecclesiastical crisis regarding the canonisation of seraphim of sarov the previous year it had been suggested that if he were canonised the imperial couple would beget a son and heir to throne while alexandra demanded in july  that seraphim be canonised in less than a week nicholas demanded that he be canonised within a year despite a public outcry the church bowed to the intense imperial pressure declaring seraphim worthy of canonisation in january  that summer the imperial family travelled to sarov for the canonisation russojapanese waredit main article russojapanese war the russian baltic fleet was annihilated by the japanese at the battle of tsushima a clash between russia and the empire of japan was almost inevitable by the turn of the th century russia had expanded in the far east and the growth of its settlement and territorial ambitions as its southward path to the balkans was frustrated conflicted with japans own territorial ambitions on the chinese and asian mainland nicholas pursued an aggressive foreign policy with regards to manchuria and korea and strongly supported the scheme for timber concessions in these areas as developed by the bezobazov group war began in february  with a preemptive japanese attack on the russian fleet in port arthur prior to a formal declaration of war with the russian far east fleet trapped at port arthur the only other russian fleet was the baltic fleet it was half a world away but the decision was made to send the fleet on a ninemonth voyage to the east the united kingdom would not allow the russian navy to use the suez canal due to its alliance with the empire of japan and due to the dogger bank incident where the baltic fleet mistakenly fired on british fishing boats in the north sea the russian baltic fleet traversed the world to lift the blockade on port arthur but after many misadventures on the way was nearly annihilated by the japanese in the battle of the tsushima strait on land the imperial russian army experienced logistical problems while commands and supplies came from st petersburg combat took place in east asian ports with only the transsiberian railway for transport of supplies as well as troops both ways the kilometre  mi rail line between st petersburg and port arthur was singletrack with no track around lake baikal allowing only gradual buildup of the forces on the front besieged port arthur fell to the japanese after nine months of resistance nicholass stance on the war was something that baffled many he approached the war with confidence and saw it as an opportunity to raise russian morale and patriotism paying little attention to the financial repercussions of a longdistance war shortly before the japanese attack on port arthur nicholas held firm to the belief that there would be no war despite the onset of the war and the many defeats russia suffered nicholas still believed in and expected a final victory maintaining an image of the racial inferiority and military weakness of the japanese as russia faced imminent defeat by the japanese the call for peace grew nicholass own mother as well as his cousin emperor wilhelm ii urged nicholas to open peace negotiations despite the

prior to bloody sunday   january  the priest and labor leader georgy gapon informed the government of the forthcoming procession to the winter palace to hand a workers petition to the tsar on saturday   january the ministers convened to consider the situation there was never any thought that the tsar who had left the capital for tsarskoye selo on the advice of the ministers would actually meet gapon the suggestion that some other member of the imperial family receive the petition was rejected finally informed by the prefect of police that he lacked the men to pluck gapon from among his followers and place him under arrest the newly appointed minister of the interior prince sviatopolkmirsky and his colleagues decided to bring additional troops to reinforce the city that evening

that saturday he telephoned my mother at the anitchkov and said that she and i were to leave for gatchina at once he and alicky went to tsarskoye selo insofar as i remember my uncles vladimir and nicholas were the only members of the family left in st petersburg but there may have been others i felt at the time that all those arrangements were hideously wrong nickys ministers and the chief of police had it all their way my mother and i wanted him to stay in st petersburg and to face the crowd i am positive that for all the ugly mood of some of the workmen nickys appearance would have calmed them they would have presented their petition and gone back to their homes but that wretched epiphany incident had left all the senior officials in a state of panic they kept on telling nicky that he had no right to run such a risk that he owed it to the country to leave the capital that even with the utmost precautions taken there might always be some loophole left my mother and i did all we could to persuade him that the ministers advice was wrong but nicky preferred to follow it and he was the first to repent when he heard of the tragic outcome from his hiding place gapon issued a letter stating nicholas romanov formerly tsar and at present soulmurderer of the russian empire the innocent blood of workers their wives and children lies forever between you and the russian people

tsarism  revolutionedit main article  russian revolution confronted with growing opposition and after consulting with witte and prince sviatopolkmirsky the tsar issued a reform ukase on december   with vague promises in hopes of cutting short the rebellion many demonstrators were shot on bloody sunday  as they tried to march to the winter palace in st petersburg dmitri feodorovich trepov was ordered to take drastic measures to stop the revolutionary activity grand duke sergei was killed in february by a revolutionarys bomb in moscow as he left the kremlin on  march the tsar condemned the revolutionaries meanwhile witte recommended that a manifesto be issued schemes of reform would be elaborated by goremykin and a committee consisting of elected representatives of the zemstvos and municipal councils under the presidency of witte in june the battleship potemkin part of the black sea fleet mutinied around augustseptember after his diplomatic success on ending the russojapanese war witte wrote to the tsar stressing the urgent need for political reforms at home the tsar remained quiet impassive and indulgent he spent most of that autumn hunting with the defeat of russia by a nonwestern power the prestige and authority of the autocratic regime fell significantly tsar nicholas ii taken by surprise by the events reacted with anger and bewilderment he wrote to his mother after months of disorder it makes me sick to read the news nothing but strikes in schools and factories murdered policemen cossacks and soldiers riots disorder mutinies but the ministers instead of acting with quick decision only assemble in council like a lot of frightened hens and cackle about providing united ministerial action ominous quiet days began quiet indeed because there was complete order in the streets but at the same time everybody knew that something was going to happen — the troops were waiting for the signal but the other side would not begin one had the same feeling as before a thunderstorm in summer everybody was on edge and extremely nervous and of course that sort of strain could not go on for long we are in the midst of a revolution with an administrative apparatus entirely disorganized and in this lies the main danger in october a railway strike developed into a general strike which paralysed the country in a city without electricity witte told nicholas ii that the country was at the verge of a cataclysmic revolution according to orlando figes the tsar asked his uncle grand duke nicholas to assume the role of dictator but the grand duke  took out a revolver and threatened to shoot himself there and then if the tsar refused to endorse wittes memorandum nicholas ii had no choice but to make a number of steps in the constitutional liberal direction the tsar accepted the draft hurriedly outlined by aleksei d obolensky the emperor and autocrat of all the russias was forced to sign the october manifesto to agree with the establishment of the imperial duma and give up part of his unlimited autocracy for the next six months witte was the prime minister according to harold williams that government was almost paralyzed from the beginning on  october os the tsar appointed trepov master of the palace without consulting witte and had daily contact with the emperor his influence at court was paramount on  november  os princess milica of montenegro presented grigori rasputin to tsar nicholas and his wife at peterhof palace relationship with the dumaedit one ruble silver coin of emperor nicholas ii dated  with the imperial coatofarms on the reverse the russian inscription reads bozheyu milostyu nikolay imperator i samoderzhets vseya rossiiiyskiy the english translation is by the grace of god nicholas ii emperor and autocrat of all the russias under pressure from the attempted  russian revolution on  august of that year nicholas ii issued a manifesto about the convocation of the state duma known as the bulygin duma initially thought to be an advisory organ in the october manifesto the tsar pledged to introduce basic civil liberties provide for broad participation in the state duma and endow the duma with legislative and oversight powers he was determined however to preserve his autocracy even in the context of reform this was signalled in the text of the  constitution he was described as the supreme autocrat and retained sweeping executive powers also in church affairs his cabinet ministers were not allowed to interfere or assist each other they were responsible only to him nicholass relations with the duma were poor the first duma with a majority of kadets almost immediately came into conflict with him scarcely had the  members sat down at the tauride palace when they formulated an address to the throne it demanded universal suffrage radical land reform the release of all political prisoners and the dismissal of ministers appointed by the tsar in favour of ministers acceptable to the duma grand duchess olga alexandrovna the younger sister of nicholas ii wrote there was such gloom at tsarskoye selo i did not understand anything about politics i just felt everything was going wrong with the country and all of us the october constitution did not seem to satisfy anyone i went with my mother to the first duma i remember the large group of deputies from among peasants and factory people the peasants looked sullen but the workmen were worse they looked as though they hated us i remember the distress in alickys eyes minister of the court count vladimir frederiks commented the deputies they give one the impression of a gang of criminals who are only waiting for the signal to throw themselves upon the ministers and cut their throats i will never again set foot among those people the dowager empress noticed incomprehensible hatred although nicholas initially had a good relationship with his prime minister sergei witte alexandra distrusted him as he had instigated an investigation of grigori rasputin and as the political situation deteriorated nicholas dissolved the duma the duma was populated with radicals many of whom wished to push through legislation that would abolish private property ownership among other things witte unable to grasp the seemingly insurmountable problems of reforming russia and the monarchy wrote to nicholas on  april  resigning his office however other accounts have said that witte was forced to resign by the emperor nicholas was not ungracious to witte and an imperial rescript was published on  april creating witte a knight of the order of saint alexander nevsky with diamonds the last two words were written in the emperors own hand followed by i remain unalterably welldisposed to you and sincerely grateful for ever more nicholas a second duma met for the first time in february  the leftist parties—including the social democrats and the social revolutionaries who had boycotted the first duma—had won  seats in the second more than a third of the membership again nicholas waited impatiently to rid himself of the duma in two letters to his mother he let his bitterness flow a grotesque deputation is coming from england to see liberal members of the duma uncle bertie informed us that they were very sorry but were unable to take action to stop their coming their famous liberty of course how angry they would be if a deputation went from us to the irish to wish them success in their struggle against their government a little while later nicholas wrote all would be well if everything said in the duma remained within its walls every word spoken however comes out in the next days papers which are avidly read by everyone in many places the populace is getting restive again they begin to talk about land once more and are waiting to see what the duma is going to say on the question i am getting telegrams from everywhere petitioning me to order a dissolution but it is too early for that one has to let them do something manifestly stupid or mean and then — slap and they are gone nicholas ii stolypin and jewish delegation during the tsars visit to kiev in  after the second duma resulted in similar problems the new prime minister pyotr stolypin whom witte described as reactionary unilaterally dissolved it and changed the electoral laws to allow for future dumas to have a more conservative content and to be dominated by the liberalconservative octobrist party of alexander guchkov stolypin a skilful politician had ambitious plans for reform these included making loans available to the lower classes to enable them to buy land with the intent of forming a farming class loyal to the crown nevertheless when the duma remained hostile stolypin had no qualms about invoking article  of the fundamental laws which empowered the tsar to issue urgent and extraordinary emergency decrees during the recess of the state duma stolypins most famous legislative act the change in peasant land tenure was promulgated under article  the third duma remained an independent body this time the members proceeded cautiously instead of hurling themselves at the government opposing parties within the duma worked to develop the body as a whole in the classic manner of the british parliament the duma reached for power grasping for the national purse strings the duma had the right to question ministers behind closed doors as to their proposed expenditures these sessions endorsed by stolypin were educational for both sides and in time mutual antagonism was replaced by mutual respect even the sensitive area of military expenditure where the october manifesto clearly had reserved decisions to the throne a duma commission began to operate composed of aggressive patriots no less anxious than nicholas to restore the fallen honour of russian arms the duma commission frequently recommended expenditures even larger than those proposed with the passage of time nicholas also began to have confidence in the duma this duma cannot be reproached with an attempt to seize power and there is no need at all to quarrel with it he said to stolypin in  unfortunately stolypins plans were undercut by conservatives at court reactionaries such as prince vladimir nikolayevich orlov never tired of telling the tsar that the very existence of the duma was a blot on the autocracy which tsaritsa alexandra had always believed anyway stolypin they whispered was a traitor and secret revolutionary who was conniving with the duma to steal the prerogatives assigned the tsar by god witte also engaged in constant intrigue against stolypin although stolypin had had nothing to do with wittes fall witte blamed him stolypin had unwittingly angered the tsaritsa he had ordered an investigation into rasputin and presented it to the tsar who read it but did nothing stolypin on his own authority ordered rasputin to leave st petersburg alexandra protested vehemently but nicholas refused to overrule his prime minister who had more influence with the emperor by the time of stolypins assassination by dmitry bogrov a student and police informant in a theatre in kiev on  september  stolypin had grown weary of the burdens of office for a man who preferred clear decisive action working with a sovereign who believed in fatalism and mysticism was frustrating as an example nicholas once returned a document unsigned with the note despite most convincing arguments in favour of adopting a positive decision in this matter an inner voice keeps on insisting more and more that i do not accept responsibility for it so far my conscience has not deceived me therefore i intend in this case to follow its dictates i know that you too believe that a tsars heart is in gods hands let it be so for all laws established by me i bear a great responsibility before god and i am ready to answer for my decision at any time alexandra believing that stolypin had severed the bonds that her son depended on for life hated the prime minister in march  in a fit of anger stating that he no longer commanded the imperial confidence stolypin asked to be relieved of his office two years earlier when stolypin had casually mentioned resigning to nicholas he was informed this is not a question of confidence or lack of it it is my will remember that we live in russia not abroadand therefore i shall not consider the possibility of any resignation it never got that far on  september  in a procession where stolypins car was unprotected rasputin had coincidentally returned from his exile as stolypins car passed him rasputin cried out in a loud voice death is after him death is driving behind him bogrov would later assassinate stolypin in the kiev theatre that night in  a fourth duma was elected with almost the same membership as the third the duma started too fast now it is slower but better and more lasting stated nicholas to sir bernard pares the first world war developed badly for russia by late  romanov family desperation reached the point that grand duke paul alexandrovich younger brother of alexander iii and the tsars only surviving uncle was deputed to beg nicholas to grant a constitution and a government responsible to the duma nicholas sternly and adamantly refused reproaching his uncle for asking him to break his coronation oath to maintain autocratic power for his successors in the duma on  december  vladimir purishkevich a fervent patriot monarchist and war worker denounced the dark forces which surrounded the throne in a thunderous twohour speech which was tumultuously applauded revolution threatens he warned and an obscure peasant shall govern russia no longer tsarevich alexeis illness and rasputinedit tsarevich alexei nikolaevich c  grigori rasputin further complicating domestic matters was the matter of the succession alexandra bore nicholas four daughters the grand duchess olga in  the grand duchess tatiana in  grand duchess maria in  and grand duchess anastasia in  before their son alexei was born on  august  the young heir was afflicted with haemophilia b a hereditary disease that prevents blood from clotting properly which at that time was untreatable and usually led to an untimely death as a granddaughter of queen victoria alexandra carried the same gene mutation that afflicted several of the major european royal houses such as prussia and spain hemophilia therefore became known as the royal disease through alexandra the disease had passed on to her son as all of nicholas and alexandras daughters perished with their parents and brother in yekaterinburg in  it is not known whether any of them inherited the gene as carriers because of the fragility of the autocracy at this time nicholas and alexandra chose not to divulge alexeis condition to anyone outside the imperial household in fact there were many in the household who were unaware of the exact nature of the tsarevichs illness at first alexandra turned to russian doctors and medics to treat alexei however their treatments generally failed and alexandra increasingly turned to mystics and holy men or starets as they were called in russian one of these starets an illiterate siberian named grigori rasputin appeared to have some success rasputins influence over empress alexandra and consequently the tsar himself had grown stronger ever since  when the tsarevich nearly died from an injury while the family was on vacation at the hunting lodges at białowieża and spała poland the bleeding grew steadily worse until it was assumed that the tsarevich would not survive and the last sacrament was administered on  october  in desperation alexandra called upon rasputin as a last resort to which he replied god has seen your tears and heard your prayers do not grieve the little one will not die do not allow the doctors to bother him too much the haemorrhage stopped the very next day and the boy began to recover alexandra took this as a sign that rasputin was a starets and that god was with him for the rest of her life she would fervently defend him and turn her wrath against anyone who dared to question him european affairsedit nicholas ii and his son alexei aboard the imperial yacht standart during king edward viis state visit to russia in tallin  in  to counter perceived german aggression russia and great britain signed the anglorussian convention great britain had already entered into the entente cordiale with france in  and the anglorussian convention led to the formation of the triple entente the following year in may  nicholas and alexandras shared uncle bertie and aunt alix britains king edward vii and queen alexandra made a state visit to russia being the first reigning british monarchs to do so however they did not set foot on russian soil instead they stayed aboard their yachts meeting off the coast of modernday tallinn later that year nicholas was taken off guard by the news that his foreign minister alexander izvolsky had entered into a secret agreement with the austrohungarian foreign minister count alois von aehrenthal agreeing that in exchange for russian naval access to the dardanelles and the bosporus strait russia would not oppose the austrian annexation of bosnia and herzegovina a revision of the  treaty of berlin when austriahungary did annex this territory that october it precipitated the diplomatic crisis when russia protested about the annexation the austrians threatened to leak secret communications between izvolsky and aehernthal prompting nicholas to complain in a letter to the austrian emperor franz joseph about a breach of confidence in  in the wake of the anglorussian convention the russian imperial family made a visit to england staying on the isle of wight for cowes week in  during the balkan wars nicholas personally offered to arbitrate between serbia and bulgaria however the bulgarians rejected his offer also in  nicholas albeit without

volga river that was made by the teenage michael romanov from the ipatiev monastery in kostroma to moscow in  when he finally agreed to become tsar first world waredit on  june  archduke franz ferdinand of austria heir to the austrohungarian throne was assassinated by gavrilo princip in sarajevo nicholas vacillated as to russias course of action the outbreak of war was not inevitable but leaders diplomats and nineteenthcentury alliances created a climate for largescale conflict the concept of panslavism and shared ethnicity created strong public sympathy between russia and serbia territorial conflict created rivalries between germany and france and between austria and serbia and as a consequence alliance networks developed across europe the triple entente and triple alliance networks were set before the war nicholas wanted neither to abandon serbia to the ultimatum of austriahungary nor to provoke a general war in a series of letters exchanged with kaiser wilhelm of germany the socalled willy and nicky correspondence the two proclaimed their desire for peace and each attempted to get the other to back down nicholas desired that russias mobilization be only against the austrian border in the hopes of preventing war with the german empire nicholas ii right with kaiser wilhelm ii of germany in  nicholas is wearing a german army uniform while wilhelm wears that of a russian hussar regiment on  july  the council of ministers was held in krasnoye selo at which tsar nicholas ii decided to intervene in the austroserbian conflict a step toward general war he put the russian army on alert on  july although this was not general mobilization it threatened the german and austrian borders and looked like military preparation for war however his army had no contingency plans for a partial mobilization and on  july  nicholas took the fateful step of confirming the order for general mobilization despite being strongly counselled against it on  july austriahungary formally declared war against serbia on  july  nicholas ii sent a telegram to wilhelm ii the willynicky correspondence with the suggestion to submit the austroserbian problem to the hague conference in hague tribunal wilhelm ii did not address the question of the hague conference in his subsequent reply count witte told the french ambassador maurice paléologue that from russias point of view the war was madness slav solidarity was simply nonsense and russia could hope for nothing from the war on  july russia ordered general mobilisation but still maintained that it would not attack if peace talks were to begin germany reacting to the discovery of russian partial mobilisation ordered on  july announced its own premobilisation posture the imminent danger of war germany requested that russia must demobilise within the next twelve hours in saint petersburg at pm with the ultimatum to russia expired the german ambassador to russia met with the russian foreign minister sergey sazonov asked three times if russia would reconsider and then with shaking hands delivered the note accepting russias war challenge and declaring war on  august less than a week later on  august franz joseph i of austria signed the austro hungarian declaration of war on russia the outbreak of war on  august  found russia grossly unprepared russia and her allies placed their faith in her army the famous russian steamroller its prewar regular strength was  mobilisation added  reserves and millions more stood ready behind them in every other respect however russia was unprepared for war germany had ten times as much railway track per square mile and whereas russian soldiers travelled an average of  kilometres  mi to reach the front german soldiers travelled less than a quarter of that distance russian heavy industry was still too small to equip the massive armies the tsar could raise and her reserves of munitions were pitifully small while the german army in  was better equipped than any other manforman the russians were severely short on artillery pieces shells motorised transports and even boots with the baltic sea barred by german uboats and the dardanelles by the guns of germanys ally turkey russia initially could receive help only via archangel which was frozen solid in winter or via vladivostok which was over  kilometres  mi from the front line by  a rail line was built north from petrozavodsk to the kola gulf and this connection laid the foundation of the icefree port of what eventually was called murmansk the russian high command was moreover greatly weakened by the mutual contempt between vladimir sukhomlinov the minister of war and the redoubtable warrior giant grand duke nicholas nikolayevich who commanded the armies in the field in spite of all of this an immediate attack was ordered against the german province of east prussia the germans mobilised there with great efficiency and completely defeated the two russian armies which had invaded the battle of tannenberg where an entire russian army was annihilated cast an ominous shadow over the empires future the loyal officers lost were the very ones needed to protect the dynasty the russian armies had great success against both the austrohungarian armies and against the forces of the ottoman empire from the very beginning of the war but they never succeeded against the might of the german army in september  in order to relieve pressure on france the russians were forced to halt a successful offensive against austrohungary in galicia in order to attack germanheld silesia russian prisoners at the battle of tannenberg where the russian second army was annihilated by german forces gradually a war of attrition set in on the vast eastern front where the russians were facing the combined forces of the german and austrohungarian empires and they suffered staggering losses general denikin retreating from galicia wrote the german heavy artillery swept away whole lines of trenches and their defenders with them we hardly replied there was nothing with which we could reply our regiments although completely exhausted were beating off one attack after another by bayonet

bakeries factories private houses and country estates belonging to people with german names were looted and burnedcitation needed the inflamed mobs then turned on the government declaring the empress should be shut up in a convent the tsar deposed and rasputin hanged nicholas was by no means deaf to these discontents an emergency session of the duma was summoned and a special defense council established its members drawn from the duma and the tsars ministers in july  king christian x of denmark first cousin of the tsar sent hans niels andersen to tsarskoye selo with an offer to act as a mediator he made several trips between london berlin and petrograd and in july saw the dowager empress maria fyodorovna andersen told her they should conclude peace nicholas chose to turn down king christians offer of mediation as he felt it would be a betrayal for russia to form a separate peace treaty with the central powers when its allies britain and france were still fighting the energetic and efficient general alexei polivanov replaced sukhomlinov as minister of war which failed to improve the strategic situation in the aftermath of the great retreat and the loss of the kingdom of poland nicholas assumed the role of commanderinchief after dismissing his cousin nikolay nikolayevich in september  this was a mistake as the tsar came to be personally associated with the continuing losses at the front he was also away at the remote hq at mogilev far from the direct governance of the empire and when revolution broke out in petrograd he was unable to halt it in reality the move was largely symbolic since all important military decisions were made by his chiefofstaff general michael alexeiev and nicholas did little more than review troops inspect field hospitals and preside over military luncheons nicholas ii with his family in yevpatoria crimea may  the duma was still calling for political reforms and political unrest continued throughout the war cut off from public opinion nicholas could not see that the dynasty was tottering with nicholas at the front domestic issues and control of the capital were left with his wife alexandra however alexandras relationship with grigori rasputin and her german background further discredited the dynastys authority nicholas had been repeatedly warned about the destructive influence of rasputin but had failed to remove him rumors and accusations about alexandra and rasputin appeared one after another alexandra was even accused of harboring treasonous sympathies towards germany anger at nicholass failure to act and the extreme damage that rasputins influence was doing to russias war effort and to the monarchy led to rasputins eventual murder by a group of nobles led by prince felix yusupov and grand duke dmitri pavlovich a cousin of the tsar in the early morning of saturday  december  os   december  ns collapseedit as the government failed to produce supplies mounting hardship created massive riots and rebellions with nicholas away at the front from  through  authority appeared to collapse and the capital was left in the hands of strikers and mutineering conscript soldiers despite efforts by the british ambassador sir george buchanan to warn the tsar that he should grant constitutional reforms to fend off revolution nicholas continued to bury himself away at the staff hq stavka  kilometres  mi away at moghilev leaving his capital and court open to intrigues and insurrection by early  russia was on the verge of total and utter collapse the army had taken  million men from the farms and food prices had soared an egg cost four times what it had in  butter five times as much the severe winter dealt the railways overburdened by emergency shipments of coal and supplies the final blow russia began the war with  locomotives by   were in service while the number of serviceable railway wagons had dwindled from half a million to  in february   locomotives burst their boilers and nearly  wagons were immobilised in petrograd supplies of flour and fuel had all but disappeared wartime prohibition of alcohol was enacted by nicholas to boost patriotism and productivity but instead damaged the treasury and funding of the war due to the treasury now being deprived of alcohol taxes one of the last photographs of nicholas ii showing him at tsarskoye selo after his abdication in march  on  february  in petrograd a combination of very severe cold weather and acute food shortages caused people to start to break shop windows to get bread and other necessities in the streets red banners appeared and the crowds chanted down with the german woman down with protopopov down with the war down with the tsar police started to shoot at the populace from rooftops which incited riots the troops in the capital were poorly motivated and their officers had no reason to be loyal to the regime they were angry and full of revolutionary fervor and sided with the populace the tsars cabinet begged nicholas to return to the capital and offered to resign completely  kilometres  mi away the tsar misinformed by the minister of the interior alexander protopopov that the situation was under control ordered that firm steps be taken against the demonstrators for this task the petrograd garrison was quite unsuitable the cream of the old regular army had been destroyed in poland and galicia in petrograd  recruits country boys or older men from the workingclass suburbs of the capital itself remained to keep control under the command of wounded officers invalided from the front and cadets from the military academies the units in the capital although many bore the names of famous imperial guard regiments were in reality rear or reserve battalions of these regiments the regular units being away at the front many units lacking both officers and rifles had never undergone formal training general khabalov attempted to put the tsars instructions into effect on the morning of sunday  march  despite huge posters ordering people to keep off the streets vast crowds gathered and were only dispersed after some  had been shot dead though a company of the volinsky regiment fired into the air rather than into the mob and a company of the pavlovsky life guards shot the officer who gave the command to open fire nicholas informed of the situation by rodzianko ordered reinforcements to the capital and suspended the duma it was too late on  march the volinsky regiment mutinied and was quickly followed by the semenovsky the ismailovsky the litovsky and even the legendary preobrazhensky regiment of the imperial guard the oldest and staunchest regiment founded by peter the great the arsenal was pillaged the ministry of the interior military government building police headquarters the law courts and a score of police buildings were put to the torch by noon the fortress of peter and paul with its heavy artillery was in the hands of the insurgents by nightfall  soldiers had joined the revolution order broke down and members of the duma and the soviet formed a provisional government to try to restore order they issued a demand that nicholas must abdicate faced with this demand which was echoed by his generals deprived of loyal troops with his family firmly in the hands of the provisional government and fearful of unleashing civil war and opening the way for german conquest nicholas had little choice but to submit abdication edit at the end of the february revolution of  february in the old russian calendar on  march os   march ns  nicholas ii chose to abdicate he first abdicated in favour of alexei but a few hours later changed his mind after advice from doctors that the tsarevich would not live long separated from his parents who would be forced into exile nicholas thus abdicated on behalf of his son and drew up a new manifesto naming his brother grand duke michael as the next emperor of all the russias he issued the following statement which was suppressed by the provisional government in the days of the great struggle against the foreign enemies who for nearly three years have tried to enslave our fatherland the lord god has been pleased to send down on russia a new heavy trial internal popular disturbances threaten to have a disastrous effect on the future conduct of this persistent war the destiny of russia the honor of our heroic army the welfare of the people and the whole future of our dear fatherland demand that the war should be brought to a victorious conclusion whatever the cost the cruel enemy is making his last efforts and already the hour approaches when our glorious army together with our gallant allies will crush him in these decisive days in the life of russia we thought it our duty of conscience to facilitate for our people the closest union possible and a consolidation of all national forces for the speedy attainment of victory in agreement with the imperial duma we have thought it well to renounce the throne of the russian empire and to lay down the supreme power as we do not wish to part from our beloved son we transmit the succession to our brother the grand duke michael alexandrovich and give him our blessing to mount the throne of the russian empire we direct our brother to conduct the affairs of state in full and inviolable union with the representatives of the people in the legislative bodies on those principles which will be established by them and on which he will take an inviolable oath in the name of our dearly beloved homeland we call on our faithful sons of the fatherland to fulfill their sacred duty to the fatherland to obey the tsar in the heavy moment of national trials and to help him together with the representatives of the people to guide the russian empire on the road to victory welfare and glory may the lord god help russia grand duke michael declined to accept the throne until the people were allowed to vote through a constituent assembly for the continuance of the monarchy or a republic the abdication of nicholas ii and the subsequent bolshevik revolution brought three centuries of the romanov dynastys rule to an end the fall of autocratic tsardom brought joy to liberals and socialists in britain and france the united states of america was the first foreign government to recognise the provisional government in russia the announcement of the tsars abdication was greeted with many emotions these included delight relief fear anger and confusion it is debatable whether nicholass enforced abdication was actually legal and whether he had the right to abdicate on behalf of his son as nicholas had already abdicated he was therefore merely a subject of his son and only grand duke michael as regent had the right to change the succession some historians contend that nicholas remained the tsar at least in theory until his death imprisonmentedit the governors mansion in tobolsk where the romanov family was held in captivity between august  and april  nicholas desperately wanted to go into exile in the united kingdom following his abdication the british government reluctantly offered the family asylum in the uk on  march  although it was suggested that it would be better for the romanovs to go to a neutral country news of the offer provoked uproar from the labour party and many liberals and the british ambassador sir george buchanan advised the government that the extreme left would use the extsars presence as an excuse for rousing public opinion against us the offer of asylum was withdrawn in april following objections by king george v who acting on the advice of his secretary arthur bigge st baron stamfordham was worried that nicholass presence in the uk might provoke an uprising like the previous years easter rising in ireland the french government declined to accept the romanovs in view of increasing unrest on the western front and on the home front as a result of the ongoing war with germany the british ambassador in paris lord francis bertie advised the foreign secretary that the romanovs would be unwelcome in france as the exempress was regarded as progerman in the early summer of  after an improvement in the internal political situation in russia the russian government approached the uk government on the issue of asylum and was informed the offer had been withdrawn due to the considerations of british internal politics in august the kerensky government evacuated the romanovs to tobolsk in the urals as a winter refuge to protect them from the rising tide of revolution until the family could be sent abroad in the spring of  via japan there they lived in the former governors mansion in considerable comfort in october  however the bolsheviks seized power from kerenskys provisional government nicholas followed the events in october with interest but not yet with alarm boris soloviev the husband of maria rasputin was supposedly organizing rescue attempts with monarchical factions but none occurred rumors persist that soloviev was working for the bolsheviks or the germans or both nicholas continued to underestimate lenins importance in the meantime he and his family occupied themselves with keeping warm conditions of imprisonment became more strict and talk of putting nicholas on trial grew more frequent the tsar was forbidden to wear epaulettes on  march  the family was placed on soldiers rations which meant parting with ten devoted servants and giving up butter and coffee as luxuries nicholas and alexandra were appalled by news of the treaty of brestlitovsk whereby russia agreed to give up poland finland the baltic states the ukraine the crimea and most of the caucasus what kept the familys spirits up was the belief that help was at hand the romanovs believed that various plots were underway to break them out of captivity and smuggle them to safety the western allies lost interest in the fate of the romanovs after russia left the war the german government wanted the monarchy restored in russia to crush the bolsheviks and maintain good relations with the central powers but on  april  the romanovs were transferred to their final destination the town of yekaterinburg where they were imprisoned in the twostorey ipatiev house the home of the military engineer nikolay nikolayevich ipatiev which ominously became referred to as the house of special purpose russian imperial family between circa  and circa  executionedit see also execution of the romanov family there are several accounts of what happened and historians have not agreed on a solid confirmed scope of events according to the account of yurovsky the chief executioner in the early hours of  july  the royal family was awakened around  am got dressed and were led down into a halfbasement room at the back of the ipatiev house the pretext for this move was the familys safety ie that antibolshevik forces were approaching yekaterinburg and the house might be fired upon present with nicholas alexandra and their children were their doctor and three of their servants who had voluntarily chosen to remain with the family the tsars personal physician eugene botkin his wifes maid anna demidova and the familys chef ivan kharitonov and footman alexei trupp a firing squad had been assembled and was waiting in an adjoining room composed of seven communist soldiers from central europe and three local bolsheviks all under the command of bolshevik officer yakov yurovsky nicholas was carrying his son when the family arrived in the basement the former empress complained that there were no chairs for them to sit oncitation needed yurovsky ordered two chairs brought in and when the empress and the heir were seated the executioners filed into the room yurovsky announced to them that they had been condemned to death by the ural soviet of workers deputies a stunned nicholas asked what what and turned toward his family yurovsky quickly repeated the order and shot the former emperor outright the executioners drew handguns and the shooting began nicholas was the first to die yurovsky shot him several times in the chest sometimes incorrectly said to have been in his head but his skull bore no bullet wounds when it was discovered in  anastasia tatiana olga and maria survived the first hail of bullets the sisters were wearing over  kilograms of diamonds and precious gems sewn into their clothing which provided some initial protection from the bullets and bayonets they were stabbed with bayonets and then shot at close range in their heads an announcement from the presidium of the ural regional soviet of the workers and peasants government emphasized that conspiracies had been exposed to free the extsar that counterrevolutionary forces were pressing in on soviet russian territory and that the extsar was guilty of unforgivable crimes against the nation in view of the enemys proximity to yekaterinburg and the exposure by the cheka of a serious white guard plot with the goal of abducting the former tsar and his family… in light of the approach of counterrevolutionary bands toward the red capital of the urals and the possibility of the crowned executioner escaping trial by the people a plot among the white guards to try to abduct him and his family was exposed and the compromising documents will be published the presidium of the ural regional soviet fulfilling the will of the revolution resolved to shoot the former tsar nikolai romanov who is guilty of countless bloody violent acts against the russian people identificationedit yekaterinburgs church on the blood built on the spot where the ipatiev house once stood in  the bodies of tsar nicholas ii tsaritsa alexandra three of their daughters and those of four nonfamily members killed with them were discovered near sverdlovsk yekaterinburg by amateur archaeologist alexander avdonin in january  the remains excavated from underneath the dirt road near yekaterinburg were officially identified as those of nicholas ii and his family excluding one of his daughters and alexei the identifications including comparisons to a living relative were performed by separate russian british and american scientists using dna analysis concur and were found to be conclusive in july  an amateur historian discovered bones near yekaterinburg belonging to a boy and young woman prosecutors reopened the investigation into the deaths of the imperial familycitation needed and in april  dna tests performed by a us laboratory proved that bone fragments exhumed in the ural mountains belonged to two children of nicholas ii son alexei b  and daughter maria b  according to russian news agencies that same day it was announced by russian authorities that the remains of the entire family had been identified on  october  supreme court of russia ruled that nicholas ii and his family were victims of political persecution and should be rehabilitated in march  results of the dna testing were published confirming that the two bodies discovered in  were those of alexei and his sister maria funeraledit after the dna testing of  the remains of the emperor and his immediate family were interred at st peter and paul cathedral saint petersburg on  july  on the eightieth anniversary of their executions the ceremony was attended by then russian president boris yeltsin who said today is a historic day for russia for many years we kept quiet about this monstrous crime but the truth has to be spoken the british royal family was represented at the funeral by prince michael of kent and more than twenty ambassadors to russia including sir andrew wood archbishop john bukovsky and ernstjörg von studnitz were also in attendance sainthoodedit main article romanov sainthood tsar nicholas ii of russia tsarmartyr nicholas ii of russia royal passionbearer tsar nicholas ii of russia born  may  tsarskoye selo saint petersburg russian empire died  july  aged  yekaterinburg russian sfsr venerated in russian orthodox church canonized  and  by russian orthodox church abroad and the russian orthodox church major shrine church on blood ekaterinburg russia feast  july in  nicholas and his immediate family were recognised as martyred saints by the russian orthodox church outside russia on  august  they were recognised by the synod of the russian orthodox church this time they were not named as martyrs since their deaths did not result immediately from their christian faith instead they were canonised as passion bearers according to a statement by the moscow synod they were glorified as saints for the following reasons in the last orthodox russian monarch and members of his family we see people who sincerely strove to incarnate in their lives the commands of the gospel in the suffering borne by the royal family in prison with humility patience and meekness and in their martyrs deaths in yekaterinburg in the night of  july  was revealed the light of the faith of christ that conquers evil however nicholass canonisation was controversial the russian orthodox church abroad was split on the issue back in  some members suggesting that the emperor was a weak ruler and had failed to thwart the rise of the bolsheviks it was pointed out by one priest that martyrdom in the russian orthodox church has nothing to do with the martyrs personal actions but is instead related to why he or she was killed the russian orthodox church inside russia rejected the familys classification as martyrs because they were not killed on account of their religious faith religious leaders in both churches also had objections to canonising the tsars family because they perceived him as a weak emperor whose incompetence led to the revolution and the suffering of his people and made him partially responsible for his own murder and those of his wife children and servants for these opponents the fact that the tsar was in private life a kind man and a good husband and father or a leader who showed genuine concern for the peasantry did not override his poor governance of russia despite the original opposition the russian orthodox church inside russia ultimately recognised the family as passion bearers or people who met their deaths with christian humility the church does not however recognise the remains interred at peter and paul cathedral as being those of the imperial familycitation needed assessmentedit nicholas is generally considered to have been incompetent at the colossal task of ruling the enormous russian empire historian barbara tuchman gives a damning evaluation of his reign the russian empire was ruled from the top by a sovereign who had but one idea of government—to preserve intact the absolute monarchy bequeathed to him by his father—and who lacking the intellect energy or training for his job fell back on personal favorites whim simple mulishness and other devices of the emptyheaded autocrat his father alexander iii who deliberately intended to keep his son uneducated in statecraft until the age of thirty unfortunately miscalculated his own life expectancy and died when nicholas was twentysix the new tsar had learned nothing in the interval and the impression of imperturbability he conveyed was in reality apathy—the indifference of a mind so shallow as to be all surface when a telegram was brought to him announcing the annihilation of the russian fleet at tsushima he read it stuffed it in his pocket and went on playing tennis in russia nicholas ii faced widespread criticism after the victory of the revolution pavel bykov who in russia wrote the first full account about the downfall of the tsar denounced nicholas as a tyrant who paid with his life for the ageold repression and arbitrary rule of his ancestors over the russian people over the impoverished and bloodsoaked country sovietera historians noted that nicholas ii was not fit to be a statesman it has been argued that he had a weak will and was manipulated by adventurist forces his regime was condemned for extensive use of the army police and courts to destroy the revolutionary movement he was criticised for fanning nationalism and chauvinism with the punitive expeditions and courtsmartial during the  revolution the monarch became known as nicholas the bloody nicholass reign was seen as a time of suffering for russians robert k massie provides a more sympathetic view of the tsar  there still are those who for political or other reasons continue to insist that nicholas was bloody nicholas most commonly he is described as shallow weak stupid—a onedimensional figure presiding feebly over the last days of a corrupt and crumbling system this certainly is the prevailing public image of the last tsar historians admit that nicholas was a good man—the historical evidence of personal charm gentleness love of family deep religious faith and strong russian patriotism is too overwhelming to be denied—but they argue that personal factors are irrelevant what matters is that nicholas was a bad tsar  essentially the tragedy of nicholas ii was that he appeared in the wrong place in history ancestorsedit ancestors of

have been vastly exaggerated as emperor of all the russias and an autocrat the resources under his command were virtually incalculable however the vast majority of this was owned by the state as crown property the romanov familys personal wealth was only a small fraction of this as monarch the income of nicholas was  million gold roubles per annum this derived from a yearly allowance from the treasury and from the profits of crown farmland from this income he had to fund staff the upkeep of imperial palaces and imperial theatres annuities for the royal family pensions bequests and other outgoings before the end of the year the tsar was usually penniless sometimes he reached this embarrassing state by autumn according to the grand marshal of the court count paul benckendorff the familys total financial resources amounted to between  and  million roubles as a comparison prince felix yussupov estimated his familys worth in real estate holdings alone as amounting to  million

tsar nicholas ii was the first cousinonceremoved of grand duke nicholas nikolaevich to distinguish between them the grand duke was often known within the imperial family as nikolasha and nicholas the tall while the tsar was nicholas the short in his childhood nicholas his parents and siblings made annual visits to the danish royal palaces of fredensborg and bernstorff to visit his grandparents the king and queen the visits also served as family reunions as his mothers siblings would also come from the united kingdom germany and greece with their respective families it was there in  that he had a flirtation with one of his english first cousins princess victoria in  nicholas also accompanied his parents and younger brother twoyearold george on a twomonth semiofficial visit to england in london nicholas and his family stayed at marlborough house as guests of his uncle bertie and aunt alix the prince and princess of wales where he was spoiled by his uncle tsesarevichedit tsarevich nicholas in japan  on  march  following the assassination of his grandfather tsar alexander ii nicholas became heir apparent upon his fathers ascension as alexander iii nicholas and his other family members bore witness to alexander iis death having been present at the winter palace in saint petersburg where he was brought after the attack for security reasons the new tsar and his family relocated their primary residence to the gatchina palace outside the city only entering the capital for various ceremonial functions on such occasions alexander iii and his family occupied the nearby anichkov palace in  nicholass comingofage ceremony was held at the winter palace where he pledged his loyalty to his father later that year nicholass uncle grand duke sergei alexandrovich married princess elizabeth daughter of louis iv grand duke of hesse and his late wife princess alice of the united kingdom who had died in  and a granddaughter of queen victoria at the wedding in st petersburg the sixteenyearold tsarevich met with and admired the brides youngest surviving sister twelveyearold princess alix those feelings of admiration blossomed into love following her visit to st petersburg five years later in  alix had feelings for him in turn as a devout lutheran she was initially reluctant to convert to russian orthodoxy in order to marry nicholas but later relented eventually in  nicholas along with his younger brother george and their cousin prince george of greece set out on a world tour although grand duke george fell ill and was sent home partway through the trip nicholas visited egypt india singapore and bangkok receiving honors as a distinguished guest in each country in april  while traveling through the city of otsu japan nicholas was the victim of an assassination attempt the incident cut his trip short returning overland to st petersburg he was present at the ceremonies in vladivostok commemorating the beginning of work on the transsiberian railway in  nicholas traveled to london on behalf of his parents to be present at the wedding of his cousin george duke of york to mary of teck queen victoria was struck by the physical resemblance between the two cousins and their appearances confused some at the wedding during this time nicholas had an affair with st petersburg ballerina mathilde kschessinska despite being heirapparent to the throne however nicholass father failed to prepare him for his future role as tsar he attended meetings of the state council however as his father was only in his forties it was expected that it would be several years before nicholas would take the throne sergei witte russias finance minister saw things differently and suggested to the tsar that nicholas be appointed to the siberian railway committee alexander argued that nicholas was not mature enough to take on serious responsibilities to which witte replied that if he was not introduced to state affairs nicholas would never be ready to understand them alexanders assumptions about living a long life and having years to prepare nicholas for becoming tsar would be proven wrong as by  alexander iii was suffering from ill health engagement accession and marriageedit see also wedding of nicholas ii and alexandra feodorovna in april  nicholas joined his uncle sergei and aunt elizabeth on a journey to coburg germany for the wedding of elizabeths and alixs brother ernest louis grand duke of hesse to their mutual first cousin princess victoria melita of saxecoburg and gotha other guests included queen victoria wilhelm ii german emperor the victoria princess royal kaiser wilhelms mother and queen victorias eldest daughter nicholass uncle the prince of wales and the brides parents the duke and duchess of saxecoburg and gotha once in coburg nicholas proposed to alix but she rejected his proposal being reluctant to convert to orthodoxy but the kaiser later told her she had a duty to marry nicholas and to convert as her sister elizabeth had voluntarily done in  thus nicholas and alix became officially engaged on  april  nicholass parents initially hesitated to give the engagement their blessing as alix had made poor impressions during her visits to russia they gave their consent only when they saw tsar alexanders health deteriorating queen victoria also initially opposed to the match for though she had no objections against nicholas personally she evidently disliked russiacitation needed official engagement photograph of nicholas ii and alexandra april  that summer nicholas travelled to england to visit both alix and the queen the visit coincided with the birth of the duke and duchess of yorks first child the future king edward viii along with being present at the christening nicholas and alix were listed amongst the childs godparents after several weeks in england nicholas returned home for the wedding of his sister xenia to a cousin grand duke alexander mikhailovich sandro by that autumn alexander iii lay dying upon learning that he would live only a fortnight the tsar had nicholas summon alix to the imperial palace at livadia alix arrived on  october the tsar insisted on receiving her in full uniform from his deathbed he told his son to heed the advice of witte his most capable minister ten days later alexander iii died at the age of fortynine leaving twentysixyearold nicholas as emperor of russia that evening nicholas was consecrated by his fathers priest as tsar nicholas ii and the following day alix was received into the russian orthodox church taking the name alexandra feodorovna with the title of grand duchess and the style of imperial highness nicholas ii and family nicholas may have felt unprepared for the duties of the crown for he asked his cousin and brotherinlaw grand duke alexander what is going to happen to me and all of russia though perhaps underprepared and unskilled nicholas was not altogether untrained for his duties as tsar nicholas chose to maintain the conservative policies favoured by his father throughout his reign while alexander iii had concentrated on the formulation of general policy nicholas devoted much more attention to the details of administrationcitation needed leaving livadia on  november tsar alexanders funeral procession—which included nicholass paternal aunt queen olga of greece and the prince and princess of wales—arrived in moscow after lying in state in the kremlin the body of the tsar was taken to st petersburg where the funeral was held on  november tsar nicholas ii and empress alexandra with their first child  nicholas and alixs wedding was originally scheduled for the spring of  but it was moved forward at nicholass insistence staggering under the weight of his new office he had no intention of allowing the one person who gave him confidence to leave his side instead nicholass wedding to alix took place on  november  which was the birthday of the dowager empress marie feodorovna and court mourning could be slightly relaxed alexandra wore the traditional dress of romanov brides and nicholas a hussars uniform nicholas and alexandra each holding a lit candle faced the palace priest and were married a few minutes before one in the afternoon reignedit coronation by valentin serov nicholas iis imperial monogram silk imperial crown of russia  coronation gift to nicholas ii nicholas ii of russia as tsarevich in  despite a visit to the united kingdom in  where he observed the house of commons in debate and seemingly impressed by the machinery of constitutional monarchy as well as a similar positive appraisal of the us congress on an official visit to the united states as tsesarevich nicholas turned his back on any notion of giving away any power to elected representatives in russia shortly after he came to the throne a deputation of peasants and workers from various towns local assemblies zemstvos came to the winter palace proposing court reforms such as the adoption of a constitutional monarchy and reform that would improve the political and economic life of the peasantry in the tver address although the addresses they had sent in beforehand were couched in mild and loyal terms nicholas was angry and ignored advice from an imperial family council by saying to them  it has come to my knowledge that during the last months there have been heard in some assemblies of the zemstvos the voices of those who have indulged in a senseless dream that the zemstvos be called upon to participate in the government of the country i want everyone to know that i will devote all my strength to maintain for the good of the whole nation the principle of absolute autocracy as firmly and as strongly as did my late lamented father on  may  nicholass formal coronation as tsar was held in uspensky cathedral located within the kremlin the silk imperial crown of russia was used as an official coronation gift of the russian empire nicholas ii was the first and only monarch to be presented with such a monumental coronation gift it was not intended as ceremonial regalia but as private imperial property a memento to his coronation in celebration on  may  a large festival with food free beer and souvenir cups was held in khodynka field outside moscow khodynka was chosen as the location as it was the only place near moscow large enough to hold all of the moscow citizens khodynka was primarily used as a military training ground and the field was uneven with trenches before the food and drink was handed out rumours spread that there would not be enough for everyone as a result the crowd rushed to get their share and individuals were tripped and trampled upon suffocating in the dirt of the field of the approximate  in attendance it is estimated that  individuals died and roughly  were injured the khodynka tragedy was seen as an ill omen and nicholas found gaining popular trust difficult from the beginning of his reign the french ambassadors gala was planned for that night the tsar wanted to stay in his chambers and pray for the lives lost but his uncles believed that his absence at the ball would strain relations with france particularly the  francorussian alliance thus nicholas attended the party as a result the mourning populace saw nicholas as frivolous and uncaring during the autumn after the coronation nicholas and alexandra made a tour of europe after making visits to the emperor and empress of austriahungary the kaiser of germany and nicholass danish grandparents and relatives nicholas and alexandra took possession of their new yacht the standart which had been built in denmark from there they made a journey to scotland to spend some time with queen victoria at balmoral castle while alexandra enjoyed her reunion with her grandmother nicholas complained in a letter to his mother about being forced to go shooting with his uncle the prince of wales in bad weather and was suffering from a bad toothache the first years of his reign saw little more than continuation and development of the policy pursued by alexander iii nicholas allotted money for the allrussia exhibition of  in  restoration of gold standard by sergei witte minister of finance completed the series of financial reforms initiated fifteen years earlier by  the transsiberian railway was nearing completion this helped the russians trade in the far east but the railway still required huge amounts of work initiatives in foreign affairsedit in foreign relations nicholas followed the policies of his father strengthening the francorussian alliance and pursuing a policy of general european pacification which culminated in the famous hague peace conference this conference suggested and promoted by nicholas ii was convened with the view of terminating the arms race and setting up machinery for the peaceful settlement of international disputes the results of the conference were less than expected due to the mutual distrust existing between great powers nevertheless the hague conventions were among the first formal statements of the laws of war in  nicholas ii and the famous russian diplomat friedrich martens were nominated for the nobel peace prize—for the initiative to convene the hague peace conference and contributing to its implementation ecclesiastical affairsedit in  nicholas threw himself into an ecclesiastical crisis regarding the canonisation of seraphim of sarov the previous year it had been suggested that if he were canonised the imperial couple would beget a son and heir to throne while alexandra demanded in july  that seraphim be canonised in less than a week nicholas demanded that he be canonised within a year despite a public outcry the church bowed to the intense imperial pressure declaring seraphim worthy of canonisation in january  that summer the imperial family travelled to sarov for the canonisation russojapanese waredit main article russojapanese war the russian baltic fleet was annihilated by the japanese at the battle of tsushima a clash between russia and the empire of japan was almost inevitable by the turn of the th century russia had expanded in the far east and the growth of its settlement and territorial ambitions as its southward path to the balkans was frustrated conflicted with japans own territorial ambitions on the chinese and asian mainland nicholas pursued an aggressive foreign policy with regards to manchuria and korea and strongly supported the scheme for timber concessions in these areas as developed by the bezobazov group war began in february  with a

fleet it was half a world away but the decision was made to send the fleet on a ninemonth voyage to the east the united kingdom would not allow the russian navy to use the suez canal due to its alliance with the empire of japan and due to the dogger bank incident where the baltic fleet mistakenly fired on british fishing boats in the north sea the russian baltic fleet traversed the world to lift the blockade on port arthur but after many misadventures on the way was nearly annihilated by the japanese in the battle of the tsushima strait on land the imperial russian army experienced logistical problems while commands and supplies came from st petersburg combat took place in east asian ports with only the transsiberian railway for transport of supplies as well as troops both ways the kilometre  mi rail line between st petersburg and port arthur was singletrack with no track around lake baikal allowing only gradual buildup of the forces on the front besieged port arthur fell to the japanese after nine months of resistance nicholass stance on the war was something that baffled many he approached the war with confidence and saw it as an opportunity to raise russian morale and patriotism paying little attention to the financial repercussions of a longdistance war shortly before the japanese attack on port arthur nicholas held firm to the belief that there would be no war despite the onset of the war and the many defeats russia suffered nicholas still believed in and expected a final victory maintaining an image of the racial inferiority and military weakness of the japanese as russia faced imminent defeat by the japanese the call for peace grew nicholass own mother as well as his cousin emperor wilhelm ii urged nicholas to open peace negotiations despite the efforts for peace nicholas remained evasive sending a telegram to the kaiser on  october that it was his intent to keep on fighting until the japanese were driven from manchuria it was not until – may  and the annihilation of the russian fleet by the japanese that nicholas finally decided to sue for peacecitation needed nicholas ii accepted american mediation appointing sergei witte chief plenipotentiary for the peace talks the war was ended by the signing of the treaty of portsmouth antijewish pogroms of –edit main article antijewish pogroms in the russian empire the kishinev newspaper bessarabets which published antisemitic materials received funds from viacheslav plehve minister of the interior these publications served to fuel the kishinev pogrom rioting the government of nicholas ii formally condemned the rioting and dismissed the regional governor with the perpetrators arrested and punished by the court leadership of the russian orthodox church also condemned antisemitic pogroms appeals to the faithful condemning the pogroms were read publicly in all churches of russia in private nicholas expressed his admiration for the mobs viewing antisemitism as a useful tool for unifying the people behind his regime however in  he approved of government efforts to prevent antisemitic pogroms following the assassination of pyotr stolypin by the jewish revolutionary dmitry bogrov bloody sunday edit main article bloody sunday  play media tsar nicholas of russia mounts his horse  unknown cinematographer of the edison manufacturing company a few days prior to bloody sunday   january  the priest and labor leader georgy gapon informed the government of the forthcoming procession to the winter palace to hand a workers petition to the tsar on saturday   january the ministers convened to consider the situation there was never any thought that the tsar who had left the capital for tsarskoye selo on the advice of the ministers would actually meet gapon the suggestion that some other member of the imperial family receive the petition was rejected finally informed by the prefect of police that he lacked the men to pluck gapon from among his followers and place him under arrest the newly appointed minister of the interior prince sviatopolkmirsky and his colleagues decided to bring additional troops to reinforce the city that evening nicholas wrote in his diary troops have been brought from the outskirts to reinforce the garrison up to now the workers have been calm their number is estimated at  at the head of their union is a kind of socialist priest named gapon mirsky came this evening to present his report on the measures taken on sunday   january  gapon began his march locking arms the workers marched peacefully through the streets some carried religious icons and banners as well as national flags and portraits of the tsar as they walked they sang hymns and the imperial anthem god save the tsar at  pm all of the converging processions were scheduled to arrive at the winter palace there was no single confrontation with the troops throughout the city at bridges on strategic boulevards the marchers found their way blocked by lines of infantry backed by cossacks and hussars and the soldiers opened fire on the crowd the official number of victims was  dead and several hundred wounded gapon vanished and the other leaders of the march were seized expelled from the capital they circulated through the empire increasing the casualties as bullets riddled their icons their banners and their portraits of nicholas the people shrieked the tsar will not help us outside russia the future british labour prime minister ramsay macdonald attacked the tsar calling him a bloodstained creature and a common murderer that evening nicholas wrote in his diary difficult day in st petersburg there were serious disturbances due to the desire of workers to get to the winter palace the troops had to shoot in different places of the city there were many dead and wounded lord how painful and bad grand duchess olga alexandrovna nicholass sister wrote afterwards nicky had the police report a few days before that saturday he telephoned my mother at the anitchkov and said that she and i were to leave for gatchina at once he and alicky went to tsarskoye selo insofar as i remember my uncles vladimir and nicholas were the only members of the family left in st petersburg but there may have been others i felt at the time that all those arrangements were hideously wrong nickys ministers and the chief of police had it all their way my mother and i wanted him to stay in st petersburg and to face the crowd i am positive that for all the ugly mood of some of the workmen nickys appearance would have calmed them they would have presented their petition and gone back to their homes but that wretched epiphany incident had left all the senior officials in a state of panic they kept on telling nicky that he had no right to run such a risk that he owed it to the country to leave the capital that even with the utmost precautions taken there might always be some loophole left my mother and i did all we could to persuade him that the ministers advice was wrong but nicky preferred to follow it and he was the first to repent when he heard of the tragic outcome from his hiding place gapon issued a letter stating nicholas romanov formerly tsar and at present soulmurderer of the russian empire the innocent blood of workers their wives and children lies forever between you and the russian people

tsarism  revolutionedit main article  russian revolution confronted with growing opposition and after consulting with witte and prince sviatopolkmirsky the tsar issued a reform ukase on december   with vague promises in hopes of cutting short the rebellion many demonstrators were shot on bloody sunday  as they tried to march to the winter palace in st petersburg dmitri feodorovich trepov was ordered to take drastic measures to stop the revolutionary activity grand duke sergei was killed in february by a revolutionarys bomb in moscow as he left the kremlin on  march the tsar condemned the revolutionaries meanwhile witte recommended that a manifesto be issued schemes of reform would be elaborated by goremykin and a committee consisting of elected representatives of the zemstvos and municipal councils under the presidency of witte in june the battleship potemkin part of the black sea fleet mutinied around augustseptember after his diplomatic success on ending the russojapanese war witte wrote to the tsar stressing the urgent need for political reforms at home the tsar remained quiet impassive and indulgent he spent most of that autumn hunting with the defeat of russia by a nonwestern power the prestige and authority of the autocratic regime fell significantly tsar nicholas ii taken by surprise by the events reacted with anger and bewilderment he wrote to his mother after months of disorder it makes me sick to read the news nothing but strikes in schools and factories murdered policemen cossacks and soldiers riots disorder mutinies but the ministers instead of acting with quick decision only assemble in council like a lot of frightened hens and cackle about providing united ministerial action ominous quiet days began quiet indeed because there was complete order in the streets but at the same time everybody knew that something was going to happen — the troops were waiting for the signal but the other side would not begin one had the same feeling as before a thunderstorm in summer everybody was on edge and extremely nervous and of course that sort of strain could not go on for long we are in the midst of a revolution with an administrative apparatus entirely disorganized and in this lies the main danger in october a railway strike developed into a general strike which paralysed the country in a city without electricity witte told nicholas ii that the country was at the verge of a cataclysmic revolution according to orlando figes the tsar asked his uncle grand duke nicholas to assume the role of dictator but the grand duke  took out a revolver and threatened to shoot himself there and then if the tsar refused to endorse wittes memorandum nicholas ii had no choice but to make a number of steps in the constitutional liberal direction the tsar accepted the draft hurriedly outlined by aleksei d obolensky the emperor and autocrat of all the russias was forced to sign the october manifesto to agree with the establishment of the imperial duma and give up part of his unlimited autocracy for the next six months witte was the prime minister according to harold williams that government was almost paralyzed from the beginning on  october os the tsar appointed trepov master of the palace without consulting witte and had daily contact with the emperor his influence at court was paramount on  november  os princess milica of montenegro presented grigori rasputin to tsar nicholas and his wife at peterhof palace relationship with the dumaedit one ruble silver coin of emperor nicholas ii dated  with the imperial coatofarms on the reverse the russian inscription reads bozheyu milostyu nikolay imperator i samoderzhets vseya rossiiiyskiy the english translation is by the grace of god nicholas ii emperor and autocrat of all the russias under pressure from the attempted  russian revolution on  august of that year nicholas ii issued a manifesto about the convocation of the state duma known as the bulygin duma initially thought to be an advisory organ in the october manifesto the tsar pledged to introduce basic civil liberties provide for broad participation in the state duma and endow the duma with legislative and oversight powers he was determined however to preserve his autocracy even in the context of reform this was signalled in the text of the  constitution he was described as the supreme autocrat and retained sweeping executive powers also in church affairs his cabinet ministers were not allowed to interfere or assist each other they were responsible only to him nicholass relations with the duma were poor the first duma with a majority of kadets almost immediately came into conflict with him scarcely had the  members sat down at the tauride palace when they formulated an address to the throne it demanded universal suffrage radical land reform the release of all political prisoners and the dismissal of ministers appointed by the tsar in favour of ministers acceptable to the duma grand duchess olga alexandrovna the younger sister of nicholas ii wrote there was such gloom at tsarskoye selo i did not understand anything about politics i just felt everything was going wrong with the country and all of us the october constitution did not seem to satisfy anyone i went with my mother to the first duma i remember the large group of deputies from among peasants and factory people the peasants looked sullen but the workmen were worse they looked as though they hated us i remember the distress in alickys eyes minister of the court count vladimir frederiks commented the deputies they give one the impression of a gang of criminals who are only waiting for the signal to throw themselves upon the ministers and cut their throats i will never again set foot among those people the dowager empress noticed incomprehensible hatred although nicholas initially had a good relationship with his prime minister sergei witte alexandra distrusted him as he had instigated an investigation of grigori rasputin and as the political situation deteriorated nicholas dissolved the duma the duma was populated with radicals many of whom wished to push through legislation that would abolish private property ownership among other things witte unable to grasp the seemingly insurmountable problems of reforming russia and the monarchy wrote to nicholas on  april  resigning his office however other accounts have said that witte was forced to resign by the emperor nicholas was not ungracious to witte and an imperial rescript was published on  april creating witte a knight of the order of saint alexander nevsky with diamonds the last two words were written in the emperors own hand followed by i remain unalterably welldisposed to you and sincerely grateful for ever more nicholas a second duma met for the first time in february  the leftist parties—including the social democrats and the social revolutionaries who had boycotted the first duma—had won  seats in the second more than a third of the membership again nicholas waited impatiently to rid himself of the duma in two letters to his mother he let his bitterness flow a grotesque deputation is coming from england to see liberal members of the duma uncle bertie informed us that they were very sorry but were unable to take action to stop their coming their famous liberty of course how angry they would be if a deputation went from us to the irish to wish them success in their struggle against their government a little while later nicholas wrote all would be well if everything said in the duma remained within its walls every word spoken however comes out in the next days papers which are avidly read by everyone in many places the populace is getting restive again they begin to talk about land once more and are waiting to see what the duma is going to say on the question i am getting telegrams from everywhere petitioning me to order a dissolution but it is too early for that one has to let them do something manifestly stupid or mean and then — slap and they are gone nicholas ii stolypin and jewish delegation during the tsars visit to kiev in  after the second duma resulted in similar problems the new prime minister pyotr stolypin whom witte described as reactionary unilaterally dissolved it and changed the electoral laws to allow for future dumas to have a more conservative content and to be dominated by the liberalconservative octobrist party of alexander guchkov stolypin a skilful politician had ambitious plans for reform these included making loans available to the lower classes to enable them to buy land with the intent of forming a farming class loyal to the crown nevertheless when the duma remained hostile stolypin had no qualms about invoking article  of the fundamental laws which empowered the tsar to issue urgent and extraordinary emergency decrees during the recess of the state duma stolypins most famous legislative act the change in peasant land tenure was promulgated under article  the third duma remained an independent body this time the members proceeded cautiously instead of hurling themselves at the government opposing parties within the duma worked to develop the body as a whole in the classic manner of the british parliament the duma reached for power grasping for the national purse strings the duma had the right to question ministers behind closed doors as to their proposed expenditures these sessions endorsed by stolypin were educational for both sides and in time mutual antagonism was replaced by mutual respect even the sensitive area of military expenditure where the october manifesto clearly had reserved decisions to the throne a duma commission began to operate composed of aggressive patriots no less anxious than nicholas to restore the fallen honour of russian arms the duma commission frequently recommended expenditures even larger than those proposed with the passage of time nicholas also began to have confidence in the duma this duma cannot be reproached with an attempt to seize power and there is no need at all to quarrel with it he said to stolypin in  unfortunately stolypins plans were undercut by conservatives at court reactionaries such as prince vladimir nikolayevich orlov never tired of telling the tsar that the very existence of the duma was a blot on the autocracy which tsaritsa alexandra had always believed anyway stolypin they whispered was a traitor and secret revolutionary who was conniving with the duma to steal the prerogatives assigned the tsar by god witte also engaged in constant intrigue against stolypin although stolypin had had nothing to do with wittes fall witte blamed him stolypin had unwittingly angered the tsaritsa he had ordered an investigation into rasputin and presented it to the tsar who read it but did nothing stolypin on his own authority ordered rasputin to leave st petersburg alexandra protested vehemently but nicholas refused to overrule his prime minister who had more influence with the emperor by the time of stolypins assassination by dmitry bogrov a student and police informant in a theatre in kiev on  september  stolypin had grown weary of the burdens of office for a man who preferred clear decisive action working with a sovereign who believed in fatalism and mysticism was frustrating as an example nicholas once returned a document unsigned with the note despite most convincing arguments in favour of adopting a positive decision in this matter an inner voice keeps on insisting more and more that i do not accept responsibility for it so far my conscience has not deceived me therefore i intend in this case to follow its dictates i know that you too believe that a tsars heart is in gods hands let it be so for all laws established by me i bear a great responsibility before god and i am ready to answer for my decision at any time alexandra believing that stolypin had severed the bonds that her son depended on for life hated the prime minister in march  in a fit of anger stating that he no longer commanded the imperial confidence stolypin asked to be relieved of his office two years earlier when stolypin had casually mentioned resigning to nicholas he was informed this is not a question of confidence or lack of it it is my will remember that we live in russia not abroadand therefore i shall not consider the possibility of any resignation it never got that far on  september  in a procession where stolypins car was unprotected rasputin had coincidentally returned from his exile as stolypins car passed him rasputin cried out in a loud voice death is after him death is driving behind him bogrov would later assassinate stolypin in the kiev theatre that night in  a fourth duma was elected with almost the same membership as the third the duma started too fast now it is slower but better and more lasting stated nicholas to sir bernard pares the first world war developed badly for russia by late  romanov family desperation reached the point that grand duke paul alexandrovich younger brother of alexander iii and the tsars only surviving uncle was deputed to beg nicholas to grant a constitution and a government responsible to the duma nicholas sternly and adamantly refused reproaching his uncle for asking him to break his coronation oath to maintain autocratic power for his successors in the duma on  december  vladimir purishkevich a fervent patriot monarchist and war worker denounced the dark forces which surrounded the throne in a thunderous twohour speech which was tumultuously applauded revolution threatens he warned and an obscure peasant shall govern russia no longer tsarevich alexeis illness and rasputinedit tsarevich alexei nikolaevich c  grigori rasputin further complicating domestic matters was the matter of the succession alexandra bore nicholas four daughters the grand duchess olga in  the grand duchess tatiana in  grand duchess maria in  and grand duchess anastasia in  before their son alexei was born on  august  the young heir was afflicted with haemophilia b a hereditary disease that prevents blood from clotting properly which at that time was untreatable and usually led to an untimely death as a granddaughter of queen victoria alexandra carried the same gene mutation that afflicted several of the major european royal houses such as prussia and spain hemophilia therefore became known as the royal disease through alexandra the disease had passed on to her son as all of nicholas and alexandras daughters perished with their parents and brother in yekaterinburg in  it is not known whether any of them inherited the gene as carriers because of the fragility of the autocracy at this time nicholas and alexandra chose not to divulge alexeis condition to anyone outside the imperial household in fact there were many in the household who were unaware of the exact nature of the tsarevichs illness at first alexandra turned to russian doctors and medics to treat alexei however their treatments generally failed and alexandra increasingly turned to mystics and holy men or starets as they were called in russian one of these starets an illiterate siberian named grigori rasputin appeared to have some success rasputins influence over empress alexandra and consequently the tsar himself had grown stronger ever since  when the tsarevich nearly died from an injury while the family was on vacation at the hunting lodges at białowieża and spała poland the bleeding grew steadily worse until it was assumed that the tsarevich would not survive and the last sacrament was administered on  october  in desperation alexandra called upon rasputin as a last resort to which he replied god has seen your tears and heard your prayers do not grieve the little one will not die do not allow the doctors to bother him too much the haemorrhage stopped the very next day and the boy began to recover alexandra took this as a sign that rasputin was a starets and that god was with him for the rest of her life she would fervently defend him and turn her wrath against anyone who dared to question him european affairsedit nicholas ii and his son alexei aboard the imperial yacht standart during king edward viis state visit to russia in tallin  in  to counter perceived german aggression russia and great britain signed the anglorussian convention great britain had already entered into the entente cordiale with france in  and the anglorussian convention led to the formation of the triple entente the following year in may  nicholas and alexandras shared uncle bertie and aunt alix britains king edward vii and queen alexandra made a state visit to russia being the first reigning british monarchs to do so however they did not set foot on russian soil instead they stayed aboard their yachts meeting off the coast of modernday tallinn later that year nicholas was taken off guard by the news that his foreign minister alexander izvolsky had entered into a secret agreement with the austrohungarian foreign minister count alois von aehrenthal agreeing that in exchange for russian naval access to the dardanelles and the bosporus strait russia would not oppose the austrian annexation of bosnia and herzegovina a revision of the  treaty of berlin when austriahungary did annex this territory that october it precipitated the diplomatic crisis when russia protested about the annexation the austrians threatened to leak secret communications between izvolsky and aehernthal prompting nicholas to complain in a letter to the austrian emperor franz joseph about a breach of confidence in  in the wake of the anglorussian convention the russian imperial family made a visit to england staying on the isle of wight for cowes week in  during the balkan wars nicholas personally offered to arbitrate between serbia and bulgaria however the bulgarians rejected his offer also in  nicholas albeit without

february a te deum took place at kazan cathedral and a state reception at the winter palace in may nicholas and the imperial family made a pilgrimage across the empire retracing the route down the volga river that was made by the teenage michael romanov from the ipatiev monastery in kostroma to moscow in  when he finally agreed to become tsar first world waredit on  june  archduke franz ferdinand of austria heir to the austrohungarian throne was assassinated by gavrilo princip in sarajevo nicholas vacillated as to russias course of action the outbreak of war was not inevitable but leaders diplomats and nineteenthcentury alliances created a climate for largescale conflict the concept of panslavism and shared ethnicity created strong public sympathy between russia and serbia territorial conflict created rivalries between germany and france and between austria and serbia and as a consequence alliance networks developed across europe the triple entente and triple alliance networks were set before the war nicholas wanted neither to abandon serbia to the ultimatum of austriahungary nor to provoke a general war in a series of letters exchanged with kaiser wilhelm of germany the socalled willy and nicky correspondence the two proclaimed their desire for peace and each attempted to get the other to back down nicholas desired that russias mobilization be only against the austrian border in the hopes of preventing war with the german empire nicholas ii right with kaiser wilhelm ii of germany in  nicholas is wearing a german army uniform while wilhelm wears that of a russian hussar regiment on  july  the council of ministers was held in krasnoye selo at which tsar nicholas ii decided to intervene in the austroserbian conflict a step toward general war he put the russian army on alert on  july although this was not general mobilization it threatened the german and austrian borders and looked like military preparation for war however his army had no contingency plans for a partial mobilization and on  july  nicholas took the fateful step of confirming the order for general mobilization despite being strongly counselled against it on  july austriahungary formally declared war against serbia on  july  nicholas ii sent a telegram to wilhelm ii the willynicky correspondence with the suggestion to submit the austroserbian problem to the hague conference in hague tribunal wilhelm ii did not address the question of the hague conference in his subsequent reply count witte told the french ambassador maurice paléologue that from russias point of view the war was madness slav solidarity was simply nonsense and russia could hope for nothing from the war on  july russia ordered general mobilisation but still maintained that it would not attack if peace talks were to begin germany reacting to the discovery of russian partial mobilisation ordered on  july announced its own premobilisation posture the imminent danger of war germany requested that russia must demobilise within the next twelve hours in saint petersburg at pm with the ultimatum to russia expired the german ambassador to russia met with the russian foreign minister sergey sazonov asked three times if russia would reconsider and then with shaking hands delivered the note accepting russias war challenge and declaring war on  august less than a week later on  august franz joseph i of austria signed the austro hungarian declaration of war on russia the outbreak of war on  august  found russia grossly unprepared russia and her allies placed their faith in her army the famous russian steamroller its prewar regular strength was  mobilisation added  reserves and millions more stood ready behind them in every other respect however russia was unprepared for war germany had ten times as much railway track per square mile and whereas russian soldiers travelled an average of  kilometres  mi to reach the front german soldiers travelled less than a quarter of that distance russian heavy industry was still too small to equip the massive armies the tsar could raise and her reserves of munitions were pitifully small while the german army in  was better equipped than any other manforman the russians were severely short on artillery pieces shells motorised transports and even boots with the baltic sea barred by german uboats and the dardanelles by the guns of germanys ally turkey russia initially could receive help only via archangel which was frozen solid in winter or via vladivostok which was over  kilometres  mi from the front line by  a rail line was built north from petrozavodsk to the kola gulf and this connection laid the foundation of the icefree port of what eventually was called murmansk the russian high command was moreover greatly weakened by the mutual contempt between vladimir sukhomlinov the minister of war and the redoubtable warrior giant grand duke nicholas nikolayevich who commanded the armies in the field in spite of all of this an immediate attack was ordered against the german province of east prussia the germans mobilised there with great efficiency and completely defeated the two russian armies which had invaded the battle of tannenberg where an entire russian army was annihilated cast an ominous shadow over the empires future the loyal officers lost were the very ones needed to protect the dynasty the russian armies had great success against both the austrohungarian armies and against the forces of the ottoman empire from the very beginning of the war but they never succeeded against the might of the german army in september  in order to relieve pressure on france the russians were forced to halt a successful offensive against austrohungary in galicia in order to attack germanheld silesia russian prisoners at the battle of tannenberg where the russian second army was annihilated by german forces gradually a war of attrition set in on the vast eastern front where the russians were facing the combined forces of the german and austrohungarian empires and they suffered staggering losses general denikin retreating from galicia wrote the german heavy artillery swept away whole lines of trenches and their defenders with them we hardly replied there was nothing with which we could reply our regiments although completely exhausted were beating off one attack after another by bayonet

bakeries factories private houses and country estates belonging to people with german names were looted and burnedcitation needed the inflamed mobs then turned on the government declaring the empress should be shut up in a convent the tsar deposed and rasputin hanged nicholas was by no means deaf to these discontents an emergency session of the duma was summoned and a special defense council established its members drawn from the duma and the tsars ministers in july  king christian x of denmark first cousin of the tsar sent hans niels andersen to tsarskoye selo with an offer to act as a mediator he made several trips between london berlin and petrograd and in july saw the dowager empress maria fyodorovna andersen told her they should conclude peace nicholas chose to turn down king christians offer of mediation as he felt it would be a betrayal for russia to form a separate peace treaty with the central powers when its allies britain and france were still fighting the energetic and efficient general alexei polivanov replaced sukhomlinov as minister of war which failed to improve the strategic situation in the aftermath of the great retreat and the loss of the kingdom of poland nicholas assumed the role of commanderinchief after dismissing his cousin nikolay nikolayevich in september  this was a mistake as the tsar came to be personally associated with the continuing losses at the front he was also away at the remote hq at mogilev far from the direct governance of the empire and when revolution broke out in petrograd he was unable to halt it in reality the move was largely symbolic since all important military decisions were made by his chiefofstaff general michael alexeiev and nicholas did little more than review troops inspect field hospitals and preside over military luncheons nicholas ii with his family in yevpatoria crimea may  the duma was still calling for political reforms and political unrest continued throughout the war cut off from public opinion nicholas could not see that the dynasty was tottering with nicholas at the front domestic issues and control of the capital were left with his wife alexandra however alexandras relationship with grigori rasputin and her german background further discredited the dynastys authority nicholas had been repeatedly warned about the destructive influence of rasputin but had failed to remove him rumors and accusations about alexandra and rasputin appeared one after another alexandra was even accused of harboring treasonous sympathies towards germany anger at nicholass failure to act and the extreme damage that rasputins influence was doing to russias war effort and to the monarchy led to rasputins eventual murder by a group of nobles led by prince felix yusupov and grand duke dmitri pavlovich a cousin of the tsar in the early morning of saturday  december  os   december  ns collapseedit as the government failed to produce supplies mounting hardship created massive riots and rebellions with nicholas away at the front from  through  authority appeared to collapse and the capital was left in the hands of strikers and mutineering conscript soldiers despite efforts by the british ambassador sir george buchanan to warn the tsar that he should grant constitutional reforms to fend off revolution nicholas continued to bury himself away at the staff hq stavka  kilometres  mi away at moghilev leaving his capital and court open to intrigues and insurrection by early  russia was on the verge of total and utter collapse the army had taken  million men from the farms and food prices had soared an egg cost four times what it had in  butter five times as much the severe winter dealt the railways overburdened by emergency shipments of coal and supplies the final blow russia began the war with  locomotives by   were in service while the number of serviceable railway wagons had dwindled from half a million to  in february   locomotives burst their boilers and nearly  wagons were immobilised in petrograd supplies of flour and fuel had all but disappeared wartime prohibition of alcohol was enacted by nicholas to boost patriotism and productivity but instead damaged the treasury and funding of the war due to the treasury now being deprived of alcohol taxes one of the last photographs of nicholas ii showing him at tsarskoye selo after his abdication in march  on  february  in petrograd a combination of very severe cold weather and acute food shortages caused people to start to break shop windows to get bread and other necessities in the streets red banners appeared and the crowds chanted down with the german woman down with protopopov down with the war down with the tsar police started to shoot at the populace from rooftops which incited riots the troops in the capital were poorly motivated and their officers had no reason to be loyal to the regime they were angry and full of revolutionary fervor and sided with the populace the tsars cabinet begged nicholas to return to the capital and offered to resign completely  kilometres  mi away the tsar misinformed by the minister of the interior alexander protopopov that the situation was under control ordered that firm steps be taken against the demonstrators for this task the petrograd garrison was quite unsuitable the cream of the old regular army had been destroyed in poland and galicia in petrograd  recruits country boys or older men from the workingclass suburbs of the capital itself remained to keep control under the command of wounded officers invalided from the front and cadets from the military academies the units in the capital although many bore the names of famous imperial guard regiments were in reality rear or reserve battalions of these regiments the regular units being away at the front many units lacking both officers and rifles had never undergone formal training general khabalov attempted to put the tsars instructions into effect on the morning of sunday  march  despite huge posters ordering people to keep off the streets vast crowds gathered and were only dispersed after some  had been shot dead though a company of the volinsky regiment fired into the air rather than into the mob and a company of the pavlovsky life guards shot the officer who gave the command to open fire nicholas informed of the situation by rodzianko ordered reinforcements to the capital and suspended the duma it was too late on  march the volinsky regiment mutinied and was quickly followed by the semenovsky the ismailovsky the litovsky and even the legendary preobrazhensky regiment of the imperial guard the oldest and staunchest regiment founded by peter the great the arsenal was pillaged the ministry of the interior military government building police headquarters the law courts and a score of police buildings were put to the torch by noon the fortress of peter and paul with its heavy artillery was in the hands of the insurgents by nightfall  soldiers had joined the revolution order broke down and members of the duma and the soviet formed a provisional government to try to restore order they issued a demand that nicholas must abdicate faced with this demand which was echoed by his generals deprived of loyal troops with his family firmly in the hands of the provisional government and fearful of unleashing civil war and opening the way for german conquest nicholas had little choice but to submit abdication edit at the end of the february revolution of  february in the old russian calendar on  march os   march ns  nicholas ii chose to abdicate he first abdicated in favour of alexei but a few hours later changed his mind after advice from doctors that the tsarevich would not live long separated from his parents who would be forced into exile nicholas thus abdicated on behalf of his son and drew up a new manifesto naming his brother grand duke michael as the next emperor of all the russias he issued the following statement which was suppressed by the provisional government in the days of the great struggle against the foreign enemies who for nearly three years have tried to enslave our fatherland the lord god has been pleased to send down on russia a new heavy trial internal popular disturbances threaten to have a disastrous effect on the future conduct of this persistent war the destiny of russia the honor of our heroic army the welfare of the people and the whole future of our dear fatherland demand that the war should be brought to a victorious conclusion whatever the cost the cruel enemy is making his last efforts and already the hour approaches when our glorious army together with our gallant allies will crush him in these decisive days in the life of russia we thought it our duty of conscience to facilitate for our people the closest union possible and a consolidation of all national forces for the speedy attainment of victory in agreement with the imperial duma we have thought it well to renounce the throne of the russian empire and to lay down the supreme power as we do not wish to part from our beloved son we transmit the succession to our brother the grand duke michael alexandrovich and give him our blessing to mount the throne of the russian empire we direct our brother to conduct the affairs of state in full and inviolable union with the representatives of the people in the legislative bodies on those principles which will be established by them and on which he will take an inviolable oath in the name of our dearly beloved homeland we call on our faithful sons of the fatherland to fulfill their sacred duty to the fatherland to obey the tsar in the heavy moment of national trials and to help him together with the representatives of the people to guide the russian empire on the road to victory welfare and glory may the lord god help russia grand duke michael declined to accept the throne until the people were allowed to vote through a constituent assembly for the continuance of the monarchy or a republic the abdication of nicholas ii and the subsequent bolshevik revolution brought three centuries of the romanov dynastys rule to an end the fall of autocratic tsardom brought joy to liberals and socialists in britain and france the united states of america was the first foreign government to recognise the provisional government in russia the announcement of the tsars abdication was greeted with many emotions these included delight relief fear anger and confusion it is debatable whether nicholass enforced abdication was actually legal and whether he had the right to abdicate on behalf of his son as nicholas had already abdicated he was therefore merely a subject of his son and only grand duke michael as regent had the right to change the succession some historians contend that nicholas remained the tsar at least in theory until his death imprisonmentedit the governors mansion in tobolsk where the romanov family was held in captivity between august  and april  nicholas desperately wanted to go into exile in the united kingdom following his abdication the british government reluctantly offered the family asylum in the uk on  march  although it was suggested that it would be better for the romanovs to go to a neutral country news of the offer provoked uproar from the labour party and many liberals and the british ambassador sir george buchanan advised the government that the extreme left would use the extsars presence as an excuse for rousing public opinion against us the offer of asylum was withdrawn in april following objections by king george v who acting on the advice of his secretary arthur bigge st baron stamfordham was worried that nicholass presence in the uk might provoke an uprising like the previous years easter rising in ireland the french government declined to accept the romanovs in view of increasing unrest on the western front and on the home front as a result of the ongoing war with germany the british ambassador in paris lord francis bertie advised the foreign secretary that the romanovs would be unwelcome in france as the exempress was regarded as progerman in the early summer of  after an improvement in the internal political situation in russia the russian government approached the uk government on the issue of asylum and was informed the offer had been withdrawn due to the considerations of british internal politics in august the kerensky government evacuated the romanovs to tobolsk in the urals as a winter refuge to protect them from the rising tide of revolution until the family could be sent abroad in the spring of  via japan there they lived in the former governors mansion in considerable comfort in october  however the bolsheviks seized power from kerenskys provisional government nicholas followed the events in october with interest but not yet with alarm boris soloviev the husband of maria rasputin was supposedly organizing rescue attempts with monarchical factions but none occurred rumors persist that soloviev was working for the bolsheviks or the germans or both nicholas continued to underestimate lenins importance in the meantime he and his family occupied themselves with keeping warm conditions of imprisonment became more strict and talk of putting nicholas on trial grew more frequent the tsar was forbidden to wear epaulettes on  march  the family was placed on soldiers rations which meant parting with ten devoted servants and giving up butter and coffee as luxuries nicholas and alexandra were appalled by news of the treaty of brestlitovsk whereby russia agreed to give up poland finland the baltic states the ukraine the crimea and most of the caucasus what kept the familys spirits up was the belief that help was at hand the romanovs believed that various plots were underway to break them out of captivity and smuggle them to safety the western allies lost interest in the fate of the romanovs after russia left the war the german government wanted the monarchy restored in russia to crush the bolsheviks and maintain good relations with the central powers but on  april  the romanovs were transferred to their final destination the town of yekaterinburg where they were imprisoned in the twostorey ipatiev house the home of the military engineer nikolay nikolayevich ipatiev which ominously became referred to as the house of special purpose russian imperial family between circa  and circa  executionedit see also execution of the romanov family there are several accounts of what happened and historians have not agreed on a solid confirmed scope of events according to the account of yurovsky the chief executioner in the early hours of  july  the royal family was awakened around  am got dressed and were led down into a halfbasement room at the back of the ipatiev house the pretext for this move was the familys safety ie that antibolshevik forces were approaching yekaterinburg and the house might be fired upon present with nicholas alexandra and their children were their doctor and three of their servants who had voluntarily chosen to remain with the family the tsars personal physician eugene botkin his wifes maid anna demidova and the familys chef ivan kharitonov and footman alexei trupp a firing squad had been assembled and was waiting in an adjoining room composed of seven communist soldiers from central europe and three local bolsheviks all under the command of bolshevik officer yakov yurovsky nicholas was carrying his son when the family arrived in the basement the former empress complained that there were no chairs for them to sit oncitation needed yurovsky ordered two chairs brought in and when the empress and the heir were seated the executioners filed into the room yurovsky announced to them that they had been condemned to death by the ural soviet of workers deputies a stunned nicholas asked what what and turned toward his family yurovsky quickly repeated the order and shot the former emperor outright the executioners drew handguns and the shooting began nicholas was the first to die yurovsky shot him several times in the chest sometimes incorrectly said to have been in his head but his skull bore no bullet wounds when it was discovered in  anastasia tatiana olga and maria survived the first hail of bullets the sisters were wearing over  kilograms of diamonds and precious gems sewn into their clothing which provided some initial protection from the bullets and bayonets they were stabbed with bayonets and then shot at close range in their heads an announcement from the presidium of the ural regional soviet of the workers and peasants government emphasized that conspiracies had been exposed to free the extsar that counterrevolutionary forces were pressing in on soviet russian territory and that the extsar was guilty of unforgivable crimes against the nation in view of the enemys proximity to yekaterinburg and the exposure by the cheka of a serious white guard plot with the goal of abducting the former tsar and his family… in light of the approach of counterrevolutionary bands toward the red capital of the urals and the possibility of the crowned executioner escaping trial by the people a plot among the white guards to try to abduct him and his family was exposed and the compromising documents will be published the presidium of the ural regional soviet fulfilling the will of the revolution resolved to shoot the former tsar nikolai romanov who is guilty of countless bloody violent acts against the russian people identificationedit yekaterinburgs church on the blood built on the spot where the ipatiev house once stood in  the bodies of tsar nicholas ii tsaritsa alexandra three of their daughters and those of four nonfamily members killed with them were discovered near sverdlovsk yekaterinburg by amateur archaeologist alexander avdonin in january  the remains excavated from underneath the dirt road near yekaterinburg were officially identified as those of nicholas ii and his family excluding one of his daughters and alexei the identifications including comparisons to a living relative were performed by separate russian british and american scientists using dna analysis concur and were found to be conclusive in july  an amateur historian discovered bones near yekaterinburg belonging to a boy and young woman prosecutors reopened the investigation into the deaths of the imperial familycitation needed and in april  dna tests performed by a us laboratory proved that bone fragments exhumed in the ural mountains belonged to two children of nicholas ii son alexei b  and daughter maria b  according to russian news agencies that same day it was announced by russian authorities that the remains of the entire family had been identified on  october  supreme court of russia ruled that nicholas ii and his family were victims of political persecution and should be rehabilitated in march  results of the dna testing were published confirming that the two bodies discovered in  were those of alexei and his sister maria funeraledit after the dna testing of  the remains of the emperor and his immediate family were interred at st peter and paul cathedral saint petersburg on  july  on the eightieth anniversary of their executions the ceremony was attended by then russian president boris yeltsin who said today is a historic day for russia for many years we kept quiet about this monstrous crime but the truth has to be spoken the british royal family was represented at the funeral by prince michael of kent and more than twenty ambassadors to russia including sir andrew wood archbishop john bukovsky and ernstjörg von studnitz were also in attendance sainthoodedit main article romanov sainthood tsar nicholas ii of russia tsarmartyr nicholas ii of russia royal passionbearer tsar nicholas ii of russia born  may  tsarskoye selo saint petersburg russian empire died  july  aged  yekaterinburg russian sfsr venerated in russian orthodox church canonized  and  by russian orthodox church abroad and the russian orthodox church major shrine church on blood ekaterinburg russia feast  july in  nicholas and his immediate family were recognised as martyred saints by the russian orthodox church outside russia on  august  they were recognised by the synod of the russian orthodox church this time they were not named as martyrs since their deaths did not result immediately from their christian faith instead they were canonised as passion bearers according to a statement by the moscow synod they were glorified as saints for the following reasons in the last orthodox russian monarch and members of his family we see people who sincerely strove to incarnate in their lives the commands of the gospel in the suffering borne by the royal family in prison with humility patience and meekness and in their martyrs deaths in yekaterinburg in the night of  july  was revealed the light of the faith of christ that conquers evil however nicholass canonisation was controversial the russian orthodox church abroad was split on the issue back in  some members suggesting that the emperor was a weak ruler and had failed to thwart the rise of the bolsheviks it was pointed out by one priest that martyrdom in the russian orthodox church has nothing to do with the martyrs personal actions but is instead related to why he or she was killed the russian orthodox church inside russia rejected the familys classification as martyrs because they were not killed on account of their religious faith religious leaders in both churches also had objections to canonising the tsars family because they perceived him as a weak emperor whose incompetence led to the revolution and the suffering of his people and made him partially responsible for his own murder and those of his wife children and servants for these opponents the fact that the tsar was in private life a kind man and a good husband and father or a leader who showed genuine concern for the peasantry did not override his poor governance of russia despite the original opposition the russian orthodox church inside russia ultimately recognised the family as passion bearers or people who met their deaths with christian humility the church does not however recognise the remains interred at peter and paul cathedral as being those of the imperial familycitation needed assessmentedit nicholas is generally considered to have been incompetent at the colossal task of ruling the enormous russian empire historian barbara tuchman gives a damning evaluation of his reign the russian empire was ruled from the top by a sovereign who had but one idea of government—to preserve intact the absolute monarchy bequeathed to him by his father—and who lacking the intellect energy or training for his job fell back on personal favorites whim simple mulishness and other devices of the emptyheaded autocrat his father alexander iii who deliberately intended to keep his son uneducated in statecraft until the age of thirty unfortunately miscalculated his own life expectancy and died when nicholas was twentysix the new tsar had learned nothing in the interval and the impression of imperturbability he conveyed was in reality apathy—the indifference of a mind so shallow as to be all surface when a telegram was brought to him announcing the annihilation of the russian fleet at tsushima he read it stuffed it in his pocket and went on playing tennis in russia nicholas ii faced widespread criticism after the victory of the revolution pavel bykov who in russia wrote the first full account about the downfall of the tsar denounced nicholas as a tyrant who paid with his life for the ageold repression and arbitrary rule of his ancestors over the russian people over the impoverished and bloodsoaked country sovietera historians noted that nicholas ii was not fit to be a statesman it has been argued that he had a weak will and was manipulated by adventurist forces his regime was condemned for extensive use of the army police and courts to destroy the revolutionary movement he was criticised for fanning nationalism and chauvinism with the punitive expeditions and courtsmartial during the  revolution the monarch became known as nicholas the bloody nicholass reign was seen as a time of suffering for russians robert k massie provides a more sympathetic view of the tsar  there still are those who for political or other reasons continue to insist that nicholas was bloody nicholas most commonly he is described as shallow weak stupid—a onedimensional figure presiding feebly over the last days of a corrupt and crumbling system this certainly is the prevailing public image of the last tsar historians admit that nicholas was a good man—the historical evidence of personal charm gentleness love of family deep religious faith and strong russian patriotism is too overwhelming to be denied—but they argue that personal factors are irrelevant what matters is that nicholas was a bad tsar  essentially the tragedy of nicholas ii was that he appeared in the wrong place in history ancestorsedit ancestors of

have been vastly exaggerated as emperor of all the russias and an autocrat the resources under his command were virtually incalculable however the vast majority of this was owned by the state as crown property the romanov familys personal wealth was only a small fraction of this as monarch the income of nicholas was  million gold roubles per annum this derived from a yearly allowance from the treasury and from the profits of crown farmland from this income he had to fund staff the upkeep of imperial palaces and imperial theatres annuities for the royal family pensions bequests and other outgoings before the end of the year the tsar was usually penniless sometimes he reached this embarrassing state by autumn according to the grand marshal of the court count paul benckendorff the familys total financial resources amounted to between  and  million roubles as a comparison prince felix yussupov estimated his familys worth in real estate holdings alone as amounting to  million

of greece as well as the united kingdoms queen alexandra consort of king edward vii nicholas his wife alexandra and wilhelm ii german emperor were all first cousins of king george v of the united kingdom nicholas was also a first cousin of both haakon vii of norway and maud of wales as well as king constantine i of greece nicholas and wilhelm ii were in turn second cousinsonceremoved as each descended from king frederick william iii of prussia as well as third cousins as they were both greatgreatgrandsons of tsar paul i of russia in addition to being second cousins through descent from louis ii grand duke of hesse and his wife princess wilhelmine of baden nicholas and alexandra were also third cousinsonceremoved as they were both descendants of king frederick william ii of prussia tsar nicholas ii was the first cousinonceremoved of grand duke nicholas nikolaevich to distinguish between them the grand duke was often known within the imperial family as nikolasha and nicholas the tall while the tsar was nicholas the short in his childhood nicholas his parents and siblings made annual visits to the danish royal palaces of fredensborg and bernstorff to visit his grandparents the king and queen the visits also served as family reunions as his mothers siblings would also come from the united kingdom germany and greece with their respective families it was there in  that he had a flirtation with one of his english first cousins princess victoria in  nicholas also accompanied his parents and younger brother twoyearold george on a twomonth semiofficial visit to england in london nicholas and his family stayed at marlborough house as guests of his uncle bertie and aunt alix the prince and princess of wales where he was spoiled by his uncle tsesarevichedit tsarevich nicholas in japan  on  march  following the assassination of his grandfather tsar alexander ii nicholas became heir apparent upon his fathers ascension as alexander iii nicholas and his other family members bore witness to alexander iis death having been present at the winter palace in saint petersburg where he was brought after the attack for security reasons the new tsar and his family relocated their primary residence to the gatchina palace outside the city only entering the capital for various ceremonial functions on such occasions alexander iii and his family occupied the nearby anichkov palace in  nicholass comingofage ceremony was held at the winter palace where he pledged his loyalty to his father later that year nicholass uncle grand duke sergei alexandrovich married princess elizabeth daughter of louis iv grand duke of hesse and his late wife princess alice of the united kingdom who had died in  and a granddaughter of queen victoria at the wedding in st petersburg the sixteenyearold tsarevich met with and admired the brides youngest surviving sister twelveyearold princess alix those feelings of admiration blossomed into love following her visit to st petersburg five years later in  alix had feelings for him in turn as a devout lutheran she was initially reluctant to convert to russian orthodoxy in order to marry nicholas but later relented eventually in  nicholas along with his younger brother george and their cousin prince george of greece set out on a world tour although grand duke george fell ill and was sent home partway through the trip nicholas visited egypt india singapore and bangkok receiving honors as a distinguished guest in each country in april  while traveling through the city of otsu japan nicholas was the victim of an assassination attempt the incident cut his trip short returning overland to st petersburg he was present at the ceremonies in vladivostok commemorating the beginning of work on the transsiberian railway in  nicholas traveled to london on behalf of his parents to be present at the wedding of his cousin george duke of york to mary of teck queen victoria was struck by the physical resemblance between the two cousins and their appearances confused some at the wedding during this time nicholas had an affair with st petersburg ballerina mathilde kschessinska despite being heirapparent to the throne however nicholass father failed to prepare him for his future role as tsar he attended meetings of the state council however as his father was only in his forties it was expected that it would be several years before nicholas would take the throne sergei witte russias finance minister saw things differently and suggested to the tsar that nicholas be appointed to the siberian railway committee alexander argued that nicholas was not mature enough to take on serious responsibilities to which witte replied that if he was not introduced to state affairs nicholas would never be ready to understand them alexanders assumptions about living a long life and having years to prepare nicholas for becoming tsar would be proven wrong as by  alexander iii was suffering from ill health engagement accession and marriageedit see also wedding of nicholas ii and alexandra feodorovna in april  nicholas joined his uncle sergei and aunt elizabeth on a journey to coburg germany for the wedding of elizabeths and alixs brother ernest louis grand duke of hesse to their mutual first cousin princess victoria melita of saxecoburg and gotha other guests included queen victoria wilhelm ii german emperor the victoria princess royal kaiser wilhelms mother and queen victorias eldest daughter nicholass uncle the prince of wales and the brides parents the duke and duchess of saxecoburg and gotha once in coburg nicholas proposed to alix but she rejected his proposal being reluctant to convert to orthodoxy but the kaiser later told her she had a duty to marry nicholas and to convert as her sister elizabeth had voluntarily done in  thus nicholas and alix became officially engaged on  april  nicholass parents initially hesitated to give the engagement their blessing as alix had made poor impressions during her visits to russia they gave their consent only when they saw tsar alexanders health deteriorating queen victoria also initially opposed to the match for though she had no objections against nicholas personally she evidently disliked russiacitation needed official engagement photograph of nicholas ii and alexandra april  that summer nicholas travelled to england to visit both alix and the queen the visit coincided with the birth of the duke and duchess of yorks first child the future king edward viii along with being present at the christening nicholas and alix were listed amongst the childs godparents after several weeks in england nicholas returned home for the wedding of his sister xenia to a cousin grand duke alexander mikhailovich sandro by that autumn alexander iii lay dying upon learning that he would live only a fortnight the tsar had nicholas summon alix to the imperial palace at livadia alix arrived on  october the tsar insisted on receiving her in full uniform from his deathbed he told his son to heed the advice of witte his most capable minister ten days later alexander iii died at the age of fortynine leaving twentysixyearold nicholas as emperor of russia that evening nicholas was consecrated by his fathers priest as tsar nicholas ii and the following day alix was received into the russian orthodox church taking the name alexandra feodorovna with the title of grand duchess and the style of imperial highness nicholas ii and family nicholas may have felt unprepared for the duties of the crown for he asked his cousin and brotherinlaw grand duke alexander what is going to happen to me and all of russia though perhaps underprepared and unskilled nicholas was not altogether untrained for his duties as tsar nicholas chose to maintain the conservative policies favoured by his father throughout his reign while alexander iii had concentrated on the formulation of general policy nicholas devoted much more attention to the details of administrationcitation needed leaving livadia on  november tsar alexanders funeral procession—which included nicholass paternal aunt queen olga of greece and the prince and princess of wales—arrived in moscow after lying in state in the kremlin the body of the tsar was taken to st petersburg where the funeral was held on  november tsar nicholas ii and empress alexandra with their first child  nicholas and alixs wedding was originally scheduled for the spring of  but it was moved forward at nicholass insistence staggering under the weight of his new office he had no intention of allowing the one person who gave him confidence to leave his side instead nicholass wedding to alix took place on  november  which was the birthday of the dowager empress marie feodorovna and court mourning could be slightly relaxed alexandra wore the traditional dress of romanov brides and nicholas a hussars uniform nicholas and alexandra each holding a lit candle faced the palace priest and were married a few minutes before one in the afternoon reignedit coronation by valentin serov nicholas iis imperial monogram silk imperial crown of russia  coronation gift to nicholas ii nicholas ii of russia as tsarevich in  despite a visit to the united kingdom in  where he observed the house of commons in debate and seemingly impressed by the machinery of constitutional monarchy as well as a similar positive appraisal of the us congress on an official visit to the united states as tsesarevich nicholas turned his back on any notion of giving away any power to elected representatives in russia shortly after he came to the throne a deputation of peasants and workers from various towns local assemblies zemstvos came to the winter palace proposing court reforms such as the adoption of a constitutional monarchy and reform that would improve the political and economic life of the peasantry in the tver address although the addresses they had sent in beforehand were couched in mild and loyal terms nicholas was angry and ignored advice from an imperial family council by saying to them  it has come to my knowledge that during the last months there have been heard in some assemblies of the zemstvos the voices of those who have indulged in a senseless dream that the zemstvos be called upon to participate in the government of the country i want everyone to know that i will devote all my strength to maintain for the good of the whole nation the principle of absolute autocracy as firmly and as strongly as did my late lamented father on  may  nicholass formal coronation as tsar was held in uspensky cathedral located within the kremlin the silk imperial crown of russia was used as an official coronation gift of the russian empire nicholas ii was the first and only monarch to be presented with such a monumental coronation gift it was not intended as ceremonial regalia but as private imperial property a memento to his coronation in celebration on  may  a large festival with food free beer and souvenir cups was held in khodynka field outside moscow khodynka was chosen as the location as it was the only place near moscow large enough to hold all of the moscow citizens khodynka was primarily used as a military training ground and the field was uneven with trenches before the food and drink was handed out rumours spread that there would not be enough for everyone as a result the crowd rushed to get their share and individuals were tripped and trampled upon suffocating in the dirt of the field of the approximate  in attendance it is estimated that  individuals died and roughly  were injured the khodynka tragedy was seen as an ill omen and nicholas found gaining popular trust difficult from the beginning of his reign the french ambassadors gala was planned for that night the tsar wanted to stay in his chambers and pray for the lives lost but his uncles believed that his absence at the ball would strain relations with france particularly the  francorussian alliance thus nicholas attended the party as a result the mourning populace saw nicholas as frivolous and uncaring during the autumn after the coronation nicholas and alexandra made a tour of europe after making visits to the emperor and empress of austriahungary the kaiser of germany and nicholass danish grandparents and relatives nicholas and alexandra took possession of their new yacht the standart which had been built in denmark from there they made a journey to scotland to spend some time with queen victoria at balmoral castle while alexandra enjoyed her reunion with her grandmother nicholas complained in a letter to his mother about being forced to go shooting with his uncle the prince of wales in bad weather and was suffering from a bad toothache the first years of his reign saw little more than continuation and development of the policy pursued by alexander iii nicholas allotted money for the allrussia exhibition of  in  restoration of gold standard by sergei witte minister of finance completed the series of financial reforms initiated fifteen years earlier by  the transsiberian railway was nearing completion this helped the russians trade in the far east but the railway still required huge amounts of work initiatives in foreign affairsedit in foreign relations nicholas followed the policies of his father strengthening the francorussian alliance and pursuing a policy of general european pacification which culminated in the famous hague peace conference this conference suggested and promoted by nicholas ii was convened with the view of terminating the arms race and setting up machinery for the peaceful settlement of international disputes the results of the conference were less than expected due to the mutual distrust existing between great powers nevertheless the hague conventions were among the first formal statements of the laws of war in  nicholas ii and the famous russian diplomat friedrich martens were nominated for the nobel peace prize—for the initiative to convene the hague peace conference and contributing to its implementation ecclesiastical affairsedit in  nicholas threw himself into an ecclesiastical crisis regarding the canonisation of seraphim of sarov the previous year it had been suggested that if he were canonised the imperial couple would beget a son and heir to throne while alexandra demanded in july  that seraphim be canonised in less than a week nicholas demanded that he be canonised within a year despite a public outcry the church bowed to the intense imperial pressure declaring seraphim worthy of canonisation in january  that summer the imperial family travelled to sarov for the canonisation russojapanese waredit main article russojapanese war the russian baltic fleet was annihilated by the japanese at the battle of tsushima a clash between russia and the empire of japan was almost inevitable by the turn of the th century russia had expanded in the far east and the growth of its settlement and territorial ambitions as its southward path to the balkans was frustrated conflicted with japans own territorial ambitions on the chinese and asian mainland nicholas pursued an aggressive foreign policy with regards to manchuria and korea and strongly supported the scheme for timber concessions in these areas as developed by the bezobazov group war began in february  with a preemptive japanese attack on the russian fleet in port arthur prior to a formal declaration of war with the russian far east fleet trapped at port arthur the only other russian fleet was the baltic fleet it was half a world away but the decision was made to send the fleet on a ninemonth voyage to the east the united kingdom would not allow the russian navy to use the suez canal due to its alliance with the empire of japan and due to the dogger bank incident where the baltic fleet mistakenly fired on british fishing boats in the north sea the russian baltic fleet traversed the world to lift the blockade on port arthur but after many misadventures on the way was nearly annihilated by the japanese in the battle of the tsushima strait on land the imperial russian army experienced logistical problems while commands and supplies came from st petersburg combat took place in east asian ports with only the transsiberian railway for transport of supplies as well as troops both ways the kilometre  mi rail line between st petersburg and port arthur was singletrack with no track around lake baikal allowing only gradual buildup of the forces on the front besieged port arthur fell to the japanese after nine months of resistance nicholass stance on the war was something that baffled many he approached the war with confidence and saw it as an opportunity to raise russian morale and patriotism paying little attention to the financial repercussions of a longdistance war shortly before the japanese attack on port arthur nicholas held firm to the belief that there would be no war despite the onset of the war and the many defeats russia suffered nicholas still believed in and expected a final victory maintaining an image of the racial inferiority and military weakness of the japanese as russia faced imminent defeat by the japanese the call for peace grew nicholass own mother as well as his cousin emperor wilhelm ii urged nicholas to open peace negotiations despite the efforts for peace nicholas remained evasive sending a telegram to the kaiser on  october that it was his intent to keep on fighting until the japanese were driven from manchuria it was not until – may  and the annihilation of the russian fleet by the japanese that nicholas finally decided to sue for peacecitation needed nicholas ii accepted american mediation appointing sergei witte chief

newspaper bessarabets which published antisemitic materials received funds from viacheslav plehve minister of the interior these publications served to fuel the kishinev pogrom rioting the government of nicholas ii formally condemned the rioting and dismissed the regional governor with the perpetrators arrested and punished by the court leadership of the russian orthodox church also condemned antisemitic pogroms appeals to the faithful condemning the pogroms were read publicly in all churches of russia in private nicholas expressed his admiration for the mobs viewing antisemitism as a useful tool for unifying the people behind his regime however in  he approved of government efforts to prevent antisemitic pogroms following the assassination of pyotr stolypin by the jewish revolutionary dmitry bogrov bloody sunday edit main article bloody sunday  play media tsar nicholas of russia mounts his horse  unknown cinematographer of the edison manufacturing company a few days prior to bloody sunday   january  the priest and labor leader georgy gapon informed the government of the forthcoming procession to the winter palace to hand a workers petition to the tsar on saturday   january the ministers convened to consider the situation there was never any thought that the tsar who had left the capital for tsarskoye selo on the advice of the ministers would actually meet gapon the suggestion that some other member of the imperial family receive the petition was rejected finally informed by the prefect of police that he lacked the men to pluck gapon from among his followers and place him under arrest the newly appointed minister of the interior prince sviatopolkmirsky and his colleagues decided to bring additional troops to reinforce the city that evening nicholas wrote in his diary troops have been brought from the outskirts to reinforce the garrison up to now the workers have been calm their number is estimated at  at the head of their union is a kind of socialist priest named gapon mirsky came this evening to present his report on the measures taken on sunday   january  gapon began his march locking arms the workers marched peacefully through the streets some carried religious icons and banners as well as national flags and portraits of the tsar as they walked they sang hymns and the imperial anthem god save the tsar at  pm all of the converging processions were scheduled to arrive at the winter palace there was no single confrontation with the troops throughout the city at bridges on strategic boulevards the marchers found their way blocked by lines of infantry backed by cossacks and hussars and the soldiers opened fire on the crowd the official number of victims was  dead and several hundred wounded gapon vanished and the other leaders of the march were seized expelled from the capital they circulated through the empire increasing the casualties as bullets riddled their icons their banners and their portraits of nicholas the people shrieked the tsar will not help us outside russia the future british labour prime minister ramsay macdonald attacked the tsar calling him a bloodstained creature and a common murderer that evening nicholas wrote in his diary difficult day in st petersburg there were serious disturbances due to the desire of workers to get to the winter palace the troops had to shoot in different places of the city there were many dead and wounded lord how painful and bad grand duchess olga alexandrovna nicholass sister wrote afterwards nicky had the police report a few days before that saturday he telephoned my mother at the anitchkov and said that she and i were to leave for gatchina at once he and alicky went to tsarskoye selo insofar as i remember my uncles vladimir and nicholas were the only members of the family left in st petersburg but there may have been others i felt at the time that all those arrangements were hideously wrong nickys ministers and the chief of police had it all their way my mother and i wanted him to stay in st petersburg and to face the crowd i am positive that for all the ugly mood of some of the workmen nickys appearance would have calmed them they would have presented their petition and gone back to their homes but that wretched epiphany incident had left all the senior officials in a state of panic they kept on telling nicky that he had no right to run such a risk that he owed it to the country to leave the capital that even with the utmost precautions taken there might always be some loophole left my mother and i did all we could to persuade him that the ministers advice was wrong but nicky preferred to follow it and he was the first to repent when he heard of the tragic outcome from his hiding place gapon issued a letter stating nicholas romanov formerly tsar and at present soulmurderer of the russian empire the innocent blood of workers their wives and children lies forever between you and the russian people

with vague promises in hopes of cutting short the rebellion many demonstrators were shot on bloody sunday  as they tried to march to the winter palace in st petersburg dmitri feodorovich trepov was ordered to take drastic measures to stop the revolutionary activity grand duke sergei was killed in february by a revolutionarys bomb in moscow as he left the kremlin on  march the tsar condemned the revolutionaries meanwhile witte recommended that a manifesto be issued schemes of reform would be elaborated by goremykin and a committee consisting of elected representatives of the zemstvos and municipal councils under the presidency of witte in june the battleship potemkin part of the black sea fleet mutinied around augustseptember after his diplomatic success on ending the russojapanese war witte wrote to the tsar stressing the urgent need for political reforms at home the tsar remained quiet impassive and indulgent he spent most of that autumn hunting with the defeat of russia by a nonwestern power the prestige and authority of the autocratic regime fell significantly tsar nicholas ii taken by surprise by the events reacted with anger and bewilderment he wrote to his mother after months of disorder it makes me sick to read the news nothing but strikes in schools and factories murdered policemen cossacks and soldiers riots disorder mutinies but the ministers instead of acting with quick decision only assemble in council like a lot of frightened hens and cackle about providing united ministerial action ominous quiet days began quiet indeed because there was complete order in the streets but at the same time everybody knew that something was going to happen — the troops were waiting for the signal but the other side would not begin one had the same feeling as before a thunderstorm in summer everybody was on edge and extremely nervous and of course that sort of strain could not go on for long we are in the midst of a revolution with an administrative apparatus entirely disorganized and in this lies the main danger in october a railway strike developed into a general strike which paralysed the country in a city without electricity witte told nicholas ii that the country was at the verge of a cataclysmic revolution according to orlando figes the tsar asked his uncle grand duke nicholas to assume the role of dictator but the grand duke  took out a revolver and threatened to shoot himself there and then if the tsar refused to endorse wittes memorandum nicholas ii had no choice but to make a number of steps in the constitutional liberal direction the tsar accepted the draft hurriedly outlined by aleksei d obolensky the emperor and autocrat of all the russias was forced to sign the october manifesto to agree with the establishment of the imperial duma and give up part of his unlimited autocracy for the next six months witte was the prime minister according to harold williams that government was almost paralyzed from the beginning on  october os the tsar appointed trepov master of the palace without consulting witte and had daily contact with the emperor his influence at court was paramount on  november  os princess milica of montenegro presented grigori rasputin to tsar nicholas and his wife at peterhof palace relationship with the dumaedit one ruble silver coin of emperor nicholas ii dated  with the imperial coatofarms on the reverse the russian inscription reads bozheyu milostyu nikolay imperator i samoderzhets vseya rossiiiyskiy the english translation is by the grace of god nicholas ii emperor and autocrat of all the russias under pressure from the attempted  russian revolution on  august of that year nicholas ii issued a manifesto about the convocation of the state duma known as the bulygin duma initially thought to be an advisory organ in the october manifesto the tsar pledged to introduce basic civil liberties provide for broad participation in the state duma and endow the duma with legislative and oversight powers he was determined however to preserve his autocracy even in the context of reform this was signalled in the text of the  constitution he was described as the supreme autocrat and retained sweeping executive powers also in church affairs his cabinet ministers were not allowed to interfere or assist each other they were responsible only to him nicholass relations with the duma were poor the first duma with a majority of kadets almost immediately came into conflict with him scarcely had the  members sat down at the tauride palace when they formulated an address to the throne it demanded universal suffrage radical land reform the release of all political prisoners and the dismissal of ministers appointed by the tsar in favour of ministers acceptable to the duma grand duchess olga alexandrovna the younger sister of nicholas ii wrote there was such gloom at tsarskoye selo i did not understand anything about politics i just felt everything was going wrong with the country and all of us the october constitution did not seem to satisfy anyone i went with my mother to the first duma i remember the large group of deputies from among peasants and factory people the peasants looked sullen but the workmen were worse they looked as though they hated us i remember the distress in alickys eyes minister of the court count vladimir frederiks commented the deputies they give one the impression of a gang of criminals who are only waiting for the signal to throw themselves upon the ministers and cut their throats i will never again set foot among those people the dowager empress noticed incomprehensible hatred although nicholas initially had a good relationship with his prime minister sergei witte alexandra distrusted him as he had instigated an investigation of grigori rasputin and as the political situation deteriorated nicholas dissolved the duma the duma was populated with radicals many of whom wished to push through legislation that would abolish private property ownership among other things witte unable to grasp the seemingly insurmountable problems of reforming russia and the monarchy wrote to nicholas on  april  resigning his office however other accounts have said that witte was forced to resign by the emperor nicholas was not ungracious to witte and an imperial rescript was published on  april creating witte a knight of the order of saint alexander nevsky with diamonds the last two words were written in the emperors own hand followed by i remain unalterably welldisposed to you and sincerely grateful for ever more nicholas a second duma met for the first time in february  the leftist parties—including the social democrats and the social revolutionaries who had boycotted the first duma—had won  seats in the second more than a third of the membership again nicholas waited impatiently to rid himself of the duma in two letters to his mother he let his bitterness flow a grotesque deputation is coming from england to see liberal members of the duma uncle bertie informed us that they were very sorry but were unable to take action to stop their coming their famous liberty of course how angry they would be if a deputation went from us to the irish to wish them success in their struggle against their government a little while later nicholas wrote all would be well if everything said in the duma remained within its walls every word spoken however comes out in the next days papers which are avidly read by everyone in many places the populace is getting restive again they begin to talk about land once more and are waiting to see what the duma is going to say on the question i am getting telegrams from everywhere petitioning me to order a dissolution but it is too early for that one has to let them do something manifestly stupid or mean and then — slap and they are gone nicholas ii stolypin and jewish delegation during the tsars visit to kiev in  after the second duma resulted in similar problems the new prime minister pyotr stolypin whom witte described as reactionary unilaterally dissolved it and changed the electoral laws to allow for future dumas to have a more conservative content and to be dominated by the liberalconservative octobrist party of alexander guchkov stolypin a skilful politician had ambitious plans for reform these included making loans available to the lower classes to enable them to buy land with the intent of forming a farming class loyal to the crown nevertheless when the duma remained hostile stolypin had no qualms about invoking article  of the fundamental laws which empowered the tsar to issue urgent and extraordinary emergency decrees during the recess of the state duma stolypins most famous legislative act the change in peasant land tenure was promulgated under article  the third duma remained an independent body this time the members proceeded cautiously instead of hurling themselves at the government opposing parties within the duma worked to develop the body as a whole in the classic manner of the british parliament the duma reached for power grasping for the national purse strings the duma had the right to question ministers behind closed doors as to their proposed expenditures these sessions endorsed by stolypin were educational for both sides and in time mutual antagonism was replaced by mutual respect even the sensitive area of military expenditure where the october manifesto clearly had reserved decisions to the throne a duma commission began to operate composed of aggressive patriots no less anxious than nicholas to restore the fallen honour of russian arms the duma commission frequently recommended expenditures even larger than those proposed with the passage of time nicholas also began to have confidence in the duma this duma cannot be reproached with an attempt to seize power and there is no need at all to quarrel with it he said to stolypin in  unfortunately stolypins plans were undercut by conservatives at court reactionaries such as prince vladimir nikolayevich orlov never tired of telling the tsar that the very existence of the duma was a blot on the autocracy which tsaritsa alexandra had always believed anyway stolypin they whispered was a traitor and secret revolutionary who was conniving with the duma to steal the prerogatives assigned the tsar by god witte also engaged in constant intrigue against stolypin although stolypin had had nothing to do with wittes fall witte blamed him stolypin had unwittingly angered the tsaritsa he had ordered an investigation into rasputin and presented it to the tsar who read it but did nothing stolypin on his own authority ordered rasputin to leave st petersburg alexandra protested vehemently but nicholas refused to overrule his prime minister who had more influence with the emperor by the time of stolypins assassination by dmitry bogrov a student and police informant in a theatre in kiev on  september  stolypin had grown weary of the burdens of office for a man who preferred clear decisive action working with a sovereign who believed in fatalism and mysticism was frustrating as an example nicholas once returned a document unsigned with the note despite most convincing arguments in favour of adopting a positive decision in this matter an inner voice keeps on insisting more and more that i do not accept responsibility for it so far my conscience has not deceived me therefore i intend in this case to follow its dictates i know that you too believe that a tsars heart is in gods hands let it be so for all laws established by me i bear a great responsibility before god and i am ready to answer for my decision at any time alexandra believing that stolypin had severed the bonds that her son depended on for life hated the prime minister in march  in a fit of anger stating that he no longer commanded the imperial confidence stolypin asked to be relieved of his office two years earlier when stolypin had casually mentioned resigning to nicholas he was informed this is not a question of confidence or lack of it it is my will remember that we live in russia not abroadand therefore i shall not consider the possibility of any resignation it never got that far on  september  in a procession where stolypins car was unprotected rasputin had coincidentally returned from his exile as stolypins car passed him rasputin cried out in a loud voice death is after him death is driving behind him bogrov would later assassinate stolypin in the kiev theatre that night in  a fourth duma was elected with almost the same membership as the third the duma started too fast now it is slower but better and more lasting stated nicholas to sir bernard pares the first world war developed badly for russia by late  romanov family desperation reached the point that grand duke paul alexandrovich younger brother of alexander iii and the tsars only surviving uncle was deputed to beg nicholas to grant a constitution and a government responsible to the duma nicholas sternly and adamantly refused reproaching his uncle for asking him to break his coronation oath to maintain autocratic power for his successors in the duma on  december  vladimir purishkevich a fervent patriot monarchist and war worker denounced the dark forces which surrounded the throne in a thunderous twohour speech which was tumultuously applauded revolution threatens he warned and an obscure peasant shall govern russia no longer tsarevich alexeis illness and rasputinedit tsarevich alexei nikolaevich c  grigori rasputin further complicating domestic matters was the matter of the succession alexandra bore nicholas four daughters the grand duchess olga in  the grand duchess tatiana in  grand duchess maria in  and grand duchess anastasia in  before their son alexei was born on  august  the young heir was afflicted with haemophilia b a hereditary disease that prevents blood from clotting properly which at that time was untreatable and usually led to an untimely death as a granddaughter of queen victoria alexandra carried the same gene mutation that afflicted several of the major european royal houses such as prussia and spain hemophilia therefore became known as the royal disease through alexandra the disease had passed on to her son as all of nicholas and alexandras daughters perished with their parents and brother in yekaterinburg in  it is not known whether any of them inherited the gene as carriers because of the fragility of the autocracy at this time nicholas and alexandra chose not to divulge alexeis condition to anyone outside the imperial household in fact there were many in the household who were unaware of the exact nature of the tsarevichs illness at first alexandra turned to russian doctors and medics to treat alexei however their treatments generally failed and alexandra increasingly turned to mystics and holy men or starets as they were called in russian one of these starets an illiterate siberian named grigori rasputin appeared to have some success rasputins influence over empress alexandra and consequently the tsar himself had grown stronger ever since  when the tsarevich nearly died from an injury while the family was on vacation at the hunting lodges at białowieża and spała poland the bleeding grew steadily worse until it was assumed that the tsarevich would not survive and the last sacrament was administered on  october  in desperation alexandra called upon rasputin as a last resort to which he replied god has seen your tears and heard your prayers do not grieve the little one will not die do not allow the doctors to bother him too much the haemorrhage stopped the very next day and the boy began to recover alexandra took this as a sign that rasputin was a starets and that god was with him for the rest of her life she would fervently defend him and turn her wrath against anyone who dared to question him european affairsedit nicholas ii and his son alexei aboard the imperial yacht standart during king edward viis state visit to russia in tallin  in  to counter perceived german aggression russia and

the following year in may  nicholas and alexandras shared uncle bertie and aunt alix britains king edward vii and queen alexandra made a state visit to russia being the first reigning british monarchs to do so however they did not set foot on russian soil instead they stayed aboard their yachts meeting off the coast of modernday tallinn later that year nicholas was taken off guard by the news that his foreign minister alexander izvolsky had entered into a secret agreement with the austrohungarian foreign minister count alois von aehrenthal agreeing that in exchange for russian naval access to the dardanelles and the bosporus strait russia would not oppose the austrian annexation of bosnia and herzegovina a revision of the  treaty of berlin when austriahungary did annex this territory that october it precipitated the diplomatic crisis when russia protested about the annexation the austrians threatened to leak secret communications between izvolsky and aehernthal prompting nicholas to complain in a letter to the austrian emperor franz joseph about a breach of confidence in  in the wake of the anglorussian convention the russian imperial family made a visit to england staying on the isle of wight for cowes week in  during the balkan wars nicholas personally offered to arbitrate between serbia and bulgaria however the bulgarians rejected his offer also in  nicholas albeit without

volga river that was made by the teenage michael romanov from the ipatiev monastery in kostroma to moscow in  when he finally agreed to become tsar first world waredit on  june  archduke franz ferdinand of austria heir to the austrohungarian throne was assassinated by gavrilo princip in sarajevo nicholas vacillated as to russias course of action the outbreak of war was not inevitable but leaders diplomats and nineteenthcentury alliances created a climate for largescale conflict the concept of panslavism and shared ethnicity created strong public sympathy between russia and serbia territorial conflict created rivalries between germany and france and between austria and serbia and as a consequence alliance networks developed across europe the triple entente and triple alliance networks were set before the war nicholas wanted neither to abandon serbia to the ultimatum of austriahungary nor to provoke a general war in a series of letters exchanged with kaiser wilhelm of germany the socalled willy and nicky correspondence the two proclaimed their desire for peace and each attempted to get the other to back down nicholas desired that russias mobilization be only against the austrian border in the hopes of preventing war with the german empire nicholas ii right with kaiser wilhelm ii of germany in  nicholas is wearing a german army uniform while wilhelm wears that of a russian hussar regiment on  july  the council of ministers was held in krasnoye selo at which tsar nicholas ii decided to intervene in the austroserbian conflict a step toward general war he put the russian army on alert on  july although this was not general mobilization it threatened the german and austrian borders and looked like military preparation for war however his army had no contingency plans for a partial mobilization and on  july  nicholas took the fateful step of confirming the order for general mobilization despite being strongly counselled against it on  july austriahungary formally declared war against serbia on  july  nicholas ii sent a telegram to wilhelm ii the willynicky correspondence with the suggestion to submit the austroserbian problem to the hague conference in hague tribunal wilhelm ii did not address the question of the hague conference in his subsequent reply count witte told the french ambassador maurice paléologue that from russias point of view the war was madness slav solidarity was simply nonsense and russia could hope for nothing from the war on  july russia ordered general mobilisation but still maintained that it would not attack if peace talks were to begin germany reacting to the discovery of russian partial mobilisation ordered on  july announced its own premobilisation posture the imminent danger of war germany requested that russia must demobilise within the next twelve hours in saint petersburg at pm with the ultimatum to russia expired the german ambassador to russia met with the russian foreign minister sergey sazonov asked three times if russia would reconsider and then with shaking hands delivered the note accepting russias war challenge and declaring war on  august less than a week later on  august franz joseph i of austria signed the austro hungarian declaration of war on russia the outbreak of war on  august  found russia grossly unprepared russia and her allies placed their faith in her army the famous russian steamroller its prewar regular strength was  mobilisation added  reserves and millions more stood ready behind them in every other respect however russia was unprepared for war germany had ten times as much railway track per square mile and whereas russian soldiers travelled an average of  kilometres  mi to reach the front german soldiers travelled less than a quarter of that distance russian heavy industry was still too small to equip the massive armies the tsar could raise and her reserves of munitions were pitifully small while the german army in  was better equipped than any other manforman the russians were severely short on artillery pieces shells motorised transports and even boots with the baltic sea barred by german uboats and the dardanelles by the guns of germanys ally turkey russia initially could receive help only via archangel which was frozen solid in winter or via vladivostok which was over  kilometres  mi from the front line by  a rail line was built north from petrozavodsk to the kola gulf and this connection laid the foundation of the icefree port of what eventually was called murmansk the russian high command was moreover greatly weakened by the mutual contempt between vladimir sukhomlinov the minister of war and the redoubtable warrior giant grand duke nicholas nikolayevich who commanded the armies in the field in spite of all of this an immediate attack was ordered against the german province of east prussia the germans mobilised there with great efficiency and completely defeated the two russian armies which had invaded the battle of tannenberg where an entire russian army was annihilated cast an ominous shadow over the empires future the loyal officers lost were the very ones needed to protect the dynasty the russian armies had great success against both the austrohungarian armies and against the forces of the ottoman empire from the very beginning of the war but they never succeeded against the might of the german army in september  in order to relieve pressure on france the russians were forced to halt a successful offensive against austrohungary in galicia in order to attack germanheld silesia russian prisoners at the battle of tannenberg where the russian second army was annihilated by german forces gradually a war of attrition set in on the vast eastern front where the russians were facing the combined forces of the german and austrohungarian empires and they suffered staggering losses general denikin retreating from galicia wrote the german heavy artillery swept away whole lines of trenches and their defenders with them we hardly replied there was nothing with which we could reply our regiments although completely exhausted were beating off one attack after another by bayonet

bakeries factories private houses and country estates belonging to people with german names were looted and burnedcitation needed the inflamed mobs then turned on the government declaring the empress should be shut up in a convent the tsar deposed and rasputin hanged nicholas was by no means deaf to these discontents an emergency session of the duma was summoned and a special defense council established its members drawn from the duma and the tsars ministers in july  king christian x of denmark first cousin of the tsar sent hans niels andersen to tsarskoye selo with an offer to act as a mediator he made several trips between london berlin and petrograd and in july saw the dowager empress maria fyodorovna andersen told her they should conclude peace nicholas chose to turn down king christians offer of mediation as he felt it would be a betrayal for russia to form a separate peace treaty with the central powers when its allies britain and france were still fighting the energetic and efficient general alexei polivanov replaced sukhomlinov as minister of war which failed to improve the strategic situation in the aftermath of the great retreat and the loss of the kingdom of poland nicholas assumed the role of commanderinchief after dismissing his cousin nikolay nikolayevich in september  this was a mistake as the tsar came to be personally associated with the continuing losses at the front he was also away at the remote hq at mogilev far from the direct governance of the empire and when revolution broke out in petrograd he was unable to halt it in reality the move was largely symbolic since all important military decisions were made by his chiefofstaff general michael alexeiev and nicholas did little more than review troops inspect field hospitals and preside over military luncheons nicholas ii with his family in yevpatoria crimea may  the duma was still calling for political reforms and political unrest continued throughout the war cut off from public opinion nicholas could not see that the dynasty was tottering with nicholas at the front domestic issues and control of the capital were left with his wife alexandra however alexandras relationship with grigori rasputin and her german background further discredited the dynastys authority nicholas had been repeatedly warned about the destructive influence of rasputin but had failed to remove him rumors and accusations about alexandra and rasputin appeared one after another alexandra was even accused of harboring treasonous sympathies towards germany anger at nicholass failure to act and the extreme damage that rasputins influence was doing to russias war effort and to the monarchy led to rasputins eventual murder by a group of nobles led by prince felix yusupov and grand duke dmitri pavlovich a cousin of the tsar in the early morning of saturday  december  os   december  ns collapseedit as the government failed to produce supplies mounting hardship created massive riots and rebellions with nicholas away at the front from  through  authority appeared to collapse and the capital was left in the hands of strikers and mutineering conscript soldiers despite efforts by the british ambassador sir george buchanan to warn the tsar that he should grant constitutional reforms to fend off revolution nicholas continued to bury himself away at the staff hq stavka  kilometres

food prices had soared an egg cost four times what it had in  butter five times as much the severe winter dealt the railways overburdened by emergency shipments of coal and supplies the final blow russia began the war with  locomotives by   were in service while the number of serviceable railway wagons had dwindled from half a million to  in february   locomotives burst their boilers and nearly  wagons were immobilised in petrograd supplies of flour and fuel had all but disappeared wartime prohibition of alcohol was enacted by nicholas to boost patriotism and productivity but instead damaged the treasury and funding of the war due to the treasury now being deprived of alcohol taxes one of the last photographs of nicholas ii showing him at tsarskoye selo after his abdication in march  on  february  in petrograd a combination of very severe cold weather and acute food shortages caused people to start to break shop windows to get bread and other necessities in the streets red banners appeared and the crowds chanted down with the german woman down with protopopov down with the war down with the tsar police started to shoot at the populace from rooftops which incited riots the troops in the capital were poorly motivated and their officers had no reason to be loyal to the regime they were angry and full of revolutionary fervor and sided with the populace the tsars cabinet begged nicholas to return to the capital and offered to resign completely  kilometres  mi away the tsar misinformed by the minister of the interior alexander protopopov that the situation was under control ordered that firm steps be taken against the demonstrators for this task the petrograd garrison was quite unsuitable the cream of the old regular army had been destroyed in poland and galicia in petrograd  recruits country boys or older men from the workingclass suburbs of the capital itself remained to keep control under the command of wounded officers invalided from the front and cadets from the military academies the units in the capital although many bore the names of famous imperial guard regiments were in reality rear or reserve battalions of these regiments the regular units being away at the front many units lacking both officers and rifles had never undergone formal training general khabalov attempted to put the tsars instructions into effect on the morning of sunday

air rather than into the mob and a company of the pavlovsky life guards shot the officer who gave the command to open fire nicholas informed of the situation by rodzianko ordered reinforcements to the capital and suspended the duma it was too late on  march the volinsky regiment mutinied and was quickly followed by the semenovsky the ismailovsky the litovsky and even the legendary preobrazhensky regiment of the imperial guard the oldest and staunchest regiment founded by peter the great the arsenal was pillaged the ministry of the interior military government building police headquarters the law courts and a score of police buildings were put to the torch by noon the fortress of peter and paul with its heavy artillery was in the hands of the insurgents by nightfall  soldiers had joined the revolution order broke down and members of the duma and the soviet formed a provisional government to try to restore order they issued a demand that nicholas must abdicate faced with this demand which was echoed by his generals deprived of loyal troops with his family firmly in the hands of the provisional government and fearful of unleashing civil war and opening the way for german conquest nicholas had little choice but to submit abdication edit at the end of the february revolution of  february in the old russian calendar on  march os   march ns  nicholas ii chose to abdicate he first abdicated in favour of alexei but a few hours later changed his mind after advice from doctors that the tsarevich would not live long separated from his parents who would be forced into exile nicholas thus abdicated on behalf of his son and drew up a new manifesto naming his brother grand duke michael as the next emperor of all the russias he issued the following statement which was suppressed by the provisional government in the days of the great struggle against the foreign enemies who for nearly three years have tried to enslave our fatherland the lord god has been pleased to send down on russia a new heavy trial internal popular disturbances threaten to have a disastrous effect on the future conduct of this persistent war the destiny of russia the honor of our heroic army the welfare of the people and the whole future of our dear fatherland demand that the war should be brought to a victorious conclusion whatever the cost the cruel enemy is making his last efforts and already the hour approaches when our glorious army together with our gallant allies will crush him in these decisive days in the life of russia we thought it our duty of conscience to facilitate for our people the closest union possible and a consolidation of all national forces for the speedy attainment of victory in agreement with the imperial duma we have thought it well to renounce the throne of the russian empire and to lay down the supreme power as we do not wish to part from our beloved son we transmit the succession to our brother the grand duke michael alexandrovich and give him our blessing to mount the throne of the russian empire we direct our brother to conduct the affairs of state in full and inviolable union with the representatives of the people in the legislative bodies on those principles which will be established by them and on which he will take an inviolable oath in the name of our dearly beloved homeland we call on our faithful sons of the fatherland to fulfill their sacred duty to the fatherland to obey the tsar in the heavy moment of national trials and to help him together with the representatives of the people to guide the russian empire on the road to victory welfare and glory may the lord god help russia grand duke michael declined to accept the throne until the people were allowed to vote through a constituent assembly for the continuance of the monarchy or a republic the abdication of nicholas ii and the subsequent bolshevik revolution brought three centuries of the romanov dynastys rule to an end the fall of autocratic tsardom brought joy to liberals and socialists in britain and france the united states of america was the first foreign government to recognise the provisional government in russia the announcement of the tsars abdication was greeted with many emotions these included delight relief fear anger and confusion it is debatable whether nicholass enforced abdication was actually legal and whether he had the right to abdicate on behalf of his son as nicholas had already abdicated he was therefore merely a subject of his son and only grand duke michael as regent had the right to change the succession some historians contend that nicholas remained the tsar at least in theory until his death imprisonmentedit the governors mansion in tobolsk where the romanov family was held in captivity between august  and april  nicholas desperately wanted to go into exile in the united kingdom following his abdication the british government reluctantly offered the family asylum in the uk on  march  although it was suggested that it would be better for the romanovs to go to a neutral country news of the offer provoked uproar from the labour party and many liberals and the british ambassador sir george buchanan advised the government that the extreme left would use the extsars presence as an excuse for rousing public opinion against us the offer of asylum was withdrawn in april following objections by king george v who acting on the advice of his secretary arthur bigge st baron stamfordham was worried that nicholass presence in the uk might provoke an uprising like the previous years easter rising in ireland the french government declined to accept the romanovs in view of increasing unrest on the western front and on the home front as a result of the ongoing war with germany the british ambassador in paris lord francis bertie advised the foreign secretary that the romanovs would be unwelcome in france as the exempress was regarded as progerman in the early summer of  after an improvement in the internal political situation in russia the russian government approached the uk government on the issue of asylum and was informed the offer had been withdrawn due to the considerations of british internal politics in august the kerensky government evacuated the romanovs to tobolsk in the urals as a winter refuge to protect them from the rising tide of revolution until the family could be sent abroad in the spring of  via japan there they lived in the former governors mansion in considerable comfort in october  however the bolsheviks seized power from kerenskys provisional government nicholas followed the events in october with interest but not yet with alarm boris soloviev the husband of maria rasputin was supposedly organizing rescue attempts with monarchical factions but none occurred rumors persist that soloviev was working for the bolsheviks or the germans or both nicholas continued to underestimate lenins importance in the meantime he and his family occupied themselves with keeping warm conditions of imprisonment became more strict and talk of putting nicholas on trial grew more frequent the tsar was forbidden to wear epaulettes on  march  the family was placed on soldiers rations which meant parting with ten devoted servants and giving up butter and coffee as luxuries nicholas and alexandra were appalled by news of the treaty of brestlitovsk whereby russia agreed to give up poland finland the baltic states the ukraine the crimea and most of the caucasus what kept the familys spirits up was the belief that help was at hand the romanovs believed that various plots were underway to break them out of captivity and smuggle them to safety the western allies lost interest in the fate of the romanovs after russia left the war the german government wanted the monarchy restored in russia to crush the bolsheviks and maintain good relations with the central powers but on  april  the romanovs were transferred to their final destination the town of yekaterinburg where they were imprisoned in the twostorey ipatiev house the home of the military engineer nikolay nikolayevich ipatiev which ominously became referred to as the house of special purpose russian imperial family between circa  and circa  executionedit see also execution of the romanov family there are several accounts of what happened and historians have not agreed on a solid confirmed scope of events according to the account of yurovsky the chief executioner in the early hours of  july  the royal family was awakened around  am got dressed and were led down into a halfbasement room at the back of the ipatiev house the pretext for this move was the familys safety ie that antibolshevik forces were approaching yekaterinburg and the house might be fired upon present with nicholas alexandra and their children were their doctor and three of their servants who had voluntarily chosen to remain with the family the tsars personal physician eugene botkin his wifes maid anna demidova and the familys chef ivan kharitonov and footman alexei trupp a firing squad had been assembled and was waiting in an adjoining room composed of seven communist soldiers from central europe and three local bolsheviks all under the command of bolshevik officer yakov yurovsky nicholas was carrying his son when the family arrived in the basement the former empress complained that there were no chairs for them to sit oncitation needed yurovsky ordered two chairs brought in and when the empress and the heir were seated the executioners filed into the room yurovsky announced to them that they had been condemned to death by the ural soviet of workers deputies a stunned nicholas asked what what and turned toward his family yurovsky quickly repeated the order and shot the former emperor outright the executioners drew handguns and the shooting began nicholas was the first to die yurovsky shot him several times in the chest sometimes incorrectly said to have been in his head but his skull bore no bullet wounds when it was discovered in  anastasia tatiana olga and maria survived the first hail of bullets the sisters were wearing over  kilograms of diamonds and precious gems sewn into their clothing which provided some initial protection from the bullets and bayonets they were stabbed with bayonets and then shot at close range in their heads an announcement from the presidium of the ural regional soviet of the workers and peasants government emphasized that conspiracies had been exposed to free the extsar that counterrevolutionary forces were pressing in on soviet russian territory and that the extsar was guilty of unforgivable crimes against the nation in view of the enemys proximity to yekaterinburg and the exposure by the cheka of a serious white guard plot with the goal of abducting the former tsar and his family… in light of the approach of counterrevolutionary bands toward the red capital of the urals and the possibility of the crowned executioner escaping trial by the people a plot among the white guards to try to abduct him and his family was exposed and the compromising documents will be published the presidium of the ural regional soviet fulfilling the will of the revolution resolved to shoot the former tsar nikolai romanov who is guilty of countless bloody violent acts against the russian people identificationedit yekaterinburgs church on the blood built on the spot where the ipatiev house once stood in  the bodies of tsar nicholas ii tsaritsa alexandra three of their daughters and those of four nonfamily members killed with them were discovered near sverdlovsk yekaterinburg by amateur archaeologist alexander avdonin in january  the remains excavated from underneath the dirt road near yekaterinburg were officially identified as those of nicholas ii and his family excluding one of his daughters and alexei the identifications including comparisons to a living relative were performed by separate russian british and american scientists using dna analysis concur and were found to be conclusive in july  an amateur historian discovered bones near yekaterinburg belonging to a boy and young woman prosecutors reopened the investigation into the deaths of the imperial familycitation needed and in april  dna tests performed by a us laboratory proved that bone fragments exhumed in the ural mountains belonged to two children of nicholas ii son alexei b  and daughter maria b  according to russian news agencies that same day it was announced by russian authorities that the remains of the entire family had been identified on  october  supreme court of russia ruled that nicholas ii and his family were victims of political persecution and should be rehabilitated in march  results of the dna testing were published confirming that the two bodies discovered in  were those of alexei and his sister maria funeraledit after the dna testing of  the remains of the emperor and his immediate family were interred at st peter and paul cathedral saint petersburg on  july  on the eightieth anniversary of their executions the ceremony was attended by then russian president boris yeltsin who said today is a historic day for russia for many years we kept quiet about this monstrous crime but the truth has to be spoken the british royal family was represented at the funeral by prince michael

russian sfsr venerated in russian orthodox church canonized  and  by russian orthodox church abroad and the russian orthodox church major shrine church on blood ekaterinburg russia feast  july in  nicholas and his immediate family were recognised as martyred saints by the russian orthodox church outside russia on  august  they were recognised by the synod of the russian orthodox church this time they were not named as martyrs since their deaths did not result immediately from their christian faith instead they were canonised as passion bearers according to a statement by the moscow synod they were glorified as saints for the following reasons in the last orthodox russian monarch and members of his family we see people who sincerely strove to incarnate in their lives the commands of the gospel in the suffering borne by the royal family in prison with humility patience and meekness and in their martyrs deaths in yekaterinburg in the night of  july  was revealed the light of the faith of christ that conquers evil however nicholass canonisation was controversial the russian orthodox church abroad was split on the issue back in  some members suggesting that the emperor was a weak ruler and had failed to thwart the rise of the bolsheviks it was pointed out by one priest that martyrdom in the russian orthodox church has nothing to do with the martyrs personal actions but is instead related to why he or she was killed the russian orthodox church inside russia rejected the familys classification as martyrs because they were not killed on account of their religious faith religious leaders in both churches also had objections to canonising the tsars family because they perceived him as a weak emperor whose incompetence led to the revolution and the suffering of his people and made him partially responsible for his own murder and those of his wife children and servants for these opponents the fact that the tsar was in private life a kind man and a good husband and father or a leader who showed genuine concern for the peasantry did not override his poor governance of russia despite the original opposition the russian orthodox church inside russia ultimately recognised the family as passion bearers or people who met their deaths with christian humility the church does not however recognise the remains interred at peter and paul cathedral as being those of the imperial familycitation needed assessmentedit nicholas is generally considered to have been incompetent at the colossal task of ruling the enormous russian empire historian barbara tuchman gives a damning evaluation of his reign the russian empire was ruled from the top by a sovereign who had but one idea of government—to preserve intact the absolute monarchy bequeathed to him by his father—and who lacking the intellect energy or training for his job fell back on personal favorites whim simple mulishness and other devices of the emptyheaded autocrat his father alexander iii who deliberately intended to keep his son uneducated in statecraft until the age of thirty unfortunately miscalculated his own life expectancy and died when nicholas was twentysix the new tsar had learned nothing in the interval and the impression of imperturbability he conveyed was in reality apathy—the indifference of a mind so shallow as to be all surface when a telegram was brought to him announcing the annihilation of the russian fleet at tsushima he read it stuffed it in his pocket and went on playing tennis in russia nicholas ii faced widespread criticism after the victory of the revolution pavel bykov who in russia wrote the first full account about the downfall of the tsar denounced nicholas as a tyrant who paid with his life for the ageold repression and arbitrary rule of his ancestors over the russian people over the impoverished and bloodsoaked country sovietera historians noted that nicholas ii was not fit to be a statesman it has been argued that he had a weak will and was manipulated by adventurist forces his regime was condemned for extensive use of the army police and courts to destroy the revolutionary movement he was criticised for fanning nationalism and chauvinism with the punitive expeditions and courtsmartial during the  revolution the monarch became known as nicholas the bloody nicholass reign was seen as a time of suffering for russians robert k massie provides a more sympathetic view of the tsar  there still are those who for political or other reasons continue to insist that nicholas was bloody nicholas most commonly he is described as shallow weak stupid—a onedimensional figure presiding feebly over the last days of a corrupt and crumbling system this certainly is the prevailing public image of the last tsar historians admit that nicholas was a good man—the historical evidence of personal charm gentleness love of family deep religious faith and strong russian patriotism is too overwhelming to be denied—but they argue that personal factors are irrelevant what matters is that nicholas was a bad tsar  essentially the tragedy of nicholas ii was that he appeared in the wrong place in history ancestorsedit ancestors of

have been vastly exaggerated as emperor of all the russias and an autocrat the resources under his command were virtually incalculable however the vast majority of this was owned by the state as crown property the romanov familys personal wealth was only a small fraction of this as monarch the income of nicholas was  million gold roubles per annum this derived from a yearly allowance from the treasury and from the profits of crown farmland from this income he had to fund staff the upkeep of imperial palaces and imperial theatres annuities for the royal family pensions bequests and other outgoings before the end of the year the tsar was usually penniless sometimes he reached this embarrassing state by autumn according to the grand marshal of the court count paul benckendorff the familys total financial resources amounted to between  and  million roubles as a comparison prince felix yussupov estimated his familys worth in real estate holdings alone as amounting to  million

united kingdom right in german military uniforms in berlin before the war  nicholas was related to several monarchs in europe his mothers siblings included kings frederik viii of denmark and george i of greece as well as the united kingdoms queen alexandra consort of king edward vii nicholas his wife alexandra and wilhelm ii german emperor were all first cousins of king george v of the united kingdom nicholas was also a first cousin of both haakon vii of norway and maud of wales as well as king constantine i of greece nicholas and wilhelm ii were in turn second cousinsonceremoved as each descended from king frederick william iii of prussia as well as third cousins as they were both greatgreatgrandsons of tsar paul i of russia in addition to being second cousins through descent from louis ii grand duke of hesse and his wife princess wilhelmine of baden nicholas and alexandra were also third cousinsonceremoved as they were both descendants of king frederick william ii of prussia tsar nicholas ii was the first cousinonceremoved of grand duke nicholas nikolaevich to distinguish between them the grand duke was often known within the imperial family as nikolasha and nicholas the tall while the tsar was nicholas the short in his childhood nicholas his parents and siblings made annual visits to the danish royal palaces of fredensborg and bernstorff to visit his grandparents the king and queen the visits also served as family reunions as his mothers siblings would also come from the united kingdom germany and greece with their respective families it was there in  that he had a flirtation with one of his english first cousins princess victoria in  nicholas also accompanied his parents and younger brother twoyearold george on a twomonth semiofficial visit to england in london nicholas and his family stayed at marlborough house as guests of his uncle bertie and aunt alix the prince and princess of wales where he was spoiled by his uncle tsesarevichedit tsarevich nicholas in japan  on  march  following the assassination of his grandfather tsar alexander ii nicholas became heir apparent upon his fathers ascension as alexander iii nicholas and his other family members bore witness to alexander iis death having been present at the winter palace in saint petersburg where he was brought after the attack for security reasons the new tsar and his family relocated their primary residence to the gatchina palace outside the city only entering the capital for various ceremonial functions on such occasions alexander iii and his family occupied the nearby anichkov palace in  nicholass comingofage ceremony was held at the winter palace where he pledged his loyalty to his father later that year nicholass uncle grand duke sergei alexandrovich married princess elizabeth daughter of louis iv grand duke of hesse and his late wife princess alice of the united kingdom who had died in  and a granddaughter of queen victoria at the wedding in st petersburg the sixteenyearold tsarevich met with and admired the brides youngest surviving sister twelveyearold princess alix those feelings of admiration blossomed into love following her visit to st petersburg five years later in  alix had feelings for him in turn as a devout lutheran she was initially reluctant to convert to russian orthodoxy in order to marry nicholas but later relented eventually in  nicholas along with his younger brother george and their cousin prince george of greece set out on a world tour although grand duke george fell ill and was sent home partway through the trip nicholas visited egypt india singapore and bangkok receiving honors as a distinguished guest in each country in april  while traveling through the city of otsu japan nicholas was the victim of an assassination attempt the incident cut his trip short returning overland to st petersburg he was present at the ceremonies in vladivostok commemorating the beginning of work on the transsiberian railway in  nicholas traveled to london on behalf of his parents to be present at the wedding of his cousin george duke of york to mary of teck queen victoria was struck by the physical resemblance between the two cousins and their appearances confused some at the wedding during this time nicholas had an affair with st petersburg ballerina mathilde kschessinska despite being heirapparent to the throne however nicholass father failed to prepare him for his future role as tsar he attended meetings of the state council however as his father was only in his forties it was expected that it would be several years before nicholas would take the throne sergei witte russias finance minister saw things differently and suggested to the tsar that nicholas be appointed to the siberian railway committee alexander argued that nicholas was not mature enough to take on serious responsibilities to which witte replied that if he was not introduced to state affairs nicholas would never be ready to understand them alexanders assumptions about living a long life and having years to prepare nicholas for becoming tsar would be proven wrong as by  alexander iii was suffering from ill health engagement accession and marriageedit see also wedding of nicholas ii and alexandra feodorovna in april  nicholas joined his uncle sergei and aunt elizabeth on a journey to coburg germany for the wedding of elizabeths and alixs brother ernest louis grand duke of hesse to their mutual first cousin princess victoria melita of saxecoburg and gotha other guests included queen victoria wilhelm ii german emperor the victoria princess royal kaiser wilhelms mother and queen victorias eldest daughter nicholass uncle the prince of wales and the brides parents the duke and duchess of saxecoburg and gotha once in coburg nicholas proposed to alix but she rejected his proposal being reluctant to convert to orthodoxy but the kaiser later told her she had a duty to marry nicholas and to convert as her sister elizabeth had voluntarily done in  thus nicholas and alix became officially engaged on  april  nicholass parents initially hesitated to give the engagement their blessing as alix had made poor impressions during her visits to russia they gave their consent only when they saw tsar alexanders health deteriorating queen victoria also initially opposed to the match for though she had no objections against nicholas personally she evidently disliked russiacitation needed official engagement photograph of nicholas ii and alexandra april  that summer nicholas travelled to england to visit both alix and the queen the visit coincided with the birth of the duke and duchess of yorks first child the future king edward viii along with being present at the christening nicholas and alix were listed amongst the childs godparents after several weeks in england nicholas returned home for the wedding of his sister xenia to a cousin grand duke alexander mikhailovich sandro by that autumn alexander iii lay dying upon learning that he would live only a fortnight the tsar had nicholas summon alix to the imperial palace at livadia alix arrived on  october the tsar insisted on receiving her in full uniform from his deathbed he told his son to heed the advice of witte his most capable minister ten days later alexander iii died at the age of fortynine leaving twentysixyearold nicholas as emperor of russia that evening nicholas was consecrated by his fathers priest as tsar nicholas ii and the following day alix was received into the russian orthodox church taking the name alexandra feodorovna with the title of grand duchess and the style of imperial highness nicholas ii and family nicholas may have felt unprepared for the duties of the crown for he asked his cousin and brotherinlaw grand duke alexander what is going to happen to me and all of russia though perhaps underprepared and unskilled nicholas was not altogether untrained for his duties as tsar nicholas chose to maintain the conservative policies favoured by his father throughout his reign while alexander iii had concentrated on the formulation of general policy nicholas devoted much more attention to the details of administrationcitation needed leaving livadia on  november tsar alexanders funeral procession—which included nicholass paternal aunt queen olga of greece and the prince and princess of wales—arrived in moscow after lying in state in the kremlin the body of the tsar was taken to st petersburg where the funeral was held on  november tsar nicholas ii and empress alexandra with their first child  nicholas and alixs wedding was originally scheduled for the spring of  but it was moved forward at nicholass insistence staggering under the weight of his new office he had no intention of allowing the one person who gave him confidence to leave his side instead nicholass wedding to alix took place on  november  which was the birthday of the dowager empress marie feodorovna and court mourning could be slightly relaxed alexandra wore the traditional dress of romanov brides and nicholas a hussars uniform nicholas and alexandra each holding a lit candle faced the palace priest and were married a few minutes before one in the afternoon reignedit coronation by valentin serov nicholas iis imperial monogram silk imperial crown of russia  coronation gift to nicholas ii nicholas ii of russia as tsarevich in  despite a visit to the united kingdom in  where he observed the house of commons in debate and seemingly impressed by the machinery of constitutional monarchy as well as a similar positive appraisal of the us congress on an official visit to the united states as tsesarevich nicholas turned his back on any notion of giving away any power to elected representatives in russia shortly after he came to the throne a deputation of peasants and workers from various towns local assemblies zemstvos came to the winter palace proposing court reforms such as the adoption of a constitutional monarchy and reform that would improve the political and economic life of the peasantry in the tver address although the addresses they had sent in beforehand were couched in mild and loyal terms nicholas was angry and ignored advice from an imperial family council by saying to them  it has come to my knowledge that during the last months there have been heard in some assemblies of the zemstvos the voices of those who have indulged in a senseless dream that the zemstvos be called upon to participate in the government of the country i want everyone to know that i will devote all my strength to maintain for the good of the whole nation the principle of absolute autocracy as firmly and as strongly as did my late lamented father on  may  nicholass formal coronation as tsar was held in uspensky cathedral located within the kremlin the silk imperial crown of russia was used as an official coronation gift of the russian empire nicholas ii was the first and only monarch to be presented with such a monumental coronation gift it was not intended as ceremonial regalia but as private imperial property a memento to his coronation in celebration on  may  a large festival with food free beer and souvenir cups was held in khodynka field outside moscow khodynka was chosen as the location as it was the only place near moscow large enough to hold all of the moscow citizens khodynka was primarily used as a military training ground and the field was uneven with trenches before the food and drink was handed out rumours spread that there would not be enough for everyone as a result the crowd rushed to get their share and individuals were tripped and trampled upon suffocating in the dirt of the field of the approximate  in attendance it is estimated that  individuals died and roughly  were injured the khodynka tragedy was seen as an ill omen and nicholas found gaining popular trust difficult from the beginning of his reign the french ambassadors gala was planned for that night the tsar wanted to stay in his chambers and pray for the lives lost but his uncles believed that his absence at the ball would strain relations with france particularly the  francorussian alliance thus nicholas attended the party as a result the mourning populace saw nicholas as frivolous and uncaring during the autumn after the coronation nicholas and alexandra made a tour of europe after making visits to the emperor and empress of austriahungary the kaiser of germany and nicholass danish grandparents and relatives nicholas and alexandra took possession of their new yacht the standart which had been built in denmark from there they made a journey to scotland to spend some time with queen victoria at balmoral castle while alexandra enjoyed her reunion with her grandmother nicholas complained in a letter to his mother about being forced to go shooting with his uncle the prince of wales in bad weather and was suffering from a bad toothache the first years of his reign saw little more than continuation and development of the policy pursued by alexander iii nicholas allotted money for the allrussia exhibition of  in  restoration of gold standard by sergei

but the railway still required huge amounts of work initiatives in foreign affairsedit in foreign relations nicholas followed the policies of his father strengthening the francorussian alliance and pursuing a policy of general european pacification which culminated in the famous hague peace conference this conference suggested and promoted by nicholas ii was convened with the view of terminating the arms race and setting up machinery for the peaceful settlement of international disputes the results of the conference were less than expected due to the mutual distrust existing between great powers nevertheless the hague conventions were among the first formal statements of the laws of war in  nicholas ii and the famous russian diplomat friedrich martens were nominated for the nobel peace prize—for the initiative to convene the hague peace conference and contributing to its implementation ecclesiastical affairsedit in  nicholas threw himself into an ecclesiastical crisis regarding the canonisation of seraphim of sarov the previous year it had been suggested that if he were canonised the imperial couple would beget a son and heir to throne while alexandra demanded in july  that seraphim be canonised in less than a week nicholas demanded that he be canonised within a year despite a public outcry the church bowed to the intense imperial pressure declaring seraphim worthy of canonisation in january  that summer the imperial family travelled to sarov for the canonisation russojapanese waredit main article russojapanese war the russian baltic fleet was annihilated by the japanese at the battle of tsushima a clash between russia and the empire of japan was almost inevitable by the turn of the th century russia had expanded in the far east and the growth of its settlement and territorial ambitions as its southward path to the balkans was frustrated conflicted with japans own territorial ambitions on the chinese and asian mainland nicholas pursued an aggressive foreign policy with regards to manchuria and korea and strongly supported the scheme for timber concessions in these areas as developed by the bezobazov group war began in february  with a preemptive japanese attack on the russian fleet in port arthur prior to a formal declaration of war with the russian far east fleet trapped at port arthur the only other russian fleet was the baltic fleet it was half a world away but the decision was made to send the fleet on a ninemonth voyage to the east the united kingdom would not allow the russian navy to use the suez canal due to its alliance with the empire of japan and due to the dogger bank incident where the baltic fleet mistakenly fired on british fishing boats in the north sea the russian baltic fleet traversed the world to lift the blockade on port arthur but after many misadventures on the way was nearly annihilated by the japanese in the battle of the tsushima strait on land the imperial russian army experienced logistical problems while commands and supplies came from st petersburg combat took place in east asian ports with only the transsiberian railway for transport of supplies as well as troops both ways the kilometre  mi rail line between st petersburg and port arthur was singletrack with no track around lake baikal allowing only gradual buildup of the forces on the front besieged port arthur fell to the japanese after nine months of resistance nicholass stance on the war was something that baffled many he approached the war with confidence and saw it as an opportunity to raise russian morale and patriotism paying little attention to the financial repercussions of a longdistance war shortly before the japanese attack on port arthur nicholas held firm to the belief that there would be no war despite the onset of the war and the many defeats russia suffered nicholas still believed in and expected a final victory maintaining an image of the racial inferiority and military weakness of the japanese as russia faced imminent defeat by the japanese the call for peace grew nicholass own mother as well as his cousin emperor wilhelm ii urged nicholas to open peace negotiations despite the efforts for peace nicholas remained evasive sending a telegram to the kaiser on  october that it was his intent to keep on fighting until the japanese were driven from manchuria it was not until – may  and the annihilation of the russian fleet by the japanese that nicholas finally decided to sue for peacecitation needed nicholas ii accepted american mediation appointing sergei witte chief

of nicholas ii formally condemned the rioting and dismissed the regional governor with the perpetrators arrested and punished by the court leadership of the russian orthodox church also condemned antisemitic pogroms appeals to the faithful condemning the pogroms were read publicly in all churches of russia in private nicholas expressed his admiration for the mobs viewing antisemitism as a useful tool for unifying the people behind his regime however in  he approved of government efforts to prevent antisemitic pogroms following the assassination of pyotr stolypin by the jewish revolutionary dmitry bogrov bloody sunday edit main article bloody sunday  play media tsar nicholas of russia mounts his horse  unknown cinematographer of the edison manufacturing company a few days prior to bloody sunday   january  the priest and labor leader georgy gapon informed the government of the forthcoming procession to the winter palace to hand a workers petition to the tsar on saturday   january the ministers convened to consider the situation there was never any thought that the tsar who had left the capital for tsarskoye selo on the advice of the ministers would actually meet gapon the suggestion that some other member of the imperial family receive the petition was rejected finally informed by the prefect of police that he lacked the men to pluck gapon from among his followers and place him under arrest the newly appointed minister of the interior prince sviatopolkmirsky and his colleagues decided to bring additional troops to reinforce the city that evening

the streets some carried religious icons and banners as well as national flags and portraits of the tsar as they walked they sang hymns and the imperial anthem god save the tsar at  pm all of the converging processions were scheduled to arrive at the winter palace there was no single confrontation with the troops throughout the city at bridges on strategic boulevards the marchers found their way blocked by lines of infantry backed by cossacks and hussars and the soldiers opened fire on the crowd the official number of victims was  dead and several hundred wounded gapon vanished and the other leaders of the march were seized expelled from the capital they circulated through the empire increasing the casualties as bullets riddled their icons their banners and their portraits of nicholas the people shrieked the tsar will not help us outside russia the future british labour prime minister ramsay macdonald attacked the tsar calling him a bloodstained creature and a common murderer that evening nicholas wrote in his diary difficult day in st petersburg there were serious disturbances due to the desire of workers to get to the winter palace the troops had to shoot in different places of the city there were many dead and wounded lord how painful and bad grand duchess olga alexandrovna nicholass sister wrote afterwards nicky had the police report a few days before that saturday he telephoned my mother at the anitchkov and said that she and i were to leave for gatchina at once he and alicky went to tsarskoye selo insofar as i remember my uncles vladimir and nicholas were the only members of the family left in st petersburg but there may have been others i felt at the time that all those arrangements were hideously wrong nickys ministers and the chief of police had it all their way my mother and i wanted him to stay in st petersburg and to face the crowd i am positive that for all the ugly mood of some of the workmen nickys appearance would have calmed them they would have presented their petition and gone back to their homes but that wretched epiphany incident had left all the senior officials in a state of panic they kept on telling nicky that he had no right to run such a risk that he owed it to the country to leave the capital that even with the utmost precautions taken there might always be some loophole left my mother and i did all we could to persuade him that the ministers advice was wrong but nicky preferred to follow it and he was the first to repent when he heard of the tragic outcome from his hiding place gapon issued a letter stating nicholas romanov formerly tsar and at present soulmurderer of the russian empire the innocent blood of workers their wives and children lies forever between you and the russian people

ordered to take drastic measures to stop the revolutionary activity grand duke sergei was killed in february by a revolutionarys bomb in moscow as he left the kremlin on  march the tsar condemned the revolutionaries meanwhile witte recommended that a manifesto be issued schemes of reform would be elaborated by goremykin and a committee consisting of elected representatives of the zemstvos and municipal councils under the presidency of witte in june the battleship potemkin part of the black sea fleet mutinied around augustseptember after his diplomatic success on ending the russojapanese war witte wrote to the tsar stressing the urgent need for political reforms at home the tsar remained quiet impassive and indulgent he spent most of that autumn hunting with the defeat of russia by a nonwestern power the prestige and authority of the autocratic regime fell significantly tsar nicholas ii taken by surprise by the events reacted with anger and bewilderment he wrote to his mother after months of disorder it makes me sick to read the news nothing but strikes in schools and factories murdered policemen cossacks and soldiers riots disorder mutinies but the ministers instead of acting with quick decision only assemble in council like a lot of frightened hens and cackle about providing united ministerial action ominous quiet days began quiet indeed because there was complete order in the streets but at the same time everybody knew that something was going to happen — the troops were waiting for the signal but the other side would not begin one had the same feeling as before a thunderstorm in summer everybody was on edge and extremely nervous and of course that sort of strain could not go on for long we are in the midst of a revolution with an administrative apparatus entirely disorganized and in this lies the main danger in october a railway strike developed into a general strike which paralysed the country in a city without electricity witte told nicholas ii that the country was at the verge of a cataclysmic revolution according to orlando figes the tsar asked his uncle grand duke nicholas to assume the role of dictator but the grand duke  took out a revolver and threatened to shoot himself there and then if the tsar refused to endorse wittes memorandum nicholas ii had no choice but to make a number of steps in the constitutional liberal direction the tsar accepted the draft hurriedly outlined by aleksei d obolensky the emperor and autocrat of all the russias was forced to sign the october manifesto to agree with the establishment of the imperial duma and give up part of his unlimited autocracy for the next six months witte was the prime minister according to harold williams that government was almost paralyzed from the beginning on  october os the tsar appointed trepov master of the palace without consulting witte and had daily contact with the emperor his influence at court was paramount on  november  os princess milica of montenegro presented grigori rasputin to tsar nicholas and his wife at peterhof palace relationship with the dumaedit one ruble silver coin of emperor nicholas ii dated  with the imperial coatofarms on the reverse the russian inscription reads bozheyu milostyu nikolay imperator i samoderzhets vseya rossiiiyskiy the english translation is by the grace of god nicholas ii emperor and autocrat of all the russias under pressure from the attempted  russian revolution on  august of that year nicholas ii issued a manifesto about the convocation of the state duma known as the bulygin duma initially thought to be an advisory organ in the october manifesto the tsar pledged to introduce basic civil liberties provide for broad participation in the state duma and endow the duma with legislative and oversight powers he was determined however to preserve his autocracy even in the context of reform this was signalled in the text of the  constitution he was described as the supreme autocrat and retained sweeping executive powers also in church affairs his cabinet ministers were not allowed to interfere or assist each other they were responsible only to him nicholass relations with the duma were poor the first duma with a majority of kadets almost immediately came into conflict with him scarcely had the  members sat down at the tauride palace when they formulated an address to the throne it demanded universal suffrage radical land reform the release of all political prisoners and the dismissal of ministers appointed by the tsar in favour of ministers acceptable to the duma grand duchess olga alexandrovna the younger sister of nicholas ii wrote there was such gloom at tsarskoye selo i did not understand anything about politics i just felt everything was going wrong with the country and all of us the october constitution did not seem to satisfy anyone i went with my mother to the first duma i remember the large group of deputies from among peasants and factory people the peasants looked sullen but the workmen were worse they looked as though they hated us i remember the distress in alickys eyes minister of the court count vladimir frederiks commented the deputies they give one the impression of a gang of criminals who are only waiting for the signal to throw themselves upon the ministers and cut their throats i will never again set foot among those people the dowager empress noticed incomprehensible hatred although nicholas initially had a good relationship with his prime minister sergei witte alexandra distrusted him as he had instigated an investigation of grigori rasputin and as the political situation deteriorated nicholas dissolved the duma the duma was populated with radicals many of whom wished to push through legislation that would abolish private property ownership among other things witte unable to grasp the seemingly insurmountable problems of reforming russia and the monarchy wrote to nicholas on  april  resigning his office however other accounts have said that witte was forced to resign by the emperor nicholas was not ungracious to witte and an imperial rescript was published on  april creating witte a knight of the order of saint alexander nevsky with diamonds the last two words were written in the emperors own hand followed by i remain unalterably welldisposed to you and sincerely grateful for ever more nicholas a second duma met for the first time in february  the leftist parties—including the social democrats and the social revolutionaries who had boycotted the first duma—had won  seats in the second more than a third of the membership again nicholas waited impatiently to rid himself of the duma in two letters to his mother he let his bitterness flow a grotesque deputation is coming from england to see liberal members of the duma uncle bertie informed us that they were very sorry but were unable to take action to stop their coming their famous liberty of course how angry they would be if a deputation went from us to the irish to wish them success in their struggle against their government a little while later nicholas wrote all would be well if everything said in the duma remained within its walls every word spoken however comes out in the next days papers which are avidly read by everyone in many places the populace is getting restive again they begin to talk about land once more and are waiting to see what the duma is going to say on the question i am getting telegrams from everywhere petitioning me to order a dissolution but it is too early for that one has to let them do something manifestly stupid or mean and then — slap and they are gone nicholas ii stolypin and jewish delegation during the tsars visit to kiev in  after the second duma resulted in similar problems the new prime minister pyotr stolypin whom witte described as reactionary unilaterally dissolved it and changed the electoral laws to allow for future dumas to have a more conservative content and to be dominated by the liberalconservative octobrist party of alexander guchkov stolypin a skilful politician had ambitious plans for reform these included making loans available to the lower classes to enable them to buy land with the intent of forming a farming class loyal to the crown nevertheless when the duma remained hostile stolypin had no qualms about invoking article  of the fundamental laws which empowered the tsar to issue urgent and extraordinary emergency decrees during the recess of the state duma stolypins most famous legislative act the change in peasant land tenure was promulgated under article  the third duma remained an independent body this time the members proceeded cautiously instead of hurling themselves at the government opposing parties within the duma worked to develop the body as a whole in the classic manner of the british parliament the duma reached for power grasping for the national purse strings the duma had the right to question ministers behind closed doors as to their proposed expenditures these sessions endorsed by stolypin were educational for both sides and in time mutual antagonism was replaced by mutual respect even the sensitive area of military expenditure where the october manifesto clearly had reserved decisions to the throne a duma commission began to operate composed of aggressive patriots no less anxious than nicholas to restore the fallen honour of russian arms the duma commission frequently recommended expenditures even larger than those proposed with the passage of time nicholas also began to have confidence in the duma this duma cannot be reproached with an attempt to seize power and there is no need at all to quarrel with it he said to stolypin in  unfortunately stolypins plans were undercut by conservatives at court reactionaries such as prince vladimir nikolayevich orlov never tired of telling the tsar that the very existence of the duma was a blot on the autocracy which tsaritsa alexandra had always believed anyway stolypin they whispered was a traitor and secret revolutionary who was conniving with the duma to steal the prerogatives assigned the tsar by god witte also engaged in constant intrigue against stolypin although stolypin had had nothing to do with wittes fall witte blamed him stolypin had unwittingly angered the tsaritsa he had ordered an investigation into rasputin and presented it to the tsar who read it but did nothing stolypin on his own authority ordered rasputin to leave st petersburg alexandra protested vehemently but nicholas refused to overrule his prime minister who had more influence with the emperor by the time of stolypins assassination by dmitry bogrov a student and police informant in a theatre in kiev on  september  stolypin had grown weary of the burdens of office for a man who preferred clear decisive action working with a sovereign who believed in fatalism and mysticism was frustrating as an example nicholas once returned a document unsigned with the note despite most convincing arguments in favour of adopting a positive decision in this matter an inner voice keeps on insisting more and more that i do not accept responsibility for it so far my conscience has not deceived me therefore i intend in this case to follow its dictates i know that you too believe that a tsars heart is in gods hands let it be so for all laws established by me i bear a great responsibility before god and i am ready to answer for my decision at any time alexandra believing that stolypin had severed the bonds that her son depended on for life hated the prime minister in march  in a fit of anger stating that he no longer commanded the imperial confidence stolypin asked to be relieved of his office two years earlier when stolypin had casually mentioned resigning to nicholas he was informed this is not a question of confidence or lack of it it is my will remember that we live in russia not abroadand therefore i shall not consider the possibility of any resignation it never got that far on  september  in a procession where stolypins car was unprotected rasputin had coincidentally returned from his exile as stolypins car passed him rasputin cried out in a loud voice death is after him death is driving behind him bogrov would later assassinate stolypin in the kiev theatre that night in  a fourth duma was elected with almost the same membership as the third the duma started too fast now it is slower but better and more lasting stated nicholas to sir bernard pares the first world war developed badly for russia by late  romanov family desperation reached the point that grand duke paul alexandrovich younger brother of alexander iii and the tsars only surviving uncle was deputed to beg nicholas to grant a constitution and a government responsible to the duma nicholas sternly and adamantly refused reproaching his uncle for asking him to break his coronation oath to maintain autocratic power for his successors in the duma on  december  vladimir purishkevich a fervent patriot monarchist and war worker denounced the dark forces which surrounded the throne in a thunderous twohour speech which was tumultuously applauded revolution threatens he warned and an obscure peasant shall govern russia no longer tsarevich alexeis illness and rasputinedit tsarevich alexei nikolaevich c  grigori rasputin further complicating domestic matters was the matter of the succession alexandra bore nicholas four daughters the grand duchess olga in  the grand duchess tatiana in  grand duchess maria in  and grand duchess anastasia in  before their son alexei was born on  august  the young heir was afflicted with haemophilia b a hereditary disease that prevents blood from clotting properly which at that time was untreatable and usually led to an untimely death as a granddaughter of queen victoria alexandra carried the same gene mutation that afflicted several of the major european royal houses such as prussia and spain hemophilia therefore became known as the royal disease through alexandra the disease had passed on to her son as all of nicholas and alexandras daughters perished with their parents and brother in yekaterinburg in  it is not known whether any of them inherited the gene as carriers because of the fragility of the autocracy at this time nicholas and alexandra chose not to divulge alexeis condition to anyone outside the imperial household in fact there were many in the household who were unaware of the exact nature of the tsarevichs illness at first alexandra turned to russian doctors and medics to treat alexei however their treatments generally failed and alexandra increasingly turned to mystics and holy men or starets as they were called in russian one of these starets an illiterate siberian named grigori rasputin appeared to have some success rasputins influence over empress alexandra and consequently the tsar himself had grown stronger ever since  when the tsarevich nearly died from an injury while the family was on vacation at the hunting lodges at białowieża and spała poland the bleeding grew steadily worse until it was assumed that the tsarevich would not survive and the last sacrament was administered on  october  in desperation alexandra called upon rasputin as a last resort to which he replied god has seen your tears and heard your prayers do not grieve the little one will not die do not allow the doctors to bother him too much the haemorrhage stopped the very next day and the boy began to recover alexandra took this as a sign that rasputin was a starets and that god was with him for the rest of her life she would fervently defend him and turn her wrath against anyone who dared to question him european affairsedit nicholas ii and his son alexei aboard the imperial yacht standart during king edward viis state visit to russia in tallin  in  to counter perceived german aggression russia and

the following year in may  nicholas and alexandras shared uncle bertie and aunt alix britains king edward vii and queen alexandra made a state visit to russia being the first reigning british monarchs to do so however they did not set foot on russian soil instead they stayed aboard their yachts meeting off the coast of modernday tallinn later that year nicholas was taken off guard by the news that his foreign minister alexander izvolsky had entered into a secret agreement with the austrohungarian foreign minister count alois von aehrenthal agreeing that in exchange for russian naval access to the dardanelles and the bosporus strait russia would not oppose the austrian annexation of bosnia and herzegovina a revision of the  treaty of berlin when austriahungary did annex this territory that october it precipitated the diplomatic crisis when russia protested about the annexation the austrians threatened to leak secret communications between izvolsky and aehernthal prompting nicholas to complain in a letter to the austrian emperor franz joseph about a breach of confidence in  in the wake of the anglorussian convention the russian imperial family made a visit to england staying on the isle of wight for cowes week in  during the balkan wars nicholas personally offered to arbitrate between serbia and bulgaria however the bulgarians rejected his offer also in  nicholas albeit without

volga river that was made by the teenage michael romanov from the ipatiev monastery in kostroma to moscow in  when he finally agreed to become tsar first world waredit on  june  archduke franz ferdinand of austria heir to the austrohungarian throne was assassinated by gavrilo princip in sarajevo nicholas vacillated as to russias course of action the outbreak of war was not inevitable but leaders diplomats and nineteenthcentury alliances created a climate for largescale conflict the concept of panslavism and shared ethnicity created strong public sympathy between russia and serbia territorial conflict created rivalries between germany and france and between austria and serbia and as a consequence alliance networks developed across europe the triple entente and triple alliance networks were set before the war nicholas wanted neither to abandon serbia to the ultimatum of austriahungary nor to provoke a general war in a series of letters exchanged with kaiser wilhelm of germany the socalled willy and nicky correspondence the two proclaimed their desire for peace and each attempted to get the other to back down nicholas desired that russias mobilization be only against the austrian border in the hopes of preventing war with the german empire nicholas ii right with kaiser wilhelm ii of germany in  nicholas is wearing a german army uniform while wilhelm wears that of a russian hussar regiment on  july  the council of ministers was held in krasnoye selo at which tsar nicholas ii decided to intervene in the austroserbian conflict a step toward general war he put the russian army on alert on  july although this was not general mobilization it threatened the german and austrian borders and looked like military preparation for war however his army had no contingency plans for a partial mobilization and on  july  nicholas took the fateful step of confirming the order for general mobilization despite being strongly counselled against it on  july austriahungary formally declared war against serbia on  july  nicholas ii sent a telegram to wilhelm ii the willynicky correspondence with the suggestion to submit the austroserbian problem to the hague conference in hague tribunal wilhelm ii did not address the question of the hague conference in his subsequent reply count witte told the french ambassador maurice paléologue that from russias point of view the war was madness slav solidarity was simply nonsense and russia could hope for nothing from the war on  july russia ordered general mobilisation but still maintained that it would not attack if peace talks were to begin germany reacting to the discovery of russian partial mobilisation ordered on  july announced its own premobilisation posture the imminent danger of war germany requested that russia must demobilise within the next twelve hours in saint petersburg at pm with the ultimatum to russia expired the german ambassador to russia met with the russian foreign minister sergey sazonov asked three times if russia would reconsider and then with shaking hands delivered the note accepting russias war challenge and declaring war on  august less than a week later on  august franz joseph i of austria signed the austro hungarian declaration of war on russia the outbreak of war on  august  found russia grossly unprepared russia and her allies placed their faith in her army the famous russian steamroller its prewar regular strength was  mobilisation added  reserves and millions more stood ready behind them in every other respect however russia was unprepared for war germany had ten times as much railway track per square mile and whereas russian soldiers travelled an average of  kilometres  mi to reach the front german soldiers travelled less than a quarter of that distance russian heavy industry was still too small to equip the massive armies the tsar could raise and her reserves of munitions were pitifully small while the german army in  was better equipped than any other manforman the russians were severely short on artillery pieces shells motorised transports and even boots with the baltic sea barred by german uboats and the dardanelles by the guns of germanys ally turkey russia initially could receive help only via archangel which was frozen solid in winter or via vladivostok which was over  kilometres  mi from the front line by  a rail line was built north from petrozavodsk to the kola gulf and this connection laid the foundation of the icefree port of what eventually was called murmansk the russian high command was moreover greatly weakened by the mutual contempt between vladimir sukhomlinov the minister of war and the redoubtable warrior giant grand duke nicholas nikolayevich who commanded the armies in the field in spite of all of this an immediate attack was ordered against the german province of east prussia the germans mobilised there with great efficiency and completely defeated the two russian armies which had invaded the battle of tannenberg where an entire russian army was annihilated cast an ominous shadow over the empires future the loyal officers lost were the very ones needed to protect the dynasty the russian armies had great success against both the austrohungarian armies and against the forces of the ottoman empire from the very beginning of the war but they never succeeded against the might of the german army in september  in order to relieve pressure on france the russians were forced to halt a successful offensive against austrohungary in galicia in order to attack germanheld silesia russian prisoners at the battle of tannenberg where the russian second army was annihilated by german forces gradually a war of attrition set in on the vast eastern front where the russians were facing the combined forces of the german and austrohungarian empires and they suffered staggering losses general denikin retreating from galicia wrote the german heavy artillery swept away whole lines of trenches and their defenders with them we hardly replied there was nothing with which we could reply our regiments although completely exhausted were beating off one attack after another by bayonet

bakeries factories private houses and country estates belonging to people with german names were looted and burnedcitation needed the inflamed mobs then turned on the government declaring the empress should be shut up in a convent the tsar deposed and rasputin hanged nicholas was by no means deaf to these discontents an emergency session of the duma was summoned and a special defense council established its members drawn from the duma and the tsars ministers in july  king christian x of denmark first cousin of the tsar sent hans niels andersen to tsarskoye selo with an offer to act as a mediator he made several trips between london berlin and petrograd and in july saw the dowager empress maria fyodorovna andersen told her they should conclude peace nicholas chose to turn down king christians offer of mediation as he felt it would be a betrayal for russia to form a separate peace treaty with the central powers when its allies britain and france were still fighting the energetic and efficient general alexei polivanov replaced sukhomlinov as minister of war which failed to improve the strategic situation in the aftermath of the great retreat and the loss of the kingdom of poland nicholas assumed the role of commanderinchief after dismissing his cousin nikolay nikolayevich in september  this was a mistake as the tsar came to be personally associated with the continuing losses at the front he was also away at the remote hq at mogilev far from the direct governance of the empire and when revolution broke out in petrograd he was unable to halt it in reality the move was largely symbolic since all important military decisions were made by his chiefofstaff general michael alexeiev and nicholas did little more than review troops inspect field hospitals and preside over military luncheons nicholas ii with his family in yevpatoria crimea may  the duma was still calling for political reforms and political unrest continued throughout the war cut off from public opinion nicholas could not see that the dynasty was tottering with nicholas at the front domestic issues and control of the capital were left with his wife alexandra however alexandras relationship with grigori rasputin and her german background further discredited the dynastys authority nicholas had been repeatedly warned about the destructive influence of rasputin but had failed to remove him rumors and accusations about alexandra and rasputin appeared one after another alexandra was even accused of harboring treasonous sympathies towards germany anger at nicholass failure to act and the extreme damage that rasputins influence was doing to russias war effort and to the monarchy led to rasputins eventual murder by a group of nobles led by prince felix yusupov and grand duke dmitri

the treasury and funding of the war due to the treasury now being deprived of alcohol taxes one of the last photographs of nicholas ii showing him at tsarskoye selo after his abdication in march  on  february  in petrograd a combination of very severe cold weather and acute food shortages caused people to start to break shop windows to get bread and other necessities in the streets red banners appeared and the crowds chanted down with the german woman down with protopopov down with the war down with the tsar police started to shoot at the populace from rooftops which incited riots the troops in the capital were poorly motivated and their officers had no reason to be loyal to the regime they were angry and full of revolutionary fervor and sided with the populace the tsars cabinet begged nicholas to return to the capital and offered to resign completely  kilometres  mi away the tsar misinformed by the minister of the interior alexander protopopov that the situation was under control ordered that firm steps be taken against the demonstrators for this task the petrograd garrison was quite unsuitable the cream of the old regular army had been destroyed in poland and galicia in petrograd  recruits country boys or older men from the workingclass suburbs of the capital itself remained to keep control under the command of wounded officers invalided from the front and cadets from the military academies the units in the capital although many bore the names of famous imperial guard regiments were in reality rear or reserve battalions of these regiments the regular units being away at the front many units lacking both officers and rifles had never undergone formal training general khabalov attempted to put the tsars instructions into effect on the morning of sunday  march  despite huge posters ordering people to keep off the streets vast crowds gathered and were only dispersed after some  had been shot dead though a company of the volinsky regiment fired into the air rather than into the mob and a company of the pavlovsky life guards shot the officer who gave the command to open fire nicholas informed of the situation by rodzianko ordered reinforcements to the capital and suspended the duma it was too late on  march the volinsky regiment mutinied and was quickly followed by the semenovsky the ismailovsky the litovsky and even the legendary preobrazhensky regiment of the imperial guard the oldest and staunchest regiment founded by peter the great the arsenal was pillaged the ministry of the interior military government building police headquarters the law courts and a score of police buildings were put to the torch by noon the fortress of peter and paul with its heavy artillery was in the hands of the insurgents by nightfall  soldiers had joined the revolution order broke down and members of the duma and the soviet formed a provisional government to try to restore order they issued a demand that nicholas must abdicate faced with this demand which was echoed by his generals deprived of loyal troops with his family firmly in the hands of the provisional government and fearful of unleashing civil war and opening the way for german conquest nicholas had little choice but to submit abdication edit at the end of the february revolution of  february in the old russian calendar on  march os   march ns  nicholas ii chose to abdicate he first abdicated in favour of alexei but a few hours later changed his mind after advice from doctors that the tsarevich would not live long separated from his parents who would be forced into exile nicholas thus abdicated on behalf of his son and drew up a new manifesto naming his brother grand duke michael as the next emperor of all the russias he issued the following statement which was suppressed by the provisional government in the days of the great struggle against the foreign enemies who for nearly three years have tried to enslave our fatherland the lord god has been pleased to send down on russia a new heavy trial internal popular disturbances threaten to have a disastrous effect on the future conduct of this persistent war the destiny of russia the honor of our heroic army the welfare of the people and the whole future of our dear fatherland demand that the war should be brought to a victorious conclusion whatever the cost the cruel enemy is making his last efforts and already the hour approaches when our glorious army together with our gallant allies will crush him in these decisive days in the life of russia we thought it our duty of conscience to facilitate for our people the closest union possible and a consolidation of all national forces for the speedy attainment of victory in agreement with the imperial duma we have thought it well to renounce the throne of the russian empire and to lay down the supreme power as we do not wish to part from our beloved son we transmit the succession to our brother the grand duke michael alexandrovich and give him our blessing to mount the throne of the russian empire we direct our brother to conduct the affairs of state in full and inviolable union with the representatives of the people in the legislative bodies on those principles which will be established by them and on which he will take an inviolable oath in the name of our dearly beloved homeland we call on our faithful sons of the fatherland to fulfill their sacred duty to the fatherland to obey the tsar in the heavy moment of national trials and to help him together with the representatives of the people to guide the russian empire on the road to victory welfare and glory may the lord god help russia grand duke michael declined to accept the throne until the people were allowed to vote through a constituent assembly for the continuance of the monarchy or a republic the abdication of nicholas ii and the subsequent bolshevik revolution brought three centuries of the romanov dynastys rule to an end the fall of autocratic tsardom brought joy to liberals and socialists in britain and france the united states of america was the first foreign government to recognise the provisional government in russia the announcement of the tsars abdication was greeted with many emotions these included delight relief fear anger and confusion it is debatable whether nicholass enforced abdication was actually legal and whether he had the right to abdicate on behalf of his son as nicholas had already abdicated he was therefore merely a subject of his son and only grand duke michael as regent had the right to change the succession some historians contend that nicholas remained the tsar at least in theory until his death imprisonmentedit the governors mansion in tobolsk where the romanov family was held in captivity between august  and april  nicholas desperately wanted to go into exile in the united kingdom following his abdication the british government reluctantly offered the family asylum in the uk on  march  although it was suggested that it would be better for the romanovs to go to a neutral country news of the offer provoked uproar from the labour party and many liberals and the british ambassador sir george buchanan advised the government that the extreme left would use the extsars presence as an excuse for rousing public opinion against us the offer of asylum was withdrawn in april following objections by king george v who acting on the advice of his secretary arthur bigge st baron stamfordham was worried that nicholass presence in the uk might provoke an uprising like the previous years easter rising in ireland the french government declined to accept the romanovs in view of increasing unrest on the western front and on the home front as a result of the ongoing war with germany the british ambassador in paris lord francis bertie advised the foreign secretary that the romanovs would be unwelcome in france as the exempress was regarded as progerman in the early summer of  after an improvement in the internal political situation in russia the russian government approached the uk government on the issue of asylum and was informed the offer had been withdrawn due to the considerations of british internal politics in august the kerensky government evacuated the romanovs to tobolsk in the urals as a winter refuge to protect them from the rising tide of revolution until the family could be sent abroad in the spring of  via japan there they lived in the former governors mansion in considerable comfort in october  however the bolsheviks seized power from kerenskys provisional government nicholas followed the events in october with interest but not yet with alarm boris soloviev the husband of maria rasputin was supposedly organizing rescue attempts with monarchical factions but none occurred rumors persist that soloviev was working for the bolsheviks or the germans or both nicholas continued to underestimate lenins importance in the meantime he and his family occupied themselves with keeping warm conditions of imprisonment became more strict and talk of putting nicholas on trial grew more frequent the tsar was forbidden to wear epaulettes on  march  the family was placed on soldiers rations which meant parting with ten devoted servants and giving up butter and coffee as luxuries nicholas and alexandra were appalled by news of the treaty of brestlitovsk whereby russia agreed to give up poland finland the baltic states the ukraine the crimea and most of the caucasus what kept the familys spirits up was the belief that help was at hand the romanovs believed that various plots were underway to break them out of captivity and smuggle them to safety the western allies lost interest in the fate of the romanovs after russia left the war the german government wanted the monarchy restored in russia to crush the bolsheviks and maintain good relations with the central powers but on  april  the romanovs were transferred to their final destination the town of yekaterinburg where they were imprisoned in the twostorey ipatiev house the home of the military engineer nikolay nikolayevich ipatiev which ominously became referred to as the house of special purpose russian imperial family between circa  and circa  executionedit see also execution of the romanov family there are several accounts of what happened and historians have not agreed on a solid confirmed scope of events according to the account of yurovsky the chief executioner in the early hours of  july  the royal family was awakened around  am got dressed and were led down into a halfbasement room at the back of the ipatiev house the pretext for this move was the familys safety ie that antibolshevik forces were approaching yekaterinburg and the house might be fired upon present with nicholas alexandra and their children were their doctor and three of their servants who had voluntarily chosen to remain with the family the tsars personal physician eugene botkin his wifes maid anna demidova and the familys chef ivan kharitonov and footman alexei trupp a firing squad had been assembled and was waiting in an adjoining room composed of seven communist soldiers from central europe and three local bolsheviks all under the command of bolshevik officer yakov yurovsky nicholas was carrying his son when the family arrived in the basement the former empress complained that there were no chairs for them to sit oncitation needed yurovsky ordered two chairs brought in and when the empress and the heir were seated the executioners filed into the room yurovsky announced to them that they had been condemned to death by the ural soviet of workers deputies a stunned nicholas asked what what and turned toward his family yurovsky quickly repeated the order and shot the former emperor outright the executioners drew handguns and the shooting began nicholas was the first to die yurovsky shot him several times in the chest sometimes incorrectly said to have been in his head but his skull bore no bullet wounds when it was discovered in  anastasia tatiana olga and maria survived the first hail of bullets the sisters were wearing over  kilograms of diamonds and precious gems sewn into their clothing which provided some initial protection from the bullets and bayonets they were stabbed with bayonets and then shot at close range in their heads an announcement from the presidium of the ural regional soviet of the workers and peasants government emphasized that conspiracies had been exposed to free the extsar that counterrevolutionary forces were pressing in on soviet russian territory and that the extsar was guilty of unforgivable crimes against the nation in view of the enemys proximity to yekaterinburg and the exposure by the cheka of a serious white guard plot with the goal of abducting the former tsar and his family… in light of the approach of counterrevolutionary bands toward the red capital of the urals and the possibility of the crowned executioner escaping trial by the people a plot among the white guards to try to abduct him and his family was exposed and the compromising documents will be published the presidium of the ural regional soviet fulfilling the will of the revolution resolved to shoot the former tsar nikolai romanov who is guilty of countless bloody violent acts against the russian people identificationedit yekaterinburgs church on the blood built on the spot where the ipatiev house once stood in  the bodies of tsar nicholas ii tsaritsa alexandra three of their daughters and those of four nonfamily members killed with them were discovered near sverdlovsk yekaterinburg by amateur archaeologist alexander avdonin in january  the remains excavated from underneath the dirt road near yekaterinburg were officially identified as those of nicholas ii and his family excluding one of his daughters and alexei the identifications including comparisons to a living relative were performed by separate russian british and american scientists using dna analysis concur and were found to be conclusive in july  an amateur historian discovered bones near yekaterinburg belonging to a boy and young woman prosecutors reopened the investigation into the deaths of the imperial familycitation needed and in april  dna tests performed by a us laboratory proved that bone fragments exhumed in the ural mountains belonged to two children of nicholas ii son alexei b  and daughter maria b  according to russian news agencies that same day it was announced by russian authorities that the remains of the entire family had been identified on  october  supreme court of russia ruled that nicholas ii and his family were victims of political persecution and should be rehabilitated in march  results of the dna testing were published confirming that the two bodies discovered in  were those of alexei and his sister maria funeraledit after the dna testing of  the remains of the emperor and his immediate family were interred at st peter and paul cathedral saint petersburg on  july  on the eightieth anniversary of their executions the ceremony was attended by then russian president boris yeltsin who said today is a historic day for russia for many years we kept quiet about this monstrous crime but the truth has to be spoken the british royal family was represented at the funeral by prince michael

tsar nicholas ii of russia tsarmartyr nicholas ii of russia royal passionbearer tsar nicholas ii of russia born  may  tsarskoye selo saint petersburg russian empire died  july  aged  yekaterinburg russian sfsr venerated in russian orthodox church canonized  and  by russian orthodox church abroad and the russian orthodox church major shrine church on blood ekaterinburg russia feast  july in  nicholas and his immediate family were recognised as martyred saints by the russian orthodox church outside russia on  august  they were recognised by the synod of the russian orthodox church this time they were not named as martyrs since their deaths did not result immediately from their christian faith instead they were canonised as passion bearers according to a statement by the moscow synod they were glorified as saints for the following reasons in the last orthodox russian monarch and members of his family we see people who sincerely strove to incarnate in their lives the commands of the gospel in the suffering borne by the royal family in prison with humility patience and meekness and in their martyrs deaths in yekaterinburg in the night of  july  was revealed the light of the faith of christ that conquers evil however nicholass canonisation was controversial the russian orthodox church abroad was split on the issue back in  some members suggesting that the emperor was a weak ruler and had failed to thwart the rise of the bolsheviks it was pointed out by one priest that martyrdom in the russian orthodox church has nothing to do with the martyrs personal actions but is instead related to why he or she was killed the russian orthodox church inside russia rejected the familys classification as martyrs because they were not killed on account of their religious faith religious leaders in both churches also had objections to canonising the tsars family because they perceived him as a weak emperor whose incompetence led to the revolution and the suffering of his people and made him partially responsible for his own murder and those of his wife children and servants for these opponents the fact that the tsar was in private life a kind man and a good husband and father or a leader who showed genuine concern for the peasantry did not override his poor governance of russia despite the original opposition the russian orthodox church inside russia ultimately recognised the family as passion bearers or people who met their deaths with christian humility the church does not however recognise the remains interred at peter and paul cathedral as being those of the imperial familycitation needed assessmentedit nicholas is generally considered to have been incompetent at the colossal task of ruling the enormous russian empire historian barbara tuchman gives a damning evaluation of his reign the russian empire was ruled from the top by a sovereign who had but one idea of government—to preserve intact the absolute monarchy bequeathed to him by his father—and who lacking the intellect energy or training for his job fell back on personal favorites whim simple mulishness and other devices of the emptyheaded autocrat his father alexander iii who deliberately intended to keep his son uneducated in statecraft until the age of thirty unfortunately miscalculated his own life expectancy and died when nicholas was twentysix the new tsar had learned nothing in the interval and the impression of imperturbability he conveyed was in reality apathy—the indifference of a mind so shallow as to be all surface when a telegram was brought to him announcing the annihilation of the russian fleet at tsushima he read it stuffed it in his pocket and went on playing tennis in russia nicholas ii faced widespread criticism after the victory of the revolution pavel bykov who in russia wrote the first full account about the downfall of the tsar denounced nicholas as a tyrant who paid with his life for the ageold repression and arbitrary rule of his ancestors over the russian people over the impoverished and bloodsoaked country sovietera historians noted that nicholas ii was not fit to be a statesman it has been argued that he had a weak will and was manipulated by adventurist forces his regime was condemned for extensive use of the army police and courts to destroy the revolutionary movement he was criticised for fanning nationalism and chauvinism with the punitive expeditions and courtsmartial during the  revolution the monarch became known as nicholas the bloody nicholass reign was seen as a time of suffering for russians robert k massie provides a more sympathetic view of the tsar  there still are those who for political or other reasons continue to insist that nicholas was bloody nicholas most commonly he is described as shallow weak stupid—a onedimensional figure presiding feebly over the last days of a corrupt and crumbling system this certainly is the prevailing public image of the last tsar historians admit that nicholas was a good man—the historical evidence of personal charm gentleness love of family deep religious faith and strong russian patriotism is too overwhelming to be denied—but they argue that personal factors are irrelevant what matters is that nicholas was a bad tsar  essentially the tragedy of nicholas ii was that he appeared in the wrong place in history ancestorsedit ancestors of

have been vastly exaggerated as emperor of all the russias and an autocrat the resources under his command were virtually incalculable however the vast majority of this was owned by the state as crown property the romanov familys personal wealth was only a small fraction of this as monarch the income of nicholas was  million gold roubles per annum this derived from a yearly allowance from the treasury and from the profits of crown farmland from this income he had to fund staff the upkeep of imperial palaces and imperial theatres annuities for the royal family pensions bequests and other outgoings before the end of the year the tsar was usually penniless sometimes he reached this embarrassing state by autumn according to the grand marshal of the court count paul benckendorff the familys total financial resources amounted to between  and  million roubles as a comparison prince felix yussupov estimated his familys worth in real estate holdings alone as amounting to  million

of greece as well as the united kingdoms queen alexandra consort of king edward vii nicholas his wife alexandra and wilhelm ii german emperor were all first cousins of king george v of the united kingdom nicholas was also a first cousin of both haakon vii of norway and maud of wales as well as king constantine i of greece nicholas and wilhelm ii were in turn second cousinsonceremoved as each descended from king frederick william iii of prussia as well as third cousins as they were both greatgreatgrandsons of tsar paul i of russia in addition to being second cousins through descent from louis ii grand duke of hesse and his wife princess wilhelmine of baden nicholas and alexandra were also third cousinsonceremoved as they were both descendants of king frederick william ii of prussia tsar nicholas ii was the first cousinonceremoved of grand duke nicholas nikolaevich to distinguish between them the grand duke was often known within the imperial family as nikolasha and nicholas the tall while the tsar was nicholas the short in his childhood nicholas his parents and siblings made annual visits to the danish royal palaces of fredensborg and bernstorff to visit his grandparents the king and queen the visits also served as family reunions as his mothers siblings would also come from the united kingdom germany and greece with their respective families it was there in  that he had a flirtation with one of his english first cousins princess victoria in  nicholas also accompanied his parents and younger brother twoyearold george on a twomonth semiofficial visit to england in london nicholas and his family stayed at marlborough house as guests of his uncle bertie and aunt alix the prince and princess of wales where he was spoiled by his uncle tsesarevichedit tsarevich nicholas in japan  on  march  following the assassination of his grandfather tsar alexander ii nicholas became heir apparent upon his fathers ascension as alexander iii nicholas and his other family members bore witness to alexander iis death having been present at the winter palace in saint petersburg where he was brought after the attack for security reasons the new tsar and his family relocated their primary residence to the gatchina palace outside the city only entering the capital for various ceremonial functions on such occasions alexander iii and his family occupied the nearby anichkov palace in  nicholass comingofage ceremony was held at the winter palace where he pledged his loyalty to his father later that year nicholass uncle grand duke sergei alexandrovich married princess elizabeth daughter of louis iv grand duke of hesse and his late wife princess alice of the united kingdom who had died in  and a granddaughter of queen victoria at the wedding in st petersburg the sixteenyearold tsarevich met with and admired the brides youngest surviving sister twelveyearold princess alix those feelings of admiration blossomed into love following her visit to st petersburg five years later in  alix had feelings for him in turn as a devout lutheran she was initially reluctant to convert to russian orthodoxy in order to marry nicholas but later relented eventually in  nicholas along with his younger brother george and their cousin prince george of greece set out on a world tour although grand duke george fell ill and was sent home partway through the trip nicholas visited egypt india singapore and bangkok receiving honors as a distinguished guest in each country in april  while traveling through the city of otsu japan nicholas was the victim of an assassination attempt the incident cut his trip short returning overland to st petersburg he was present at the ceremonies in vladivostok commemorating the beginning of work on the transsiberian railway in  nicholas traveled to london on behalf of his parents to be present at the wedding of his cousin george duke of york to mary of teck queen victoria was struck by the physical resemblance between the two cousins and their appearances confused some at the wedding during this time nicholas had an affair with st petersburg ballerina mathilde kschessinska despite being heirapparent to the throne however nicholass father failed to prepare him for his future role as tsar he attended meetings of the state council however as his father was only in his forties it was expected that it would be several years before nicholas would take the throne sergei witte russias finance minister saw things differently and suggested to the tsar that nicholas be appointed to the siberian railway committee alexander argued that nicholas was not mature enough to take on serious responsibilities to which witte replied that if he was not introduced to state affairs nicholas would never be ready to understand them alexanders assumptions about living a long life and having years to prepare nicholas for becoming tsar would be proven wrong as by  alexander iii was suffering from ill health engagement accession and marriageedit see also wedding of nicholas ii and alexandra feodorovna in april  nicholas joined his uncle sergei and aunt elizabeth on a journey to coburg germany for the wedding of elizabeths and alixs brother ernest louis grand duke of hesse to their mutual first cousin princess victoria melita of saxecoburg and gotha other guests included queen victoria wilhelm ii german emperor the victoria princess royal kaiser wilhelms mother and queen victorias eldest daughter nicholass uncle the prince of wales and the brides parents the duke and duchess of saxecoburg and gotha once in coburg nicholas proposed to alix but she rejected his proposal being reluctant to convert to orthodoxy but the kaiser later told her she had a duty to marry nicholas and to convert as her sister elizabeth had voluntarily done in  thus nicholas and alix became officially engaged on  april  nicholass parents initially hesitated to give the engagement their blessing as alix had made poor impressions during her visits to russia they gave their consent only when they saw tsar alexanders health deteriorating queen victoria also initially opposed to the match for though she had no objections against nicholas personally she evidently disliked russiacitation needed official engagement photograph of nicholas ii and alexandra april  that summer nicholas travelled to england to visit both alix and the queen the visit coincided with the birth of the duke and duchess of yorks first child the future king edward viii along with being present at the christening nicholas and alix were listed amongst the childs godparents after several weeks in england nicholas returned home for the wedding of his sister xenia to a cousin grand duke alexander mikhailovich sandro by that autumn alexander iii lay dying upon learning that he would live only a fortnight the tsar had nicholas summon alix to the imperial palace at livadia alix arrived on  october the tsar insisted on receiving her in full uniform from his deathbed he told his son to heed the advice of witte his most capable minister ten days later alexander iii died at the age of fortynine leaving twentysixyearold nicholas as emperor of russia that evening nicholas was consecrated by his fathers priest as tsar nicholas ii and the following day alix was received into the russian orthodox church taking the name alexandra feodorovna with the title of grand duchess and the style of imperial highness nicholas ii and family nicholas may have felt unprepared for the duties of the crown for he asked his cousin and brotherinlaw grand duke alexander what is going to happen to me and all of russia though perhaps underprepared and unskilled nicholas was not altogether untrained for his duties as tsar nicholas chose to maintain the conservative policies favoured by his father throughout his reign while alexander iii had concentrated on the formulation of general policy nicholas devoted much more attention to the details of administrationcitation needed leaving livadia on  november tsar alexanders funeral procession—which included nicholass paternal aunt queen olga of greece and the prince and princess of wales—arrived in moscow after lying in state in the kremlin the body of the tsar was taken to st petersburg where the funeral was held on  november tsar nicholas ii and empress alexandra with their first child  nicholas and alixs wedding was originally scheduled for the spring of  but it was moved forward at nicholass insistence staggering under the weight of his new office he had no intention of allowing the one person who gave him confidence to leave his side instead nicholass wedding to alix took place on  november  which was the birthday of the dowager empress marie feodorovna and court mourning could be slightly relaxed alexandra wore the traditional dress of romanov brides and nicholas a hussars uniform nicholas and alexandra each holding a lit candle faced the palace priest and were married a few minutes before one in the afternoon reignedit coronation by valentin serov nicholas iis imperial monogram silk imperial crown of russia  coronation gift to nicholas ii nicholas ii

russia shortly after he came to the throne a deputation of peasants and workers from various towns local assemblies zemstvos came to the winter palace proposing court reforms such as the adoption of a constitutional monarchy and reform that would improve the political and economic life of the peasantry in the tver address although the addresses they had sent in beforehand were couched in mild and loyal terms nicholas was angry and ignored advice from an imperial family council by saying to them  it has come to my knowledge that during the last months there have been heard in some assemblies of the zemstvos the voices of those who have indulged in a senseless dream that the zemstvos be called upon to participate in the government of the country i want everyone to know that i will devote all my strength to maintain for the good of the whole nation the principle of absolute autocracy as firmly and as strongly as did my late lamented father on  may  nicholass formal coronation as tsar was held in uspensky cathedral located within the kremlin the silk imperial crown of russia was used as an official coronation gift of the russian empire nicholas ii was the first and only monarch to be presented with such a monumental coronation gift it was not intended as ceremonial regalia but as private imperial property a memento to his coronation in celebration on  may  a large festival with food free beer and souvenir cups was held in khodynka field outside moscow khodynka was chosen as the location as it was the only place near moscow large enough to hold all of the moscow citizens khodynka was primarily used as a military training ground and the field was uneven with trenches before the food and drink was handed out rumours spread that there would not be enough for everyone as a result the crowd rushed to get their share and individuals were tripped and trampled upon suffocating in the dirt of the field of the approximate  in attendance it is estimated that  individuals died and roughly  were injured the khodynka tragedy was seen as an ill omen and nicholas found gaining popular trust difficult from the beginning of his reign the french ambassadors gala was planned for that night the tsar wanted to stay in his chambers and pray for the lives lost but his uncles believed that his absence at the ball would strain relations with france particularly the  francorussian alliance thus nicholas attended the party as a result the mourning populace saw nicholas as frivolous and uncaring during the autumn after the coronation nicholas and alexandra made a tour of europe after making visits to the emperor and empress of austriahungary the kaiser of germany and nicholass danish grandparents and relatives nicholas and alexandra took possession of their new yacht the standart which had been built in denmark from there they made a journey to scotland to spend some time with queen victoria at balmoral castle while alexandra enjoyed her reunion with her grandmother nicholas complained in a letter to his mother about being forced to go shooting with his uncle the prince of wales in bad weather and was suffering from a bad toothache the first years of his reign saw little more than continuation and development of the policy pursued by alexander iii nicholas allotted money for the allrussia exhibition of  in  restoration of gold standard by sergei witte minister of finance completed the series of financial reforms initiated fifteen years earlier by  the transsiberian railway was nearing completion this helped the russians trade in the far east but the railway still required huge amounts of work initiatives in foreign affairsedit in foreign relations nicholas followed the policies of his father strengthening the francorussian alliance and pursuing a policy of general european pacification which culminated in the famous hague peace conference this conference suggested and promoted by nicholas ii was convened with the view of terminating the arms race and setting up machinery for the peaceful settlement of international disputes the results of the conference were less than expected due to the mutual distrust existing between great powers nevertheless the hague conventions were among the first formal statements of the laws of war in  nicholas ii and the famous russian diplomat friedrich martens were nominated for the nobel peace prize—for the initiative to convene the hague peace conference and contributing to its implementation ecclesiastical affairsedit in  nicholas threw himself into an ecclesiastical crisis regarding the canonisation of seraphim of sarov the previous year it had been suggested that if he were canonised the imperial couple would beget a son and heir to throne while alexandra demanded in july  that seraphim be canonised in less than a week nicholas demanded that he be canonised within a year despite a public outcry the church bowed to the intense imperial pressure declaring seraphim worthy of canonisation in january  that summer the imperial family travelled to sarov for the canonisation russojapanese waredit main article russojapanese war the russian baltic fleet was annihilated by the japanese at the battle of tsushima a clash between russia and the empire of japan was almost inevitable by the turn of the th century russia had expanded in the far east and the growth of its settlement and territorial ambitions as its southward path to the balkans was frustrated conflicted with japans own territorial ambitions on the chinese and asian mainland nicholas pursued an aggressive foreign policy with regards to manchuria and korea and strongly supported the scheme for timber concessions in these areas as developed by the bezobazov group war began in february  with a preemptive japanese attack on the russian fleet in port arthur prior to a formal declaration of war with the russian far east fleet trapped at port arthur the only other russian fleet was the baltic fleet it was half a world away but the decision was made to send the fleet on a ninemonth voyage to the east the united kingdom would not allow the russian navy to use the suez canal due to its alliance with the empire of japan and due to the dogger bank incident where the baltic fleet mistakenly fired on british fishing boats in the north sea the russian baltic fleet traversed the world to lift the blockade on port arthur but after many misadventures on the way was nearly annihilated by the japanese in the battle of the tsushima strait on land the imperial russian army experienced logistical problems while commands and supplies came from st petersburg combat took place in east asian ports with only the transsiberian railway for transport of supplies as well as troops both ways the kilometre  mi rail line between st petersburg and port arthur was singletrack with no track around lake baikal allowing only gradual buildup of the forces on the front besieged port arthur fell to the japanese after nine months of resistance nicholass stance on the war was something that baffled many he approached the war with confidence and saw it as an opportunity to raise russian morale and patriotism paying little attention to the financial repercussions of a longdistance war shortly before the japanese attack on port arthur nicholas held firm to the belief that there would be no war despite the onset of the war and the many defeats russia suffered nicholas still believed in and expected a final victory maintaining an image of the racial inferiority and military weakness of the japanese as russia faced imminent defeat by the japanese the call for peace grew nicholass own mother as well as his cousin emperor wilhelm ii urged nicholas to open peace negotiations despite the efforts for peace nicholas remained evasive sending a telegram to the kaiser on  october that it was his intent to keep on fighting until the japanese were driven from manchuria it was not until – may  and the annihilation of the russian fleet by the japanese that nicholas finally decided to sue for peacecitation needed nicholas ii accepted american mediation appointing sergei witte chief plenipotentiary for the peace talks the war was ended by the signing of the treaty of portsmouth antijewish pogroms of –edit main article antijewish pogroms in the russian empire the kishinev newspaper bessarabets which published antisemitic materials received funds from viacheslav plehve minister of the interior these publications served to fuel the kishinev pogrom rioting the government of nicholas ii formally condemned the rioting and dismissed the regional governor with the perpetrators arrested and punished by the court leadership of the russian orthodox church also condemned antisemitic pogroms appeals to the faithful condemning the pogroms were read publicly in all churches of russia in private nicholas expressed his admiration for the mobs viewing antisemitism as a useful tool for unifying the people behind his regime however in  he approved of government efforts to prevent antisemitic pogroms following the assassination of pyotr stolypin by the jewish revolutionary dmitry bogrov bloody sunday edit main article bloody sunday  play media tsar nicholas of russia mounts his horse  unknown cinematographer of the edison manufacturing company a few days prior to bloody sunday   january  the priest and labor leader georgy gapon informed the government of the forthcoming procession to the winter palace to hand a workers petition to the tsar on saturday   january the ministers convened to consider the situation there was never any thought that the tsar who had left the capital for tsarskoye selo on the advice of the ministers would actually meet gapon the suggestion that some other member of the imperial family receive the petition was rejected finally informed by the prefect of police that he lacked the men to pluck gapon from among his followers and place him under arrest the newly appointed minister of the interior prince sviatopolkmirsky and his colleagues decided to bring additional troops to reinforce the city that evening nicholas wrote in his diary troops have been brought from the outskirts to reinforce the garrison up to now the workers have been calm their number is estimated at  at the head of their union is a kind of socialist priest named gapon mirsky came this evening to present his report on the measures taken on sunday   january  gapon began his march locking arms the workers marched peacefully through the streets some carried religious icons and banners as well as national flags and portraits of the tsar as they walked they sang hymns and the imperial anthem god save the tsar at  pm all of the converging processions were scheduled to arrive at the winter palace there was no single confrontation with the troops throughout the city at bridges on strategic boulevards the marchers found their way blocked by lines of infantry backed by cossacks and hussars and the soldiers opened fire on the crowd the official number of victims was  dead and several hundred wounded gapon vanished and the other leaders of the march were seized expelled from the capital they circulated through the empire increasing the casualties as bullets riddled their icons their banners and their portraits of nicholas the people shrieked the tsar will not help us outside russia the future british labour prime minister ramsay macdonald attacked the tsar calling him a bloodstained creature and a common murderer that evening nicholas wrote in his diary difficult day in st petersburg there were serious disturbances due to the desire of workers to get to the winter palace the troops had to shoot in different places of the city there were many dead and wounded lord how painful and bad grand duchess olga alexandrovna nicholass sister wrote afterwards nicky had the police report a few days before that saturday he telephoned my mother at the anitchkov and said that she and i were to leave for gatchina at once he and alicky went to tsarskoye selo insofar as i remember my uncles vladimir and nicholas were the only members of the family left in st petersburg but there may have been others i felt at the time that all those arrangements were hideously wrong nickys ministers and the chief of police had it all their way my mother and i wanted him to stay in st petersburg and to face the crowd i am positive that for all the ugly mood of some of the workmen nickys appearance would have calmed them they would have presented their petition and gone back to their homes but that wretched epiphany incident had left all the senior officials in a state of panic they kept on telling nicky that he had no right to run such a risk that he owed it to the country to leave the capital that even with the utmost precautions taken there might always be some loophole left my mother and i did all we could to persuade him that the ministers advice was wrong but nicky preferred to follow it and he was the first to repent when he heard of the tragic outcome from his hiding place gapon issued a letter stating nicholas romanov formerly tsar and at present soulmurderer of the russian empire the innocent blood of workers their wives and children lies forever between you and the russian people

with vague promises in hopes of cutting short the rebellion many demonstrators were shot on bloody sunday  as they tried to march to the winter palace in st petersburg dmitri feodorovich trepov was ordered to take drastic measures to stop the revolutionary activity grand duke sergei was killed in february by a revolutionarys bomb in moscow as he left the kremlin on  march the tsar condemned the revolutionaries meanwhile witte recommended that a manifesto be issued schemes of reform would be elaborated by goremykin and a committee consisting of elected representatives of the zemstvos and municipal councils under the presidency of witte in june the battleship potemkin part of the black sea fleet mutinied around augustseptember after his diplomatic success on ending the russojapanese war witte wrote to the tsar stressing the urgent need for political reforms at home the tsar remained quiet impassive and indulgent he spent most of that autumn hunting with the defeat of russia by a nonwestern power the prestige and authority of the autocratic regime fell significantly tsar nicholas ii taken by surprise by the events reacted with anger and bewilderment he wrote to his mother after months of disorder it makes me sick to read the news nothing but strikes in schools and factories murdered policemen cossacks and soldiers riots disorder mutinies but the ministers instead of acting with quick decision only assemble in council like a lot of frightened hens and cackle about providing united ministerial action ominous quiet days began quiet indeed because there was complete order in the streets but at the same time everybody knew that something was going to happen — the troops were waiting for the signal but the other side would not begin one had the same feeling as before a thunderstorm in summer everybody was on edge and extremely nervous and of course that sort of strain could not go on for long we are in the midst of a revolution with an administrative apparatus entirely disorganized and in this lies the main danger in october a railway strike developed into a general strike which paralysed the country in a city without electricity witte told nicholas ii that the country was at the verge of a cataclysmic revolution according to orlando figes the tsar asked his uncle grand duke nicholas to assume the role of dictator but the grand duke  took out a revolver and threatened to shoot himself there and then if the tsar refused to endorse wittes memorandum nicholas ii had no choice but to make a number of steps in the constitutional liberal direction the tsar accepted the draft hurriedly outlined by aleksei d obolensky the emperor and autocrat of all the russias was forced to sign the october manifesto to agree with the establishment of the imperial duma and give up part of his unlimited autocracy for the next six months witte was the prime minister according to harold williams that government was almost paralyzed from the beginning on  october os the tsar appointed trepov master of the palace without consulting witte and had daily contact with the emperor his influence at court was paramount on  november  os princess milica of montenegro presented grigori rasputin to tsar nicholas and his wife at peterhof palace relationship with the dumaedit one ruble silver coin of emperor nicholas ii dated  with the imperial coatofarms on the reverse the russian inscription reads bozheyu milostyu nikolay imperator i samoderzhets vseya rossiiiyskiy the english translation is by the grace of god nicholas ii emperor and autocrat of all the russias under pressure from the attempted  russian revolution on  august of that year nicholas ii issued a manifesto about the convocation of the state duma known as the bulygin duma initially thought to be an advisory organ in the october manifesto the tsar pledged to introduce basic civil liberties provide for broad participation in the state duma and endow the duma with legislative and oversight powers he was determined however to preserve his autocracy even in the context of reform this was signalled in the text of the  constitution he was described as the supreme autocrat and retained sweeping executive powers also in church affairs his cabinet ministers were not allowed to interfere or assist each other they were responsible only to him nicholass relations with the duma were poor the first duma with a majority of kadets almost immediately came into conflict with him scarcely had the  members sat down at the tauride palace when they formulated an address to the throne it demanded universal suffrage radical land reform the release of all political prisoners and the dismissal of ministers appointed by the tsar in favour of ministers acceptable to the duma grand duchess olga alexandrovna the younger sister of nicholas ii wrote there was such gloom at tsarskoye selo i did not understand anything about politics i just felt everything was going wrong with the country and all of us the october constitution did not seem to satisfy anyone i went with my mother to the first duma i remember the large group of deputies from among peasants and factory people the peasants looked sullen but the workmen were worse they looked as though they hated us i remember the distress in alickys eyes minister of the court count vladimir frederiks commented the deputies they give one the impression of a gang of criminals who are only waiting for the signal to throw themselves upon the ministers and cut their throats i will never again set foot among those people the dowager empress noticed incomprehensible hatred although nicholas initially had a good relationship with his prime minister sergei witte alexandra distrusted him as he had instigated an investigation of grigori rasputin and as the political situation deteriorated nicholas dissolved the duma the duma was populated with radicals many of whom wished to push through legislation that would abolish private property ownership among other things witte unable to grasp the seemingly insurmountable problems of reforming russia and the monarchy wrote to nicholas on  april  resigning his office however other accounts have said that witte was forced to resign by the emperor nicholas was not ungracious to witte and an imperial rescript was published on  april creating witte a knight of the order of saint alexander nevsky with diamonds the last two words were written in the emperors own hand followed by i remain unalterably welldisposed to you and sincerely grateful for ever more nicholas a second duma met for the first time in february  the leftist parties—including the social democrats and the social revolutionaries who had boycotted the first duma—had won  seats in the second more than a third of the membership again nicholas waited impatiently to rid himself of the duma in two letters to his mother he let his bitterness flow a grotesque deputation is coming from england to see liberal members of the duma uncle bertie informed us that they were very sorry but were unable to take action to stop their coming their famous liberty of course how angry they would be if a deputation went from us to the irish to wish them success in their struggle against their government a little while later nicholas wrote all would be well if everything said in the duma remained within its walls every word spoken however comes out in the next days papers which are avidly read by everyone in many places the populace is getting restive again they begin to talk about land once more and are waiting to see what the duma is going to say on the question i am getting telegrams from everywhere petitioning me to order a dissolution but it is too early for that one has to let them do something manifestly stupid or mean and then — slap and they are gone nicholas ii stolypin and jewish delegation during the tsars visit to kiev in  after the second duma resulted in similar problems the new prime minister pyotr stolypin whom witte described as reactionary unilaterally dissolved it and changed the electoral laws to allow for future dumas to have a more conservative content and to be dominated by the liberalconservative octobrist party of alexander guchkov stolypin a skilful politician had ambitious plans for reform these included making loans available to the lower classes to enable them to buy land with the intent of forming a farming class loyal to the crown nevertheless when the duma remained hostile stolypin had no qualms about invoking article  of the fundamental laws which empowered the tsar to issue urgent and extraordinary emergency decrees during the recess of the state duma stolypins most famous legislative act the change in peasant land tenure was promulgated under article  the third duma remained an independent body this time the members proceeded cautiously instead of hurling themselves at the government opposing parties within the duma worked to develop the body as a whole in the classic manner of the british parliament the duma reached for power grasping for the national purse strings the duma had the right to question ministers behind closed doors as to their proposed expenditures these sessions endorsed by stolypin were educational for both sides and in time mutual antagonism was replaced by mutual respect even the sensitive area of military expenditure where the october manifesto clearly had reserved decisions to the throne a duma commission began to operate composed of aggressive patriots no less anxious than nicholas to restore the fallen honour of russian arms the duma commission frequently recommended expenditures even larger than those proposed with the passage of time nicholas also began to have confidence in the duma this duma cannot be reproached with an attempt to seize power and there is no need at all to quarrel with it he said to stolypin in  unfortunately stolypins plans were undercut by conservatives at court reactionaries such as prince vladimir nikolayevich orlov never tired of telling the tsar that the very existence of the duma was a blot on the autocracy which tsaritsa alexandra had always believed anyway stolypin they whispered was a traitor and secret revolutionary who was conniving with the duma to steal the prerogatives assigned the tsar by god witte also engaged in constant intrigue against stolypin although stolypin had had nothing to do with wittes fall witte blamed him stolypin had unwittingly angered the tsaritsa he had ordered an investigation into rasputin and presented it to the tsar who read it but did nothing stolypin on his own authority ordered rasputin to leave st petersburg alexandra protested vehemently but nicholas refused to overrule his prime minister who had more influence with the emperor by the time of stolypins assassination by dmitry bogrov a student and police informant in a theatre in kiev on  september  stolypin had grown weary of the burdens of office for a man who preferred clear decisive action working with a sovereign who believed in fatalism and mysticism was frustrating as an example nicholas once returned a document unsigned with the note despite most convincing arguments in favour of adopting a positive decision in this matter an inner voice keeps on insisting more and more that i do not accept responsibility for it so far my conscience has not deceived me therefore i intend in this case to follow its dictates i know that you too believe that a tsars heart is in gods hands let it be so for all laws established by me i bear a great responsibility before god and i am ready to answer for my decision at any time alexandra believing that stolypin had severed the bonds that her son depended on for life hated the prime minister in march  in a fit of anger stating that he no longer commanded the imperial confidence stolypin asked to be relieved of his office two years earlier when stolypin had casually mentioned resigning to nicholas he was informed this is not a question of confidence or lack of it it is my will remember that we live in russia not abroadand therefore i shall not consider the possibility of any resignation it never got that far on  september  in a procession where stolypins car was unprotected rasputin had coincidentally returned from his exile as stolypins car passed him rasputin cried out in a loud voice death is after him death is driving behind him bogrov would later assassinate stolypin in the kiev theatre that night in  a fourth duma was elected with almost the same membership as the third the duma started too fast now it is slower but better and more lasting stated nicholas to sir bernard pares the first world war developed badly for russia by late  romanov family desperation reached the point that grand duke paul alexandrovich younger brother of alexander iii and the tsars only surviving uncle was deputed to beg nicholas to grant a constitution and a government responsible to the duma nicholas sternly and adamantly refused reproaching his uncle for asking him to break his coronation oath to maintain autocratic power for his successors in the duma on  december  vladimir purishkevich a fervent patriot monarchist and war worker denounced the dark forces which surrounded the throne in a thunderous twohour speech which was tumultuously applauded revolution threatens he warned and an obscure peasant shall govern russia no longer tsarevich alexeis illness and rasputinedit tsarevich alexei nikolaevich c  grigori rasputin further complicating domestic matters was the matter of the succession alexandra bore nicholas four daughters the grand duchess olga in  the grand duchess tatiana in  grand duchess maria in  and grand duchess anastasia in  before their son alexei was born on  august  the young heir was afflicted with haemophilia b a hereditary disease that prevents blood from clotting properly which at that time was untreatable and usually led to an untimely death as a granddaughter of queen victoria alexandra carried the same gene mutation that afflicted several of the major european royal houses such as prussia and spain hemophilia therefore became known as the royal disease through alexandra the disease had passed on to her son as all of nicholas and alexandras daughters perished with their parents and brother in yekaterinburg in  it is not known whether any of them inherited the gene as carriers because of the fragility of the autocracy at this time nicholas and alexandra chose not to divulge alexeis condition to anyone outside the imperial household in fact there were many in the household who were unaware of the exact nature of the tsarevichs illness at first alexandra turned to russian doctors and medics to treat alexei however their treatments generally failed and alexandra increasingly turned to mystics and holy men or starets as they were called in russian one of these starets an illiterate siberian named grigori rasputin appeared to have some success rasputins influence over empress alexandra and consequently the tsar himself had grown stronger ever since  when the tsarevich nearly died from an injury while the family was on vacation at the hunting lodges at białowieża and spała poland the bleeding grew steadily worse until it was assumed that the tsarevich would not survive and the last sacrament was administered on  october  in desperation alexandra called upon rasputin as a last resort to which he replied god has seen your tears and heard your prayers do not grieve the little one will not die do not allow the doctors to bother him too much the haemorrhage stopped the very next day and the boy began to recover alexandra took this as a sign that rasputin was a starets and that god was with him for the rest of her life she would fervently defend him and turn her wrath against anyone who dared to question him european affairsedit nicholas ii and his son alexei aboard the imperial yacht standart during king edward viis state visit to russia in tallin  in  to counter perceived german aggression russia and great britain signed the anglorussian convention great britain had already entered into the entente cordiale with france in  and the anglorussian convention led to the formation of the triple entente the following year in may  nicholas and alexandras shared uncle bertie and aunt alix britains king edward vii and queen alexandra made a state visit to russia being the first reigning british monarchs to do so however they did not set foot on russian soil instead they stayed aboard their yachts meeting off the coast of modernday tallinn later that year nicholas was taken off guard by the news that his foreign minister alexander izvolsky had entered into a secret agreement with the austrohungarian foreign minister count alois von aehrenthal agreeing that in exchange for russian naval access to the dardanelles and the bosporus strait russia would not oppose the austrian annexation of bosnia and herzegovina a revision of the  treaty of berlin when austriahungary did annex this territory that october it precipitated the diplomatic crisis when russia protested about the annexation the austrians threatened to leak secret communications between izvolsky and aehernthal prompting nicholas to complain in a letter to the austrian emperor franz joseph about a breach of confidence in  in the wake of the anglorussian convention the russian imperial family made a visit to england staying on the isle of wight for cowes week in  during the balkan wars nicholas personally offered to arbitrate between serbia and bulgaria however the bulgarians rejected his offer also in  nicholas albeit without

volga river that was made by the teenage michael romanov from the ipatiev monastery in kostroma to moscow in  when he finally agreed to become tsar first world waredit on  june  archduke franz ferdinand of austria heir to the austrohungarian throne was assassinated by gavrilo princip in sarajevo nicholas vacillated as to russias course of action the outbreak of war was not inevitable but leaders diplomats and nineteenthcentury alliances created a climate for largescale conflict the concept of panslavism and shared ethnicity created strong public sympathy between russia and serbia territorial conflict created rivalries between germany and france and between austria and serbia and as a consequence alliance networks developed across europe the triple entente and triple alliance networks were set before the war nicholas wanted neither to abandon serbia to the ultimatum of austriahungary nor to provoke a general war in a series of letters exchanged with kaiser wilhelm of germany the socalled willy and nicky correspondence the two proclaimed their desire for peace and each attempted to get the other to back down nicholas desired that russias mobilization be only against the austrian border in the hopes of preventing war with the german empire nicholas ii right with kaiser wilhelm ii of germany in  nicholas is wearing a german army uniform while wilhelm wears that of a russian hussar regiment on  july  the council of ministers was held in krasnoye selo at which tsar nicholas ii decided to intervene in the austroserbian conflict a step toward general war he put the russian army on alert on  july although this was not general mobilization it threatened the german and austrian borders and looked like military preparation for war however his army had no contingency plans for a partial mobilization and on  july  nicholas took the fateful step of confirming the order for general mobilization despite being strongly counselled against it on  july austriahungary formally declared war against serbia on  july  nicholas ii sent a telegram to wilhelm ii the willynicky correspondence with the suggestion to submit the austroserbian problem to the hague conference in hague tribunal wilhelm ii did not address the question of the hague conference in his subsequent reply count witte told the french ambassador maurice paléologue that from russias point of view the war was madness slav solidarity was simply nonsense and russia could hope for nothing from the war on  july russia ordered general mobilisation but still maintained that it would not attack if peace talks were to begin germany reacting to the discovery of russian partial mobilisation ordered on  july announced its own premobilisation posture the imminent danger of war germany requested that russia must demobilise within the next twelve hours in saint petersburg at pm with the ultimatum to russia expired the german ambassador to russia met with the russian foreign minister sergey sazonov asked three times if russia would reconsider and then with shaking hands delivered the note accepting russias war challenge and declaring war on  august less than a week later on  august franz joseph i of austria signed the austro hungarian declaration of war on russia the outbreak of war on  august  found russia grossly unprepared russia and her allies placed their faith in her army the famous russian steamroller its prewar regular strength was  mobilisation added  reserves and millions more stood ready behind them in every other respect however russia was unprepared for war germany had ten times as much railway track per square mile and whereas russian soldiers travelled an average of  kilometres  mi to reach the front german soldiers travelled less than a quarter of that distance russian heavy industry was still too small to equip the massive armies the tsar could raise and her reserves of munitions were pitifully small while the german army in  was better equipped than any other manforman the russians were severely short on artillery pieces shells motorised transports and even boots with the baltic sea barred by german uboats and the dardanelles by the guns of germanys ally turkey russia initially could receive help only via archangel which was frozen solid in winter or via vladivostok which was over  kilometres  mi from the front line by  a rail line was built north from petrozavodsk to the kola gulf and this connection laid the foundation of the icefree port of what eventually was called murmansk the russian high command was moreover greatly weakened by the mutual contempt between vladimir sukhomlinov the minister of war and the redoubtable warrior giant grand duke nicholas nikolayevich who commanded the armies in the field in spite of all of this an immediate attack was ordered against the german province of east prussia the germans mobilised there with great efficiency and completely defeated the two russian armies which had invaded the battle of tannenberg where an entire russian army was annihilated cast an ominous shadow over the empires future the loyal officers lost were the very ones needed to protect the dynasty the russian armies had great success against both the austrohungarian armies and against the forces of the ottoman empire from the very beginning of the war but they never succeeded against the might of the german army in september  in order to relieve pressure on france the russians were forced to halt a successful offensive against austrohungary in galicia in order to attack germanheld silesia russian prisoners at the battle of tannenberg where the russian second army was annihilated by german forces gradually a war of attrition set in on the vast eastern front where the russians were facing the combined forces of the german and austrohungarian empires and they suffered staggering losses general denikin retreating from galicia wrote the german heavy artillery swept away whole lines of trenches and their defenders with them we hardly replied there was nothing with which we could reply our regiments although completely exhausted were beating off one attack after another by bayonet  blood flowed unendingly the ranks became thinner and thinner and thinner the number of graves multiplied total losses for the spring and summer of  amounted to  killed or wounded while  had been taken prisonercitation needed on  august with the russian army in retreat warsaw fell defeat at the front bred disorder at home at first the targets were german and for three days in june shops bakeries factories private houses and country estates belonging to people with german names were looted and burnedcitation needed the inflamed mobs then turned on the government declaring the empress should be shut up in a convent the tsar deposed and rasputin hanged nicholas was by no means deaf to these discontents an emergency session of the duma was summoned and a special defense council established its members drawn from the duma and the tsars ministers in july  king christian x of denmark first cousin of the tsar sent hans niels andersen to tsarskoye selo with an offer to act as a mediator he made several trips between london berlin and petrograd and in july saw the dowager empress maria fyodorovna andersen told her they should conclude peace nicholas chose to turn down king christians offer of mediation as he felt it would be a betrayal for russia to form a separate peace treaty with the central powers when its allies britain and france were still fighting the energetic and efficient general alexei polivanov replaced sukhomlinov as minister of war which failed to improve the strategic situation in the aftermath of the great retreat and the loss of the kingdom of poland nicholas assumed the role of commanderinchief after dismissing his cousin nikolay nikolayevich in september  this was a mistake as the tsar came to be personally associated with the continuing losses at the front he was also away at the remote hq at mogilev far from the direct governance of the empire and when revolution broke out in petrograd he was unable to halt it in reality the move was largely symbolic since all important military decisions were made by his chiefofstaff general michael alexeiev and nicholas did little more than review troops inspect field hospitals and preside over military luncheons nicholas ii with his family in yevpatoria crimea may  the duma was still calling for political reforms and political unrest continued throughout the war cut off from public opinion nicholas could not see that the dynasty was tottering with nicholas at the front domestic issues and control of the capital were left with his wife alexandra however alexandras relationship with grigori rasputin and her german background further discredited the dynastys authority nicholas had been repeatedly warned about the destructive influence of rasputin but had failed to remove him rumors and accusations about alexandra and rasputin appeared one after another alexandra was even accused of harboring treasonous sympathies towards germany anger at nicholass failure to act and the extreme damage that rasputins influence was doing to russias war effort and to the monarchy led to rasputins eventual murder by a group of nobles led by prince felix yusupov and grand duke dmitri pavlovich a cousin of the tsar in the early morning of saturday  december  os   december  ns collapseedit as the government failed to produce supplies mounting hardship created massive riots and rebellions with nicholas away at the front from  through  authority appeared to collapse and the capital was left in the hands of strikers and mutineering conscript soldiers despite efforts by the british ambassador sir george buchanan to warn the tsar that he should grant constitutional reforms to fend off revolution nicholas continued to bury himself away at the staff hq stavka  kilometres

russia began the war with  locomotives by   were in service while the number of serviceable railway wagons had dwindled from half a million to  in february   locomotives burst their boilers and nearly  wagons were immobilised in petrograd supplies of flour and fuel had all but disappeared wartime prohibition of alcohol was enacted by nicholas to boost patriotism and productivity but instead damaged the treasury and funding of the war due to the treasury now being deprived of alcohol taxes one of the last photographs of nicholas ii showing him at tsarskoye selo after his abdication in march  on  february  in petrograd a combination of very severe cold weather and acute food shortages caused people to start to break shop windows to get bread and other necessities in the streets red banners appeared and the crowds chanted down with the german woman down with protopopov down with the war down with the tsar police started to shoot at the populace from rooftops which incited riots the troops in the capital were poorly motivated and their officers had no reason to be loyal to the regime they were angry and full of revolutionary fervor and sided with the populace the tsars cabinet begged nicholas to return to the capital and offered to resign completely  kilometres  mi away the tsar misinformed by the minister of the interior alexander protopopov that the situation was under control ordered that firm steps be taken against the demonstrators for this task the petrograd garrison was quite unsuitable the cream of the old regular army had been destroyed in poland and galicia in petrograd  recruits country boys or older men from the workingclass suburbs of the capital itself remained to keep control under the command of wounded officers invalided from the front and cadets from the military academies the units in the capital although many bore the names of famous imperial guard regiments were in reality rear or reserve battalions of these regiments the regular units being away at the front many units lacking both officers and rifles had never undergone formal training general khabalov attempted to put the tsars instructions into effect on the morning of sunday  march  despite huge posters ordering people to keep off the streets vast crowds gathered and were only dispersed after some  had been shot dead though a company of the volinsky regiment fired into the air rather than into the mob and a company of the pavlovsky life guards shot the officer who gave the command to open fire nicholas informed of the situation by rodzianko ordered reinforcements to the capital and suspended the duma it was too late on  march the volinsky regiment mutinied and was quickly followed by the semenovsky the ismailovsky the litovsky and even the legendary preobrazhensky regiment of the imperial guard the oldest and staunchest regiment founded by peter the great the arsenal was pillaged the ministry of the interior military government building police headquarters the law courts and a score of police buildings were put to the torch by noon the fortress of peter and paul with its heavy artillery was in the hands of the insurgents by nightfall  soldiers had joined the revolution order broke down and members of the duma and the soviet formed a provisional government to try to restore order they issued a demand that nicholas must abdicate faced with this demand which was echoed by his generals deprived of loyal troops with his family firmly in the hands of the provisional government and fearful of unleashing civil war and opening the way for german conquest nicholas had little choice but to submit abdication edit at the end of the february revolution of  february in the old russian calendar on  march os   march ns  nicholas ii chose to abdicate he first abdicated in favour of alexei but a few hours later changed his mind after advice from doctors that the tsarevich would not live long separated from his parents who would be forced into exile nicholas thus abdicated on behalf of his son and drew up a new manifesto naming his brother grand duke michael as the next emperor of all the russias he issued the following statement which was suppressed by the provisional government in the days of the great struggle against the foreign enemies who for nearly three years have tried to enslave our fatherland the lord god has been pleased to send down on russia a new heavy trial internal popular disturbances threaten to have a disastrous effect on the future conduct of this persistent war the destiny of russia the honor of our heroic army the welfare of the people and the whole future of our dear fatherland demand that the war should be brought to a victorious conclusion whatever the cost the cruel enemy is making his last efforts and already the hour approaches when our glorious army together with our gallant allies will crush him in these decisive days in the life of russia we thought it our duty of conscience to facilitate for our people the closest union possible and a consolidation of all national forces for the speedy attainment of victory in agreement with the imperial duma we have thought it well to renounce the throne of the russian empire and to lay down the supreme power as we do not wish to part from our beloved son we transmit the succession to our brother the grand duke michael alexandrovich and give him our blessing to mount the throne of the russian empire we direct our brother to conduct the affairs of state in full and inviolable union with the representatives of the people in the legislative bodies on those principles which will be established by them and on which he will take an inviolable oath in the name of our dearly beloved homeland we call on our faithful sons of the fatherland to fulfill their sacred duty to the fatherland to obey the tsar in the heavy moment of national trials and to help him together with the representatives of the people to guide the russian empire on the road to victory welfare and glory may the lord god help russia grand duke michael declined to accept the throne until the people were allowed to vote through a constituent assembly for the continuance of the monarchy or a republic the abdication of nicholas ii and the subsequent bolshevik revolution brought three centuries of the romanov dynastys rule to an end the fall of autocratic tsardom brought joy to liberals and socialists in britain and france the united states of america was the first foreign government to recognise the provisional government in russia the announcement of the tsars abdication was greeted with many emotions these included delight relief fear anger and confusion it is debatable whether nicholass enforced abdication was actually legal and whether he had the right to abdicate on behalf of his son as nicholas had already abdicated he was therefore merely a subject of his son and only grand duke michael as regent had the right to change the succession some historians contend that nicholas remained the tsar at least in theory until his death imprisonmentedit the governors mansion in tobolsk where the romanov family was held in captivity between august  and april  nicholas desperately wanted to go into exile in the united kingdom following his abdication the british government reluctantly offered the family asylum in the uk on  march  although it was suggested that it would be better for the romanovs to go to a neutral country news of the offer provoked uproar from the labour party and many liberals and the british ambassador sir george buchanan advised the government that the extreme left would use the extsars presence as an excuse for rousing public opinion against us the offer of asylum was withdrawn in april following objections by king george v who acting on the advice of his secretary arthur bigge st baron stamfordham was worried that nicholass presence in the uk might provoke an uprising like the previous years easter rising in ireland the french government declined to accept the romanovs in view of increasing unrest on the western front and on the home front as a result of the ongoing war with germany the british ambassador in paris lord francis bertie advised the foreign secretary that the romanovs would be unwelcome in france as the exempress was regarded as progerman in the early summer of  after an improvement in the internal political situation in russia the russian government approached the uk government on the issue of asylum and was informed the offer had been withdrawn due to the considerations of british internal politics in august the kerensky government evacuated the romanovs to tobolsk in the urals as a winter refuge to protect them from the rising tide of revolution until the family could be sent abroad in the spring of  via japan there they lived in the former governors mansion in considerable comfort in october  however the bolsheviks seized power from kerenskys provisional government nicholas followed the events in october with interest but not yet with alarm boris soloviev the husband of maria rasputin was supposedly organizing rescue attempts with monarchical factions but none occurred rumors persist that soloviev was working for the bolsheviks or the germans or both nicholas continued to underestimate lenins importance in the meantime he and his family occupied themselves with keeping warm conditions of imprisonment became more strict and talk of putting nicholas on trial grew more frequent the tsar was forbidden to wear epaulettes on  march  the family was placed on soldiers rations which meant parting with ten devoted servants and giving up butter and coffee as luxuries nicholas and alexandra were appalled by news of the treaty of brestlitovsk whereby russia agreed to give up poland finland the baltic states the ukraine the crimea and most of the caucasus what kept the familys spirits up was the belief that help was at hand the romanovs believed that various plots were underway to break them out of captivity and smuggle them to safety the western allies lost interest in the fate of the romanovs after russia left the war the german government wanted the monarchy restored in russia to crush the bolsheviks and maintain good relations with the central powers but on  april  the romanovs were transferred to their final destination the town of yekaterinburg where they were imprisoned in the twostorey ipatiev house the home of the military engineer nikolay nikolayevich ipatiev which ominously became referred to as the house of special purpose russian imperial family between circa  and circa  executionedit see also execution of the romanov family there are several accounts of what happened and historians have not agreed on a solid confirmed scope of events according to the account of yurovsky the chief executioner in the early hours of  july  the royal family was awakened around  am got dressed and were led down into a halfbasement room at the back of the ipatiev house the pretext for this move was the familys safety ie that antibolshevik forces were approaching yekaterinburg and the house might be fired upon present with nicholas alexandra and their children were their doctor and three of their servants who had voluntarily chosen to remain with the family the tsars personal physician eugene botkin his wifes maid anna demidova and the familys chef ivan kharitonov and footman alexei trupp a firing squad had been assembled and was waiting in an adjoining room composed of seven communist soldiers from central europe and three local bolsheviks all under the command of bolshevik officer yakov yurovsky nicholas was carrying his son when the family arrived in the basement the former empress complained that there were no chairs for them to sit oncitation needed yurovsky ordered two chairs brought in and when the empress and the heir were seated the executioners filed into the room yurovsky announced to them that they had been condemned to death by the ural soviet of workers deputies a stunned nicholas asked what what and turned toward his family yurovsky quickly repeated the order and shot the former emperor outright the executioners drew handguns and the shooting began nicholas was the first to die yurovsky shot him several times in the chest sometimes incorrectly said to have been in his head but his skull bore no bullet wounds when it was discovered in  anastasia tatiana olga and maria survived the first hail of bullets the sisters were wearing over  kilograms of diamonds and precious gems sewn into their clothing which provided some initial protection from the bullets and bayonets they were stabbed with bayonets and then shot at close range in their heads an announcement from the presidium of the ural regional soviet of the workers and peasants government emphasized that conspiracies had been exposed to free the extsar that counterrevolutionary forces were pressing in on soviet russian territory and that the extsar was guilty of unforgivable crimes against the nation in view of the enemys proximity to yekaterinburg and the exposure by the cheka of a serious white guard plot with the goal of abducting the former tsar and his family… in light of the approach of counterrevolutionary bands toward the red capital of the urals and the possibility of the crowned executioner escaping trial by the people a plot among the white guards to try to abduct him and his family was exposed and the compromising documents will be published the presidium of the ural regional soviet fulfilling the will of the revolution resolved to shoot the former tsar nikolai romanov who is guilty of countless bloody violent acts against the russian people identificationedit yekaterinburgs church on the blood built on the spot where the ipatiev house once stood in  the bodies of tsar nicholas ii tsaritsa alexandra three of their daughters and those of four nonfamily members killed with them were discovered near sverdlovsk yekaterinburg by amateur archaeologist alexander avdonin in january  the remains excavated from underneath the dirt road near yekaterinburg were officially identified as those of nicholas ii and his family excluding one of his daughters and alexei the identifications including comparisons to a living relative were performed by separate russian british and american scientists using dna analysis concur and were found to be conclusive in july  an amateur historian discovered bones near yekaterinburg belonging to a boy and young woman prosecutors reopened the investigation into the deaths of the imperial familycitation needed and in april  dna tests performed by a us laboratory proved that bone fragments exhumed in the ural mountains belonged to two children of nicholas ii son alexei b  and daughter maria b  according to russian news agencies that same day it was announced by russian authorities that the remains of the entire family had been identified on  october  supreme court of russia ruled that nicholas ii and his family were victims of political persecution and should be rehabilitated in march  results of the dna testing were published confirming that the two bodies discovered in  were those of alexei and his sister maria funeraledit after the dna testing of  the remains of the emperor and his immediate family were interred at st peter and paul cathedral saint petersburg on  july  on the eightieth anniversary of their executions the ceremony was attended by then russian president boris yeltsin who said today is a historic day for russia for many years we kept quiet about this monstrous crime but the truth has to be spoken the british royal family was represented at the funeral by prince michael

russian sfsr venerated in russian orthodox church canonized  and  by russian orthodox church abroad and the russian orthodox church major shrine church on blood ekaterinburg russia feast  july in  nicholas and his immediate family were recognised as martyred saints by the russian orthodox church outside russia on  august  they were recognised by the synod of the russian orthodox church this time they were not named as martyrs since their deaths did not result immediately from their christian faith instead they were canonised as passion bearers according to a statement by the moscow synod they were glorified as saints for the following reasons in the last orthodox russian monarch and members of his family we see people who sincerely strove to incarnate in their lives the commands of the gospel in the suffering borne by the royal family in prison with humility patience and meekness and in their martyrs deaths in yekaterinburg in the night of  july  was revealed the light of the faith of christ that conquers evil however nicholass canonisation was controversial the russian orthodox church abroad was split on the issue back in  some members suggesting that the emperor was a weak ruler and had failed to thwart the rise of the bolsheviks it was pointed out by one priest that martyrdom in the russian orthodox church has nothing to do with the martyrs personal actions but is instead related to why he or she was killed the russian orthodox church inside russia rejected the familys classification as martyrs because they were not killed on account of their religious faith religious leaders in both churches also had objections to canonising the tsars family because they perceived him as a weak emperor whose incompetence led to the revolution and the suffering of his people and made him partially responsible for his own murder and those of his wife children and servants for these opponents the fact that the tsar was in private life a kind man and a good husband and father or a leader who showed genuine concern for the peasantry did not override his poor governance of russia despite the original opposition the russian orthodox church inside russia ultimately recognised the family as passion bearers or people who met their deaths with christian humility the church does not however recognise the remains interred at peter and paul cathedral as being those of the imperial familycitation needed assessmentedit nicholas is generally considered to have been incompetent at the colossal task of ruling the enormous russian empire historian barbara tuchman gives a damning evaluation of his reign the russian empire was ruled from the top by a sovereign who had but one idea of government—to preserve intact the absolute monarchy bequeathed to him by his father—and who lacking the intellect energy or training for his job fell back on personal favorites whim simple mulishness and other devices of the emptyheaded autocrat his father alexander iii who deliberately intended to keep his son uneducated in statecraft until the age of thirty unfortunately miscalculated his own life expectancy and died when nicholas was twentysix the new tsar had learned nothing in the interval and the impression of imperturbability he conveyed was in reality apathy—the indifference of a mind so shallow as to be all surface when a telegram was brought to him announcing the annihilation of the russian fleet at tsushima he read it stuffed it in his pocket and went on playing tennis in russia nicholas ii faced widespread criticism after the victory of the revolution pavel bykov who in russia wrote the first full account about the downfall of the tsar denounced nicholas as a tyrant who paid with his life for the ageold repression and arbitrary rule of his ancestors over the russian people over the impoverished and bloodsoaked country sovietera historians noted that nicholas ii was not fit to be a statesman it has been argued that he had a weak will and was manipulated by adventurist forces his regime was condemned for extensive use of the army police and courts to destroy the revolutionary movement he was criticised for fanning nationalism and chauvinism with the punitive expeditions and courtsmartial during the  revolution the monarch became known as nicholas the bloody nicholass reign was seen as a time of suffering for russians robert k massie provides a more sympathetic view of the tsar  there still are those who for political or other reasons continue to insist that nicholas was bloody nicholas most commonly he is described as shallow weak stupid—a onedimensional figure presiding feebly over the last days of a corrupt and crumbling system this certainly is the prevailing public image of the last tsar historians admit that nicholas was a good man—the historical evidence of personal charm gentleness love of family deep religious faith and strong russian patriotism is too overwhelming to be denied—but they argue that personal factors are irrelevant what matters is that nicholas was a bad tsar  essentially the tragedy of nicholas ii was that he appeared in the wrong place in history ancestorsedit ancestors of

have been vastly exaggerated as emperor of all the russias and an autocrat the resources under his command were virtually incalculable however the vast majority of this was owned by the state as crown property the romanov familys personal wealth was only a small fraction of this as monarch the income of nicholas was  million gold roubles per annum this derived from a yearly allowance from the treasury and from the profits of crown farmland from this income he had to fund staff the upkeep of imperial palaces and imperial theatres annuities for the royal family pensions bequests and other outgoings before the end of the year the tsar was usually penniless sometimes he reached this embarrassing state by autumn according to the grand marshal of the court count paul benckendorff the familys total financial resources amounted to between  and  million roubles as a comparison prince felix yussupov estimated his familys worth in real estate holdings alone as amounting to  million

united kingdom right in german military uniforms in berlin before the war  nicholas was related to several monarchs in europe his mothers siblings included kings frederik viii of denmark and george i of greece as well as the united kingdoms queen alexandra consort of king edward vii nicholas his wife alexandra and wilhelm ii german emperor were all first cousins of king george v of the united kingdom nicholas was also a first cousin of both haakon vii of norway and maud of wales as well as king constantine i of greece nicholas and wilhelm ii were in turn second cousinsonceremoved as each descended from king frederick william iii of prussia as well as third cousins as they were both greatgreatgrandsons of tsar paul i of russia in addition to being second cousins through descent from louis ii grand duke of hesse and his wife princess wilhelmine of baden nicholas and alexandra were also third cousinsonceremoved as they were both descendants of king frederick william ii of prussia tsar nicholas ii was the first cousinonceremoved of grand duke nicholas nikolaevich to distinguish between them the grand duke was often known within the imperial family as nikolasha and nicholas the tall while the tsar was nicholas the short in his childhood nicholas his parents and siblings made annual visits to the danish royal palaces of fredensborg and bernstorff to visit his grandparents the king and queen the visits also served as family reunions as his mothers siblings would also come from the united kingdom germany and greece with their respective families it was there in  that he had a flirtation with one of his english first cousins princess victoria in  nicholas also accompanied his parents and younger brother twoyearold george on a twomonth semiofficial visit to england in london nicholas and his family stayed at marlborough house as guests of his uncle bertie and aunt alix the prince and princess of wales where he was spoiled by his uncle tsesarevichedit tsarevich nicholas in japan  on  march  following the assassination of his grandfather tsar alexander ii nicholas became heir apparent upon his fathers ascension as alexander iii nicholas and his other family members bore witness to alexander iis death having been present at the winter palace in saint petersburg where he was brought after the attack for security reasons the new tsar and his family relocated their primary residence to the gatchina palace outside the city only entering the capital for various ceremonial functions on such occasions alexander iii and his family occupied the nearby anichkov palace in  nicholass comingofage ceremony was held at the winter palace where he pledged his loyalty to his father later that year nicholass uncle grand duke sergei alexandrovich married princess elizabeth daughter of louis iv grand duke of hesse and his late wife princess alice of the united kingdom who had died in  and a granddaughter of queen victoria at the wedding in st petersburg the sixteenyearold tsarevich met with and admired the brides youngest surviving sister twelveyearold princess alix those feelings of admiration blossomed into love following her visit to st petersburg five years later in  alix had feelings for him in turn as a devout lutheran she was initially reluctant to convert to russian orthodoxy in order to marry nicholas but later relented eventually in  nicholas along with his younger brother george and their cousin prince george of greece set out on a world tour although grand duke george fell ill and was sent home partway through the trip nicholas visited egypt india singapore and bangkok receiving honors as a distinguished guest in each country in april  while traveling through the city of otsu japan nicholas was the victim of an assassination attempt the incident cut his trip short returning overland to st petersburg he was present at the ceremonies in vladivostok commemorating the beginning of work on the transsiberian railway in  nicholas traveled to london on behalf of his parents to be present at the wedding of his cousin george duke of york to mary of teck queen victoria was struck by the physical resemblance between the two cousins and their appearances confused some at the wedding during this time nicholas had an affair with st petersburg ballerina mathilde kschessinska despite being heirapparent to the throne however nicholass father failed to prepare him for his future role as tsar he attended meetings of the state council however as his father was only in his forties it was expected that it would be several years before nicholas would take the throne sergei witte russias finance minister saw things differently and suggested to the tsar that nicholas be appointed to the siberian railway committee alexander argued that nicholas was not mature enough to take on serious responsibilities to which witte replied that if he was not introduced to state affairs nicholas would never be ready to understand them alexanders assumptions about living a long life and having years to prepare nicholas for becoming tsar would be proven wrong as by  alexander iii was suffering from ill health engagement accession and marriageedit see also wedding of nicholas ii and alexandra feodorovna in april  nicholas joined his uncle sergei and aunt elizabeth on a journey to coburg germany for the wedding of elizabeths and alixs brother ernest louis grand duke of hesse to their mutual first cousin princess victoria melita of saxecoburg and gotha other guests included queen victoria wilhelm ii german emperor the victoria princess royal kaiser wilhelms mother and queen victorias eldest daughter nicholass uncle the prince of wales and the brides parents the duke and duchess of saxecoburg and gotha once in coburg nicholas proposed to alix but she rejected his proposal being reluctant to convert to orthodoxy but the kaiser later told her she had a duty to marry nicholas and to convert as her sister elizabeth had voluntarily done in  thus nicholas and alix became officially engaged on  april  nicholass parents initially hesitated to give the engagement their blessing as alix had made poor impressions during her visits to russia they gave their consent only when they saw tsar alexanders health deteriorating queen victoria also initially opposed to the match for though she had no objections against nicholas personally she evidently disliked russiacitation needed official engagement photograph of nicholas ii and alexandra april  that summer nicholas travelled to england to visit both alix and the queen the visit coincided with the birth of the duke and duchess of yorks first child the future king edward viii along with being present at the christening nicholas and alix were listed amongst the childs godparents after several weeks in england nicholas returned home for the wedding of his sister xenia to a cousin grand duke alexander mikhailovich sandro by that autumn alexander iii lay dying upon learning that he would live only a fortnight the tsar had nicholas summon alix to the imperial palace at livadia alix arrived on  october the tsar insisted on receiving her in full uniform from his deathbed he told his son to heed the advice of witte his most capable minister ten days later alexander iii died at the age of fortynine leaving twentysixyearold nicholas as emperor of russia that evening nicholas was consecrated by his fathers priest as tsar nicholas ii and the following day alix was received into the russian orthodox church taking the name alexandra feodorovna with the title of grand duchess and the style of imperial highness nicholas ii and family nicholas may have felt unprepared for the duties of the crown for he asked his cousin and brotherinlaw grand duke alexander what is going to happen to me and all of russia though perhaps underprepared and unskilled nicholas was not altogether untrained for his duties as tsar nicholas chose to maintain the conservative policies favoured by his father throughout his reign while alexander iii had concentrated on the formulation of general policy nicholas devoted much more attention to the details of administrationcitation needed leaving livadia on  november tsar alexanders funeral procession—which included nicholass paternal aunt queen olga of greece and the prince and princess of wales—arrived in moscow after lying in state in the kremlin the body of the tsar was taken to st petersburg where the funeral was held on  november tsar nicholas ii and empress alexandra with their first child  nicholas and alixs wedding was originally scheduled for the spring of  but it was moved forward at nicholass insistence staggering under the weight of his new office he had no intention of allowing the one person who gave him confidence to leave his side instead nicholass wedding to alix took place on  november  which was the birthday of the dowager empress marie feodorovna and court mourning could be slightly relaxed alexandra wore the traditional dress of romanov brides and nicholas a hussars uniform nicholas and alexandra each holding a lit candle faced the palace priest and were married a few minutes before one in the afternoon reignedit coronation by valentin serov nicholas iis imperial monogram silk imperial crown of russia  coronation gift to nicholas ii nicholas ii of russia as tsarevich in  despite a visit to the united kingdom in  where he observed the house of commons in debate and seemingly impressed by the machinery of constitutional monarchy as well as a similar positive appraisal of the us congress on an official visit to the united states as tsesarevich nicholas turned his back on any notion of giving away any power to elected representatives in russia shortly after he came to the throne a deputation of peasants and workers from various towns local assemblies zemstvos came to the winter palace proposing court reforms such as the adoption of a constitutional monarchy and reform that would improve the political and economic life of the peasantry in the tver address although the addresses they had sent in beforehand were couched in mild and loyal terms nicholas was angry and ignored advice from an imperial family council by saying to them  it has come to my knowledge that during the last months there have been heard in some assemblies of the zemstvos the voices of those who have indulged in a senseless dream that the zemstvos be called upon to participate in the government of the country i want everyone to know that i will devote all my strength to maintain for the good of the whole nation the principle of absolute autocracy as firmly and as strongly as did my late lamented father on  may  nicholass formal coronation as tsar was held in uspensky cathedral located within the kremlin the silk imperial crown of russia was used as an official coronation gift of the russian empire nicholas ii was the first and only monarch to be presented with such a monumental coronation gift it was not intended as ceremonial regalia but as private imperial property a memento to his coronation in celebration on  may  a large festival with food free beer and souvenir cups was held in khodynka field outside moscow khodynka was chosen as the location as it was the only place near moscow large enough to hold all of the moscow citizens khodynka was primarily used as a military training ground and the field was uneven with trenches before the food and drink was handed out rumours spread that there would not be enough for everyone as a result the crowd rushed to get their share and individuals were tripped and trampled upon suffocating in the dirt of the field of the approximate  in attendance it is estimated that  individuals died and roughly  were injured the khodynka tragedy was seen as an ill omen and nicholas found gaining popular trust difficult from the beginning of his reign the french ambassadors gala was planned for that night the tsar wanted to stay in his chambers and pray for the lives lost but his uncles believed that his absence at the ball would strain relations with france particularly the  francorussian alliance thus nicholas attended the party as a result the mourning populace saw nicholas as frivolous and uncaring during the autumn after the coronation nicholas and alexandra made a tour of europe after making visits to the emperor and empress of austriahungary the kaiser of germany and nicholass danish grandparents and relatives nicholas and alexandra took possession of their new yacht the standart which had been built in denmark from there they made a journey to scotland to spend some time with queen victoria at balmoral castle while alexandra enjoyed her reunion with her grandmother nicholas complained in a letter to his mother about being forced to go shooting with his uncle the prince of wales in bad weather and was suffering from a bad toothache the first years of his reign saw little more than continuation and development of the policy pursued by alexander iii nicholas allotted money for the allrussia exhibition of  in  restoration of gold standard by sergei witte minister of finance completed the series of financial reforms initiated fifteen years earlier by  the transsiberian railway was nearing completion this helped the russians trade in the far east but the railway still required huge amounts of work initiatives in foreign affairsedit in foreign relations nicholas followed the policies of his father strengthening the francorussian alliance and pursuing a policy of general european pacification which culminated in the famous hague peace conference this conference suggested and promoted by nicholas ii was convened with the view of terminating the arms race and setting up machinery for the peaceful settlement of international disputes the results of the conference were less than expected due to the mutual distrust existing between great powers nevertheless the hague conventions were among the first formal statements of the laws of war in  nicholas ii and the famous russian diplomat friedrich martens were nominated for the nobel peace prize—for the initiative to convene the hague peace conference and contributing to its implementation ecclesiastical affairsedit in  nicholas threw himself into an ecclesiastical crisis regarding the canonisation of seraphim of sarov the previous year it had been suggested that if he were canonised the imperial couple would beget a son and heir to throne while alexandra demanded in july  that seraphim be canonised in less than a week nicholas demanded that he be canonised within a year despite a public outcry the church bowed to the intense imperial pressure declaring seraphim worthy of canonisation in january  that summer the imperial family travelled to sarov for the canonisation russojapanese waredit main article russojapanese war the russian baltic fleet was annihilated by the japanese at the battle of tsushima a clash between russia and the empire of japan was almost inevitable by the turn of the th century russia had expanded in the far east and the growth of its settlement and territorial ambitions as its southward path to the balkans was frustrated conflicted with japans own territorial ambitions on the chinese and asian mainland nicholas pursued an aggressive foreign policy with regards to manchuria and korea and strongly supported the scheme for timber concessions in these areas as developed by the bezobazov group war began in february  with a preemptive japanese attack on the russian fleet in port arthur prior to a formal declaration of war with the russian far east fleet trapped at port arthur the only other russian fleet was the baltic fleet it was half a world away but the decision was made to send the fleet on a ninemonth voyage to the east the united kingdom would not allow the russian navy to use the suez canal due to its alliance with the empire of japan and due to the dogger bank incident where the baltic fleet mistakenly fired on british fishing boats in the north sea the russian baltic fleet traversed the world to lift the blockade on port arthur but after many misadventures on the way was nearly annihilated by the japanese in the battle of the tsushima strait on land the imperial russian army experienced logistical problems while commands and supplies came from st petersburg combat took place in east asian ports with only the transsiberian railway for transport of supplies as well as troops both ways the kilometre  mi rail line between st petersburg and port arthur was singletrack with no track around lake baikal allowing only gradual buildup of the forces on the front besieged port arthur fell to the japanese after nine months of resistance nicholass stance on the war was something that baffled many he approached the war with confidence and saw it as an opportunity to raise russian morale and patriotism paying little attention to the financial repercussions of a longdistance war shortly before the japanese attack on port arthur nicholas held firm to the belief that there would be no war despite the onset of the war and the many defeats russia suffered nicholas still believed in and expected a final victory maintaining an image of the racial inferiority and military weakness of the japanese as russia faced imminent defeat by the japanese the call for peace grew nicholass own mother as well as his cousin emperor wilhelm ii urged nicholas to open peace negotiations despite the efforts for peace nicholas remained evasive sending a telegram to the kaiser on  october that it was his intent to keep on fighting until the japanese were driven from manchuria it was not until – may  and the annihilation of the russian fleet by the japanese that nicholas finally decided to sue for peacecitation needed nicholas ii accepted american mediation appointing sergei witte chief

of nicholas ii formally condemned the rioting and dismissed the regional governor with the perpetrators arrested and punished by the court leadership of the russian orthodox church also condemned antisemitic pogroms appeals to the faithful condemning the pogroms were read publicly in all churches of russia in private nicholas expressed his admiration for the mobs viewing antisemitism as a useful tool for unifying the people behind his regime however in  he approved of government efforts to prevent antisemitic pogroms following the assassination of pyotr stolypin by the jewish revolutionary dmitry bogrov bloody sunday edit main article bloody sunday  play media tsar nicholas of russia mounts his horse  unknown cinematographer of the edison manufacturing company a few days prior to bloody sunday   january  the priest and labor leader georgy gapon informed the government of the forthcoming procession to the winter palace to hand a workers petition to the tsar on saturday   january the ministers convened to consider the situation there was never any thought that the tsar who had left the capital for tsarskoye selo on the advice of the ministers would actually meet gapon the suggestion that some other member of the imperial family receive the petition was rejected finally informed by the prefect of police that he lacked the men to pluck gapon from among his followers and place him under arrest the newly appointed minister of the interior prince sviatopolkmirsky and his colleagues decided to bring additional troops to reinforce the city that evening

kind of socialist priest named gapon mirsky came this evening to present his report on the measures taken on sunday   january  gapon began his march locking arms the workers marched peacefully through the streets some carried religious icons and banners as well as national flags and portraits of the tsar as they walked they sang hymns and the imperial anthem god save the tsar at  pm all of the converging processions were scheduled to arrive at the winter palace there was no single confrontation with the troops throughout the city at bridges on strategic boulevards the marchers found their way blocked by lines of infantry backed by cossacks and hussars and the soldiers opened fire on the crowd the official number of victims was  dead and several hundred wounded gapon vanished and the other leaders of the march were seized expelled from the capital they circulated through the empire increasing the casualties as bullets riddled their icons their banners and their portraits of nicholas the people shrieked the tsar will not help us outside russia the future british labour prime minister ramsay macdonald attacked the tsar calling him a bloodstained creature and a common murderer that evening nicholas wrote in his diary difficult day in st petersburg there were serious disturbances due to the desire of workers to get to the winter palace the troops had to shoot in different places of the city there were many dead and wounded lord how painful and bad grand duchess olga alexandrovna nicholass sister wrote afterwards nicky had the police report a few days before that saturday he telephoned my mother at the anitchkov and said that she and i were to leave for gatchina at once he and alicky went to tsarskoye selo insofar as i remember my uncles vladimir and nicholas were the only members of the family left in st petersburg but there may have been others i felt at the time that all those arrangements were hideously wrong nickys ministers and the chief of police had it all their way my mother and i wanted him to stay in st petersburg and to face the crowd i am positive that for all the ugly mood of some of the workmen nickys appearance would have calmed them they would have presented their petition and gone back to their homes but that wretched epiphany incident had left all the senior officials in a state of panic they kept on telling nicky that he had no right to run such a risk that he owed it to the country to leave the capital that even with the utmost precautions taken there might always be some loophole left my mother and i did all we could to persuade him that the ministers advice was wrong but nicky preferred to follow it and he was the first to repent when he heard of the tragic outcome from his hiding place gapon issued a letter stating nicholas romanov formerly tsar and at present soulmurderer of the russian empire the innocent blood of workers their wives and children lies forever between you and the russian people

ordered to take drastic measures to stop the revolutionary activity grand duke sergei was killed in february by a revolutionarys bomb in moscow as he left the kremlin on  march the tsar condemned the revolutionaries meanwhile witte recommended that a manifesto be issued schemes of reform would be elaborated by goremykin and a committee consisting of elected representatives of the zemstvos and municipal councils under the presidency of witte in june the battleship potemkin part of the black sea fleet mutinied around augustseptember after his diplomatic success on ending the russojapanese war witte wrote to the tsar stressing the urgent need for political reforms at home the tsar remained quiet impassive and indulgent he spent most of that autumn hunting with the defeat of russia by a nonwestern power the prestige and authority of the autocratic regime fell significantly tsar nicholas ii taken by surprise by the events reacted with anger and bewilderment he wrote to his mother after months of disorder it makes me sick to read the news nothing but strikes in schools and factories murdered policemen cossacks and soldiers riots disorder mutinies but the ministers instead of acting with quick decision only assemble in council like a lot of frightened hens and cackle about providing united ministerial action ominous quiet days began quiet indeed because there was complete order in the streets but at the same time everybody knew that something was going to happen — the troops were waiting for the signal but the other side would not begin one had the same feeling as before a thunderstorm in summer everybody was on edge and extremely nervous and of course that sort of strain could not go on for long we are in the midst of a revolution with an administrative apparatus entirely disorganized and in this lies the main danger in october a railway strike developed into a general strike which paralysed the country in a city without electricity witte told nicholas ii that the country was at the verge of a cataclysmic revolution according to orlando figes the tsar asked his uncle grand duke nicholas to assume the role of dictator but the grand duke  took out a revolver and threatened to shoot himself there and then if the tsar refused to endorse wittes memorandum nicholas ii had no choice but to make a number of steps in the constitutional liberal direction the tsar accepted the draft hurriedly outlined by aleksei d obolensky the emperor and autocrat of all the russias was forced to sign the october manifesto to agree with the establishment of the imperial duma and give up part of his unlimited autocracy for the next six months witte was the prime minister according to harold williams that government was almost paralyzed from the beginning on  october os the tsar appointed trepov master of the palace without consulting witte and had daily contact with the emperor his influence at court was paramount on  november  os princess milica of montenegro presented grigori rasputin to tsar nicholas and his wife at peterhof palace relationship with the dumaedit one ruble silver coin of emperor nicholas ii dated  with the imperial coatofarms on the reverse the russian inscription reads bozheyu milostyu nikolay imperator i samoderzhets vseya rossiiiyskiy the english translation is by the grace of god nicholas ii emperor and autocrat of all the russias under pressure from the attempted  russian revolution on  august of that year nicholas ii issued a manifesto about the convocation of the state duma known as the bulygin duma initially thought to be an advisory organ in the october manifesto the tsar pledged to introduce basic civil liberties provide for broad participation in the state duma and endow the duma with legislative and oversight powers he was determined however to preserve his autocracy even in the context of reform this was signalled in the text of the  constitution he was described as the supreme autocrat and retained sweeping executive powers also in church affairs his cabinet ministers were not allowed to interfere or assist each other they were responsible only to him nicholass relations with the duma were poor the first duma with a majority of kadets almost immediately came into conflict with him scarcely had the  members sat down at the tauride palace when they formulated an address to the throne it demanded universal suffrage radical land reform the release of all political prisoners and the dismissal of ministers appointed by the tsar in favour of ministers acceptable to the duma grand duchess olga alexandrovna the younger sister of nicholas ii wrote there was such gloom at tsarskoye selo i did not understand anything about politics i just felt everything was going wrong with the country and all of us the october constitution did not seem to satisfy anyone i went with my mother to the first duma i remember the large group of deputies from among peasants and factory people the peasants looked sullen but the workmen were worse they looked as though they hated us i remember the distress in alickys eyes minister of the court count vladimir frederiks commented the deputies they give one the impression of a gang of criminals who are only waiting for the signal to throw themselves upon the ministers and cut their throats i will never again set foot among those people the dowager empress noticed incomprehensible hatred although nicholas initially had a good relationship with his prime minister sergei witte alexandra distrusted him as he had instigated an investigation of grigori rasputin and as the political situation deteriorated nicholas dissolved the duma the duma was populated with radicals many of whom wished to push through legislation that would abolish private property ownership among other things witte unable to grasp the seemingly insurmountable problems of reforming russia and the monarchy wrote to nicholas on  april  resigning his office however other accounts have said that witte was forced to resign by the emperor nicholas was not ungracious to witte and an imperial rescript was published on  april creating witte a knight of the order of saint alexander nevsky with diamonds the last two words were written in the emperors own hand followed by i remain unalterably welldisposed to you and sincerely grateful for ever more nicholas a second duma met for the first time in february  the leftist parties—including the social democrats and the social revolutionaries who had boycotted the first duma—had won  seats in the second more than a third of the membership again nicholas waited impatiently to rid himself of the duma in two letters to his mother he let his bitterness flow a grotesque deputation is coming from england to see liberal members of the duma uncle bertie informed us that they were very sorry but were unable to take action to stop their coming their famous liberty of course how angry they would be if a deputation went from us to the irish to wish them success in their struggle against their government a little while later nicholas wrote all would be well if everything said in the duma remained within its walls every word spoken however comes out in the next days papers which are avidly read by everyone in many places the populace is getting restive again they begin to talk about land once more and are waiting to see what the duma is going to say on the question i am getting telegrams from everywhere petitioning me to order a dissolution but it is too early for that one has to let them do something manifestly stupid or mean and then — slap and they are gone nicholas ii stolypin and jewish delegation during the tsars visit to kiev in  after the second duma resulted in similar problems the new prime minister pyotr stolypin whom witte described as reactionary unilaterally dissolved it and changed the electoral laws to allow for future dumas to have a more conservative content and to be dominated by the liberalconservative octobrist party of alexander guchkov stolypin a skilful politician had ambitious plans for reform these included making loans available to the lower classes to enable them to buy land with the intent of forming a farming class loyal to the crown nevertheless when the duma remained hostile stolypin had no qualms about invoking article  of the fundamental laws which empowered the tsar to issue urgent and extraordinary emergency decrees during the recess of the state duma stolypins most famous legislative act the change in peasant land tenure was promulgated under article  the third duma remained an independent body this time the members proceeded cautiously instead of hurling themselves at the government opposing parties within the duma worked to develop the body as a whole in the classic manner of the british parliament the duma reached for power grasping for the national purse strings the duma had the right to question ministers behind closed doors as to their proposed expenditures these sessions endorsed by stolypin were educational for both sides and in time mutual antagonism was replaced by mutual respect even the sensitive area of military expenditure where the october manifesto clearly had reserved decisions to the throne a duma commission began to operate composed of aggressive patriots no less anxious than nicholas to restore the fallen honour of russian arms the duma commission frequently recommended expenditures even larger than those proposed with the passage of time nicholas also began to have confidence in the duma this duma cannot be reproached with an attempt to seize power and there is no need at all to quarrel with it he said to stolypin in  unfortunately stolypins plans were undercut by conservatives at court reactionaries such as prince vladimir nikolayevich orlov never tired of telling the tsar that the very existence of the duma was a blot on the autocracy which tsaritsa alexandra had always believed anyway stolypin they whispered was a traitor and secret revolutionary who was conniving with the duma to steal the prerogatives assigned the tsar by god witte also engaged in constant intrigue against stolypin although stolypin had had nothing to do with wittes fall witte blamed him stolypin had unwittingly angered the tsaritsa he had ordered an investigation into rasputin and presented it to the tsar who read it but did nothing stolypin on his own authority ordered rasputin to leave st petersburg alexandra protested vehemently but nicholas refused to overrule his prime minister who had more influence with the emperor by the time of stolypins assassination by dmitry bogrov a student and police informant in a theatre in kiev on  september  stolypin had grown weary of the burdens of office for a man who preferred clear decisive action working with a sovereign who believed in fatalism and mysticism was frustrating as an example nicholas once returned a document unsigned with the note despite most convincing arguments in favour of adopting a positive decision in this matter an inner voice keeps on insisting more and more that i do not accept responsibility for it so far my conscience has not deceived me therefore i intend in this case to follow its dictates i know that you too believe that a tsars heart is in gods hands let it be so for all laws established by me i bear a great responsibility before god and i am ready to answer for my decision at any time alexandra believing that stolypin had severed the bonds that her son depended on for life hated the prime minister in march  in a fit of anger stating that he no longer commanded the imperial confidence stolypin asked to be relieved of his office two years earlier when stolypin had casually mentioned resigning to nicholas he was informed this is not a question of confidence or lack of it it is my will remember that we live in russia not abroadand therefore i shall not consider the possibility of any resignation it never got that far on  september  in a procession where stolypins car was unprotected rasputin had coincidentally returned from his exile as stolypins car passed him rasputin cried out in a loud voice death is after him death is driving behind him bogrov would later assassinate stolypin in the kiev theatre that night in  a fourth duma was elected with almost the same membership as the third the duma started too fast now it is slower but better and more lasting stated nicholas to sir bernard pares the first world war developed badly for russia by late  romanov family desperation reached the point that grand duke paul alexandrovich younger brother of alexander iii and the tsars only surviving uncle was deputed to beg nicholas to grant a constitution and a government responsible to the duma nicholas sternly and adamantly refused reproaching his uncle for asking him to break his coronation oath to maintain autocratic power for his successors in the duma on  december  vladimir purishkevich a fervent patriot monarchist and war worker denounced the dark forces which surrounded the throne in a thunderous twohour speech which was tumultuously applauded revolution threatens he warned and an obscure peasant shall govern russia no longer tsarevich alexeis illness and rasputinedit tsarevich alexei nikolaevich c  grigori rasputin further complicating domestic matters was the matter of the succession alexandra bore nicholas four daughters the grand duchess olga in  the grand duchess tatiana in  grand duchess maria in  and grand duchess anastasia in  before their son alexei was born on  august  the young heir was afflicted with haemophilia b a hereditary disease that prevents blood from clotting properly which at that time was untreatable and usually led to an untimely death as a granddaughter of queen victoria alexandra carried the same gene mutation that afflicted several of the major european royal houses such as prussia and spain hemophilia therefore became known as the royal disease through alexandra the disease had passed on to her son as all of nicholas and alexandras daughters perished with their parents and brother in yekaterinburg in  it is not known whether any of them inherited the gene as carriers because of the fragility of the autocracy at this time nicholas and alexandra chose not to divulge alexeis condition to anyone outside the imperial household in fact there were many in the household who were unaware of the exact nature of the tsarevichs illness at first alexandra turned to russian doctors and medics to treat alexei however their treatments generally failed and alexandra increasingly turned to mystics and holy men or starets as they were called in russian one of these starets an illiterate siberian named grigori rasputin appeared to have some success rasputins influence over empress alexandra and consequently the tsar himself had grown stronger ever since  when the tsarevich nearly died from an injury while the family was on vacation at the hunting lodges at białowieża and spała poland the bleeding grew steadily worse until it was assumed that the tsarevich would not survive and the last sacrament was administered on  october  in desperation alexandra called upon rasputin as a last resort to which he replied god has seen your tears and heard your prayers do not grieve the little one will not die do not allow the doctors to bother him too much the haemorrhage stopped the very next day and the boy began to recover alexandra took this as a sign that rasputin was a starets and that god was with him for the rest of her life she would fervently defend him and turn her wrath against anyone who dared to question him

the following year in may  nicholas and alexandras shared uncle bertie and aunt alix britains king edward vii and queen alexandra made a state visit to russia being the first reigning british monarchs to do so however they did not set foot on russian soil instead they stayed aboard their yachts meeting off the coast of modernday tallinn later that year nicholas was taken off guard by the news that his foreign minister alexander izvolsky had entered into a secret agreement with the austrohungarian foreign minister count alois von aehrenthal agreeing that in exchange for russian naval access to the dardanelles and the bosporus strait russia would not oppose the austrian annexation of bosnia and herzegovina a revision of the  treaty of berlin when austriahungary did annex this territory that october it precipitated the diplomatic crisis when russia protested about the annexation the austrians threatened to leak secret communications between izvolsky and aehernthal prompting nicholas to complain in a letter to the austrian emperor franz joseph about a breach of confidence in  in the wake of the anglorussian convention the russian imperial family made a visit to england staying on the isle of wight for cowes week in  during the balkan wars nicholas personally offered to arbitrate between serbia and bulgaria however the bulgarians rejected his offer also in  nicholas albeit without

ferdinand of austria heir to the austrohungarian throne was assassinated by gavrilo princip in sarajevo nicholas vacillated as to russias course of action the outbreak of war was not inevitable but leaders diplomats and nineteenthcentury alliances created a climate for largescale conflict the concept of panslavism and shared ethnicity created strong public sympathy between russia and serbia territorial conflict created rivalries between germany and france and between austria and serbia and as a consequence alliance networks developed across europe the triple entente and triple alliance networks were set before the war nicholas wanted neither to abandon serbia to the ultimatum of austriahungary nor to provoke a general war in a series of letters exchanged with kaiser wilhelm of germany the socalled willy and nicky correspondence the two proclaimed their desire for peace and each attempted to get the other to back down nicholas desired that russias mobilization be only against the austrian border in the hopes of preventing war with the german empire nicholas ii right with kaiser wilhelm ii of germany in  nicholas is wearing a german army uniform while wilhelm wears that of a russian hussar regiment on  july  the council of ministers was held in krasnoye selo at which tsar nicholas ii decided to intervene in the austroserbian conflict a step toward general war he put the russian army on alert on  july although this was not general mobilization it threatened the german and austrian borders and looked like military preparation for war however his army had no contingency plans for a partial mobilization and on  july  nicholas took the fateful step of confirming the order for general mobilization despite being strongly counselled against it on  july austriahungary formally declared war against serbia on  july  nicholas ii sent a telegram to wilhelm ii the willynicky correspondence with the suggestion to submit the austroserbian problem to the hague conference in hague tribunal wilhelm ii did not address the question of the hague conference in his subsequent reply count witte told the french ambassador maurice paléologue that from russias point of view the war was madness slav solidarity was simply nonsense and russia could hope for nothing from the war on  july russia ordered general mobilisation but still maintained that it would not attack if peace talks were to begin germany reacting to the discovery of russian partial mobilisation ordered on  july announced its own premobilisation posture the imminent danger of war germany requested that russia must demobilise within the next twelve hours in saint petersburg at pm with the ultimatum to russia expired the german ambassador to russia met with the russian foreign minister sergey sazonov asked three times if russia would reconsider and then with shaking hands delivered the note accepting russias war challenge and declaring war on  august less than a week later on  august franz joseph i of austria signed the austro hungarian declaration of war on russia the outbreak of war on  august  found russia grossly unprepared russia and her allies placed their faith in her army the famous russian steamroller its prewar regular strength was  mobilisation added  reserves and millions more stood ready behind them in every other respect however russia was unprepared for war germany had ten times as much railway track per square mile and whereas russian soldiers travelled an average of  kilometres  mi to reach the front german soldiers travelled less than a quarter of that distance russian heavy industry was still too small to equip the massive armies the tsar could raise and her reserves of munitions were pitifully small while the german army in  was better equipped than any other manforman the russians were severely short on artillery pieces shells motorised transports and even boots with the baltic sea barred by german uboats and the dardanelles by the guns of germanys ally turkey russia initially could receive help only via archangel which was frozen solid in winter or via vladivostok which was over  kilometres  mi from the front line by  a rail line was built north from petrozavodsk to the kola gulf and this connection laid the foundation of the icefree port of what eventually was called murmansk the russian high command was moreover greatly weakened by the mutual contempt between vladimir sukhomlinov the minister of war and the redoubtable warrior giant grand duke nicholas nikolayevich who commanded the armies in the field in spite of all of this an immediate attack was ordered against the german province of east prussia the germans mobilised there with great efficiency and completely defeated the two russian armies which had invaded the battle of tannenberg where an entire russian army was annihilated cast an ominous shadow over the empires future the loyal officers lost were the very ones needed to protect the dynasty the russian armies had great success against both the austrohungarian armies and against the forces of the ottoman empire from the very beginning of the war but they never succeeded against the might of the german army in september  in order to relieve pressure on france the russians were forced to halt a successful offensive against austrohungary in galicia in order to attack germanheld silesia

should be shut up in a convent the tsar deposed and rasputin hanged nicholas was by no means deaf to these discontents an emergency session of the duma was summoned and a special defense council established its members drawn from the duma and the tsars ministers in july  king christian x of denmark first cousin of the tsar sent hans niels andersen to tsarskoye selo with an offer to act as a mediator he made several trips between london berlin and petrograd and in july saw the dowager empress maria fyodorovna andersen told her they should conclude peace nicholas chose to turn down king christians offer of mediation as he felt it would be a betrayal for russia to form a separate peace treaty with the central powers when its allies britain and france were still fighting the energetic and efficient general alexei polivanov replaced sukhomlinov as minister of war which failed to improve the strategic situation in the aftermath of the great retreat and the loss of the kingdom of poland nicholas assumed the role of commanderinchief after dismissing his cousin nikolay nikolayevich in september  this was a mistake as the tsar came to be personally associated with the continuing losses at the front he was also away at the remote hq at mogilev far from the direct governance of the empire and when revolution broke out in petrograd he was unable to halt it in reality the move was largely symbolic since all important military decisions were made by his chiefofstaff general michael alexeiev and nicholas did little more than review troops inspect field hospitals and preside over military luncheons nicholas ii with his family in yevpatoria crimea may  the duma was still calling for political reforms and political unrest continued throughout the war cut off from public opinion nicholas could not see that the dynasty was tottering with nicholas at the front domestic issues and control of the capital were left with his wife alexandra however alexandras relationship with grigori rasputin and her german background further discredited the dynastys authority nicholas had been repeatedly warned about the destructive influence of rasputin but had failed to remove him rumors and accusations about alexandra and rasputin appeared one after another alexandra was even accused of harboring treasonous sympathies towards germany anger at nicholass failure to act and the extreme damage that rasputins influence was doing to russias war effort and to the monarchy led to rasputins eventual murder by a group of nobles led by prince felix yusupov and grand duke dmitri pavlovich a cousin of the tsar in the early morning of saturday  december  os   december  ns collapseedit as the government failed to produce supplies mounting hardship created massive riots and rebellions with nicholas away at the front from  through  authority appeared to collapse and the capital was left in the hands of strikers and mutineering conscript soldiers despite efforts by the british ambassador sir george buchanan to warn the tsar that he should grant constitutional reforms to fend off revolution nicholas continued to bury himself away at the staff hq stavka  kilometres  mi away at moghilev leaving his capital and court open to intrigues and insurrection by early  russia was on the verge of total and utter collapse the army had taken  million men from the farms and food prices had soared an egg cost four times what it had in  butter five times as much the severe winter dealt the railways overburdened by emergency shipments of coal and supplies the final blow russia began the war with  locomotives by   were in service while the number of serviceable railway wagons had dwindled from half a million to  in february   locomotives burst their boilers and nearly  wagons were immobilised in petrograd supplies of flour and fuel had all but disappeared wartime prohibition of alcohol was enacted by nicholas to boost patriotism and productivity but instead damaged the treasury and funding of the war due to the treasury now being deprived of alcohol taxes one of the last photographs of nicholas ii showing him at tsarskoye selo after his abdication in march  on  february  in petrograd a combination of very severe cold weather and acute food shortages caused people to start to break shop windows to get bread and other necessities in the streets red banners appeared and the crowds chanted down with the german woman down with protopopov down with the war down with the tsar police started to shoot at the populace from rooftops which incited riots the troops in the capital were poorly motivated and their officers had no reason to be loyal to the regime they were angry and full of revolutionary fervor and sided with the populace the tsars cabinet begged nicholas to return to the capital and offered to resign completely  kilometres  mi away the tsar misinformed by the minister of the interior alexander protopopov that the situation was under control ordered that firm steps be taken against the demonstrators for this task the petrograd garrison was quite unsuitable the cream of the old regular army had been destroyed in poland and galicia in petrograd  recruits country boys or older men from the workingclass suburbs of the capital itself remained to keep control under the command of wounded officers invalided from the front and cadets from the military academies the units in the capital although many bore the names of famous imperial guard regiments were in reality rear or reserve battalions of these regiments the regular units being away at the front many units lacking both officers and rifles had never undergone formal training general khabalov attempted to put the tsars instructions into effect on the morning of sunday  march  despite huge posters ordering people to keep off the streets vast crowds gathered and were only dispersed after some  had been shot dead though a company of the volinsky regiment fired into the air rather than into the mob and a company of the pavlovsky life guards shot the officer who gave the command to open fire nicholas informed of the situation by rodzianko ordered reinforcements to the capital and suspended the duma it was too late on  march the volinsky regiment mutinied and was quickly followed by the semenovsky the ismailovsky the litovsky and even the legendary preobrazhensky regiment of the imperial guard the oldest and staunchest regiment founded by peter the great the arsenal was pillaged the ministry of the interior military government building police headquarters the law courts and a score of police buildings were put to the torch by noon the fortress of peter and paul with its heavy artillery was in the hands of the insurgents by nightfall  soldiers had joined the revolution order broke down and members of the duma and the soviet formed a provisional government to try to restore order they issued a demand that nicholas must abdicate faced with this demand which was echoed by his generals deprived of loyal troops with his family firmly in the hands of the provisional government and fearful of unleashing civil war and opening the way for german conquest nicholas had little choice but to submit abdication edit at the end of the february revolution of  february in the old russian calendar on  march os   march ns  nicholas ii chose to abdicate he first abdicated in favour of alexei but a few hours later changed his mind after advice from doctors that the tsarevich would not live long separated from his parents who would be forced into exile nicholas thus abdicated on behalf of his son and drew up a new manifesto naming his brother grand duke michael as the next emperor of all the russias he issued the following statement which was suppressed by the provisional government in the days of the great struggle against the foreign enemies who for nearly three years have tried to enslave our fatherland the lord god has been pleased to send down on russia a new heavy trial internal popular disturbances threaten to have a disastrous effect on the future conduct of this persistent war the destiny of russia the honor of our heroic army the welfare of the people and the whole future of our dear fatherland demand that the war should be brought to a victorious conclusion whatever the cost the cruel enemy is making his last efforts and already the hour approaches when our glorious army together with our gallant allies will crush him in these decisive days in the life of russia we thought it our duty of conscience to facilitate for our people the closest union possible and a consolidation of all national forces for the speedy attainment of victory in agreement with the imperial duma we have thought it well to renounce the throne of the russian empire and to lay down the supreme power as we do not wish to part from our beloved son we transmit the succession to our brother the grand duke michael alexandrovich and give him our blessing to mount the throne of the russian empire we direct our brother to conduct the affairs of state in full and inviolable union with the representatives of the people in the legislative bodies on those principles which will be established by them and on which he will take an inviolable oath in the name of our dearly beloved homeland we call on our faithful sons of the fatherland to fulfill their sacred duty to the fatherland to obey the tsar in the heavy moment of national trials and to help him together with the representatives of the people to guide the russian empire on the road to victory welfare and glory may the lord god help russia grand duke michael declined to accept the throne until the people were allowed to vote through a constituent assembly for the continuance of the monarchy or a republic the abdication of nicholas ii and the subsequent bolshevik revolution brought three centuries of the romanov dynastys rule to an end the fall of autocratic tsardom brought joy to liberals and socialists in britain and france the united states of america was the first foreign government to recognise the provisional government in russia the announcement of the tsars abdication was greeted with many emotions these included delight relief fear anger and confusion it is debatable whether nicholass enforced abdication was actually legal and whether he had the right to abdicate on behalf of his son as nicholas had already abdicated he was therefore merely a subject of his son and only grand duke michael as regent had the right to change the succession some historians contend that nicholas remained the tsar at least in theory until his death imprisonmentedit the governors mansion in tobolsk where the romanov family was held in captivity between august  and april  nicholas desperately wanted to go into exile in the united kingdom following his abdication the british government reluctantly offered the family asylum in the uk on  march  although it was suggested that it would be better for the romanovs to go to a neutral country news of the offer provoked uproar from the labour party and many liberals and the british ambassador sir george buchanan advised the government that the extreme left would use the extsars presence as an excuse for rousing public opinion against us the offer of asylum was withdrawn in april following objections by king george v who acting on the advice of his secretary arthur bigge st baron stamfordham was worried that nicholass presence in the uk might provoke an uprising like the previous years easter rising in ireland the french government declined to accept the romanovs in view of increasing unrest on the western front and on the home front as a result of the ongoing war with germany the british ambassador in paris lord francis bertie advised the foreign secretary that the romanovs would be unwelcome in france as the exempress was regarded as progerman in the early summer of  after an improvement in the internal political situation in russia the russian government approached the uk government on the issue of asylum and was informed the offer had been withdrawn due to the considerations of british internal politics in august the kerensky government evacuated the romanovs to tobolsk in the urals as a winter refuge to protect them from the rising tide of revolution until the family could be sent abroad in the spring of  via japan there they lived in the former governors mansion in considerable comfort in october  however the bolsheviks seized power from kerenskys provisional government nicholas followed the events in october with interest but not yet with alarm boris soloviev the husband of maria rasputin was supposedly organizing rescue attempts with monarchical factions but none occurred rumors persist that soloviev was working for the bolsheviks or the germans or both nicholas continued to underestimate lenins importance in the meantime he and his family occupied themselves with keeping warm conditions of imprisonment became more strict and talk of putting nicholas on trial grew more frequent the tsar was forbidden to wear epaulettes on  march  the family was placed on soldiers rations which meant parting with ten devoted servants and giving up butter and coffee as luxuries nicholas and alexandra were appalled by news of the treaty of brestlitovsk whereby russia agreed to give up poland finland the baltic states the ukraine the crimea and most of the caucasus what kept the familys spirits up was the belief that help was at hand the romanovs believed that various plots were underway to break them out of captivity and smuggle them to safety the western allies lost interest in the fate of the romanovs after russia left the war the german government wanted the monarchy restored in russia to crush the bolsheviks and maintain good relations with the central powers but on  april  the romanovs were transferred to their final destination the town of yekaterinburg where they were imprisoned in the twostorey ipatiev house the home of the military engineer nikolay nikolayevich ipatiev which ominously became referred to as the house of special purpose russian imperial family between circa  and circa  executionedit see also execution of the romanov family there are several accounts of what happened and historians have not agreed on a solid confirmed scope of events according to the account of yurovsky the chief executioner in the early hours of  july  the royal family was awakened around  am got dressed and were led down into a halfbasement room at the back of the ipatiev house the pretext for this move was the familys safety ie that antibolshevik forces were approaching yekaterinburg and the house might be fired upon present with nicholas alexandra and their children were their doctor and three of their servants who had voluntarily chosen to remain with the family the tsars personal physician eugene botkin his wifes maid anna demidova and the familys chef ivan kharitonov and footman alexei trupp a firing squad had been assembled and was waiting in an adjoining room composed of seven communist soldiers from central europe and three local bolsheviks all under the command of bolshevik officer yakov yurovsky nicholas was carrying his son when the family arrived in the basement the former empress complained that there were no chairs for them to sit oncitation needed yurovsky ordered two chairs brought in and when the empress and the heir were seated the executioners filed into the room yurovsky announced to them that they had been condemned to death by the ural soviet of workers deputies a stunned nicholas asked what what and turned toward his family yurovsky quickly repeated the order and shot the former emperor outright the executioners drew handguns and the shooting began nicholas was the first to die yurovsky shot him several times in the chest sometimes incorrectly said to have been in his head but his skull bore no bullet wounds when it was discovered in  anastasia tatiana olga and maria survived the first hail of bullets the sisters were wearing over  kilograms of diamonds and precious gems sewn into their clothing which provided some initial protection from the bullets and bayonets they were stabbed with bayonets and then shot at close range in their heads an announcement from the presidium of the ural regional soviet of the workers and peasants government emphasized that conspiracies had been exposed to free the extsar that counterrevolutionary forces were pressing in on soviet russian territory and that the extsar was guilty of unforgivable crimes against the nation in view of the enemys proximity to yekaterinburg and the exposure by the cheka of a serious white guard plot with the goal of abducting the former tsar and his family… in light of the approach of counterrevolutionary bands toward the red capital of the urals and the possibility of the crowned executioner escaping trial by the people a plot among the white guards to try to abduct him and his family was exposed and the compromising documents will be published the presidium of the ural regional soviet fulfilling the will of the revolution resolved to shoot the former tsar nikolai romanov who is guilty of countless bloody violent acts against the russian people identificationedit yekaterinburgs church on the blood built on the spot where the ipatiev house once stood in  the bodies of tsar nicholas ii tsaritsa alexandra three of their daughters and those of four nonfamily members killed with them were discovered near sverdlovsk yekaterinburg by amateur archaeologist alexander avdonin in january  the remains excavated from underneath the dirt road near yekaterinburg were officially identified as those of nicholas ii and his family excluding one of his daughters and alexei the identifications including comparisons to a living relative were performed by separate russian british and american scientists using dna analysis concur and were found to be conclusive in july  an amateur historian discovered bones near yekaterinburg belonging to a boy and young woman prosecutors reopened the investigation into the deaths of the imperial familycitation needed and in april  dna tests performed by a us laboratory proved that bone fragments exhumed in the ural mountains belonged to two children of nicholas ii son alexei b  and daughter maria b  according to russian news agencies that same day it was announced by russian authorities that the remains of the entire family had been identified on  october  supreme court of russia ruled that nicholas ii and his family were victims of political persecution and should be rehabilitated in march  results of the dna testing were published confirming that the two bodies discovered in  were those of alexei and his sister maria funeraledit after the dna testing of  the remains of the emperor and his immediate family were interred at st peter and paul cathedral saint petersburg on  july  on the eightieth anniversary of their executions the ceremony was attended by then russian president boris yeltsin who said today is a historic day for russia for many years we kept quiet about this monstrous crime but the truth has to be spoken the british royal family was represented at the funeral by prince michael

russian sfsr venerated in russian orthodox church canonized  and  by russian orthodox church abroad and the russian orthodox church major shrine church on blood ekaterinburg russia feast  july in  nicholas and his immediate family were recognised as martyred saints by the russian orthodox church outside russia on  august  they were recognised by the synod of the russian orthodox church this time they were not named as martyrs since their deaths did not result immediately from their christian faith instead they were canonised as passion bearers according to a statement by the moscow synod they were glorified as saints for the following reasons in the last orthodox russian monarch and members of his family we see people who sincerely strove to incarnate in their lives the commands of the gospel in the suffering borne by the royal family in prison with humility patience and meekness and in their martyrs deaths in yekaterinburg in the night of  july  was revealed the light of the faith of christ that conquers evil however nicholass canonisation was controversial the russian orthodox church abroad was split on the issue back in  some members suggesting that the emperor was a weak ruler and had failed to thwart the rise of the bolsheviks it was pointed out by one priest that martyrdom in the russian orthodox church has nothing to do with the martyrs personal actions but is instead related to why he or she was killed the russian orthodox church inside russia rejected the familys classification as martyrs because they were not killed on account of their religious faith religious leaders in both churches also had objections to canonising the tsars family because they perceived him as a weak emperor whose incompetence led to the revolution and the suffering of his people and made him partially responsible for his own murder and those of his wife children and servants for these opponents the fact that the tsar was in private life a kind man and a good husband and father or a leader who showed genuine concern for the peasantry did not override his poor governance of russia despite the original opposition the russian orthodox church inside russia ultimately recognised the family as passion bearers or people who met their deaths with christian humility the church does not however recognise the remains interred at peter and paul cathedral as being those of the imperial familycitation needed assessmentedit nicholas is generally considered to have been incompetent at the colossal task of ruling the enormous russian empire historian barbara tuchman gives a damning evaluation of his reign the russian empire was ruled from the top by a sovereign who had but one idea of government—to preserve intact the absolute monarchy bequeathed to him by his father—and who lacking the intellect energy or training for his job fell back on personal favorites whim simple mulishness and other devices of the emptyheaded autocrat his father alexander iii who deliberately intended to keep his son uneducated in statecraft until the age of thirty unfortunately miscalculated his own life expectancy and died when nicholas was twentysix the new tsar had learned nothing in the interval and the impression of imperturbability he conveyed was in reality apathy—the indifference of a mind so shallow as to be all surface when a telegram was brought to him announcing the annihilation of the russian fleet at tsushima he read it stuffed it in his pocket and went on playing tennis in russia nicholas ii faced widespread criticism after the victory of the revolution pavel bykov who in russia wrote the first full account about the downfall of the tsar denounced nicholas as a tyrant who paid with his life for the ageold repression and arbitrary rule of his ancestors over the russian people over the impoverished and bloodsoaked country sovietera historians noted that nicholas ii was not fit to be a statesman it has been argued that he had a weak will and was manipulated by adventurist forces his regime was condemned for extensive use of the army police and courts to destroy the revolutionary movement he was criticised for fanning nationalism and chauvinism with the punitive expeditions and courtsmartial during the  revolution the monarch became known as nicholas the bloody nicholass reign was seen as a time of suffering for russians robert k massie provides a more sympathetic view of the tsar  there still are those who for political or other reasons continue to insist that nicholas was bloody nicholas most commonly he is described as shallow weak stupid—a onedimensional figure presiding feebly over the last days of a corrupt and crumbling system this certainly is the prevailing public image of the last tsar historians admit that nicholas was a good man—the historical evidence of personal charm gentleness love of family deep religious faith and strong russian patriotism is too overwhelming to be denied—but they argue that personal factors are irrelevant what matters is that nicholas was a bad tsar  essentially the tragedy of nicholas ii was that he appeared in the wrong place in history ancestorsedit ancestors of

have been vastly exaggerated as emperor of all the russias and an autocrat the resources under his command were virtually incalculable however the vast majority of this was owned by the state as crown property the romanov familys personal wealth was only a small fraction of this as monarch the income of nicholas was  million gold roubles per annum this derived from a yearly allowance from the treasury and from the profits of crown farmland from this income he had to fund staff the upkeep of imperial palaces and imperial theatres annuities for the royal family pensions bequests and other outgoings before the end of the year the tsar was usually penniless sometimes he reached this embarrassing state by autumn according to the grand marshal of the court count paul benckendorff the familys total financial resources amounted to between  and  million roubles as a comparison prince felix yussupov estimated his familys worth in real estate holdings alone as amounting to  million
