university of new hampshire these hybrid cherries have similar characteristics they all ripen in late august and early september with the potential to extend the tart cherry season they have a distinctive flavor that is somewhat of an acquired taste but could be enjoyed as a fresh fruit observations at carandale farm ‘jan’ was acquired from raintree nursery in  plants were small but adapted well and produced a crop the following year it is a lowgrowing shrub that suckers readily but has never exceeded three feet in height ‘jan’ needs to be cross pollinated by ‘joel’ or ‘joy’ for good fruit set ‘joel’ and ‘joy’ were acquired from st lawrence nurseries in  these tissuecultured plants adapted very well both are taller than ‘jan’ about four feet and do not have as much suckering ‘joy’ is considered selffruitful ‘joel’ requires cross pollination fruit yield has been consistent and good discussion these plants have received little attention over the last  years but still persist in the carandale test plot because of its small stature ‘jan’ is not as competitive and will require more attention as a commercial crop with pruning and pest management the meader hybrids could be a sustainable crop late ripening could help extend the tart cherry season their potential to be machineharvested could give them a place in an integrated system but these plants will have to compete
