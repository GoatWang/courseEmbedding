realtymogulsign up for realtymogulback to platformssimilar real estate crowdfunding platformscityfundersfundriseifundingrealtymogul reviewaverage rating  reviewssummaryrealty mogul is one of the heavy hitters in the real estate crowdfunding game and it is considered one of the bestrun sites in an industry that is proliferating wildly the company was founded in  and it is very well capitalized it has raised  million in five rounds of funding the site has a growing following from institutional investors especially those funding large loans cofounder and ceo jilliene helman arguably the best known single individual in the industry has said the site now offers a new mogulreit which has a low minimum investment of  realty mogul’s most famous deal was in  raising  million for the room hard rock hotel in palm springs california this was the first crowdfunded hotel in the country the equity transaction involved  investors who also received perks such as room rate discounts and use of a special poolside cabana at the hotel headquartered in los angeles realty mogul has historically been strong on the west coast but the platform in mid opened its first east coast office in atlanta helman said it is looking “to do more on the east coast and the southeast in particular” the company is exploring other offices on the east coast helman said in december  that investors in a retail project in san antonio texas funded by the site had recently been repaid all of their initial investment and accrued preferred returns after only nine months “we believe that this is the first ‘full circle’ deal that’s occurred in the real estate crowdfunding industry” she said open a realtymogul accountquick factsminimum investment assets under management  millionyear founded number of users realtymogul fees management fees for investors depending on dealexpert walkthrough pros well capitalized high volume of deals strong institutional participation cons historically focused on west coast though it is diversifying high fees steep minimum investment specialty realty mogul started with a focus on equity deals for accredited investors about twothirds of its projects are for equity and the remainder debt or loanbased transactions it offers a diverse array of properties including commercial multifamily retail industrial office mixed use and residential unique among the crowdfunded real estate platforms realty mogul in  expanded into commercial lending for amounts up to  million or more realty mogul considers its differentiators in part to be the fact that it outsources real estate expertise to vetted professionals and that it keeps its focus on cashflow either via rent or interest payments target audience realty mogul is only open to accredited investors meaning with net worth of  million or income of  a year or more the minimum investment on the platform is only  now due to the addition of a real estate investment trust option called mogulreit to make investing easier the average customer invests  across the platform and according to helman over  percent of the company’s investors make more than one transaction the site says its users include “high net worth individual investors and institutional investors including family offices registered investment advisors private equity firms hedge funds banks and asset managers” in other words realty mogul participants have deep pockets deal structure when you make an investment on realty mogul investors are typically purchasing shares in a realty mogul limited liability company “llc” that in turn invests into an llc or limited partnership “lp” that holds title to the real property the company says this structure minimizes overhead for sponsors and streamlines administration on debt deals realty mogul often sets up what it calls “borrower dependent notes” in which realty mogul holds the loan and security for transaction and it pays investors in the notes returns from the debt service in faqs on deals realty mogul says “although innovative in the context of real estate transactions similar structures have previously been used by several consumer lending companies other webbased online finance companies have also used such techniques” dealflow realty mogul says one of its strengths is deal flow “we’re sourcing real estate transactions that others just aren’t seeing” helman said its specialty is shortterm loans on first trust deeds or the most senior first lien debt in direct real estate deals at rates generally ranging from  to  as well as equity on less liquid deals of three to five years in the form of preferred percentages at the time of review realty mogul had more than  active deals on the site there were single family homes apartment complexes mobile home parks retail properties hotels office buildings and storage facilities one review did not give realty mogul high marks for deal quality saying it focused on single family and multifamily properties in class c markets realty mogul itself says its “investments are highly speculative and investors should be able to bear the loss of their entire investment” adds helman “it’s real money and there’s potential for real losses” due diligence realty mogul performs an underwriting process that includes an assessment of the property the location the borrower or sponsor background and criminal checks and more prior to placing investment opportunities on the realty mogul platform it estimates that it approves less than  of deals it reviews “we are not investing in rookies” helman said pointing out that the firm focuses on “boring cash flow” rather than illiquid development deals or trophy deals that are sexy but don’t always perform “we are in the business of curating bestinclass operators” the site’s head of credit has three decades in real estate finance including eight years at jpmorgan in reviewing sponsors hellman said her team looks for three qualities conservatism active in different market cycles and integrity for equity investments realty mogul and its brokerdealer partner review every transaction inhouse “we go to great lengths to fully understand the variables of each transaction including the structure the market statistics the property the quality of the property and the track record reputation and quality of the real estate investment company we are working with this process includes background criminal and credit checks to mitigate the risk of fraud” it says typical projects on the platform a rich variety of deals is evident realty mogul says its financings in the first quarter of  included an apartment building in brooklyn ny an apartment building in bel air ca and an office building in washington dc among many others in addition the platform said in june  it was making its first investment in the medical sector with a multitenant medical office building in texas hold times vary widely depending on the type of investment realty mogul says investing in loans could be  months while equity investments could range from  years realty mogul expanded in april  into commercial lending to steer the platform toward sources of larger loans on commercial real estate properties “our commercial lending division will focus on  million million loans including private money bridge and permanent financing” ceo helman said the offerings include a three to fiveyear floating bridge product in the  to  range and a fixedrate program that is priced in the  percent range and primarily adheres to the standards set by the commercial mortgagebacked security securitization market this was the first time a competitively priced cmbs loan was made available through an online marketplace the company said fees realty mogul charges deal sponsors a commission on funds raised with a tiered fee schedule based on the amount investors are charged a  annual investor reporting and technology fee which is based on invested capital the realty mogul site is not very expansive about the fees that investors face one analysis says it charges acquisition refinancing and construction management fees the latter estimated at  if you decide to participate in a realty mogul deal you will need to press hard to get full information on fees contingency plans in the event of a corporate bankruptcy there would be uncertainty and ultimately it would be up to the bankruptcy courts to decide how realty mogul investors fare however realty mogul says it would work to put replacement servicers in place for all realty mogul transactions it also says that since its first day of operation it has worked to make sure it has a contingency plan in place it says its fees would cover the costs of a replacement debt servicer and it has identified a thirdparty servicing firm as a preferred vendor for loan servicing on equity investments realty mogul says it would turn to a national bank or thirdparty servicer with a real estate trust specialty to take over management of its llcs “we’ve had active discussions with both banks and alternative managers around subservicing in the event of a bankruptcy and have identified specific individuals that would be contacted” realty mogul says realty mogul offers equity securities through wealthforge llc a registered brokerdealer and member finrasipc those are investor protection bodies but their protections do not apply to any loss in value or deals that do not pan out as expected it’s really up to the individual investor to do due diligence if you aren’t experienced enough to do this you probably are not qualified to participate in real estate crowdfunding without the assistance of a trained adviser leadership team realty mogul was born in  when helman was a yearold vice president at union bank in los angeles the company was founded in  with  in capital helman brought in justin hughes a consultant for businesses building communities who is chief technology officer realty mogul raised  million in series b funding in july  following  million in series a funding in  the latest funding was led by sorenson capital and sorenson’s rob rueckert joined realty mogul’s board the company intends to use this new financing to hire more technologists and data scientists and strengthen its technology platform helman said the idea for realty mogul came from the passion she shares for finance and also for real estate since she grew up in a real estate family helman travels yearround and does anywhere from  to  interviews a year to teach others about the crowdfunding business “jilliene is like a hardworking politician who kisses babies at every campaign stop and her ambassadorship has made her probably the most recognizable front person of any real estate crowdfunding platform” according to one article the company’s board is studded with well known figures from the worlds of venture capital technology and real estate open a realtymogul accountrealtymogul reviews investorjunkie  realty mogul offers a unique opportunity to invest in real estate that’s less involved than buying property outright on an individual basis but is much deeper in scope than investing in real estate through a real estate investment trust reit it’s an opportunity to invest in real estate through a variety of closetohome investment opportunities gold ira guide  soon all investors everywhere will be able to participate in great outfits like realty mogul and their deal offerings to obtain higher returns on proven types of investments such as commercial real estate and house rehabilitation and flipping this company has an impressive track record with over  properties funded in the last few years removing the main objection raised about a lack of transparency and track record skeptics have levelled in the direction of the real estate peer to peer lenders and crowdfunders my money blog  interesting idea i’d take a ‘wait and see’ attitude on this one it might be a good deal for investors and the real estate pros both kinda like lending club for house flippers but it seems like there might be high risk here and so i’d wait to see how well they perform before i’d put any money into it financial
