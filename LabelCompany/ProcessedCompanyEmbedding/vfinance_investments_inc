choice of lender and  of firsttime home buyers regret their choice among customers who regret their decision there are two distinct situationsthe first situation is customers having a poor experience overall scores below  on a point scale which includes an aboveaverage incidence of problems lack of communication and unmet promises while this group’s responses aren’t unexpected they are often vocal about their displeasure making an average of  negative comments compared with the study average of the second situation is more unexpected because satisfaction among these customers is high this group tends to be very pricefocused and frequently obtains multiple quotes among customers who regret their lender selection  indicate they were pressured to choose a particular mortgage product their final lender choice is often linked to financial reasons such as getting a lower rate because they have a relationship with the firm eg checking account with direct deposit“this ‘happy buyer’s remorse’ is in part due to customers feeling that circumstances out of their control drove them to a particular choice and that options weren’t totally clear” said craig martin director of the mortgage practice at jd power “like a lot of consumers they are happy with a good deal but they can feel that they have to jump through hoops to get the deal in the end they may not fully understand exactly what they got and the longerterm risk for lenders is that customers’ perceptions of the deal may change in the future”one potential contributing factor to this condition could be trid tila respa integrated disclosure  over the past two years much of lenders’ attention has been focused on complying with and minimizing the negative effects of these new requirements which became effective in october  lenders have feared that the new requirements would extend an already lengthy process and negatively affect satisfaction while various sources have reported increases in the total number of days for the lending process findings of the  us primary mortgage origination satisfaction study show little change in the perceived speed of the process improved communication and setting expectations appropriately have helped prevent negative perceptions“whether it is a new regulation shifting rates or new technology lenders will continue to face challenges that require them to change” martin said “regardless of what comes if lenders focus on the needs of the customer and execute on key best practices they can positively influence perceptions and minimize the negative effects on customers”following are some of the key findings in this year’s studya higher percentage of customers in  indicate their loan representative always called back when promised compared with last year
