apparel was incorporated on december   as an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of delta woodside industries inc delta woodside on june   delta woodside distributed all of the outstanding shares of delta apparel to the shareholders of delta woodside prior to may  the business of the company was conducted by the delta apparel company division of various subsidiaries of delta woodside in may

marketing is performed primarily by employed sales personnel located throughout the country delta apparel also utilizes independent sales representatives sales personnel call directly on the retail marketplace contacting screen printing companies distributors and mass marketers approximately  of delta apparels fiscal  sales were to screen printers and other direct customers approximately  were to distributors with the balance to private label accounts in fiscal year  the company increased its sales personnel by over  in its continued focus on selling directly to screen printers and other direct customers as a growing percentage of the companys sale of goods are direct backlog order levels no longer give a general indication of future sales generally sales to screen printers and distributors are driven by the availability of competitive products and price while sales in the private label business are characterized by slightly higher customer loyalty the company currently services over  customers no single customer accounted for more than  of delta apparels sales in fiscal year   or  part of delta apparels strategy is not to become dependent on any single customer the majority of the companys knit apparel products are produced based on forecasts to permit quick shipment and to level production schedules special knit apparel products and private label knit apparel styles are generally made only to order some customers place multimonth orders and request shipment at their discretion the company offers sameday shipping and uses third party carriers to ship products to its customers delta apparels sales reflect some seasonality with sales during the first and fourth fiscal quarters generally being the highest and sales during the second fiscal quarter generally being the lowest the apparel industry is characterized by rapid shifts in fashion consumer demand and competitive pressures resulting in both price and demand volatility the demand for any particular product varies from time to time based largely upon changes in consumer preferences and general economic conditions affecting the apparel industry such as consumer expenditures for nondurable goods manufacturing as a vertically integrated operation the company converts raw fibers into finished apparel utilizing companyowned and leased facilities when demand exceeds production capacity or when it is cost effective to do so the company uses outside contractors and general suppliers for textile and sewing production delta apparel spins the majority of its yarn at its modern facility in edgefield south carolina the company knits dyes finishes and cuts its fabric in companyowned plants located in maiden north carolina and fayette alabama delta apparel currently sews most of its garments in two leased facilities in san pedro sula honduras and one leased facility in campeche mexico at the   and  fiscal year ends delta apparels longlived assets in honduras and mexico collectively comprised   and  respectively of delta apparels total net property plant and equipment in addition to its leased sewing facilities during fiscal year  the company used outside contractors located in the caribbean basin to sew approximately  of the companys products outside sewing contractors will provide approximately  to  of the companys total sewing needs for fiscal year  delta apparel has distribution centers located in knoxville tennessee and buena park california in february  the company opened a distribution center in miami florida the florida distribution center is expected to ship in excess of one million dozen garments during fiscal year  the company is not planning on adding any additional distribution centers during fiscal year  raw materials delta apparels principal raw material is cotton which is acquired from several suppliers in fiscal  delta apparel expects to use over  million pounds of cotton in its manufacture of yarn delta apparel fixes the price on its expected cotton requirements based upon its forecast of future cotton prices the company uses derivatives including cotton option contracts to manage its exposure to movements in cotton market prices the company has not designated its options as hedge instruments upon inception and therefore changes in the fair market value are marked to market delta apparel believes that it will be competitive with other companies in the united states apparel industry when the cotton purchased for  table of contents future use is put into production to the extent that cotton prices decrease before delta apparel uses these future purchases or to the extent that cotton prices increase and delta apparel has not provided for its requirements with fixed price contracts the company could be materially and adversely affected as there can be no assurance that it would be able to pass along its own relatively higher costs to its customers business strategy delta apparels mission is to grow sales and increase earnings by providing its customers with the best value with respect to the products it manufactures set forth below are key components of the companys current business strategy to pursue this objective maintain lowcost verticallyintegrated manufacturing operations the company is a vertically integrated manufacturer that spins knits bleaches dyes finishes cuts and sews its products at its manufacturing facilities the company believes this reduces costs allows for efficient production and provides for consistent high quality products delta apparel continues to use its automated textile manufacturing facilities in the united states but has moved all its sewing operations offshore to take advantage of the favorable wage differentials in april  the company purchased an additional textile facility in fayette alabama the fayette plant produced over  of delta apparels textile production in fiscal year  during fiscal year  the company will be increasing its focus on cost reductions to continue to improve its profitability provide excellent customer service the company believes that providing excellent customer service with respect to rapid and accurate delivery customer inventory needs and order monitoring is essential in june  the company opened its west coast sales and distribution center in order to provide better service to its west coast customers in february  the company opened a distribution center in miami florida the florida distribution center allowed delta apparel to expand its  to  hour delivery capability to a new group of customers delta apparel can costeffectively offer delivery of its products to approximately  of the continental united states population in one to two days under normal conditions delta apparel also offers a customerfriendly internet site the site provides realtime information in an easy to use format so customers will have the information they need to run their business more efficiently customers can now track the status of their order receive emails confirming the shipment of their order and check the availability of inventory prior to placing an order during fiscal year  the companys internet site was updated to allow new customers to open an account on the internet and purchase products with credit card payments the company believes that its knowledgeable phonebased customer service representatives along with the internet site make its total customer service offering among the most advanced and convenient in the industry balance the customer and product mix the company believes that a balanced mix of customers and products is essential to its success the company has continued to focus its sales efforts on direct customers increasing the sales to direct customers to  of total sales in fiscal  in addition delta apparel is focusing on shifting the product mix to higher margin items this includes manufacturing more colored products and expanding the product line into more specialized shirts during fiscal year  the company continued to increase its sales of colored products to  of catalog sales in addition the company introduced new specialty products including the sleeveless tee and pigmentdyed tee delta apparels specialty tees continued to generate good margins and helped offset declining margins on basic tees focus on inventory and accounts receivable delta apparel continues to focus on the management of inventory and accounts receivable in order to minimize its overall risk and capital investment during fiscal year  the company increased its inventory levels to support its new distribution center and in anticipation of continued sales growth during fiscal year  the company will continue to monitor its inventory levels to maintain the correct mix and levels of inventory for its anticipated sales the company expects inventory levels in fiscal year  will be similar to the inventory levels maintained in fiscal year  delta apparel will also closely monitor its average payment terms to customers in order to limit its days sales outstanding competition delta apparel competes with many united states and canadian branded and private label manufacturers of knit apparel some of which are larger in size and have greater financial resources than delta apparel competition in the activewear apparel industry is generally based upon price service delivery time quality and flexibility with the relative importance of each factor depending upon the needs of particular customers and the specific product offering delta apparels strategy is to provide the best value to its customers favorable competitive aspects of delta apparels business are the relatively high  table of contents quality of its products its state of the art information systems and its flexibility and process control which leads to product consistency delta apparels primary relative competitive disadvantage is that its brand names are not as well known as the brand names of its largest competitors such as gildan® hanes® and russell® employees at june   the company including its offshore subsidiaries had approximately  full time employees delta apparels employees are not represented by unions and the company believes that its relations with its employees are good environmental and regulatory matters delta apparel is subject to various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning among other things wastewater discharges storm water flows air emissions and solid waste disposal delta apparels plants generate very small quantities of hazardous waste which are either recycled or disposed of offsite most of its plants are required to possess one or more discharge permits on may   the company received a renewal of its national pollution discharge elimination system npdes permit from the north carolina department of environment and natural resources division of water quality dwq for its maiden north carolina textile plant among other things the new permit required the company to reduce its effluent waste discharge color to specified color concentration limits the color concentration limits were lowered over time the company believed that the dwq exceeded its authority and acted arbitrarily in imposing the specific color concentration limitations within the new permit and on july   contested the permit by filing a petition with the north carolina office of administrative hearings the company and dwq have reached a tentative settlement and have stayed the contested case until september   the tentative settlement provides that delta apparel will have one year to research and test alternative color removal technologies and thereafter must select and implement a technology in addition delta apparel must continue to monitor its color removal the company does not currently have an estimate of the amount of additional annual expenses if any that the company may incur in the future in order to comply with the tentative settlement the company believes that the cost of compliance will not be material to the results of operations or financial condition of the company delta apparel incurs capital and other expenditures each year that are aimed at achieving compliance with current and future environmental standards generally the environmental rules applicable to delta apparel are becoming increasingly stringent delta apparel does not expect that the amount of these expenditures in the future will have a material adverse effect on its operations financial condition or liquidity there can be no assurance however that future changes in federal state or local regulations interpretations of existing regulations or the discovery of currently unknown problems or conditions will not require substantial additional expenditures similarly the extent of delta apparels liability if any for past failures to comply with laws regulations and permits applicable to its operations cannot be determined risk factors availability of cash the company believes that adverse changes in competitive conditions coupled with the longterm trend of declining prices for delta apparels products could cause delta apparel to incur operating losses or to use significant amounts of cash in its operations significant operating losses or significant uses of cash in its operations could cause the company to be unable to pay its debts as they become due and to default on its credit facility which would have an adverse effect on the value of the delta apparel shares in midmay  delta apparel entered into a credit agreement with a lending institution under which the lender provided delta apparel with a  million term loan and a year  million revolving credit facility on august   the company amended its credit agreement to extend the due date of the revolver loan from may   to may   the companys ability to borrow under its revolving credit facility is based upon and thereby limited by the amounts of its accounts receivable and inventory any material deterioration in delta apparels financial results could reduce the companys borrowing base which could cause the company to lose its ability to borrow additional amounts under its revolving credit facility or to issue additional letters of credit to suppliers in such a circumstance the borrowing availability under delta apparels credit facility may not be sufficient for the companys capital needs delta apparels credit agreement contains covenants that restrict among other things the ability of delta apparel and its subsidiaries to incur indebtedness create liens consolidate merge sell assets or make investments the credit agreement  table of contents also contains customary representations and warranties funding conditions and events of default a breach of one or more covenants or any other event of default under the credit agreement could result in an acceleration of the companys obligations under that agreement in the foreclosure on any assets subject to liens in favor of the credit agreements lender and in the inability of delta apparel to borrow additional amounts under the credit agreement pricing prices for the companys products have generally been dropping over the last several years even though demand for delta apparels products has increased since fiscal  the price declines have resulted from factors largely outside delta apparels control such as the industrys transfer of manufacturing out of the united states excess supply capacity and declining raw material prices in addition intense competition to gain market share may lead some competitors to sell substantial amounts of goods at prices against which delta apparel cannot profitably compete demand for delta apparels products is dependent on the general demand for tshirts and the availability of alternative sources of supply the companys strategy in this market environment is to be a low cost producer and to differentiate itself by providing quality service to its customers even if this strategy is successful its results may be offset by reductions in demand or price declines cyclical results delta apparel and the us apparel industry are sensitive to the business cycle of the national economy moreover the popularity supply and demand for particular apparel products can change significantly from year to year based on prevailing fashion trends and other factors reflecting the cyclical nature of the apparel industry many apparel producers tend to increase capacity during years in which sales are strong these increases in capacity tend to accelerate a general economic downturn in the apparel markets when demand weakens these factors have historically contributed to fluctuations in delta apparels results of operations when these fluctuations occur in the future delta apparel may be unable to compete successfully in the industry downturn market price of delta apparel shares various investment banking firms have informed the company that public companies with relatively small market capitalizations have difficulty generating institutional interest research coverage or trading volume this illiquidity can translate into price discounts as compared to industry peers or to the shares inherent value delta apparel believes that the market perceives it to have a relatively small market capitalization this could lead to delta apparels shares trading at prices that are significantly lower than the companys estimate of their inherent value as of august   delta apparel had outstanding  shares of common stock  the company believes that approximately  of this stock is beneficially owned by persons who beneficially own more than  of the outstanding shares of delta apparel common stock and related individuals and that of this approximately  of the outstanding stock is beneficially owned by institutional investors who own more than  of the outstanding shares sales of substantial amounts of delta apparel common stock in the public market by any of these large holders could adversely affect the market price of the common stock principal stockholders exert substantial influence as of august   two members of delta apparels board of directors and related individuals had or share the voting power with respect to approximately  of the outstanding shares of delta apparel common stock these individuals will exert substantial influence with respect to all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders including the election of the delta apparel directors political and economic uncertainty in honduras and mexico delta apparel has two companyoperated sewing facilities in honduras and one companyoperated sewing facility in mexico if the honduran or mexican labor markets tighten it could have some adverse effects on the industries located in the applicable country in addition the company might be adversely affected if economic or legal changes occur that affect the way in which delta apparel conducts its business in these countries for example a growing economy could lower unemployment which could increase wage rates or make it difficult to retain employees or employ enough people to meet demand the government could also decide to add additional holidays or change employment law increasing the companys costs to operate in that country domestic unrest or political instability in either of these countries could also disrupt delta apparels operations us trade regulations delta apparels products are subject to foreign competition which in the past has been faced with significant us government import restrictions foreign producers of apparel often have significant labor cost advantages given the number of these foreign producers the substantial elimination of import protections that protect domestic apparel producers could materially adversely affect delta apparels business the extent of import protection afforded to domestic apparel producers has been and is likely to remain subject to considerable political considerations the north american free trade agreement or nafta became effective on january   and has created a freetrade zone among canada mexico and the united states nafta contains a rule of origin requirement that products be produced in one of the three countries in order to benefit from the agreement nafta has phased out all trade restrictions and tariffs among the three countries on apparel products competitive with those of delta apparel during fiscal  the company  table of contents completed its sewing expansion into mexico in order to take advantage of the nafta benefits subsequent repeal or alteration of nafta could seriously adversely affect the companys results of operations the caribbean basin trade partnership act often referred to as the cbi parity bill became effective on october   the provisions of the cbi parity bill have the following effects most relevant to the apparel business      apparel assembled in most caribbean nations such as honduras from fabric formed and cut in the united states of us manufactured yarn can enter the united states dutyfree      apparel cut and sewn in most caribbean nations from fabric formed in the united states of us manufactured yarn can enter the united states dutyfree as long as it is sewn with us manufactured thread and      certain limits of apparel made from fabric formed in certain caribbean nations of us manufactured yarn and cut and sewn in those nations can enter the united states dutyfree apparel entering the united states under any of these three provisions is not subject to any quotas that may exist for that specific category of goods delta apparel believes that the cbi parity bill gives it a competitive advantage relative to apparel manufacturers outside of the caribbean and improves its competitive position relative to apparel manufacturers inside the nonnafta

wto a multilateral trade organization was formed in january  and is the successor to the general agreement on tariffs and trade or gatt this multilateral trade organization has set forth

mechanisms the us government is negotiating bilateral trade agreements with developing countries which are generally exporters of textile and apparel products that are members of the wto to get them to reduce their tariffs on imports of textiles and apparel in exchange for reductions by the united states in tariffs on imports of textiles and apparel the elimination of quotas and the reduction of tariffs under the wto may result in increased imports of certain apparel products into north america these factors could make delta apparels products less competitive against low cost imports from

qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk sensitivity the company purchases cotton from approximately eleven established merchants with whom it has long standing relationships the majority of the companys purchases are executed using oncall contracts these oncall arrangements are used to insure that an adequate supply of cotton is available for the companys requirements under oncall contracts the company agrees to purchase specific quantities for delivery on specific dates with pricing to be determined at a later time prices are set according to prevailing prices as reported by the new york cotton exchange at the time of the companys election to fix specific contracts cotton oncall with a fixed price at june   was valued at  million and is scheduled for delivery between july  and december  at june   the company had unpriced contracts for deliveries between july  and june  based on the prevailing price at june   the value of these commitments was approximately  million at june   a  decline in the market price of the cotton covered by delta apparels fixed price contracts would have had a negative impact of approximately  million on the value of the contracts at june   cotton oncall with a fixed price was valued at  million at june   a  decline in the market price of the cotton covered by delta apparels fixed price contracts would have had a negative impact of approximately  million on the value of the contracts the effect of a  decline in the market price of cotton on delta apparels fixed price contracts would have been less at june   than at june   because the value of delta apparels fixed price cotton oncall contracts was less on june   daily price fluctuations are minimal yet longterm trends in price movement could result in unfavorable pricing of cotton for delta apparel the company uses derivatives including cotton option contracts to manage its exposure to movements in commodity prices the company did not designate its options as hedge instruments upon inception accordingly changes in the fair market value are marked to market the company owned options valued at  million on june   interest rate sensitivity delta

term loan had been outstanding during the entire year and the interest rate on this outstanding indebtedness were increased by  basis points delta apparels expense would have increased by approximately  or  for the fiscal year the actual increase in interest expense resulting from a change in interest rates would depend on the magnitude of the increase in rates and the average
