and the perfect classic solitaire engagement ring by liza connolly on may   in everything weddings jabel stories   henry and alyssa met at the university of massachusetts amherst where alyssa attended college with one of henry’s best friends  alyssa lived in a house with henry’s friend where the housemates threw awesome parties all the time some of which were attended by henry though he went to school at trinity college in connecticut  henry and alyssa barely noticed each other at these parties  each has approximately one memory of each other “he’s cute but he totally knows he’s cute  that’s annoying” – alyssa “why is that girl wearing a hemp necklace  she must be some sort of hippie  weird” – henry love was not in the air  also for the record hemp necklaces were totally in in   anyways after graduating in  both henry and alyssa ultimately ended up moving to boston as did their mutual friend and many many other friends  throughout their early twenties while alyssa attended law school and henry worked for the red sox they hung out together with their mutual friends on a regular basis and alyssa grew to realize that henry is not in fact an egomaniac while henry discovered that alyssa is not actually a flower child  as it turns out they got along rather well and had a lot in common  one november evening in  henry walked alyssa home from a friend’s party as he often did  instead of the usual “well see you later” at the doorstep of alyssa’s apartment henry revealed that he had romantic feelings for alyssa and told her all sorts of wonderful things including that he really thinks they could have a lot of fun together he was right after six years of traveling eating playing and generally having a fantastic time the two decided to move in together to the tiniest apartment in south boston in   eight months later on a regular thursday in may alyssa came home from the gym and the two decided to go for a walk to talk about the prospect of an upcoming london trip  clad in her sweaty gym clothes off alyssa went with henry ready to plead her case for traveling to europe  and she plead  and plead  the two eventually sat down on a sand dune at the nearby beach while alyssa continued to make point after point to convince henry to take this trip  fortunately she required a breath at one point at which time henry interjected with “there is something else i think we might want to focus on instead of london…”  then he got down on one knee in the sand and told alyssa all sorts of wonderful things culminating in asking her to marry him while presenting her with a stunning exactlywhatshewanted diamond jabel classic solitaire engagement ring  she very very happily accepted  while they haven’t picked a date or a venue they are confident beyond a doubt that they are going to have a lot of fun together about liza connolly view all posts by liza connolly →  ways to reinvent the plain gold band  ways jck  luxury can help you even if you didn’t attend about

pollutioncircular flow of the effects of water pollution a how does this issue affect households and local residents water pollution causes water to be unsafe for people to consume and use if this water is used people could become ill and medical bills could become costly b how does this issue affect area businesses local businesses would be affected because if they use the polluted water it could contaminate their product especially in the agriculture and fishing industries this could be very costly because it would set them back in productionc how does this issue affect our government at the local state and national levels government would have to set new regulations and get funding for programs to clean up the pollution if too many people become ill from the water measures would need to be take to make sure treatment is available to them and that something is being done to prevent more from becoming illd how does this issue affect the rest of the world the rest of the world may put restrictions on us exports that could have been contaminated by the water to prevent their citizens from becoming ill governments would have to spend money to clean up pollution that occurs in their countrye how does the issue affect resources goods and services and finances resources could be unusable because of contamination goods and services could be recalled or limited in production because of the water pollution and financially people could sue businesses or choose not to invest in businesses because of possible contamination of their productsfactors in choosing a solutionwhat are the necessary conditions for any possible solution to work there has to be substantial proof that there is a safety concern in the community caused by the pollution to create support and necessity for a change there should also be funds to back up a solution community support and approval and a complete plan on how to carry out the solutionare there budget or labor concerns yes the solution must be cost effective or it may not get the support of the communitydoes the public need to be aware of and support the solution yes because without the support and help of the community it will be much harder to carry out any sort of solution with the communities help solutions can be carried out more effectively and on a much grander scalewhat challenges are there to implementing each solution the resources must be available it can’t violate and local government laws and policies and it has to have support of the peoplehow else might you judge possible solutions against each other i may consider how long the solution will take or how many parts are involved in executing each solutionwhat do your parents say about the issue water is necessary for life and plans should be made to protect it everyone can do a small part in conserving and stopping water pollutionshould possible externalities factor into the chosen solution yes because if there are more negative externalities than positive externalities the solution should probably be reconsidered and revisedpossible solutions and externalities of the issueanalysis of solutionsincentives  individuals would have cleaner water that would not be contaminated by car washing chemicals businesses especially car washing businesses would benefit because they would get more business because many recycle or properly dispose of the water they use the government would benefit because the tax money they would get back could pay from different programs and the money that would go towards a cleanup program could go somewhere else  individuals would get to experience cleaner beaches and water as well as being less likely to get sick businesses along the beaches would have more customers attracted to them because the beaches would be nicer the government would benefit because the tax money and the money that would go towards a cleanup program could go towards new programs  individuals would be less likely to get sick from contaminants in the water and have more naturally grown gardens businesses selling organic fertilizer will flourish externalities  people may petition against the regulations because they can’t afford to pay to have their car washed or it’s too inconvenient more people could start car washing businesses because of the increase in demand for them which would create more jobs  more jobs would be created because some sort of group or program would need to be created to maintain and distribute the trash cans tourism would increase because the beaches would be cleaner storms could move or destroy them spreading trash everywhere that would need to be cleaned up  people who have gardens with specific needs might not be able to properly care for them or have to change their plants non organic fertilizer companies would suffer and organic fertilizer companies would flourishanalysis this solution doesnt really meet the criteria as a solution because it would be hard to get the support of a policy like this one and would require money to enforce it would be possible to ease the people into it gradually but that would take time and they still wouldnt be very happy with it this solution meets the criteria because its easy enough to get started its not as expensive as the other policies it would provide jobs for those who help with the project and it would effectively help reduce pollution on the beaches this solution doesnt really meet the criteria because it would be expensive to maintain because many people would have to switch what fertilizer they use and it wouldnt have a lot of support from the people without that support it would be harder to enforce the policyi would choose option  over the other options because it is more cost effective and would have greater support from the community there are less negative externalities for option  than the other options which make it a clear choice solution  would create jobs because theyd need people to place and maintain the trash cans this solution would effectively reduce pollution it meets the criteria and doesnt have many negative externalities therefore it is the best choicecitationswallsthumma
