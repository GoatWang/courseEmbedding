phd consulting a maine companywebsite maintenance by snakeroot datagraphics • proud member of downtownmecom a maine business search engine vision  crown o maine organic cooperative vision is a result of experience the comoc manifesto with apologies to karl marx or the communityism revolution founder jim cooks vision for crown omaine written circa  maine is a place it can happen as we look around the world we can see that it definitely aint happenin in too many places we are fortunate to live in a place of great natural resource and beauty with a population small enough and government “grassroots” enough that we can act with reasonable hope of accomplishment in our case at hand “it” is a community interconnected through a selfproviding food system that results in strong and vibrant local agriculture contrary to the belief that we must centralize specialize and globalize to succeed we see that whatever else we need to do to survive in this world we must be strong sophisticated and savvy at home this means locally produced food shelter and fuel to have a regionally secure food supply we must have a strong farming base and strong support at home your support at home is what we term “coproduction” for without it nothing happens just as farmers might cozy up to the fire in january and order the inputs for spring planting your production planning input happens when you can tell your farmers what you like and how much you would like to purchase we call this “coproduction” because you are valued partners in our vocation of raising crops for our livelihood as the distribution vehicle for many maine farms some of them also your more local farms we are in a great place to interface information about the “big picture” and coordinate efforts for the next years production while it is our philosophy and policy not to compete or interfere with direct farm to customer sales our job is to enhance each farms ability to produce and serve wider markets both in state and new england over the last ten years we have witnessed and taken part in the keen interest maine residents have for their rural roots and maritime traditions the farming and fishing sectors of our maine economy however are struggling they are struggling because the existing food distribution system is all about forcing farmers to commodity pricing and maximizing corporate profit as small farmers distributors and neighbors we have a unique opportunity in maine to do business “as unusual” the most frequently expressed equivocations to buying local products are “i can’t find it” and “i can’t afford it” the unspoken excuse is “its just too much trouble” as we look around the maine landscape we see the need to take the steps to improve access to local foods at affordable prices the link comoc is trying to forge is improved access to affordable local foods state wide mainers have given enthusiastic reception to the field crops see products for complete list we have been able to provide including maine grown and milled wheat flour coordinating production with overall demand is somewhat of a “chicken and egg” magic trick because we are not merci a dieu a large corporate entity with deep pockets however we have learned through hard won experience that by working together we can conceive and produce supply of both our traditional maine crops and innovative “new crops” such as winter greens and specialty items for the restaurant trade continuing to work together we expect to meet the demand for these products and enable production to go to the next dependable level the net result of spending your money to purchase local products is a stronger and more independent local economy statewide delivery to buying clubs at wholesale prices how this works our retail partners see retailers do great job providing day a week access to our products to provide this service they need to be able to pay the help the rent the taxes the insurance etc etc furthermore they have provided maine’s small family farms with a viable return for their efforts the seeming price disparity between locally produced small farm raised organic products in comparison with the food giant’s commodity based produce and products is easily dispelled if we take into account the real cost of industrially produced commodity food including subsidies and hidden health and environmental costs locally produce organic food can be seen for the genuine value that it is in order to provide people in all walks of life with broader access at a different price level an alternate type of service must be employed this service we will call farm direct delivery to buying clubs implicit in this mechanism is the desire to work in harmony with your local csa’s to augment selection and extend seasons for each and every farm order deadlines and delivery schedules will be posted considerations experienced buying club members know that managing bulk purchases of perishable and semiperishable items requires some forethought and preparation if you are not equipped and prepared to receive perishable and semiperishable foodstuffs it is less expensive to entrust this responsibility to your neighborhood retailer than to manage the food supply yourself we have learned through experience that no one is better equipped or understands storage requirements better than the farmer comoc can facilitate the club members storing and using these items by ensuring a regular delivery schedule at the outset we envision delivering every two weeks to any given area as we get progressively busier we may be able to offer certain areas weekly deliveries we hope this will allow club members to order on a more shortterm basis and help minimize losses we started providing this service on nov  if

farms to natural food stores restaurants buying clubs and institutional kitchens making it happen in maine crown o’maine takes distribution to new levels by marada cook author’s note while objectivity and honesty are traditionally the foremost goals of journalists the mofg has always made my job easy by asking me to cover farmers and food producers i sincerely admire “positively spun and helpful to farmers” has been jean english’s creed and in writing a piece about my family’s distribution business i embrace this philosophy ahead of unbiased reporting this is my family at work this story comes from my own kitchen table and is one i’ve overheard and participated in from teenage years to the present on friday afternoons dozens of orders come into the office beside the kitchen at skylandia organic farm in grand isle maine “i need a bag of organic whole wheat flour a case of nezinscot farm butter  pounds of ‘yukon gold’ potatoes  pounds of mesclun and  pounds of fiddleheads” the crown o’maine organic cooperative comoc is a specialized distribution business delivering local and organic produce from maine farms to natural food stores restaurants buying clubs and institutional kitchens  jim cook works the end of the phone line his farm is the northernmost in the cooperative and it is his job to coordinate filling the truck as it heads southward from aroostook county sometimes an incoming order is for a full palletload of potatoes carrots or wheat flour – other times orders are for a single case of cheese apples or ployes mix leah cook crown o’maine’s trucker has traveled  miles delivering produce in maine in the past year driving the crown o’maine’s foot ford box truck is jim’s youngest daughter leah a yearold trucker with a degree in biology from reed college she has logged  miles for comoc since she began delivering farm products last september as she says “i could have crossed the country eight times in as many miles but i wouldn’t have met all my farmers and produce people and neighbors across the state”     leah starts her delivery run at  am on sunday mornings making pickups from dionne farm woodprairie farm nature’s circle farm thibodeau farm margeson farm ostlund farm aurora mills checkerberry farm goranson farm nezinscot farm and thirty acre farm crown o’maine carries seasonal produce from a full roster of over  farms this week in june the first stop planned is the home of a fiddlehead picker from grand isle while obstacles to local food distribution are more often systemwide than casespecific this time the weak link is a missinginaction producer “what do you mean he’s not around this week” asks jim cook comoc director “well i think he went on vacation” explains the picker’s brother over the phone “is he coming back” jim has sold  pounds of fiddleheads banking on the hope that northern maine’s cool spring can extend southern maine’s brief window of picking chefs and farmstands have placed heavy orders knowing this is a oneshot opportunity finding fiddleheads in june has never been a surefire thing but neither has distributing produce for small family farms over the years fluctuating supply variable quality and inconsistent seasons have challenged comoc’s mission to keep farmgate prices high wholesale prices reasonable product available and customers satisfied with quality these goals leave just enough margin for comoc’s carefully customized distribution business comoc usually sells root vegetables grains and valueadded products in what is considered maine’s “offseason” novemberjune last year crown o’ maine extended its distribution season with the reemergence of mainegrown organic oats wheat flour spelt and rye flour the grain harvest in late august got the crown o’maine’s “season” off to an early start – and this year the crown o’ maine will run straight through the summer months filling gaps in early spring and summer availability of items such as greens new farmers participating in the cooperative effort new products added to the availability list a refrigerated truck and a newportbased warehouse with a ’ x ’ walkin cooler have made the expanded distribution season a working reality when comoc began  years ago a passenger ford club wagon loaded with handpicked handpacked handloaded and handdelivered potatoes was the height of its organizational structure the cooperative had no bylaws no official members and no officers – and still doesn’t the “cooperative” nature of crown o’ maine comes from farmers working together to pool product to maintain uniform quality standards and to ensure that distribution is on time the family business is an extension of the abilities of a man who left a comfortable career in dealership car sales to go into farming the cook family grew up hearing lines like “it’s not about price it’s about quality product” as the five kids grew older two leah and i returned to grand isle to work the farm and cooperative learning from jim’s experience has been part of the expansion process “we have never been the classic ‘middlemen’” jim says “we don’t follow commodity pricing we don’t speculate on farmers’ produce we ask ‘how much do you need at the farm gate to make this work for you’ in order to pay farms fairly you must recognize that a ‘good deal’ is not just about price it is about quality” starting with the family farm skylandia organic farm in grand isle comoc established its reputation for niche products and for providing chefs and other markets with unusual organic root vegetables believe it or not in  a widelyavailable unblemished goodeating potato was considered an unusual root vegetable in recognizing and serving the need crown o’maine was the first and became the largest instate distributor and outofstate exporter of certified organic produce jim’s wife and kids meticulously packed each comoc box that left skylandia farm in the ford van twelve years and  additional producers later carrying uniformly quality products remains a strict standard of the cooperative it has been successful moving fingerling potatoes ‘sunchoke’ jeruselum artichokes springdug parsnips organic cranberries potatoes in all shapes sizes and colors wheat from the “breadbasket of the northeast” apples for the coast blueberries for the west fiddleheads for anywhere south of bangor mainemade sea salt beyond coffee farmmade jams acadian ployes mix and greens for the springseason weather gaps foods that were once impossible to find mainegrown wild and organic now travel the state every two weeks leah cook’s rounds take her through hamden bar harbor ellsworth blue hill belfast rockland brunswick farmington skowhegan norway turner augusta portland and portsmouth they bring her into contact with every facet of the maine food system she meets farmers at the warehouse in newport she squeezes the delivery truck between liberallystickered suburu outbacks at the blue hill coop she has encountered an amazing array of personalities including a farmhand who once caught alligators and has added her own wry collection of practical tricks to the voices of local food advocates “watch out for recycling bins on loading docks” is one of them “i get to see all the back rooms of the stores where mofg readers shop” leah says “i meet the produce managers who are stalwart defenders of local organic veggies they know what customers want – and also what they should want their staff unpack the boxes like it’s a perpetual birthday party” these observations are shared with jim as they go over the next day’s orders which restaurant gets the largest potatoes which baker needs his grain in a hurry where the special order goes and the final doublecheck to be sure nothing has been left out the two routesone logistical and one physical – create the beaten track to the company’s motto “making it happen in maine” on the crown o’maine web site “it” is defined as “a community interconnected through a selfproviding food system that results in strong and vibrant local agriculture” but it has taken jim cook years to turn this from a personal vision into a viable business in his experience the concepts of food security local resilience to national and worldwide issues and “strengthening of rural communities” that are at once so vital and so nebulous can be made active and real through a fairlyrun food distribution system   “in this equation every member of this team farmerdistributorretailerconsumer must make enough to cover costs and receive value” jim says “the only time there will be a problem is when the costvalue ratio is wrong when price exceeds value and it doesn’t sell then we have a problem” he says this and then observes “in  years i can count on two fingers the number of problems we have encountered”         farmers quickly found they can ask the price they need to produce the crop purveyors dealing with comoc found the product unconditionally guaranteed and delivery dates timed to their locations for the freshest possible dropoff chefs who value good flavor discovered taste is a crown o’maine benchmark of marketability all parties involved have learned over years of cooperation that ‘mainegrown organic’ is not limited to this year’s crop if a certain crop doesn’t exist one year starting dialog with a farmer may bring it to harvest the next if a “market” seems to be the obstacle a phone call to jim may change the entire picture dozens of phone calls as early as seven in the morning countless emails and faxes and the weeklong process of taking requests and compiling product orders for farmers this is jim’s part in “making it happen in maine” this week however “making ‘it’ happen” hasn’t happened exactly as planned on board the delivery truck are greens and frozen strawberries from skylandia farm a freezer and a refrigerator and a halfton of fish meal fertilizer for a farmer in guilford – even after a sixhour delay though no fiddleheads have appeared from the st john river valley jim shrugs his shoulders as the truck departs “i’ll have to call everybody tomorrow” he says “and apologize” two hours later a call comes in to the farm “hello is jim there” he’s here all right “did you need some fiddleheads” it is not the neighbor who disappeared but an outoftheblue call from a second picker “sorry the truck left hours ago but stay in touch for next year” he says biting his tongue “most of the time we take the longer view” jim says once he’s off the phone referring to costefficiencies “the attitude that an endeavor must immediately make money or it can’t be done is shortsighted the first point is” he says repeating himself for emphasis “the first point is that is has to be done” no longer biting his tongue jim makes a second phone call “you going towards boston today” a muted response comes through “got room for four coolers to go to newport” within the hour jim has called back the picker and  pounds of fresh fiddleheads are riding south with a tractortrailer driver from a nearby truck company “if you admit that the challenges looming ahead are large” jim says “then you must agree that regional food security will be the backbone of our strength as we face these challenges … to be the strongest link in this chain is comoc’s mission” for more information about crown o’maine organic cooperative please visit wwwcrownofmainecoopcom
