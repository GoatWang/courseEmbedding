general summary of the federal income tax consequences of the purchase of shares by the fund from shareholders pursuant to the offer shareholders should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the specific tax consequences applicable to them valuation date         bassociated with a purchase of their shares by the fund pursuant to the offer including the effect and applicability of state local foreign and other tax laws and the possible effects of changes in federal or other tax lawsin general the purchase of shares from a shareholder pursuant to the offer will be a taxable transaction for us federal income tax purposes either as a “sale or exchange” or under certain circumstances as a “dividend” under section b of the internal revenue code of  as amended the “code” a purchase of shares pursuant to the offer generally will be treated as a “sale or exchange” if the receipt of cash by the shareholder in exchange for the shares a results in a “complete termination” of the shareholders interest in the fund b is “substantially disproportionate” with respect to the shareholder or c is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” with respect to the shareholder in determining whether any of these tests has been met shares actually owned as well as shares considered to be owned by the shareholder by reason of certain constructive ownership rules set forth in section  of the code generally must be taken into account if any of these three tests for “sale or exchange” treatment is met a shareholder will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the price paid by the fund for the shares repurchased in the offer and the shareholders adjusted tax basis in such shares if such shares are held as a capital asset the gain or loss will generally be capital gain or loss the maximum tax rate applicable to capital gains recognized by individuals and other noncorporate taxpayers is generally i the same as the applicable ordinary income rate for capital assets held for one year or less or ii either  or  for capital assets held for more than one year depending on whether the individual’s income exceeds certain threshold amounts if the requirements of section b of the code are not met amounts received by a shareholder in exchange for the shares repurchased pursuant to the offer will be taxable to the shareholder as a “dividend” to the extent of such shareholder’s allocable portion of the fund’s current or accumulated earnings and profits to the extent that amounts received exceed a shareholder’s allocable portion of the fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits such excess will constitute a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of such shareholder’s then adjusted tax basis in the shares and any amounts in excess of such shareholder’s adjusted tax basis will constitute taxable capital gain any remaining adjusted tax basis in the shares tendered to the fund will be transferred to any remaining shares held by such shareholder in addition if a purchase of shares pursuant to the offer is treated as a “dividend” to a tendering shareholder a constructive dividend under section c of the code may result to a nontendering shareholder whose proportionate interest in the earnings and assets of the fund has been increased by such tenderthe fund generally will be required to withhold tax at the rate of  “backup withholding” from any payment to a tendering shareholder that is an individual or certain other noncorporate persons if the shareholder fails to provide its correct taxpayer identification number to the fund or otherwise establish an exemption from the backup withholding tax rules backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld may be credited against a shareholder’s us federal income tax liabilitythe us federal income taxation of a nonus resident shareholder arising from a purchase of shares pursuant to the offer depends on whether this transaction is “effectively connected” with a valuation date         btrade or business carried on in the us by the nonus resident shareholder and if an income tax treaty applies on whether the nonus resident shareholder maintains a us permanent establishment as well as the tax characterization of the transaction as either a sale of the shares or a dividend distribution by the fund as discussed above if the purchase of shares pursuant to the offer is not so effectively connected or if an income tax treaty applies a nonus resident shareholder does not maintain a us permanent establishment and if such purchase is subject to “sale or exchange” rather than dividend treatment any gain realized by a nonus resident shareholder upon the tender of shares pursuant to the offer will not be subject to us federal income tax or to any us tax withholding provided however that such a gain will be subject to us federal income tax at the rate of  or such lower rate as may be applicable under an income tax treaty if the nonus resident shareholder is a nonresident alien individual who is physically present in the united states for more than  days during the taxable year of the sale if however a nonus resident shareholder is considered for the reasons described above to have received a distribution potentially subject to treatment as a dividend from the fund with respect to shares tendered the portion of the distribution treated as a dividend to the nonus resident shareholder would be subject to a us withholding tax at the rate of  or such lower rate as may be applicable under an income tax treaty if the dividend is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the united states by the nonus resident shareholder if the amount realized on the tender of shares by a nonus resident shareholder is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the united states by the nonus resident shareholder and if an income tax treaty applies and the nonus resident shareholder maintains a us permanent establishment regardless of whether the tender is characterized as a sale or as giving rise to a dividend distribution from the fund for us federal income tax purposes the transaction will be treated and taxed in the same manner as if the shares involved were tendered by a us shareholder any dividends received by a corporate nonus resident shareholder that are effectively connected with a us trade or business in which the corporate shareholder is engaged and if an income tax treaty applies are attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the corporate nonus resident shareholder also may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a  rate or lower applicable treaty ratenonus resident shareholders should provide the fund with a properly completed form wben form wbene form wimy form weci form wexp or other applicable us nonresident withholding tax certification in order to avoid backup withholding on the cash they receive from the fund regardless of how they are taxed with respect to the shares purchased pursuant to the offer a foreign financial institution or nonfinancial foreign entity that tenders shares that are

compliance act or “fatca” and applicable us treasury regulations promulgated thereunder at a rate of  of the gross proceeds payable to such foreign financial institution or nonfinancial foreign entity unless such foreign financial institution or nonfinancial foreign entity provides to the applicable withholding agent a properly completed form wben form wbene form wimy form weci form wexp or other
