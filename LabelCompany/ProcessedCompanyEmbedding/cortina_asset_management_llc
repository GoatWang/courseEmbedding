highlights employs a timetested “franchise investing” approach to stock selection favors unique defendable companies with established growth profiles and advantageous industry positioning qualitative and quantitative business model analysis is performed with intensive reviews during company meetings franchise companies aren’t easily captured through quantitative screening throughout all market conditions our consistent investment discipline drives decision making market timing is not employed investment strategy the small cap opportunity strategy seeks longterm investments in companies with strong business models that will consistently produce industry leading earnings and cash flow growth exceptional business models are often found where a company has established a differentiated franchise or where a secular trend creates favorable supply and demand imbalances franchise companies are unique and often misunderstood or unacknowledged during the formative stage of a company’s life cycle as a result such companies often sell below their intrinsic value even though they are likely growing faster than the overall market and generating high levels of free cash flow correctly assessing the duration of a company’s franchise advantage or favorable secular trend is absolutely critical very few businesses ultimately stand the test of time over several decades or even years investment process our fourphase process to research and investment encompasses discovery analysis investment and exit the first stage of the investment process is discovery where various methods are simultaneously employed to uncover potential investments ideas are generated from inperson management meetings industry conferences occasional database screening wall street analyst contacts and industry channel checks cortina analysts and portfolio managers hold more than  private meetings each year with small cap companies analysis the second phase involves an indepth examination of a company’s business and its competitive positioning the primary focus is an operational and financial assessment of the company which builds the foundation for the stock price valuation increasing operating margins high levels of free cash flow and rising return on equity are specifically targeted in many cases we construct financial models to forecast earnings and cash flow growth after identifying an attractive portfolio candidate the investment is closely monitored frequent meetings with company officials as well as an independent analysis of the latest business fundamentals permit continual assessment of the risk and rewards of the security quarterly earnings reports industry conferences and channel checks provide regular data points for tracking a company’s progress against our expectations the final stage in the research process is the exit whether the price objective was reached or the fundamental story changed along with the security’s valuation a stock is sold when the riskreward ratio becomes unfavorable the portfolio managers employ a  peak pullback rule and a strict price decline rule to capture strong investment returns while limiting capital losses franchise investing regardless of market capitalization the best performing stocks over time are those with the highest level of free cash flow generation the driver of exceptionally high cash flow generation is almost always a company’s unique positioning within an industry as well as favorable industry dynamics that permit such success since all industries and sectors ultimately cycle through good and bad periods the ability for one company to surpass all others in cash flow generation is often due to unique “franchise” characteristics these companies exploit their niche instead of hoping to someday invent one these companies run circles around their larger peers instead of running from them the small cap sectors with the greatest share of franchise companies are health care technology
