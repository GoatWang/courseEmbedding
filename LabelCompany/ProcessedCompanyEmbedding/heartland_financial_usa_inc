community bank careers wisconsin bank careers new mexico bank and trust careers arizona bank and trust careers rocky mountain bank careers centennial bank and trust careers minnesota bank and trust careers citizens finance careers national residential careers morrill  janes bank careers contact us the start of making great things happen™ before heartland financial there was dubuque bank and trust a community bank born of the great depression it served the area independently until  when the economic environment demanded change the banking industry was struggling with the uncertainties of deregulation and interest rates hit an alltime high bringing the economy to its knees our hometown of dubuque iowa received national attention as the city with the highest unemployment rate in the nation reaching well into double digits as the community’s two largest employers experienced layoffs and real estate values crashed through the floor  in  dbt was very closely held and the question pondered by a number of its directors was “how can we retain the benefits of locally managed community banking while preserving and increasing the value of our shares for future generations” as history has proven time and again out of the darkest times come great new visions and this was certainly the case with heartland  the vision the concept of community banking was near and dear to the hearts of our visionary directors at that time they were convinced that a community bank model based on local ownership and local decisionmaking would have value well into the future directors william c brown lynn s fuller evangeline k jansen james a schmid and fw woodward all had banking relationships with large regional banks as well as with their own community bank dubuque bank and trust and had experienced the ease of doing business with a community bank  to position the company for future expansion the directors decided that a holding company should be formed mapping a new course for the company the creation of heartland bankcorp subsequently renamed heartland financial usa inc resulted in a onebank holding company its sole asset was dubuque bank and trust with  million in assets and five offices in dubuque county the company was now poised for growth and geographic diversification of risk  early progress in the following  years heartland acquired its first outofstate bank in illinois galena state bank and trust with the  acquisition of first community bank fsb keokuk iowa heartland shares were registered with the sec and for the first time heartland stock was publicly traded during the mids heartland continued its midwest expansion with the formation of riverside community bank in rockford illinois additionally we acquired what is now wisconsin bank  trust in madison and monroe with subsequent expansion into green bay and sheboygan wisconsin  growing a legacy following early acquisitions in the midwest heartland gained the experience and acquired the technology needed to reach more distant markets beginning in the late s the company ventured west actively expanding with both acquisition and de novo activity in new mexico arizona montana and colorado as well as minnesota kansas and missouri all supported by the company’s centralized stateoftheart backroom operations in dubuque  in recent years heartland has increased the percent of total assets held in our western banks moving closer to our goal of an equal distribution of assets between our midwestern and western banks  surpassing expectations in  the listing of heartland stock on the nasdaq national market system brought closure to the question originally pondered by the company’s organizers heartland was now traded nationally on a major stock exchange and could provide its shareholders increased liquidity and attractive returns  our commitment to an enhanced customer experience was demonstrated in  when we announced a significant addition to our residential mortgage lending capabilities our team of mortgage banking professionals and executives is headquartered in phoenix arizona mortgage services are offered within our bank footprint as well as in nevada and idaho  growing tradition looking ahead we see an attractive position for heartland by virtue of our size as we strategically operate between the mega banks and small community banks banking today is a business of scale as an organization with a multibillion of assets we have the resources to afford highly qualified talent stateoftheart technology continued investment in training product development and compliance we are able to offer products and services that are competitive with the largest banks and still deliver the hightouch personalized banking experience our clients appreciate      all

spotlight heartland financial usa inc it infrastructure monitoring ibm i posted jan th    charles bertsch and paul duval are part of the operations team at heartland financial a multibank holding company based out of dubuque iowa these guys were excited to share how robot job scheduling and monitoring software has helped them manage their processing needs across platforms from their iseries with a goal of doubling in size every five to seven years the processing window was a concern they needed tools that could grow with their business and came up with some creative solutions using robot  centralize scheduling on the iseries prior to robot operations at heartland financial involved a lot of manual processes and problems with temperamental builtin task schedulers their third shift would run nightly processing until  am and then run manual jobs afterwards because operators had to physically watch them they started using native schedulers for some of those jobs but the challenge there was that their nightly workflow never ended at exactly the same time due to the amount of guesswork in timing managing nightly processes and  separate monthend jobs on the ibm scheduler and windows scheduler was tough what really intrigued heartland with the robot products was being able to have the iseries applications control all their jobs not only on the iseries but on the windows scheduler as well using robot schedule and robot schedule enterprise following an update to their fiserv signature software they were able to use the schedule activity monitor sam in robot schedule to spot the handful of jobs that didn’t run see what queries they were calling step through them and kick off the jobs again all from a single dashboard the sam is the first thing their operators check—they look for the red “x” and attempt to rerun the job  establish fiserv message archive for auditors the fiserv signature application does not provide a canned report confirming that all jobs completed and that’s really what their auditors expected to see when heartland kicks off a nightly process it runs a batch job stream that spawns several different jobs and messages which the operators watch to make sure it completes before moving on to the next bank but try to explain that to an auditor they’d say “how do you know they watched it to completion” paul used the global programming in robot console to look for specific message ids from each bank the messages confirm when backups and batch jobs are complete robot catches these messages from fiserv and emails them to the operations team who archive them for auditors to prove that any given job or backup finished without digging through job logs all they need is the message from robot alert which says exactly what auditors need to hear  track disk space usage for cost allocation before robot heartland lacked disk accounting services across their  independently chartered banks and  banking locations changes in library size for their many banks needed to be tracked so they could allocate costs using robot space they’ve been able to monitor library growth and analyze existing trends to make space for new data they also use the size of their data libraries to do allocations after jobs run the first of the month for example charles can go back and graph out their status how big the libraries are each month how they change and fluctuate heartland just concluded a rollout project putting robot scheduling and monitoring products on all their test partitions to create true simulations of their production environment they have storage thresholds and notifications in place for the production environment and look forward to pushing out robot space to their test partitions to help manage disk space there as well  optimize existing staff when they were smaller heartland had more time to deal with the eccentricities of native schedulers but with recent acquisitions and more planned for the coming years their growth strategy demanded a scalable solution reliable processing was even more missioncritical if things continued to err out as often as it did before robot the only solution would be to have somebody watching the system at all times as they add banks and processing their goal is to position themselves to handle the rapid growth and fold in additional banks while maintaining the same processing window without adding staff automation was huge for them to maintain that window so they would have time to run their extracts on a consistent basis without robot heartland would have had to add staff to monitor jobs overnight robot jobs run unattended and do what they’re intended to do when the operations team arrives in the morning and checks the dashboard the jobs are consistent  leverage robot tech support when they first began using robot products heartland was coming away from manual processes and builtin schedulers on the iseries and windows they had a lot of entries to move over and on the enterprise side they had to make sure the services were running on specific servers naturally they were a little apprehensive about making sure the conversion went well the migration tool in robot was helpful and they did some training for their core group to get them familiar with the products they also spent a lot of time working with roxanne callan a technical consultant at helpsystems paul tells us she was really helpful and that they pretty much had a direct line to her phone in comparison to their other software vendors charles ranked robot support services “definitely above average” heartland is comfortable calling or using the online chat option to get the answers or assistance they need in setting up anything they’re trying to do we asked them to sum up their experience with helpsystems and the robot products in ten words or less they did it in three great support simple   learn more read the full case study for more ways robot helped
