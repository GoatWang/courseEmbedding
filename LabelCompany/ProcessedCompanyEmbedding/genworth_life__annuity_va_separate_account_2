insurance or fixed annuities after march  genworth financial a top longtermcare insurance company is suspending new sales of life insurance products and fixed annuities to help reverse financial lossesthe move will help save the company  million in annual expenses said david o’leary president and ceo of genworth us life insurance in a letter to customers distributors and partners the decision is part of a broader reorganization to “increase our financial and strategic flexibility” he addedlife annuity and longterm care inforce clients should see no change in their policies or how those policies are serviced o’leary saidthe company has  million life and annuity policy and contract holders and beneficiaries he said a topfive seller of longterm care products genworth said it would “separate and isolate” its longterm care block of businessthe past three years have been difficult for the richmond vabased company as it deals with obligations to millions of longterm care policyholders in a lowinterest rate environmentthe latest quarterly earnings reports showed the company’s losses narrowing fourthquarter loss was  million compared to a loss of  million in the yearago period the company reportedadjusted for nonrecurring costs and to account for discontinued operations losses came to  cents per share missing the average of five analysts surveyed by zacks investment research by  centsasked by one analyst during friday’s quarterly earnings call if the company was open to splitting itself up president and ceo thomas mcinerney said that would be a possibilitythe restructuring of the company’s life insurance business is significant and the company will execute with a sense of urgency he said calling the restructuring “significant” mcinerney said the company was undertaking the move with “a sense of urgency”products no longer soldeffective march  genworth will no longer accept applications for its asset builder index universal life ii foundation builder

effective for all states except arkansas south dakota and texas the company saidproducers’ renewal compensation on inforce business will not be affected by the changes the company addeddue to ratings issues and suspension of sales on the part of distributors the company’s sale of traditional life and fixed annuity products would simply “not recover” genworth executives saidthe company’s us life insurance segment which include life fixed annuities and longterm care reported a fourthquarter net loss of  million that is much improved from the  million loss the segment reported in the yearago period the company saidhigher claim counts and higher severity were partly to blame the company saidlegacy ltc policies isolated while the company’s asset sales over the past two years have helped it exceed capital ratios required of regulators genworth said it was nevertheless “isolating” its longterm care legacy block of business that line continues to “pressure ratings across the organization” the company saiddiscussions with us regulators convinced senior company managers that genworth has an important role to play in the longterm care business mcinerney saidregulators in many states have authorized price increases that the company is asking for on inforce longterm care policies he explainedwith only about a dozen companies selling longterm care in the us and with genworth a consistent topfive longterm care player the company has a much better chance of doing well in the segment mcinerney saidby contrast there are thousands of life and annuity carriers in the us and genworth doesn’t break the top  in terms of us individual annuity sales according to limra datathe market for longterm care is growing so it makes sense for genworth to build on its marketleader position particularly if private longterm care can help alleviate publically funded longterm care costs borne by medicaid executives said“our society is aging and the need for caregiving is increasing and we believe this market opportunity provides significant potential for profitable growth” o’leary said in his letter to customers distributors and partnersunder the restructuring plan the company will operate through

carrier step  distributors respond “i would never sell a company with this rating” step  sales slump allowing agencies to say “see we predicted this”reply spot on stevereply i don’t think soreply yes insurance is hard enough to sell on good ratings and prices there was one client i closed it took me three months just for an appointmentreply agreed not that genworth has ever been a good sign for managment of an insurance company remember genworth is the result of ge capital buying out a bunch of insurance companies then spinning it off i think amex was the first but not sure i know when genworth got a hold of continental life in brentwood an independent company prior to that buyout things went downhill fast from a “doing business with the company” point of view thankfully aetna purchased the company from genworth and things have improved quite a bit the companies now part of the genworth family were once solid very solid carriers only to be messed up by genworth management style life of virginia and first colony are examples of once great life companies that have lost their identities and their mojo i do understand wanting to buy a profitable insurance company but i don’t understand buying it and then changing everything about how it is managed if it ain’t broke don’t fix it the people running the company obviously knew the magic formula to make it all work — the last thing needed is a bunch of mba’s who never worked the business to come in and start changing things to the defense of the rating agencies multipleyear losses and the the selling off of assets to keep the regulators at bay isn’t the best of circumstancesreply exactly right siri received a letter from selectquote that states they do not offer products less than a rating and genworth was down graded to b you are spot onreply long term care is the culprit it’s a product filled with risk for both genworth and the policyholder no guaranteed rate structure for either genworth or the policyholder poor claims experience historically and rate increases for the clientsreply this seems to be an argument aimed more at “long term care” as an insurable risk than at genworth as a company ironically genworth is taking the opposite position and throwing their weight behind long term care as the profitable path forwardreply long term care short term care i’m starting to wonder if some employees of this insurance company really did care or even know what the word meantreply what struck me as odd is the notion that life insurance isn’t profitable thousands of companies big and little that only sell life insurance and annuities all making a profit seems to me that the life insurance division would have been providing a profit base to weather the downturns of the longterm care business as we all know when you jack up the rates on a health policy most of those who cancel are the healthy ones thus creating a worse pool than before the rate increase which means another rate increase will be necessary    the things that snowballs are made ofreply there has been a long and tangled history with this company first known as first colony some years ago they tried to “securitize” through the use of derivatives the very essence of our business responsible risk taking as they say in the fall on sunday upon further review the truly curious will find that to be the symptom the reaction as well as the culpritreply i first wrote business and formed a general agency selling fcl first colony life in  they were known for having the smartest people and for consistentlycompetitive policies at least for years with gnw – bought other companies like fcl – were at the cutting edge of technology also was quite exciting now those like myself with ‘blocks of business ‘ and it’s surprisingly archaicreply i am an almost  yo policy holder just got a notice from genworth they are raising our premium  per year and expect it to go up again in future ours is a good policy with inflation protection yet i’m worried they will go out of business before i get to use it we have paid in over  in premiums so far for the last  years we can downsize the policy and pay the same or get a paid up policy for the premiums paid in or pay the new rate and keep it as is any ideas of what to doreply you may not know this but you have more options than the carrier will often tell you about in your rate increase notice you can reduce your years of care andor reduce your daily benefit andor reduce your inflation protection percentage to adjust your premium you could also increase your deductible called the “elimination period” in your ltc policy call your agent and ask him or her to get all of the options that would make sense for you to consider the multiyear lowinterest rate environment is the primary factor insufficient investment return on your premiums to pay expected claims but also more policyholders are surviving their cancers heart disease strokes
