juan ernesto de bedout president latin american operations kimberyclark corporation bsie  msie  for his innovative leadership and outstanding managerial abilities which have brought dramatic growth and success to a major international manufacturing corporation the schools of engineering are proud to present the distinguished engineering alumnus award to juan ernesto de bedout on his experience at purdue the exposure to both the american environment and the very diverse international community is one of the purdue experiences i most value relating to individuals and groups from so many different backgrounds provided a strong cultural sensitivity and understanding that has served me well in what is becoming an increasingly global scenario i recently learned that purdue currently enrolls more international students than any public research institution in the united states what a stimulating setting in which to be able to study on the beginnings of his career my first interest was in a greenfield specialtypapers plant that was being built by kimberlyclark and its local associates in medellín colombia where i was born and raised i followed up quickly and although i was informed that the initial team was already in place the partners asked me to join them ironically some years later i was asked to manage that very same partnership and that is how my career with kimberlyclark began quite frankly ive always wanted the accountability of being in charge but i never imagined that this would take me to other geographies and to where i am now on globalization since the berlin wall came down the world has been shrinking better communications and declining barriers have been key elements of this process however cultural fragmentation is expanding as people try to preserve their identities and as a result more countries are coming into view all over the world companies may claim to have a global perspective but how sensitive are they to local idiosyncrasies knowing that various people think and react differently is essential to a true global approach on business philosophy to be delighted but never satisfied is a principal business philosophy that i have fully embraced from an extraordinary mentor for whom i have the highest respect kimberlyclark is a very resultsoriented corporation and were delighted with good results but always strive for more and enjoy doing so with our recent entry into many latin american countries a major challenge has been constructing a strong leadership platform in this part of the world building this foundation has rendered a great sense of accomplishment it also represents employment for  individuals in latin america and has provided consumers with quality products such as huggies diapers and kleenex tissues on his personal involvements my most significant personal endeavor has been raising and mentoring my two sons nicolas and juan manuel both are engineers with graduate degrees and juan manuel is finishing his doctoral program in mechanical engineering at purdue my dedication to them has been amply rewarded with the satisfaction of seeing them blossom into fine morally upstanding individuals i am also proud that my nephew juan diego velasquez de bedout is following my same career path at purdue on communityrelated matters my affiliation with the colombian american chamber of commerce in medellín was one of my most gratifying as i was involved in its formation and direction this provided a means of bringing together matters concerning the two countries with which i have had my closest ties on purdues future as a recent member of purdues engineering visiting committee i have been impressed by the schools vision to be the best similarly the newly established business management program in germany is a prime example of the increasing sphere of influence that the universitys administration has forged one need not go far to note that the alumni being brought together by the schools of engineering in this years convocation of which i am deeply honored to be a part reflects backgrounds from chile colombia india norway and the united states evidencing purdues longstanding international scope i see very very good things ahead   member engineering visiting committee purdue university  addition of the caribbean to latin american area of responsibility in kimberlyclark 
