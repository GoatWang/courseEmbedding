manufacturer portfolioservices  partssuppliesoff lease equipment call us  homespecialsformsabout uscontact usbecome a dealer about us bruce collins president by bruce collins president in the beginning the concept for collins distributing was discussed with me when i was twelve years old in a sidewalk café in gatlinburg tennessee my father bill explained to his family that his employer wanted him to move from our home in memphis in his role as regional sales manager we didnt care for the idea much and then he explained another option he could go into business for himself selling typewriters and such to the dealer network he had developed in many years of sales on the road he explained it may be tough at first and the family needed to be ready to make sacrifices if needed but he knew he could make it work so collins distributing was born in  with a station wagon and office equipment and supplies stored in our carport attic he hit the road during the s and s collins distributing had great success and had developed a wide range of products and a very loyal customer base products started with typewriters and ribbons and grew to calculators copiers typewriter elements remember those we even made privatelabel spray paint for machine touchups the most lucrative product for collins was reconditioned typewriters a concept that has been reborn today at collins with copiers the trouble years collins fell on bad times in the late s and early s the company was having trouble adjusting to the lack of demand for reconditioned equipment due to the new lower priced equipment in the marketplace also margins were sharply lower and inventory requirements were higher which meant borrowing money on top of tough business conditions bill still the active president of the company started an eight year battle with parkinsons disease before long collins couldnt keep up with its competitors and business dwindled collins distributing reborn in  i bought collins distributing company after graduating from college in  i spent my time as a cpa banker and developed something of a reputation for rebuilding broken companies well collins distributing was broken i would like to say i rode in on my white horse and saved the day but there was much more to it than that  hard work luck and timing played a big part in the course of six months in late  we had obtained much needed working capital from sba loans hired knowledgeable and experienced personnel and reestablished our distributor relationship with sharp which had been lost before you knew it we were back in business in  our sales surpassed  million which was the largest year in the history of collins distributing and already exceeding our fiveyear plan as a side note my father bill passed away later in  but i would bring him down to work every now and then let him sit at his desk which is mine now go to the post office to open checks and greet local dealers he had seen his company reborn collins distributing today today our company is one of the leading office equipment distributors in the country with sales of approximately  million annually we represent four of the finest manufacturers in the country sharp toshiba samsung and konica minolta we also are one of the leading distributors of reconditioned offlease copiers in the country whats the reason for this success there are many but one stands out above the rest collins distributing has assembled the finest staff of any company i have ever been around every company president says that  but i really mean it our
