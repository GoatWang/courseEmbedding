the investment business it is easy to talk about diversification most investors understand that it is beneficial to diversify their assets so most investment providers focus their marketing efforts on their devotion to diversification however the measure of a firm’s commitment to effective diversification can be found in the strategy or lack thereof they employ at capital directions our investment strategy is based on the science of investing built upon decades of academic research and institutional application our portfolios are designed to accomplish one single task – to capture the market’s return while minimizing risk through prudent diversification our philosophy is firmly grounded in both efficientmarket hypothesis emh and modern portfolio theory mpt emh helps us understand asset pricing it asserts that all known information is already reflected in the value of any asset thereby making it is improbable to consistently uncover securities whose real value deviates from its market value with millions of investors seeking the highest riskadjusted return on their capital competition quickly drives prices to their fair value  mpt guides us in the construction of our portfolios one of the most important and influential economic theories ever postulated it won the nobel prize in  mpt provides the framework for creating optimal portfolios by closely considering the relationship between risk and reward mpt proved that by commingling poorly correlated asset classes together in a portfolio the portfolio’s risk could actually be lower than the sum of its individual parts mpt is the gold standard for prudent diversification in fact it was the underpinning of the uniform prudent investors act which governs prudent fiduciary procedure in  states in the us contrary to what wall street would like you to believe market timing and security selection add very little if any return to a portfolio and we eschew such tactics in our portfolio management we do not follow the latest investment fads chase performance or engage in will emotionbased trading in our clients’ portfolios all of these activities will significantly reduce the probability of delivering the riskadjusted returns that are there for the taking for investors – and their advisors – who stay the course instead using emh and mpt as our guides we focus our actions on factors that have a high probability of creating a successful investment strategy  diversifying both within and across a wide variety of asset classes  minimizing fees and transaction costs as much as possible and  maximizing our clients’ aftertax returns finally we will closely monitor the portfolio to ensure the structural integrity is never compromised  by embracing proven academic theories and building an investment strategy focused on factors that can be controlled we can create portfolios that have a much greater likelihood of success for our clients than the typical tradingintensive performance chasing

rebalancing our beliefs it has been said that golf is a simple game but not an easy game and the same could well be said of investing history shows that the stock market has always rewarded investors who were welldiversified and invested for the longterm and yet most investors do not enjoy those rewards a  study by dalbar inc revealed this disconnect it showed that during the year period from  –  the stock market enjoyed an annual return of  per year meanwhile the average investor earned only  a year  so if the path to investment success is so simple … why do so many investors deviate from that path in a word emotion investors fail to appreciate the nearly insurmountable pull that emotions have on their investment decisions in booming markets such as the dotcom bubble in the late s the dominant emotion is greed in periods of market turmoil such as the financial crisis of  the dominant emotion is fear both fear and greed are the enemies of investment success because they cause investors to make shortsighted decisions that deviate from their longterm investment plan and those shortterm movements end up costing investors as a group billions in lost returns yearafteryear – returns that were there for the taking we believe therefore that one of the key responsibilities of an outstanding wealth manager is to be the emotional barrier between clients and their money to create a prudent welldiversified investment strategy appropriate for the client’s needs and then act as a voice of calm reason during periods of market extremes to make sure there are no emotiondriven deviations from that strategy this will help ensure that our clients are in the market all the time to enjoy its longterm rewards to minimize the investor’s emotions we believe an outstanding wealth manager must minimize unnecessary volatility and that is why at capital directions we employ the tenets of modern portfolio theory as our investment strategy spotlight capital ideas visit our

dissent jack calhoun  principal examining the common nonsense that causes investors to fail flight or freeze august  “don’t just stand there – do something” that is the refrain of anxiety fear and panic it is the fightorflight survival instinct put into words – a plea to do anything other than stay put sometimes the notion of taking action makes perfect sense if for instance your car stalls out on the railroad tracks and a freight train comes barreling around the bend then staying put is clearly unwise when it comes to investing however the notion of “taking action” during times of perceived danger in the market is misguided and dangerous and it is precisely the sort of counterintuitive concept central to investment success that very few people who manage their own portfolios are ever able to understand or embrace before we explore this notion in more depth a caveat the wisdom of staying put during periods of market turmoil depends entirely on the soundness of your current strategy investors with portfolios heavily concentrated in individual stocks or invested in narrow market sectors should indeed take action to diversify their portfolios but the time do this is before the market volatility swoops in and knocks your portfolio value in half or more see wachovia delta gm et al for those who are invested in a welldiversified portfolio strategy it is vital to stay the course in times of turmoil unfortunately the “blink moments” as we call them always coincide with the exact moment of maximum stress in the market the greater the stress the harder it is to say put because every time we pick up the paper click on the financial web site or turn on the tv we hear the “experts” urging us to “do something” but what exactly is the “something this is the logical next step in this progression and the one that people usually fail to consider when panic sets in as it did in the fall of  and again in the summer of  investors become obsessed with “fleeing from” without considering what they are “running to with that in mind let’s examine what investors historically have considered the safe havens in times of turmoil to see if they really are a safer alternative to stocks gold gold is often touted as a safe haven in turbulent markets and as a way to moderate volatility or even generate healthy returns the reality however is that gold is a more volatile asset than common stocks over the past  years the volatility of gold as measured by standard deviation was  versus sp  volatility of   and this was during a decade that saw three significant market declines many people fled to gold following the downgrade of the us debt rating in august  and yet from september  through june  the price of gold plunged from  to  a decline of  during the same time the sp  rose  from  to  those who fled stocks for gold and thought they were getting “safety” actually suffered a cumulative loss of more than  bonds fixedincome is the traditional asset class used to moderate equity volatility in the past four years however individual investors have flooded into fixed income as a refuge from the perceived risk of investing in stocks in just the second quarter of  – and despite a  gain in stocks the prior six months – volatilityweary investors pulled  billion from stock funds and plowed  billion into bond funds unfortunately many such investors are only trading a perceived risk for a guaranteed risk having found the extremely low yields of high credit quality bonds to be unattractive the current barclays aggregate bond index yield is  many investors are running to high yield low credit quality bonds in pursuit of returns unfortunately these junk bonds will suffer significant losses of principal when interest rates rise exposing their investors to significant volatility as seen in the chart below high yield bonds have risk more closely aligned with equities than high credit quality bonds on top of this the low interest rate environment and high demand for safer assets has driven bonds to significant premiums when compared with equities the price to earnings ratio of the barclays aggregate bond index has skyrocketed to  vs  for the sp  cash there can be a temptation to throw one’s arms up pull out of the market and seek the safety of cash amid uncertainty however there is a very real risk of loss of purchasing power if fleeing exclusively to cash inflation in the us as measured by the consumer price index has been  over the past  years with current average money market rates at  inflation will rapidly erode a pure cash position’s real value often times investors view a move to cash as temporary vowing to get back in the market once volatility subsides unfortunately such investors usually make a move to cash after they have experienced the downturn and then fail to get back in the market in time for the subsequent rebound investors pulled billions from stock mutual funds last fall and fled to cash after the market’s dramatic plunge following the downgrade in the us credit rating those who waited just two months to get back in the market however missed a  gain in the sp  and if they waited six months they missed a  gain the bottom line is that investing involves risk the best way to mitigate that risk is to have a welldiversified portfolio and a proper balance of stocks and bonds appropriate to your risk and return needs after that the best strategies you can employ are time patience faith and fortitude history shows that market downturns have always worked themselves out over time – if you stayed put as one of the industry’s most respected and revered figures vanguard founder john bogle says about market downturns “don’t just do something – stand there” data sources morningstar direct financeyahoocom wwwkitcocom wwwstandardandpoorscom dimensional returns  email a friend print this article your name email email to title body hello i thought you would find this article interesting is the rally for real march  a recent article in the atlanta journal constitution featured an angle that i have seen frequently in the media in the past few weeks which can be summed up in five words “is the rally for real” in other words are stocks going to continue to climb or are we due for another downturn my first thought whenever i read these articles is what do they mean by “real” when i look at the gains stocks have enjoyed going back to the recent market low in october they certainly seem real to me so the actual question that is being asked in these articles is will the market keep going up now we get to the heart of the issue the folks who are really worried about whether the stock rally is real are the ones who didn’t participate in it they are the investors – and investment managers – who got out of the market back in the summer or never got in it at all after bailing out in  those investors are terrified of buying high and enduring another downturn in the market which would further compound their losses they are stuck in the neverending spiral that is market timing always wondering when to get out and when to get back in the intrepid investors who have stayed put are enjoying their doubledigit gains going back to october – and tripledigit gains going back to march  – and aren’t as anxious about whether the rally is “real” they have much to show for their discipline and they know that if the market does go down in the short term it will sooner or later reverse its course again they don’t have to worry about buying high and selling low because they don’t engage in that loser’s game the simple fact is that the market just gained between  and  in about five month’s time and the bulk of those gains came in october when the european debt crisis was in peak frenzy and things were a long way from “calm” folks who got out of the market just until things “calmed down” now have their wish and they have a conundrum while they were waiting for things to calm down the market took off and now they sit on the sidelines wondering what to do the rally is for “real” because it “really” happened whether the market goes up down or sideways from here is beside the point the lesson is that gains happen in the stock market right when you least expect it and you want to be sure you are there when they happen   email a friend print this article your name email email to title body hello i thought you would find this article interesting is the recent market volatility really unprecedented november  i attended a symposium in austin texas recently where the esteemed finance professor gene fama addressed our group if you aren’t familiar with dr fama he is one of the pioneers of efficient market research is often referred to as “the father of modern finance” and has been a candidate for the nobel prize in economics so to borrow the old ef hutton line “when dr fama speaks people listen” after his presentation dr fama took some questions from the crowd and his response to one of them caught my attention when asked for his perspective about the extreme volatility that has been plaguing the financial markets since august – and really since  – he had an interesting response “the volatility we have seen is not unusual from a longterm historical perspective” dr fama said “but it is unusual compared to the volatility we became used to over the past few decades” this may be hard for you to believe but it’s easy to see looking back at the historical record while volatility in recent years has spiked it is consistent with other times of turbulence notably the s and ‘s and in truth it has been a good deal less volatile than the depression era this may not exactly be comforting but it is at least informing “but wait” you say “why do i keep reading about the ‘unprecedented volatility’ we are seeing in the market today” the answer is that the media isn’t interested in perspective it is interested in drama financial reporters love to focus on point declines in the market because it draws people’s attention and when reporters get to go on air and breathlessly tell us that the dow experienced say its fourthlargest point decline ever that makes for some captive viewers point declines however are very different from percentage declines and percentage declines are really the only logical way to judge volatility after all a oneday drop of  points at dow  is not nearly of the same significance as it was at dow  which happened in october  at dow  that decline was about  at dow  it was about  in that regard consider the following list of the  largest oneday percentage declines in the dow jones’ modern history notice anything interesting about this chart that’s right – not one of the declines from recent weeks even made the top  largest percentage declines and even at the height of the panic in  only one day cracked the top  so i take exception with the argument that these swings in the market have been unprecedented this isn’t to say however that the recent swings haven’t been unusual referring back to the table it is interesting to note that fully  years passed between the  downturn at  and “black monday”  the mother of all oneday percentage declines that is  by a large margin looking back at a timeline of oneday percentage swings of  or more in the dow from  –  we can see this trend in which volatility took a long holiday during middle part of the century so while we can’t say the market volatility we have seen in the past few years has been unprecedented we really have to go back to the depression era to find a time that rivaled our current market environment this is consistent with a central reality financial crises lead to extreme volatility in the financial markets and until the crisis is resolved the volatility will likely remain and we are in the midst of the worst financial crisis we have seen since the s while politicians trade in rhetoric markets deal with realities and the reality the market sees right now is a heavily indebted developed world that can’t meet its obligations and so in its own heavy handed way the market is forcing the issue by essentially voting on the policy moves that european and american governments are making to improve their balance sheets the market is applying pressure to politicians by giving a bronx cheer to any efforts it deems ineffective in getting our debt crisis under control and the same thing is happening overseas in europe and this is serving to force our politicians to deal with things they’d just as soon kick down the road to the next crisis in the short to intermediateterm therefore stock volatility may well be like the relative who drops by and then just keeps hanging around wearing out his welcome in the long run however issues and crises have a way of resolving themselves as the old economic saying goes “if something can’t continue it won’t” this is where longterm investors need to be extremely careful about the dangers of as financial writer nick murray refers to it “volatility fatigue” after years of enduring wild swings in the market it can be easy for investors to throw in the towel and flee the market “until things calm down” but the stock market is a leading economic indicator and things turn decisively upward in the market long before crises resolve themselves we saw this coming out of the bear market lows in march  and no doubt we’ll see it again as events in the developed world resolve themselves in the years ahead alas just as we saw two years ago most of the investing public will be on the sidelines when it happens email a friend print this article your name email email to title body hello i thought you would find this article interesting muni bond mayhem or just another version of a nightmare on main street february  one of the most painful things about my line of work is watching the investing public commit one grievous mistake after another and being unable to do anything about it i can help my clients avoid the emotional reactionary missteps that are so tempting in times of turmoil but there is nothing i can do for the masses who seem predestined hey i’m a good presbyterian to destroy themselves in every conceivable market cycle no matter what the situation the majority of investors do the wrong thing every time it’s like being forced to watch a horror movie in slow motion over and over and over again… so as i look at the recent happenings in the municipal bond market all i can think is “here comes a nightmare on main street part ” first for some context here is a brief review of the average american investor we’ll call him “john q public” and his experience over the past  years • in the late s john q public loaded up on technology stocks especially “dotcom” stocks when the bubble burst in the spring of  he lost about  of his investable assets • after the tech bubble burst mr public took whatever funds he had left and fled to the “safety” of cash investments and he did indeed feel safe there for awhile until the market suddenly took off in the spring of  gaining  in  months while he earned  in moneymarket funds • in the mids mr public then tiptoed back into the risk pool but he was still wary of stocks from his frightening experience in the  bear market so he split the difference and went mostly into bonds just in time for interest rates to go up which caused his bonds to fall in value he lost money here too • with the stock market back to record highs by  john q public realized what a fool he had been the recovery was complete and all was safe with stocks and oh what returns those financial and real estate stocks had delivered he loaded up on rocksolid banks and financial service companies then the subprime financial crisis hit the dow fell nearly  over the next two years and many financial stocks went under entirely by early  mr public was once again completely fed up with “losing money in stocks” and went back to cash locking in catastrophic losses • right on cue the market enjoyed its strongest gain in  years from its march  low the dow gained  in  months but mr public missed it by late  – fed up with making literally nothing in cash – john q public went not to those risky old stocks but back to bonds safe secure bonds except the safe secure bonds weren’t delivering returns much higher than cash so mr public went searching for “yield” moving farther out on the yield curve and lower down in credit quality he invested in the supposed safety of municipal bonds but opted for the higheryielding longerterm variety – never stopping to wonder why those bonds were producing such high yields in a low interestrate environment and that brings us inevitably to today’s “muni bond crisis” that has been heavily touted in the headlines last fall famed analyst meredith whitney issued a dire forecast for municipal bonds and small investors panicked en masse municipal bond funds were swamped with redemption requests forcing many of the funds to dump their bonds on the market at discounted prices to raise cash that created a huge glut of bonds on the open market and prices dropped accordingly most experts believe that the muni bond market overall remains extremely secure in a report last month ratings agency standard  poors noted “we believe the crises that many state and local administrators find themselves in are policy crises rather than questions of governments continued ability to exist and function… the crises are more about tough decisions than potential defaults see standard  poors us states and municipalities face crises more of policy than debt sp went on to say in the report that for significant defaults to occur state and local governments would have to face revenue declines roughly double to what they were during the great depression – an unlikely scenario to say the least unfortunately small investors have not grasped this reality and are selling muni bonds without regard to risk or return that has forced yields higher because new issues coming to market must be competitive with the existing issues being sold at firesale prices on the secondary market and that in turn has sent prices lower for all existing muni bonds what is lost on most investors is that municipal bonds come in almost as many flavors as baskin robbins’ ice cream consider this while there are only about  publicly traded stocks in the us there are millions of municipal bond issues in a wide variety of structures there are general obligation bonds revenue bonds prerefunded bonds insured bonds taxable muni bonds escrowedtomaturity bonds and many others the type of bond the maturity of the bond and the credit worthiness of the issuing municipality all play heavily into the risk and return characteristics of the bond not surprisingly therefore the selloff in the muni market has not impacted all bond prices the same muni bonds of high credit quality and with short to intermediateterm maturities have not been much impacted by the socalled crisis many of these are general obligation bonds backed by the taxing authority of the municipality and insured against default some even have “prerefunded” features in which treasury bills have been escrowed to ensure that the principal is there to be repaid when due the spread in performance between these types of bonds and the lesser quality longer term bonds that enticed small investors with their higher yields has been eyepopping for example while the pimco high yield muni bond fund declined a whopping  from midnovember to midjanuary the dfa shortterm muni bond fund only declined about  unfortunately most individual investors once again succumbed to return chasing and followed their quest for yield out to the edges of the yield curve ending up in highyield funds that they have now sold for  losses or worse individual issues like year munis that have sold for losses of  to  it has been a jarring realization for these folks that “safe and secure” bonds can be as volatile as stocks – perhaps even more so – if you are in the wrong bonds at the wrong time alas all of this pain could have been avoided if the investing public had subscribed to our philosophy about fixed income at capital directions “bonds are a riskreducer – not a returnjuicer” in other words if you want “return” let stocks do that for you if you want “stability” let short to intermediateterm high quality bonds do that for you and never get those two objectives confused if only john q public could get the memo… email a friend print this

significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but

financial instruments hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the securities and exchange commission but that’s on a case to case basis if the assets are large enough the sec will require reports hedge fund managers however are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face antifraud measures a brief history of hedge funds hedge funds have a very long history people and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early st century the funds never lost popularity over time before the recession hit there was a total value of us trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide the industry had a brief hiccup afterwards because of the subprime mortgage crisis but it eventually recovered this is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers hedge fund assets totaled  trillion worldwide by april  just three years after the crisis burst by the third quarter of  the worldwide value of assets under management or aum is at  trillion and may continue to grow in the next years hedge fund strategies hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but rather they employ a combination of various strategies it is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives there are however some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets global macro this type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments the global macro approach leverages multiple markets and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements this approach is very flexible and very diversified as well because there are many variations of substrategy under this umbrella directional the directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis instead directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments a typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term and to couple that position with shortterm buying and selling to hedge against risk eventdriven hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences for instance company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price eventdriven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from eventdriven hedge fund managers relative value relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those this is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies how do hedge fund managers approach risk as mentioned above hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation that is where risk mitigation comes in in fact managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings the most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify the entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments and varying investment positions for instance some of the funds may be put into longterm positions in lowrisk lowreturn funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time a portion of the funds may be invested in highrisk highreturn investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment in addition hedge fund companies may employ risk officers these are not people who are directly involved in trading but have knowledge in how markets work these risk officers will focus on identifying long and shortterm risks to the assets under management and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence offshore and onshore hedge funds because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment hedge fund managers can be found all over the world there are two types of hedge fund management companies and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences for example usbased investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments particularly in retirement funds will turn to offshore hedge funds this helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds on the other hand if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the united states they can expect the us government to slap withholding taxes on their investments however there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not doubletaxed for any increase on the value of their assets only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments the presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation in addition it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of doubletaxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally prominent centers of investment the united states remains the center of global hedge fund management  of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the united states the securities and exchange commission has in its registry nearly  financial experts as of april  who handled management of hedge funds these are found across the us but most of them are based in new york city and connecticut’s gold coast as for european hedge funds london is the home of the managers with over  of them found in the city in  these firms were responsible for managing  of the hedge fund assets from continental europe there is a growing market in asia particularly in japan growing economic centers hong kong and singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the us and london in europe in fact most of the hedge funds from asia are managed by offshore companies based in these two centers hedge fund

commodity trading advisors are these that provide managed futures accounts or funds and they have very different return profile and correlations than hedge funds managed futures offer a good way to diversify hedge fund or other traditional investments and in some cases could also offer lower minimum investment requirements because hedge funds are usually stock picking and don’t provide crisis

detailsgot it choosing the right financial advisor your details done by eric rosenberg by eric rosenberg  november   if you know you want a financial advisor choosing the right one can be a challenge there are so many different fee structures and specialties knowing how to sort through your options is difficult you trust your financial advisor with your money so it is important to make the best possible decisionhow to choose a financial advisorwhen you start your search for a financial advisor you need to find someone whose skills matches your needs that means you need to recognize what you are looking for before you start lookinghere are some common needs from financial advisors cash flow management budgeting retirement planning investing paying for childrens education no financial advisor is perfect for every need which is why it is so important to understand your needs before hiring anyonehow to find a financial advisoryour first step in choosing a financial advisor after examining your needs is to find potential advisors you will want someone who is easy to reach and ideally not too far from your home or office so it is easy to get to a meeting if neededthere are over  registered financial advisors in the united states smartassets financial advisor search tool can help you navigate to the best advisor for your needs answer questions about where you live your plans for retirement and other financial priorities in just a few minutes youll be all set and smartasset will have an advisor contact youquestions to ask a financial advisoronce you have found a few advisors you should interview them to decide who is the best fit for your needs here are some example questions to ask to make sure you end up with the right advisorhow many years of experience do you have as a professional financial advisor do you want someone new and inexperienced managing your money it is best to find someone with plenty of experience advisors with a decade or more under their belt have seen multiple economic cycles and can better help you weather the stormwhat is your strongest focus area in financial planning some advisors are experts in retirement others have expertise in estates and trusts others still are best suited to help you pay for your childs education some financial advisors focus on people who are selfemployed be sure to choose someone who can help with what you need not what someone else needswhat is your budgeting philosophy every familys budget is unique budgets can be very detailed or more general some advisors suggest living frugally to meet your goals others take a more balanced approach find an advisor with a philosophy that matches yourshow are you compensated some financial advisors are “fee only” this means that you pay your advisor a flat fee for their services many advisors charge based on the size of your portfolio the worst situation is where advisors are paid a commission by mutual funds in this case a conflict of interest exists the advisor is incentivized to put your money into those funds even if they are not the best for your needshow much does it cost to work with you after learning how they are paid make sure you know how much you will pay no one wants a giant surprise bill after your first meetingare you a fiduciary fiduciary means putting your needs first many financial advisors work as a fiduciary and have to put your needs first even if it means they earn less money however many financial advisors are not fiduciaries and can give you advice that is not in your best interestdo you own the same investments youll suggest to me do they put their money where their mouth is advisors who suggest one strategy to clients and use a different strategy for their own finances should be a big red flaghow have your clients portfolios performed how did you handle their portfolios during the great recession in  these questions get to the root of their performance if the advisor does not readily share this information they are probably hiding something that went wrong in the past make sure your financial advisor is licensedfinancial advisors are not allowed to give you specific investment advice unless they are licensed the most common and important license for a financial advisor is the cfp or certified financial planner cfps are regulated and must take a course and pass a test proving their competence in financial topicsseries  and series  licenses give finance professionals the ability to recommend and trade stocks bonds and other investments on your behalf make sure your financial advisor has successfully completed both of these exams and has an uptodate licensebeware of lofty promisesif an advisor makes promises that sound like something from the  presidential campaign proceed with caution promises to beat the market and outperform other advisors and funds are easier said than done further no advisor can promise that they will beat the marketat the end of the day many financial advisors have similar skills they use comparable tools and reports to stay uptodate on the markets and help find the best investments for you if any advisor gives you a bad vibe dont feel bad looking elsewherechoose an advisor you can trustafter you have met with a few advisors it is time to make your decision asking about licenses fees and past performance is black and white there are other parts of the decision that are a bit more subjectivedo you like the person do you trust them would you trust them with your daughters education fund your retirementif you have been able to limit your list down to your final few it is time to trust your gut it is important to have an advisor you like trust and enjoy interacting with your money is too important to put in the hands of someone you dont trust pick and advisor who feels like a partner who will stand beside you through your financial journey if you do youll be on track for a great financial futureif youre ready to
