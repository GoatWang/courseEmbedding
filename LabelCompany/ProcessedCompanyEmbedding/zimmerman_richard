sometimes bad circumstances force a pastor to leave sometimes an effective pastor moves to a new congregation or retires either way the congregation is thrust into a unique journey through change and loss people often fail to identify or understand the emotions of loss churning under the surface whether a congregation embraces a good future or gets stuck in the dynamics of the past depends in part on skillful and wise leadership when faced with confusing signs transitional leaders seek wisdom about the unique dynamics of a congregational system in flux how can one leader adapt to the sudden and surprising needs inherent in transitional leadership firmly rooted in the biblical narratives of leading through journeys of transition this book matches those narratives with case studies and other stories to connect the present practice of transitional leadership with the deep wisdom in the biblical accounts the perseverance and hope inherent in the bibles story of redemption deeply engages the dynamics of transition suggesting ways to lead congregations to embrace a renewed mission this combination of narratives points to a new level of understanding what is happening within communities in transition pastor rich reminds us that god does amazing work in times of transition struggle or searching his insights comparing the stories of scripture to reallife church situations are eye opening
