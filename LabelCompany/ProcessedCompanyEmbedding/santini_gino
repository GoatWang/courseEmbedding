became known throughout italy as a highly competent heldentenor singing siegfried at the verona arena and lohengrin in rome he also partnered maria callas in norma macbeth il trovatore and medea in various theatres in italyin  his career took an international turn he appeared at the paris op�ra the liceo in barcelona the monte carlo opera the metropolitan opera in new york and the royal opera house in londonhe was very highly thought of both for his musicianship and his reportedly enormous voice of magnificent qualityi heard tebaldi many times as a standee at the old metropolitan opera house from the mids through the early s and i never stopped marveling at the sheer beauty of the voice her ability to project a pianissimo throughout the auditorium so that even though the note was extraordinarily soft it sounded as if she were standing right next to you the plushness of tone was probably the most unique feature of her singing and along with that an innate sense of the appropriate shape of the phrase she was singing she was not a subtle actress never inflecting every phrase with subtexts of meaning the way callas could but nor was she a disengaged singer just pouring out lovely sounds her acting both physical and vocal was sincere and convincing and at times very powerful her butterfly broke your heart every time through the moving way she shaped the ebb and flow of the music there was no way you could see her as a  year old geisha but by the wedding scene of the first act you were a complete believerabove all there was that voice it was immediately recognizable distinctive unlike any other if you tuned in to a radio broadcast without hearing an announcement two notes would be enough to identify the richly colored luxurious sonority of the tebaldi sound a sound that caressed the ear and at the same time enveloped you for many of us it was the sound that defined what an italian soprano should be� henry fogel fanfare�giulio neri was a leading italian bass in the postww ii period he had a very powerful penetrating but utterly secure voice� neri never made it to these shores i would have walked miles to hear him� kurt moses american record guide mayjune �giangiacomo guelfi not to be confused with carlo guelfi a younger baritone studied at the centro lirico in florence as well as with legendary italian baritone titta ruffo and made his opera d�but in the title role of verdis rigoletto in  an exceptionally young age for such a work he won the spoleto experimental theater prize and made his la scala d�but in  as the visitor in castros proserpina y el extranjero he made his london d�but two years later at drury lane as g�rard in giordanos andrea ch�nier though he drew considerable acclaim in a  performance of verdis i due foscari in venice and he was considered a rising star during the late s and early s it was not until his  performance of verdis macbeth at la scala that he was acknowledged as a fullfledged star he made his metropolitan d�but in  as scarpia he was particularly admired during his prime for his powerful voice but like many possessors of such voices occasionally indulged in bellowing and toward the end of his career relied excessively on extramusical vocal effects� anne feeney allmusiccom norpetecom webutation business profile vermont  norbeck peters  fordnew offeringsbookslpssale itemsopera
