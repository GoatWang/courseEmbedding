management thornburg investment management was founded by garrett thornburg in  on the belief that fixed income managers could do a better job of preserving wealth after investors account for inflation taxes and expenses for more than  years we have sought — via a responsible straightforward organic approach to bond management — to provide investors with attractive returns and relative stability of principal we launched our first mutual fund in  in the form of the limited term municipal fund — a laddered portfolio of municipal bonds from throughout the country between then and  we began a series of similar actively managed laddered portfolios both taxable and taxfree that can serve as core components of a diversified portfolio from the intermediate municipal fund to the limited term income fund each of these conservative funds has followed the same tested strategy since inception with fixedincome assets totaling  billion as of  thornburg now offers both core and strategic portfolios which are defined by their flexibility the strategic income fund and the strategic municipal income fund both enjoy broad latitude to invest anywhere along the yield curve anywhere along the credit spectrum and across a variety of asset classes a conservative view of the role of bonds in a portfolio we view the role of bonds in a portfolio more conservatively than many asset managers we don’t employ complex exotic and risky tactics in an effort to “juice” returns and believe that a fixedincome position should serve as the ballast for a welldiversified portfolio not as the sails of the ship a straightforward organic investment approach we seek the best relative value across a broad array of asset classes our strategies are typically simple and straightforward we don’t reach for yield we conduct rigorous credit research and invest only when the riskreward tradeoff appears tilted decidedly in the shareholder’s favor whether in the flexible strategic funds or the more conservative core funds our portfolios are run on a cashonly basis meaning that we don’t employ leverage or complex trading tactics to try to grab return thornburg’s structure as a global manager means that each of our portfolio managers and analysts works across a broad array of geographies sectors asset classes and security types and is conducive to a free exchange of ideas in the pursuit of
