location as easily as sending a text message but a lot more fun recipients know exactly where you are when and for as long as you want them to in short glympse is simple safe location sharing — in an instant how glympse works glympse is a mobile service that allows gpsenabled mobile phone users to share their location via a webbased map for a preset period of time with anyone they choose with glympse you are in complete control – you choose who you want to see your location when and for how long unlike other locationbased services that require users to log in and build a friend network before use glympse can be used within seconds of downloading to a gpsenabled smartphone device theres no need to create an account to use the service eliminating login and password hassles once downloaded you can glympse anyone you choose by simply selecting a contact or contacts choose the duration you want your location to be available to the recipient and then hit send only glympse uses patentpending timebased glympsewatch℠ technology that allows users to set a timer for how long their location may be shared from minutes or up to four hours a sender has the ability to pause or cancel a glympse at any time or choose to extend an existing glympse the auto shut off security feature addresses the concern that users can easily forget to turn off locationsharing mode and unintentionally broadcast their whereabouts at inappropriate times on the receiving end anyone with an internetenable mobile device or email access can receive a glympse and view your whereabouts turnbyturn in full interactive fidelity the recipient receives an sms or email message with a unique url that can be clicked to open browser with a map pinpointing the senders precise location while glympse users are given the option of adding a photo and nickname or an optional message to appear on the map with their location it is not a requirement to use the service at glympse consumer privacy and safety are paramount with glympse you do not need to join a new social network or go through a cumbersome setup process that requires you to find people with the same phone and service then seek permission to share location with each other the sender is the only one who decides when they will share their location and with whom and for how long once the glympsewatch expires or times out thats it the only way a recipient can see your location again is if you send another glympse you can also pause or cancel a glympse at any time or choose to extend it for up to another four hours ready to get started
