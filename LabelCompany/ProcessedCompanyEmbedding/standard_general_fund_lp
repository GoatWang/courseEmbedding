performance of the funds described on the website firm overviewinvestment processleadershipcontact uslogin eventdriven opportunity funds firm overview standard general is a new yorkbased investment firm that manages eventdriven opportunity funds we focus on companies with complex capital structures that are undergoing dramatic change or are faced with material events the key to our investment approach is familiarity with both credit markets and equity investing companies in our universe have investable equity and credit components our experienced investment professionals analyze how each part of a companys capital structure will act and interact with the whole we complement this analysis with an eventdriven approach we seek mispriced opportunities that we anticipate the market will correct or where we ourselves have the opportunity to create value we apply this framework in an evenhanded manner that generates both long and short investment ideas combining a catalystdependent focus with our willingness to position ourselves flexibly allows us to target an allweather stream of returns we believe this approach can generate a differentiated and uncorrelated return stream standard general was founded in  and has been a secregistered investment adviser since  we primarily manage capital for public and private pension plans endowments foundations and high net worth individuals investment process our crosscapital structure approach gives us a broader foundation from which to identify specific events and catalysts we seek very specific situations but we seek them broadly across markets asset classes and industries the strategy allows us to be nimble and to go where markets offer the most compelling riskreward opportunities most investment strategies are compartmentalized by different constraintslimited to debt or equity by loans or bonds by credit rating by market capitalization or by time horizon unencumbered by these restrictions our strategy is to deploy capital in all of the above areas we use our analysis of specific credit considerations such as liquidity collateral and covenants to help us evaluate potential investments across capital structures over the years we have found this especially relevant for public companies that also have a credit component we believe we have an advantage over more equitycentric investors when evaluating such companies as those unaccustomed to evaluating credit may minimize its relevance when markets are uneventful yet overreact when credit issues loom our crosscapital structure approach gives us a broader foundation from which to identify specific events and catalysts the greatest impact of employing this approach particularly without the constraints of silos or arbitrary limitations is that we uncover an uncommon pool of situations which we believe has little overlap with other managers we believe that our investors are specifically drawn to our differentiated approach and portfolios over time this has given us the added advantage of a committed investor base that has allowed us to see events through to their resolution leadership soo kimdavid glazekjoseph mausestephen
