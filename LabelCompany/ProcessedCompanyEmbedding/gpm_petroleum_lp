per common unit the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus after deducting underwriting discounts the structuring fee of  million paid to raymond james and offering expenses together with  million of borrowings under our new revolving credit facility which we expect to borrow within  days of the closing of this offering • to repay borrowings of approximately  million assumed by us under two affiliate loans entered into by our predecessor which were used to finance the road ranger acquisition • to purchase approximately  million of us treasury or other investment grade securities which will be assigned as collateral to secure our new  million term loan the proceeds of which will be distributed to and for which a guarantee of collection will be provided by gpm • to purchase approximately  million of us treasury or other investment grade securities which will be assigned as collateral to secure  million of the pnc term loan which we will assume from gpm and for which gpm will provide a guarantee and • to repay approximately  million of trade payables assumed by us in connection with our formation transactions if and to the extent the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional common units the number of additional common units purchased by the underwriters pursuant to such exercise will be issued to the public and the remainder of the additional common units if any will be issued to gpm or a wholly owned subsidiary of gpm any such units issued to gpm or a wholly owned subsidiary of gpm will be issued for no additional consideration if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional common units in full the additional net proceeds would be approximately  million based upon the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses the net proceeds received in connection with any exercise of such option will be used to purchase a corresponding amount of additional us treasury or other investment grade securities which will be used for general partnership purposes and may be used temporarily to collateralize our new term loan in addition we will borrow under our new term loan an amount equal to the net proceeds received upon exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional common units in excess of  million and use the proceeds of such loan to make a distribution to gpm gpm will provide a guarantee of collection with respect to such borrowing if the underwriters do not exercise their option to purchase additional common units we will issue common units to gpm or a wholly owned subsidiary of gpm upon the option’s expiration accordingly the exercise of the underwriters’ option will not affect the total number of common units outstanding or the amount of cash needed to pay the minimum quarterly distribution on all units in march  a portion of the consideration for the road ranger acquisition was financed in part with a  million loan with arko holdings ltd “arko” and a  million loan with gpm holdings inc “gpm holdings” these loans mature in september  and bear interest at  per annum payable monthly at the closing of this offering we expect to assume these loans and to repay the amounts outstanding in full with the proceeds of this offering a  increase or decrease in the assumed initial public offering price of  per common unit would cause the net proceeds from this offering after deducting the estimated underwriting discount and offering expenses payable by us to increase or decrease respectively by approximately  million in addition we may also increase or decrease the number of common units we are offering each increase of  million common units offered by us together with a concomitant  increase in the assumed initial public offering price to  per common unit would increase net proceeds to us from this offering by approximately  million similarly each decrease of  million common units offered by us together with a concomitant  decrease in the assumed initial public offering price to  per common unit would decrease the net proceeds to us from this offering by approximately  million if we increase or decrease the number of common units offered we will increase or decrease respectively the amount of funds retained for general partnership purposes we may concomitantly increase or reduce as applicable the amount of indebtedness we will pay down as a result cash available for distribution per unit is expected to remain unchanged regardless of the changes in the number of common units offered we compete primarily with other independent motor fuel distributors the market for distribution of wholesale motor fuel is highly competitive and fragmented which results in narrow margins we have numerous competitors some of which may have significantly greater resources and name recognition than we do we rely on our ability to provide valueadded and reliable service and to control our operating costs in order to maintain our competitive position company description we are a growthoriented delaware limited partnership formed by gpm to engage in the wholesale distribution of motor fuels on a fixed fee per gallon basis to gpmcontrolled convenience stores and third parties as of june   gpm controlled over  convenience stores that sell motor fuel merchandise food beverages and other products and services to retail customers in the midatlantic southeastern midwestern and northeastern united states upon the completion of this offering gpm will purchase all of its motor fuel from us for the twelve months ended june   on a pro forma basis we distributed  million gallons of motor fuel to gpmcontrolled convenience stores and  million gallons of motor fuel to thirdparty customers we believe we are one of the largest independent motor fuel distributors by number of convenience stores in the united states the largest distributor of valerobranded motor fuel on the east coast and the third largest distributor of valerobranded motor fuel in the united states in addition we receive rental income from real estate that we own and lease to third parties our primary business objective is to make stable quarterly cash distributions to our unitholders and over time to increase our quarterly cash distributions we intend to make minimum quarterly distributions of  per unit per quarter or  per unit on an annualized basis we purchase motor fuel primarily from major integrated oil companies and independent refiners and distribute it to gpm pursuant to three year wholesale motor fuel distribution agreements which we refer to as the gpm distribution contracts as of june   gpm distributed volumes it purchased from us to • over  convenience stores controlled by gpm • over  sites operated by independent dealers • over  sites owned or leased by gpm and operated by lessee dealers and • over  consignment locations where gpm sells motor fuel to retail customers though we arrange for the transportation of motor fuel to gpm for sale to its controlled convenience stores and consignment locations we do not physically transport any of the motor fuel gpm directly arranges for transportation of motor fuel to its independent and lessee dealers in addition to the volumes of motor fuel we distribute to gpm we also distribute motor fuel directly to approximately  subwholesalers and bulk purchasers subwholesalers in turn distribute fuel to convenience stores bulk purchasers primarily purchase motor fuel for their own use for the six months ended june   and the year ended december   we distributed  million and  million gallons of motor fuel to subwholesalers and bulk purchasers respectively gpm is obligated to provide us a right of first offer to purchase fuel distribution contracts for all convenience stores dealer sites and consignment locations that gpm acquires in the future the total amount of motor fuel we sold grew from  million gallons during  to over  million gallons during  primarily as a result of a series of convenience store acquisitions by gpm since january   the number of gpmcontrolled convenience stores has grown from  to  while the amount of motor fuel sold to such convenience stores has increased from  million gallons during  to  million gallons during  during the twelve months ended june   and after giving pro forma effect to the gpm distribution contracts as defined below approximately  of our fuel gallons sold would have been pursuant to such contracts under the gpm distribution contract the gpm rr distribution contract and the gpm mw distribution contract we will be the exclusive distributor of motor fuel purchased by gpm’s existing convenience stores independent and lessee dealers and consignment locations for  years at cost plus a fixed fee of  cents per gallon we believe that we have limited exposure to fluctuating commodity prices because we charge gpm the cost of our fuel plus a markup gpm in turn passes these costs along to its retail customers at its controlled convenience stores and consignment locations and to the dealers it supplies in addition to revenues earned in our wholesale motor fuel distribution business we also receive rental income from convenience store properties that we own and lease to third parties at the closing of this offering we expect to receive rental income from six properties located in delaware new jersey and virginia although we may purchase and lease convenience store properties to gpm or third parties we do not operate or have any intention to operate any convenience stores at this time though we may elect to do so in the future  our principal
