core operating income assists investors in understanding and evaluating the financial performance of the companys longterm investment strategy and core business activities over periods of time as well as its earnings capacity  a limitation of utilizing this nongaap financial measure is that the effect of accounting for noncore events or transactions in accordance with gaap does in fact reflect the financial results of our business and these effects should not be ignored when evaluating and analyzing our financial results  for example the economic cost or benefit of hedging instruments other than interest rate swap agreements such as us treasury note futures or options on us treasury note futures do not affect the computation of nongaap core operating income  in addition the companys calculation of nongaap core operating income may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies  therefore the company believes that net income and comprehensive income
