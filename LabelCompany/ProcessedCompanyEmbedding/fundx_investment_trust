you compare the cost of investing in the upgrader fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds  the example assumes that you invest  in the upgrader fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods  the example also assumes that your investment has a  return each year and that the upgrader fund’s operating expenses remain the sametaking into account the expense cap for the first year only  although your actual costs may be higher or lower based on these assumptions your costs would be      year  years  years  years fundx upgrader fund       portfolio turnover as a fundoffunds the upgrader fund does not typically pay transaction costs such as commissions when it buys and sells securities or “turns over” its portfolio except with respect to any purchases or sales of exchangetraded funds “etfs”  if transaction costs are involved a higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when upgrader fund shares are held in a taxable account  these costs which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example affect the upgrader fund’s performance  during the most recent fiscal year the upgrader fund’s portfolio turnover rate was   of the average value of its portfolio   principal investment strategies the upgrader fund is a fundoffunds and as such invests primarily in noload and loadwaived mutual funds including etfs “underlying funds”  the underlying funds in turn invest primarily in individual securities such as common stocks   because markets change the advisor actively manages the fund’s portfolio using a proprietary investment strategy called upgrading which seeks to capture global market trends  the advisor invests in the underlying funds that it considers to be in synch with current market leadership  the advisor sells an underlying fund when it believes that the underlying fund is no longer performing in synch with current market leadership or if a new underlying fund is judged more attractive than a current holding   under normal market conditions the upgrader fund will invest predominantly in core equity underlying funds which generally invest in diversified portfolios of equity securities of wellestablished us and foreign companies with a wide range of market capitalizations  core equity underlying funds may also invest in fixed income securities  core equity underlying funds allow the fund to participate in broad market leadership trends such as the rotation between growth and value stocks large and smallcap stocks and international and domestic stocks  the upgrader fund may purchase without limit shares of underlying funds that invest in domestic international and global securities     upgrading when a fund begins to lag its peers the advisor redeems the shares and directs the proceeds to a better performing alternative  the advisor classifies the pool of underlying funds into four riskreturn categories ▪     aggressive equity underlying funds ▪     core equity underlying funds ▪     total return underlying funds ▪     bond underlying funds     to a lesser extent the upgrader fund may also invest a portion of its assets in aggressive equity underlying funds which may invest in more concentrated portfolios or in smallcap midcap or lessseasoned companies or may make significant use of complex investment techniques such as leverage short sales and margin  they may also include the use of derivative securities such as options futures and swap contracts for hedging andor speculative purposes  aggressive equity underlying funds may be riskier than core equity underlying funds but may hold the potential for higher reward  aggressive equity funds allow the fund to participate in more specialized stock market leadership trends such as rotations between specific sectors or within emerging markets  the upgrader fund may hold up to  of its assets in underlying funds that focus on emerging markets   see “more about the funds’ investment objectives strategies and risks – the advisor’s process for classifying the underlying funds” for more information on this system            principal risks an investment in the upgrader fund entails risk  the upgrader fund cannot guarantee that it will meet its investment objective  since the price of the underlying funds that the upgrader fund holds may fluctuate the value of your investment may fluctuate and you could lose all or a portion of your investment in the upgrader fund  the following risks could affect the value of your investment   · general market risk – general market risk is the risk that the value of a fund’s shares will fluctuate based on the performance of the securities held by the underlying funds it owns  these fluctuations may cause a security to be worth less than its cost when originally purchased or less than it was worth at an earlier time · management risk – management risk describes the upgrader fund’s ability to meet its investment objective based on the advisor’s success or failure to implement investment strategies for the upgrader fund · foreign securities risk – the underlying funds held by the upgrader fund may have significant investments in foreign securities  foreign securities risk entails risk relating to political social and economic developments abroad and differences between us and foreign regulatory requirements and market practices · emerging markets risk – in addition to the foreign securities risks mentioned above emerging markets are generally more volatile and less liquid · derivative risk – some underlying funds may use derivative instruments which derive their value from the value of an underlying asset currency or index  the value of derivatives may rise or fall more rapidly than other investments and it is possible to lose more than the initial amount invested · leverage risk – some underlying funds may borrow money for leveraging and will incur interest expense  leverage is investment exposure which exceeds the initial amount invested  leverage can cause the portfolio to lose more than the principal amount invested  leverage can magnify the portfolio’s gains and losses and therefore increase its volatility · short sales risk – the underlying funds may engage in short sales which could cause an underlying fund’s investment performance to suffer if it is required to close out a short position earlier than it had intended · small company risk – the underlying funds may invest in securities of small companies which involves greater volatility than investing in larger and more established companies · sector emphasis risk – some of the underlying funds may have particular emphasis in one or more sectors subjecting that underlying fund to sector emphasis risk  sector emphasis risk is the possibility that a certain sector may underperform other sectors or the market as a whole · etf trading risk – because the upgrader fund invests in etfs it is subject to additional risks that do not apply to conventional mutual funds including the risks that the market price of an etf’s shares may trade at a discount to its net asset value “nav” an active secondary trading market may not develop or be maintained or trading may be halted by the exchange in which the etfs trade which may impact a fund’s ability to sell its shares of an etf · portfolio turnover risk – to the extent the upgrader fund invests in etfs it may be subject to the risks of having a high portfolio turnover rate  high portfolio turnover involves correspondingly greater expenses to a fund including brokerage commissions or dealer markups and other transaction costs on the sale of securities and reinvestments in other securities · upgrading strategy risk – the upgrader fund employs an upgrading strategy whereby it continually seeks to invest in the topperforming securities at a given time  when investment decisions are based on nearterm performance however the upgrader fund may be exposed to the risk of buying underlying funds immediately following a sudden brief surge in performance that may be followed by a subsequent drop in market value · underlying funds risk – the risks associated with the upgrader fund include the risks related to each underlying fund in which the upgrader fund invests  although the upgrader fund seeks to reduce the risk of your investment by diversifying among mutual funds and etfs that invest in stocks and in some cases bonds there are inherent risks of investing in various asset classes  the fund must also pay its pro rata portion of an investment company’s fees and expenses   performance the following performance information provides some indication of the risks of investing in the upgrader fund  the bar chart below illustrates how the   upgrader fund’s total returns have varied from year to year  the table below illustrates how the upgrader fund’s average annual total returns for the year year and year periods compare with a domestic broadbased market index and secondary index provided to offer a broader market perspective  the upgrader fund’s performance before and after taxes is not necessarily an indication of how the upgrader fund will perform in the future  updated performance is available on the
