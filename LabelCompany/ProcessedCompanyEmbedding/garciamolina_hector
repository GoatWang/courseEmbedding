editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide performance of update algorithms for replicated  data in a distributed database by hector garciamolina book  editions published between  and  in english and undetermined and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide in this thesis we study the performance of update algorithms for replicated data in a distributed database in doing so we also investigate several other related issues we start by presenting a simple model of a distributed database which is suitable for studying updates and concurrency control we also develop a performance model and a set of parameters which represent the most important performance features of a distributed database the distributed database models are used to study the performance of update algorithms for replicated data this is done in two steps first the algorithms are analyzed in the case of completely replicated databases in a no failure update only environment then the restrictions that we made are eliminated one at a time and the impact on the system performance of doing this is evaluated for the first step we develop a new technique for analyzing the performance of update algorithms this iterative technique is based on queueing theory several well known update algorithms are analyzed using this technique the performance results are verified through detailed simulations of the algorithms the results show that centralized control algorithms nearly always perform better than the more popular distributed control algorithms overview of multidatabase transaction management by y breitbart book  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide abstract a multidatabase system mdbs is a facility that allows users access to data located in multiple autonomous database management systems dbmss in such a system global transactions are executed under the control of the mdbs independently local transactions are executed under the control of the local dbmss each local dbms integrated by the mdbs may employ a different transaction management scheme in addition each local dbms has complete control over all transactions global and local executing at its site including the ability to abort at any point any of the transactions executing at its site aggressive transmissions over redundant paths for time critical messages by benjamin chiming kao book  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide abstract faulttolerant computer systems have redundant paths connecting their components given these paths it is possible to use aggressive techniques to reduce the average value and variability of the response time for critical messages one technique is to send a copy of a packet over an alternate path before it is know if the first copy failed or was delayed a second technique is to split a single stream of packets over multiple paths we analyze both approaches and show that they can provide significant improvements over conventional conservative mechanisms performance of inverted indices in distributed text document retrieval systems by anthony slavko tomasic book  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide abstract the performance of distributed text document retrieval systems is strongly influenced by the organization of the inverted index this paper compares the performance impact on query processing of various physical organizations for inverted lists we present a new probalistic model of the database and queries simulation experiments determine which variables most strongly influence response time and throughput this leads to a set of design tradeoffs over a wide range of hardware configurations and new parallel query processing strategies index structures for selective dissemination of information by t w yan book  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide in this paper we propose several index structures for standing orders and algorithms that efficiently match documents against large number sic of orders we also present analysis and simulations results to compare their performance under different scenarios realtime communication over multiple standard networks by benjamin chiming kao book  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide abstract in this paper we consider systems with redundant communication paths and show how applications can exploit the redundancy to improve realtime communications we consider two policies one that evenly distributes load and one that partitions load according to packet slackness we evaluate the effectiveness of these policies through analysis and simulation deadline assignment in a distributed soft realtime system by benjamin chiming kao book  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide abstract in a distributed environment tasks often have processing demands on multiple different sites a distributed task is usually divided up into several subtasks each one to be executed at some site in order in a realtime system an overall deadline is usually specified by an application designer indicating when a distributed task is to be finished however the problem of how a global deadline is automatically translated to the deadline of each individual subtask has not been well studied this paper examines through simulations four strategies for subtask deadline assignment in a distributed soft realtime environment caching and database scaling in distributed sharednothing information retrieval systems by a tomasic book  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide abstract a common class of existing information retrieval system provides access to abstracts for example stanford university through its folio system provides access to the inspec database of abstracts of the literature on physics computer science electrical engineering etc in this paper this database is studied by using a trace driven simulation we focus on physical index design inverted index caching and database scaling in a distributed sharednothing system all three issues are shown to have a strong effect on response time and throughput database scaling is explored in two ways one way assumes an optimal configuration for a single host and then linearly scales the database by duplicating the host architecture as needed subtask deadline assignment for complex distributed soft real time tasks by benjamin chiming kao book  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide abstract complex distributed tasks often involve parallel execution of subtasks at different nodes to meet the deadline of a global task all of its parallel subtasks have to be finished on time comparing to a local task which involves execution at only one node a global task may have a much harder time making its deadline because it is fairly likely that at least one of its subtasks run into an overloaded node another problem with complex distributed tasks occurs when a global task consists of a number of serially executing subtasks in this case we have the problem of dividing up the endtoend deadline of the global task and assigning them to the intermediate subtasks in this paper we study both of these problems different algorithms for assigning deadlines to subtasks are presented and evaluated coordinating multitransaction activities by hector garciamolina book  editions published between  and  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide abstract data processing applications must often execute collections of related transactions we propose a model for structuring and coordinating these multitransaction activities the model includes mechanisms for communication between transactions for compensating transactions after an activity has failed for dynamic creation and binding of activities and for checkpointing the progress of an activity boolean query mapping across heterogeneous information sources  extended version by kevin chenchuan chang book  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide abstract searching over heterogeneous information sources is difficult because of the nonuniform query languages our approach is to allow a user to compose boolean queries in one rich frontend language for each user query and target source we transform the user query into a subsuming query that can be supported by the source but that may return extra documents the results are then processed by a filter query to yield the correct final result in this paper we introduce the architecture and associated algorithms for generating the supported subsuming queries and filters we show that generated subsuming queries return a minimal number of documents we also discuss how minimal cost filters can be obtained we have implemented prototype versions of these algorithms and demonstrated them on heterogeneous boolean systems management of replicated data  nd workshop  papers book  edition published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide readonly transactions in a distributed database by hector garciamolina book  editions published in  in english and undetermined and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide a readonly transaction or query is a transaction which does not modify any data readonly transactions could be processed with general transaction processing algorithms but in many cases it is more efficient to process readonly transactions with special algorithms which take advantage of the knowledge that the transaction only reads this paper defines the various consistency and currency requirements that readonly transactions may have the processing of the different classes of readonly transactions in a distributed database is discussed the concept of r insularity is introduced to characterize both the readonly and update algorithms several simple update and readonly transaction processing algorithms are presented to illustrate how the query requirements and the update algorithms affect the readonly transaction processing algorithms author altruistic locking by kenneth salem book  editions published between  and  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide abstract long lived transactions llts hold on to database resources for relatively long periods of time significantly delaying the completion of shorter and more common transactions to alleviate this problems sic we propose an extension to twophase locking called altruistic locking whereby llts can release their locks early transactions that access this released data are said to run in the wake of the llt and must follow special locking rules altruistic locking guarantees serializability and does not a priori specify an order in which database objects must be accessed index structures for information filtering under the vector space model by tak w yan book  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide we apply the idea of the standard inverted index to index user profiles we devise an alternative to the standard inverted index in which we instead of indexing every term in a profile select only the significant ones to index we evaluate their performance and show that the indexing methods require orders of magnitude fewer ios to process a document than when no index is used we also show that the proposed alternative performs better in terms of io and cpu processing time in many cases   more

description   for database systems and database design and application courses offered at the junior senior and graduate levels in computer science departments written by wellknown computer scientists this introduction to database systems offers a comprehensive approach focusing on database design database use and implementation of database applications and database management systems the first half of the book provides indepth coverage of databases from the point of view of the database designer user and application programmer it covers the latest database standards sql sqlpsm sqlcli jdbc odl and xml with broader coverage of sql than most other texts the second half of the book provides indepth coverage of databases from the point of view of the dbms implementor it focuses on storage structures query processing and transaction management the book covers the main techniques in these areas with broader coverage of query optimization than most other texts along with advanced topics including multidimensional and bitmap indexes distributed transactions and information integration techniques   resources open access author website  httpinfolabstanfordeduullmandscbhtml includes

offers a readable and engaging presentation extensive treatment of database modeling–includes detailed and separate explanations of how to use er and odl to design databases teaches about this important first step of the planning process excellent uptodate and detailed coverage of sql–includes coverage of objectrelational systems and many aspects of the new sql standard provides a more extensive treatment of query processing than other books on the market discussion of the technologies used to connect database programming with c or java code–includes discussions of sqlpsm sqlcli and jdbc gives students practical advice on integrating stateoftheart technologies with databases coverage of advanced issues important to database designers and users includes discussions of views integrity constraints assertions triggers transactions authorization and recursion in sql discussions of how to successfully plan a database application before building it reflects how these plans are developed in the real world coverage of topics such as designing storage structures and implementing a variety of indexing schemes shows students how to build efficient database management systems extensive coverage of query processing and optimization shows students how to fine tune database systems to improve performance comprehensive coverage of transaction processing mechanisms for concurrency control and recovery including distributed and longduration transactions shows how to design complex database systems that can handle realworld business applications coverage of information integration including data warehousing mediation olap datacube systems and data mining exposes readers to cutting edge technology used in business applications extensive exercises–in almost every section provides students with the opportunity to practice and apply the concepts theyve learned in each chapter please note that goalgradiance is no longer available with this book new to this edition chapters have been extensively reorganized and augmented relational modeling is covered in chapters  chapter  is devoted to highlevel modeling and includes the er model as well as uml unified modeling language the viewpoint of chapter   which focuses on functional and multivalued dependencies  has been modified so that a functional dependency is now assumed to have a set of attributes on the right explicitly certain algorithms including the “chase” allow us to manipulate dependencies the discussion of third normal form has been augmented to include the nf synthesis algorithm and to delineate the tradeoff between nf and bcnf chapter  contains the coverage of relational algebra from the previous edition and is joined by part of the treatment of datalog from the old chapter  the discussion of recursion in datalog is either moved to the book’s web site or combined with the treatment of recursive sql in chapter  of this edition chapters  are devoted to aspects of sql programming and they represent a reorganization and augmentation of the earlier book’s chapters    and parts of  the material on indexes and views has been moved to its own chapter number  and this material has been augmented with a discussion of important new topics including materialized views and automatic selection of indexes the new chapter  is based on the old chapter  embedded sql it is introduced by a new section on tiered architecture it also includes an expanded discussion of jdbc and new coverage of php chapter  collects a number of advanced sql topics including the nestedrelation model objectrelational features of sql and data cubes chapters  and  covering xml and xmlbased systems contain new and expanded material on modeling and programming including xml schema dtds xpath xquery and xslt chapter  covering parallel and distributed databases includes new sections on distributed query execution the mapreduce framework for parallel computation peertopeer databases and their implementation of distributed hash tables new sections on localasview mediators and entity resolution have been added to chapter  which covers information integration the expanded data mining chapter includes material on association rules and frequent itemset mining including both the famous apriori algorithm and certain efficiency improvements key techniques of shingling minhashing localitysensitive hashing and clustering have been added an entirely new chapter  addresses ways in which the internet has impacted database technology through search engines and datastream
