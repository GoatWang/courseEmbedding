is only required when investors do not understand what they are doingwarren buffett wide diversification is only required when investors do not understand what they are doing this morning i had coffee with a lady from one of the emerging asian private equity fund of funds she told me that her team considers the indian lp obsession with management fees quite bizarre i am hearing this from every side at the momentthere is a growing sense that our local lps would rather negotiate low fees than deploy their capital in high quality private equity funds overseas management fees are relatively far down the midmarket lp agenda when investors complain about fees they are mostly talking about huge funds but there are only about ten of those globally india is a strange outlier in this respect many of our lps appear absolutely obsessed with management fees it’s not uncommon for them to raise the question of fees in the very first meeting or phone call so why is this i have a few theories just    asset advisors control the majority of indian lp capital a strong personality or thought leader can have an influence on industry terms and conditions that would be impossible in the united states or europe perhaps ironically the earliest financial backers of indian private equity were large union retirement funds they are notoriously fee conscious our super pension funds are required to publish fund management expense ratios or mers unfortunately they often measure mer on drawn down rather than committed capital on this basis pe management fees will always appear disproportionately high and may draw the attention of the fund trustees it takes a long time to discover whether a pe team has delivered good performance but the management fees are evident on day one and fund trustees are the
