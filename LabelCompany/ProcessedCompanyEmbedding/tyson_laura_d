the haas school of business at the university of california berkeley and headed the council of economic advisers and the national economic council under president clinton horrific factory tragedies often prompt powerful public calls for reform and the rana plaza fire that killed more than  garment workers in bangladesh almost a year ago is no exception todays economistperspectives from expert contributorsbangladesh is the poster child for the global apparel industry it is the world’s secondlargest exporter of clothing after china its factories employ four million workers supplying retail giants like benetton walmart jc penney and hm about  percent of these workers are women and they earn wages that are among the lowest in the developing world yet for them a job in the garment industry is often the only job available and a possible step out of grinding poverty apparel wages in many countries including bangladesh are often higher than wages in alternative employment at a dreadful human cost the rana plaza tragedy has led to some beneficial changes to protect their brands and reputations american and european corporations have scrambled to reduce the risks of similar calamities several big european companies have signed an accord on fire and building safety in bangladesh which includes binding commitments and financial obligations to make factories safer and submit them to independent inspectors major retailers in the united states have signed a similar but lessambitious agreement known as the alliance for bangladesh worker safety both groups have cooperated to establish a fire safety and structural integrity standard for the factories with which they do business american companies have committed to completing inspections at more than  factories to assess their compliance with the new standard by the middle of this year this will be a formidable task there is a shortage of trained inspectors in bangladesh and at the end of january only about  percent of the required inspections were done read more… jan   jan   tempered optimism for the economyby laura dandrea tyson laura d’andrea tyson is a professor at the haas school of business at the university of california berkeley and headed the council of economic advisers and the national economic council under president clinton the last few years have begun with rosy expectations for an acceleration of growth in the united states economy and this year is no different this time however the rosy expectations are more likely to be realized after several years of lackluster growth around  percent forecasters are predicting that the economy will enjoy its strongest growth since the  recession with growth in the  percent range there are plenty of reasons for optimism  but there are also plenty of reasons that optimism should be tempered with caution and with concern about the prospects for sustainable and equitable growth todays economistperspectives from expert contributorsthe headwinds impeding the recovery — from impaired household balance sheets a depressed housing market and government budget cuts — are dissipating  as a result of painful deleveraging household debt has fallen to the levels of the early s and household debt payments as a share of aftertax income are as low as they have been since the early s when the the data series began equity and home values have risen restoring real household net worth to its prerecession peak residential investment continues to strengthen although it is still below its prerecession rate as a share of gross domestic product house prices are rising and the number of underwater mortgages mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures has declined significantly the fiscal position of state and local governments is improving and they are adding rather than cutting jobs employment by the federal government continues to decline but federal fiscal austerity is easing as a result of the recent budget deal the federal budget is on course to subtract only about  percent from gdp in  compared with a whopping  percent in  congressional fiscal follies with destabilizing showdowns over the debt limit and government shutdowns appear to be on hold at least for the  midterm election year as these headwinds dissipate monetary policy is likely to remain highly accommodative at its last meeting the federal reserve reiterated its intention to hold the federal funds rate near zero well past the time that the unemployment rate falls to  percent and to trim its asset purchases by only a modest amount policy continuity is expected when janet yellen becomes the fed chief this month as she has been a vocal coarchitect of the fed’s accommodative monetary stance the combination of stronger household balance sheets a rebounding housing market less fiscal restraint and continued monetary accommodation bodes well for the economy’s growth in   so does the fact that job creation is gaining momentum improving job prospects have strengthened consumer confidence which should fuel stronger consumption growth read more… dec   dec   raising the minimum wage old shibboleths new evidenceby laura dandrea tyson laura d’andrea tyson is a professor at the haas school of business at the university of california berkeley and served as chairwoman of the council of economic advisers under president clinton the last several decades have been especially hard on american workers in jobs that pay the minimum wage adjusted for inflation the federal minimum wage of  an hour today is  percent lower than it was in  if it had kept up with inflation and with the growth of average labor productivity it would be  an hour todays economistperspectives from expert contributorscongressional democrats have proposed legislation to raise the minimum wage to  an hour and index it to inflation and president obama signaled support in a recent speech highlighting the economic and political dangers of growing income inequality predictably opponents of an increase in the minimum wage are once again invoking the hackneyed warning that it will lead to higher unemployment especially among lowskilled lowwage workers who are the intended beneficiaries i heard the same refrain in  when i served as chairwoman of president bill clinton’s national economic council and he worked with congressional democrats to raise the minimum wage to  an hour at a time when it had fallen in real terms to a year low to hear republican opponents and lobbyists for retailers and fastfood companies we were about to inflict a coldhearted fate on young people and minority workers the same chorus is voicing the same dire predictions today as it happened the united states experienced a spectacular boom in employment and prosperity from  to  indeed these years proved to be a rare and alltoobrief period when incomes improved at every wage level contrary to the warnings of the naysayers a higher minimum wage did not impede robust employment growth it did contribute to healthy income gains for lowwage workers read more… oct   oct   gamechanging investments for the usby laura dandrea tyson and susan lund laura d’andrea tyson is a professor at the haas school of business at the university of california berkeley and served as chairwoman of the council of economic advisers under president bill clinton susan lund is a partner at mckinsey  company and the mckinsey global institute based in washington while washington remains mired in brinksmanship over the debt ceiling and the budget a potentially larger problem is building that may constrain growth for decades to come in late  the congressional budget office issued a report revising potential gross domestic product downward because of weak investment in the underlying productive capacity of the economy a slowdown in productivity growth and demographic shifts todays economistperspectives from expert contributorstoday gdp in the united states remains nearly  trillion below the prerecession trend and is expanding at an anemic annual rate of about  percent both because of weak aggregate demand and because of the slowdown in the economy’s potential growth rate a resurgence in investment is essential to address both causes of the disappointing recovery and to create jobs annual net private nonresidential fixed investment — a measure of the productive investment and real expansion in physical structures equipment and software — fell to less than  billion in  dollars in  and  from a peak of  billion in  and while it has recovered since then it remains  percent below its prerecession peak when measured as a share of gdp this trend is even more worrisome net productive investment averaged roughly  percent of gdp in the united states in the postwar period until  the share plummeted after the  recession and again after the  recession falling to a historic low of just  percent of gdp in  read more… sep   sep   the quality of jobs the new normal and the old normalby laura dandrea tyson laura d’andrea tyson is a professor at the haas school of business at the university of california berkeley and served as chairwoman of the council of economic advisers under president clinton since the great recession of  the labor market has recovered at an agonizingly slow pace despite  consecutive months of gains in privatesector employment the unemployment rate is still at  percent in december  it was only  percent the current unemployment rate is higher now than in  across all age education occupation gender and ethnic groups todays economistperspectives from expert contributorsthat’s despite the fact that about four million workers have left the labor force driving the labor force participation rate to a historic low at least a percentage point below its longrun downward trend according to the council of economic advisers both hiring and quit rates remain significantly below their prerecession peaks although the share of the longterm unemployed has fallen from its peak of  percent in  to  percent today it is still far above its  average and about eight million people are working parttime for “economic reasons” a euphemism for those who would like a fulltime position but cannot find one the weakness of the labor market is manifest not only in the number of jobs created and the number of unemployed but also in the quality of jobs here the news is also bleak read more… aug   aug   japan’s women to the rescueby laura dandrea tyson laura d’andrea tyson is a professor at the haas school of business at the university of california berkeley and served as chairwoman of the council of economic advisers under president clinton among economists most of whom are male there is a tendency to treat diversity and gender equality as “soft” issues – worthy social goals perhaps but secondary to the real business of economic growth job creation and productivity but these soft issues have jumped to the top of the longterm growth agenda in japan the world’s thirdlargest economy where prime minister shinzo abe is working to shake the nation out of its year deflationary slump todays economistperspectives from expert contributorsso far the world’s attention has focused on mr abe’s bold macroeconomic policies to lift demand and growth in the short run  these policies have been strikingly successful confirming the validity of keynesian remedies for an economy suffering from insufficient demand when interest rates are stuck at their zero lower bound as a result of higher deficit spending and a vast quantitative easing program by the bank of japan the japanese economy is growing at  percent the highest rate among advanced economies and the stock market has soared by  percent over the last six months now after his recent impressive electoral victory prime minister abe has signaled his intention to move forward with the “third arrow” of his policy quiver — significant structural reforms to increase japan’s longterm growth potential  his list reads like a neoclassical economist’s list of “usual suspects” including deregulation industrial restructuring corporate tax reform and trade liberalization — all worthy objectives  but in a departure from tradition he is also championing reforms to expand economic opportunities for women read more… jun   jun   the myriad benefits of a carbon taxby laura dandrea tyson laura d’andrea tyson is a professor at the haas school of business at the university of california berkeley and served as chairwoman of the council of economic advisers under president clinton few goals in washington have more bipartisan support at least in theory than cleaning up the tax code republicans and democrats say they want a system that is simpler fairer and more efficient put simply they want a system with fewer special tax breaks and lower rates todays economistperspectives from expert contributorsyet one of the best ideas for advancing all of those goals – and also heading off catastrophic climate change — isn’t even on the table i refer to a carbon tax which would impose a price on emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases most climate experts concur that dangerous climate change is occurring at a more rapid rate than expected they also agree that the deterioration in the earth’s climate is primarily a result of carbon emissions from fossil fuel consumption by humans if you dispute the overwhelming scientific consensus about manmade climate change and the role of fossil fuel emissions you should probably stop reading now evidence is unlikely to affect your opinions but if you accept this consensus you should know that economists across the political spectrum agree that a carbon tax is the most effective way to discourage carbon consumption and lower the risks of catastrophic climate changes i am convinced by the environmental case for a carbon tax but i want to make a broader argument a carbon tax could be an engine for tax simplification deficit reduction less government regulation and even increased competitiveness read more… jun   jun   getting more bang for the buck in higher educationby laura dandrea tyson laura d’andrea tyson is a professor at the haas school of business at the university of california berkeley and served as chairwoman of the council of economic advisers under president bill clinton republicans and democrats are hurtling toward another bipartisan standoff this one over rival plans on the interest rates to be charged on subsidized federal loans to help students and their families pay for postsecondary education unless congress can agree on a plan the interest rate on new loans will double on july  to  percent from  percent todays economistperspectives from expert contributorswhile the interest rate on student loans is important there are much bigger problems in the financing of higher education soaring tuition costs the exploding volume of total student debt and shockingly low college completion rates americans are spending unprecedented amounts both privately and publicly on higher education what are the returns are there ways to get more bang for the buck on this substantial investment in the nation’s future work force students are already borrowing about  billion a year more than twice as much as a decade ago and student debt now tops  trillion the federal government accounts for nearly  percent of all student loans and the congressional budget office estimates that students will take out  trillion in new federal loans over the next decade for young college graduates the unemployment rate is  percent and the underemployment rate which includes those who have given up looking for a job or who are working part time because they cannot find a fulltime job is about  percent in addition many college graduates have been forced to settle for lowpaying jobs that do not require a college degree not surprisingly the default rate on student loans is increasing more than  percent of students whose loans came due in  were in default as of september  meaning that they had missed payments on their loans for more than  days read more… show
