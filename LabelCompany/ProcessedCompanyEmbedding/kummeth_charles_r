note that the commentary today regarding the total companys q organic growth by end market and geography does not include the performance of our protein platforms division with that i will turn the call over to chuck charles r kummeth  president chief executive officer  director thank you jim and good morning everyone thanks for joining us today for our fourth quarter call this morning we reported a  increase in revenue for the fourth quarter with strength organically in most of our end markets and with sales contribution from the acquisitions we made over the past year organic growth was solid for the quarter at  with nice contribution from both our biotechnology and clinical control segments the strong finish for the year allowed us to end fiscal year  with fullyear revenues that grew  overall and  organically protein the biotech product that we are most well known for experienced midsingle digit growth in q just as it has for the last several quarters we feel proteins are positioned well to continue this growth trajectory going forward antibodies another significant biotech product category also had a solid quarter with midsingle digit organic growth this marks the first quarter in over eight quarters where we have had positive growth in antibodies biotechs assays product category also performed similarly and together this is the reasons that the biotech division had the best quarter in years we are delighted to see this and it gives us confidence that we are doing the right things to rejuvenate the core of the company we are very excited about the progress with integrating our reagentsbased acquisitions primegene and novus primegene has experienced near  growth in our china for china brand strategy theyve just moved to a new factory where we will focus on gp level products as well as boosting the product portfolio novus is completely integrated now and the internal system infrastructure that managed over  antibody products is now a central system in our overall antibody commercial operations we have now crossed the  mark for certified antibodies to run on our simple wes platform within our proteinsimple business this will allow researchers to purchase our antibodies with confidence that theyll perform as advertised in q north america continued to experience stable organic growth for the biotech division in this region our biopharma end markets experienced approximately  growth as theyve done for all of fiscal year  and our academia end market continued with its streak of sequential improvements since the fisher channel partnership was put in place over a year ago with growth this quarter in the midsingle digits both our us sales team and the fisher channel remain focused on engaging customers and understand their specific needs in combination with our new trade show investment and strategies europe rebounded in q with most countries continuing to perform nicely germany was less the drag on organic growth during the quarter with lowsingle digit declines yearoveryear compared to the doubledigit declines throughout the rest of fiscal year  there are signs now that the pharma research cycle in germany may have bottomed and we could see an uptick in growth here later in fiscal year  currency translation in europe continued to be a significant headwind in q and this is headwind will stay with us throughout the first half of fiscal year  assuming they stay where they are today when we look at our results in asia china really knocked it out of the park in q with  organic growth finishing the year with organic growth in the mids just as we expected at the beginning of the fiscal year what we didnt foresee a year ago was the disruption caused by the chinese governments anticorruption auditing activities but our team in china persevered despite the distractions and im very proud of what they achieved this year weve now grown the biotechne organization in china from just  people two years ago to now near  we expect exciting times in china to continue in the pacific rim we reported last quarter this region was impacted negatively by distributors reducing inventories due to the sudden strengthening of the us dollar in q japan was still soft showing signs of stabilizing while the rest of the pacific rim markets returned to doubledigit growth assuming no further change in exchange rates we believe the worst is behind us and japan too will return to growth in fiscal year  in our clinical controls division some new projects from oem customers that were delayed last quarter began to transfer in q resulting in revenue growth in the highsingle digits for the quarter for the year clinical controls grew midsingle digits we remain excited about some of the projects that we have for the business and we expect this kind of annual growth rate to continue lastly our protein platforms segment finished the year with  organic growth on a standalone basis but suffered in q of roughly flat yearoveryear revenue and breakeven operating profit the yearoveryear comparable was especially difficult in q given it was the last full quarter under prior ownership however the q performance of this division was still below our expectations there were several setbacks in the quarter mostly related to the integration of cyvek and commercial team attrition we have done a lot of reviewing of the situation the operations the team and the commercial processes and feel we have corrected the primary issues causing the bump in the road we also recognize that its an instruments business that will be more lumpy quartertoquarter than our core run rate reagents business model nothing has changed in our view of the market potential of the gamechanging platform solutions and continue to expect the business to operate at  organic growth annually for the foreseeable future we must also remember that cyvek is a pure startup and while we are now selling instruments the product line should be viewed as a few years behind proteinsimple thus this product line will be dilutive to adjusted earnings until revenues start to scale with profitability not expected until fiscal year  but the future is very bright here its just not here yet to help guide us towards this bright future we have hired a new head of human resources who is experienced in change management we are very excited about this new addition to our executive team the company has grown in the past two years from  people to nearly  and from six sites to  the promise of success for biotechne will be directly related to how fast we can get businesses and teams working together collaborating on complete solutions that are comprised of both reagents and instruments in our strategic markets focusing on managing change culture and collaboration will accelerate our time to success i am proud of our teams record performance this quarter and the increasing amount of dedication to our business there is true excitement and energy coming not only from our headquarters in minneapolis but all our new sites and regions it shows our recently conducted commercial reviews and in the faces of all those involved we look forward to another strong year ahead with everincreasing growth levels of the company given new many platforms that we now have in our portfolio with that i will turn the call over to jim for more detail on the financials before we open the line up for qa jim james t hippel  cfo vpfinance  principal accounting officer thanks chuck as on prior earnings calls i will provide an overview of our q financial performance for the total company and then provide some color on each of our three segments as a reminder at the total company level reported organic growth excludes the results of acquired companies up to the oneyear anniversary date of acquisition and it also excludes the impact of foreign currency translation however for the protein platforms segment we are providing organic revenue growth on a pro forma basis as if we owned proteinsimple and cyvek for all  and  so starting with the overall financial performance for the fourth quarter adjusted earnings was approximately flat to the prior year at  million while adjusted eps was  versus  in the prior year the impact of currency translation was a  yearoveryear headwind for the full year  adjusted earnings were  million a  increase versus prior year adjusted eps was  versus  with a foreign currency translation headwind of  under gaap eps recorded was  compared to  in the prior year and for the full year gaap eps was  versus  last year the decrease from last year for both the quarter and the year was driven by the amortization of intangibles and other costs related to acquisitions in addition to the impact of currency translation on the top line q reported sales were  million an increase of  yearoveryear with organic growth of  q sales included approximately  growth from acquisitions and a negative  impact from foreign exchange fullyear reported revenue was  million an increase of  with organic growth at  revenue for the full year included approximately  growth from acquisitions and a  headwind from currency translation moving on to the details of the pl total company adjusted gross margin came in at  in q down  basis points from the prior year the decrease is due to product mix change associated with the acquisitions that have occurred since last year as well as the impact of currency translation for the full year adjusted gross margin was  down  basis points from last year excluding the impact of acquisitions and fx core gross margins marginally improved yearoveryear for both the quarter and the full year due to the business productivity initiatives adjusted sga in q was  of revenue and rd was  of revenue  basis points and  basis points higher than last year respectively the increases in these operating expenses were driven by the acquisitions made since q of last year the resulting adjusted operating margin for the quarter was  operating margins excluding the impact of acquisitions and fx were flat compared to q of last year for the full year adjusted sga was  of revenue and rd expense was  of revenue a  basis point and  basis point increase respectively from the prior year the resulted adjusted operating margins for the full year were  again excluding the impact of acquisitions fx and higher noncash stockbased compensation operating margins were essentially flat to the prior year looking at our numbers below operating income net interest expense in q was  compared to  million of net interest income last year this is as a result of a line of credit that was opened in july of  to partially fund the acquisitions of proteinsimple and cyvek net interest expense for the full year was  million versus interest income of  million in the prior year adjusted other nonoperating income for q was  million compared to  million of nonoperating expense in the prior year quarter and for the full year adjusted nonoperating expense was  million versus  million in the prior year adjusted nonoperating yearoveryear improvements for both the quarter and the full year were driven by favorable transactional currency exchange fluctuation our adjusted effective tax rate in q was  up  basis points from the fourth quarter of last year due to acquisition and geographic mix and for the full year the adjusted effective tax rate was  ebit up  basis points from the prior year in terms of returning capital we continue to pay our dividend and paid out  million in the quarter and  million for the year average diluted shares were up  million shares for both the fourth quarter and the full year at  million shares and  million shares respectively both time periods represent less than  dilution from last year as a result of stock option grants turning to cash flow and the balance sheet  million of cash was generated from operations in the fourth quarter and  million was generated during the full year our investment in capital expenditures was  million for the quarter and  million for the year we ended the year with  million of cash and shortterm availableforsale investments down  million sequentially from the end of q the decrease was driven by incremental paydown of our line of credit as a result our longterm debt obligations at the end of q stood at  million a decrease of  million from the end of q that wraps up my comments on the total company performance for the fourth quarter and full year and now ill discuss the performance of our three business segments starting with the biotechnology segment q net sales for the segment were  million with reported growth of  compared to last year and organic growth of  growth from acquisitions was  while the impact from foreign exchange was negative  by geography north america increased in the highsingle digits organically biopharma sales continued to be strong in the region with growth nearing  while academic and government experienced its best quarter in many years with growth in the midsingle digits europe rebounded from q and experienced organic growth in the midsingle digits with most countries performing well and germany less of a drag on the growth for the region china experienced fantastic organic growth in the mids while pacific rim was flat yearoveryear as chuck noted earlier excluding japan the pacific rim grew approximately  and for the full year biotechnology segment revenue was  million with organic growth at  adjusted operating income for the biotechnology segment increased  in q compared to the prior year and adjusted operating margin was  a decline of  basis points yearoveryear foreign exchange currency translation impacted adjusted operating income negatively by  and operating margin by  basis points the remaining decline in adjusted margin percentage is attributable to a change in product mix associated with the acquisition of novus biologicals for all of fiscal year  adjusted operating margin was  also a decline of  basis point yearoveryear driven by the negative impact of fx and mix from acquisitions turning now to our clinical controls segment where q sales were  million both reported and organic growth was  compared to last year for all of fiscal year  sales were  million and organic growth was  adjusted operating income for the segment increased  in q and adjusted operating margin was  a decrease of  basis points from the prior year the decrease was attributable to pricing pressure in the blood glucose controls market however margins have since stabilized and were flat to q for the full fiscal year  adjusted operating margin was also  a decrease of  basis points yearoveryear moving on to our protein platforms segment where net sales in q were  million on a pro forma basis assuming proteinsimple and cyvek were owned for the entire quarter in both current and prior years organic revenue for the segment decreased  as chuck mentioned earlier the proteinsimple business experienced a very tough comparable where they grew  last year in what was their final quarter of prior ownership this tough comparable together with the integration of cyvek and commercial transition activities in q contributed to a lack of growth for the full year on a pro forma basis protein platforms grew  organically and we expect to see this kind of growth in fiscal year  and beyond adjusted operating margin in q was essentially breakeven as independent companies proteinsimple and cyvek together reported negative  adjusted operating margin in the quarter ended june   in all of fiscal year  for the period of time since the acquisitions that formed this new segment adjusted operating margin was  that concludes my prepared comments and with that i will turn the call back to the moderator to open the line up for some questions questionandanswer session operator our first question is going to come from dan leonard from leerink please go ahead dan dan l leonard  leerink partners llc apologies i had you on mute can you hear me now charles r kummeth  president chief executive officer  director yeah we can year you dan james t hippel  cfo vpfinance  principal accounting officer yeah dan l leonard  leerink partners llc great so my first question is on the platforms business can you speak to the visibility you have on the  organic growth view and whether theres any sort of backlog to support that or new product funnel charles r kummeth  president chief executive officer  director theres a strong new product funnel in fact proteinsimples organization has three different product lines simple western biologics and some other analytics that go along with the imaging stuff biologics was the biggest issue for this bump in the road this quarter actually on a simple wes platform we had a record quarter for installations it was a record number so the pipeline is strong theyve got deep programs in all the areas including biologics so more products coming and announcements soon to be had dan l leonard  leerink partners llc okay and then my follow up is there anything we should be aware of as it relates to pacing throughout fiscal  any days issues in any given quarter or anything youd call out james t hippel  cfo vpfinance  principal accounting officer yeah dan nothing id call out specifically there may be a day here or there quartertoquarter but nothing that we havent seen in our pacing from last year dan l leonard  leerink partners llc okay thank you operator and our next question is going to come from matt hewitt from craighallum please go ahead dillon k hoover  craighallum capital group llc hey good morning guys this is actually dillon on for matt digging into the biotech segment growth just wondering or trying to get a better sense of the customer mix thats driving that growth is that just new product growth getting deeper with existing customers or are you guys taking business from peers charles r kummeth  president chief executive officer  director well its a combination of things i mean one is weve talked about announcing a new website weve had strong traction with that weve had a pretty good lift with our academia by the market this quarter and the fisher numbers were the strongest weve ever had as well biotech pharma was also kind of on par where its been right at around  around there which is also very good all things considered thats whats been adding up to the  growth in the biotech side a record for us while ive been here anyway probably been many years james t hippel  cfo vpfinance  principal accounting officer yeah i would just add its too early to claim victory in terms of taking share from anywhere what weve seen from reported results from other companies in our space biopharma and academic has performed fairly well this quarter as well so i think were definitely keeping up with the market but i think its too early to say were at the point of taking share charles r kummeth  president chief executive officer  director i think the thing to point out is we were much stronger than we have been in the past in antibodies so thats our biggest deepest our broader investment area for the company i mean were on the fence with proteins and thats going fine its about antibodies and weve make some pretty good strides there dillon k hoover  craighallum capital group llc okay and then a quick follow up just in terms of the capital deployment strategy in  in the form ma are we going to expect any changes in the form of pace or size of deals charles r kummeth  president chief executive officer  director well in terms of capital we were kind of consistent with the capital the way weve been in the past and for operations on the ma side we did officially one deal we bought in last  most of these we did the first month into the fiscal year this last year and were on the way to integrating most of them novus is completely integrated at this plant looking forward weve never worked any less hard than we are now were trying like everyone does weve got a strong funnel someplus targets that weve had  they range in size from startup to large transformational deals were on the hunt all the time for things that hit our strategy but we think strategically first that said especially on the front where theres auctions its not a great for finding great deals its a good time for owners thinking that they should think about selling because everybody knows the market is pretty hot so thats helpful but youve still got to get a good price and its hard on both the private and public side so were diligent were working the process we have a deep and very rigorous process but we wont do a dumb deal we walked away from lot in this last year because the numbers werent good enough for us but strategy first numbers second and well keep hunting dillon k hoover  craighallum capital group llc great thanks and congrats on good quarter operator and our next question is going to come from jeff elliott from robert w baird please go ahead jeff t elliott  robert w baird  co inc broker yeah good morning nice quarter guys chuck can you provide any other color on the issues you had in the protein platforms division charles r kummeth  president chief executive officer  director yeah weve been digging into it pretty hard as you might imagine we had a lot of integration typical type concerns we had some market conditions as well we had as you already know and others know we had some bumps in some running buffers from some ancillary products that go with instruments we have those corrected this last quarter but that probably flowed through a little bit everything is caught up there the backlog is caught up as i mentioned it was a record quarter for shipping wes systems  biologics is little bit lumpy and on the biologics side we have some larger platforms there hundreds of thousands of dollars and thats where weve had some issues i mean you miss a couple of those and youre off a quite a bit so could be timing in some of those orders but they didnt hit i think also ive got to point out the fx in europe this has affected us in demand and our numbers in europe quite a bit and we see all that returning things are looking much better we did have some commercial team attrition fully expected we knew that a lot of that team would move on with tim and terry when they transitioned out of the business and they did i will mention we brought in an individual from my past at thermo fisher that ran the entire mass spec business for us  very strong person hes on board and like a kid in a candy shop putting in processes for the saves  this company is in right now in a growth level its coming together im very confident that weve got things under control here its lumpy and it is an instrument business its going to be lumpier i think our full plan was lowdouble digits because coming off the record fourth quarter last year and they sold everything they could before they sold to us and thats natural and so well see now if we have another quarter or two of flat going forward then things are going to change but we dont have any hair on fire alarms here yet so its kind of i think just the usual and things are looking pretty good there this quarter and i think its just a natural transition with this type of business model we think jeff t elliott  robert w baird  co inc broker got it and it sounds like you dont want to give fiscal  guidance but would you be able to comment on the estimates that you see out there the stuff in consensus charles r kummeth  president chief executive officer  director yeah we think you guys are closer on the revenue side and still some work to do i think on the bottom line with our investments in sga so i think youre close or catching up it looks good well give the feedback we can we still are not giving guidance we put out our notes for the future and our goals i will say that weve been very public with everybody about as we annualize these deals and looking forward we should be in  to  kind of growth range going forward and it could vary a lot depending on the lumpiness of our instrument platform but that should be kind of the range saying whether we can continue in the  range were not saying that in our organic core weve said victory for us is midsingle digits and thats what were sticking with right now if we do better in antibodies if we start taking more share things could be better its just like jim said its not time to claim any victory lap yet thats for sure but we are really happy with the quarter its obviously a lot better than last quarter for the year were right on track with where we told everybody wed be at and at midsingle digit level in our core and so were excited were happy we dont have really any homework to do in the core side everything is looking good even as of last we talked about the assays and elisa being kind of a drag this year theyve done a lot better i think a lot of its market as well everybody is looking pretty good this quarter so again no victory lap were just happy to be in upper end of path james t hippel  cfo vpfinance  principal accounting officer id add a modeling aspect of it is two things just to make sure and also being mindful of one is of course the fx impact and making sure were taking in account the bottom line impact is a very very high dropthrough for us on that fx impact and thats going to definitely be with us at least for the first six months of fiscal year  and where rates go from there well see but thats one item the other item id mentioned is the fact that we had one month in fiscal year  that we did not own proteinsimple and in that one month given how that instruments business works its very very light on revenue but still has the cost burden of its sga and rd run rate and so that one month worth of cost was not in our fiscal year  numbers but will be in our fiscal year  and the same goes for cyvek where we purchased cyvek outright in november of fiscal year  so theres a good four months of their sga rd costs in our first four month run rate thats not in fiscal year  that will be  i just would ask you to be mindful of those two items charles r kummeth  president chief executive officer  director yeah good catch jim jeff t elliott  robert w baird  co inc broker good thanks guys operator and our next question is going to come from drew jones from stephens please go ahead garrett ryan phelps  stephens inc hi guys this is actually garrett on for drew but first question you talked about placement strength with simple wes in the quarter was any of that seen on the academic market did you kind of charles r kummeth  president chief executive officer  director im sorry garrett youre breaking up we cant understand the question garrett ryan phelps  stephens inc hear me better now charles r kummeth  president chief executive officer  director yes thats better garrett ryan phelps  stephens inc okay hi guys this is garrett on for drew you talked about the simple wes placement strength in the quarter did you see any of that coming from the academic market as you kind of talked about addressing that market with proteinsimple in the past charles r kummeth  president chief executive officer  director its been even mix so one of the major factors of us even making the acquisition if you might recall with proteinsimple was that the desktop platform the wes would find a significant following with academia because we were concerned academia wouldnt make the switch and they did half their sales have been roughly with academia and i do believe that is continuing about the same trend garrett ryan phelps  stephens inc okay great and then also just on china given the strength weve seen in the quarter is this something where you think that strength will continue given more released funding or is this kind of a flood coming through of the funding that you saw in the quarter charles r kummeth  president chief executive officer  director we were pretty bullish all last year even when others were flat to lowsingle digits we still on strong doubledigit growth and were largely a run rate business there and not having instruments ship  thats probably part of it but were still very much in an expansion mode and while were near  people were still in the front end of our opportunities in china so as we open and grow in beijing and other cities i think were going to find more growth as these institutions keep driving for healthcare i think the audit activities are probably progressing and travelling from this space to the next space they want to look at in terms of markets and i think were moving through that i think the next riff of course is their market in general with everything crashing over there and the government stepping in i think theres a lot of unknowns for all of us if any of thats going to trickle down into the way purchasing happens within these programs theyre funding right now we believe and we hear that all funding in these areas is still there still strong as it was through the audit  operations this year its just people waiting for the process from the government how to actually spend the money theyre putting in place templates and processes actually how to account for their funding which they didnt have a lot of controls before so now they do so i think if all those controls get put in place well probably see maybe hope for some of that pentup funding we could see come forward for us to say were going to do better than  growth probably not were going to stick with we hope to be in that range for the foreseeable future which we think is pretty darned good growth rate were just really ecstatic that we had a quarter at  and i could just tell you that the team is really a great team really jazzed we had zero attrition in over a year in our china team i mean kind of unheard of so thats how happy they are were getting them a new site again theyve outgrown the other one they were only in it for like two years were merging that team with the proteinsimple team which is also growing and building over there so we have a fullfledged company there with demo capabilities and everything else so thats all coming in the coming year so theyre happy theyre excited theyre young but its a nascent market and industry as we all know and were trying to ride that wave as best we can garrett ryan phelps  stephens inc all right thanks guys operator and our next question is going to come from  please go ahead he disappeared one moment and our next question is going to come from karen padgett from biotechne please go ahead charles r kummeth  president chief executive officer  director hello karen might be a mistake shes probably listening in but operator and our next question is going to come from john souter from railsplitter please go ahead your line is live mr souter did you have a question our next question is going to come from paul knight from janney montgomery please go ahead paul richard knight  janney montgomery scott llc hi chuck i think everybodys confused on the star  or  star we figured it out now charles r kummeth  president chief executive officer  director we know you know how to do this paul paul richard knight  janney montgomery scott llc how big is china do you think can you say charles r kummeth  president chief executive officer  director how big what do you mean paul richard knight  janney montgomery scott llc  million revenue is it  million charles r kummeth  president chief executive officer  director i think allin this year were in the  millionish range with proteinsimple and everything in were mid to high  million in the core reagent side of the business paul richard knight  janney montgomery scott llc and on proteinsimple what are people saying what would be their complaint or what do you see is the issue is it not enough people on the ground is it applications charles r kummeth  president chief executive officer  director i think its just as i said it was a bit of perfect storm we had a plan in the lowdouble digit growth because it was a  growth comp from last year we had a backlog issue to clear out from the quarter before on some of the its called running buffers theyre reagents that work with the system thats all been corrected remember that whole company whole business moved to a new building in the past year and there were a lot of new building startup issues which were all – were through all that the fx piece is a strong component when youre in the instrument business these are big ticket items theres a lot of currency issues in europe around that so that was a hit for the quarter that too has come around and we have had some commercial turnover terry had the commercial of the company before moving on six months to nine months ago weve had to transition through that weve gone with an incumbent actually the person that trained in terry years ago as head of commercial for the company now she has some years experience shes wonderful we think and knows all the people and were filling in around that and then on the other operations side with one of my people from my past at thermo fisher in operations i think were on track for us always was always probably will be and was the plan going forward our deepest concern was the rd team the development team with this young company with this strong pipeline of technology and new products and that we preserve that and we preserve all of that weve had zero attrition there on the rd front with bob gavin the head of that and running that business for us as the svp of the division and thats all gone very well hes been in the role here for nine months or so very pleased with that so its just a lot of little things going forward we do still think this is a  kind of grower i do believe that it is probably more feet in the street is probably important i think regionally for sure weve got some coverage issues to deal with it is a very very exciting platform as i mentioned with all these issues we had a record quarter in our simple western in our wes platform so were shipping a lot of systems now in the quarter and its starting to scale so the rest of the pipeline it needs to get out its the bigger platforms we need to do a little better on and i think its coming so well watch it this quarter and have more input i guess james t hippel  cfo vpfinance  principal accounting officer hi paul this is jim just to clarify in case youre looking at this from a modeling perspective for china a very good guess by chuck on the  million i actually have the exact numbers here in front of me what we call our china region finished the year around  million but that also includes that taiwan and hong kong and it also includes products that are made in china that ultimately get exported out of china from primegene so from a modeling perspective if youre thinking about mainland china where the high organic growth is coming from its probably more in the mid to high  million paul richard knight  janney montgomery scott llc okay got it and then lastly europe was a problem in the first quarter i guess thats over now charles r kummeth  president chief executive officer  director in the fourth quarter last quarter you mean paul richard knight  janney montgomery scott llc sorry in the march quarter charles r kummeth  president chief executive officer  director it was certainly a problem its less a problem this quarter is it over is europe ever over were comfortable saying that we think weve seen the coming back of lot of projects with our biotech pharma our largest customer base in the german region so i can say right now on that we like what we see the numbers are improving it was still a lownegative singledigit drag but thats a lot better than doubledigits like last quarter paul richard knight  janney montgomery scott llc did the quarters orders finish stronger or was it even throughout the period charles r kummeth  president chief executive officer  director they finished strong at the end of the quarter its definitely been a trend paul richard knight  janney montgomery scott llc okay charles r kummeth  president chief executive officer  director another quarter or two and we hope to have germany something like last year remember last year was doubledigit growth and so it is a little bit cyclical there paul richard knight  janney montgomery scott llc lastly what do you think market growth is for your core protein elisa business antibody business charles r kummeth  president chief executive officer  director yeah i think as a composite in the market is probably  to  i think the best one of course are antibodies we did all the primary research like you guys do its highsingle digits and proteins we think are  to  as a market being the smallest market of the bunch weve been in the midsingle digits we definitely think weve been taking some share back the last couple years from these ankle biters that have been chasing us our brand new strategies i think are working we think the website has been phenomenal our traffic and our orders are up  in only in the first month of this new website and i think id tell you that the website previously was about flat the two years ive been here so we had immediate response on the new website and again thats coming off a lot of the infrastructure the process system tools and experience the novus team brought with them who already run this whole thing for us now and its been really wonderful on time on target on budget and i hope the growth in the traffic keeps going paul richard knight  janney montgomery scott llc great thank you operator our next question is going to come from amanda murphy from william blair please go ahead amanda l murphy  william blair  co llc hi good morning so just a couple on the competitive dynamics so i appreciate all the commentary around the antibody business and it sounds like fisher is doing pretty well for you but have you seen any change – it sounds like youre gaining share but any change in terms of pricing from any of the competitors and then i guess you mentioned some pricing pressure in the blood glucose segment so maybe just talk a little bit about that as well charles r kummeth  president chief executive officer  director ill go in reverse the glucose is kind of old history its old news that really happened almost a full year ago and we kind of worked through it amanda l murphy  william blair  co llc okay charles r kummeth  president chief executive officer  director jims comment was really quarteronquarter the same so were through that its almost a last man standing kind of strategy here so we dont think theres a lot more downside one of the reasons we bought the business and for us its all about building out that funnel to everincreasing content its a bit of a super specialized highcontent packaging organization with high volume processes so we love it for that and the other side antibodies i would say no overall pricing differences there were still building who we are in antibodies were not at the same level of clout that we are in proteins of course we are probably officially the largest supplier in the world right now but thats not to say that were maybe selling the most we have processes and a website and everything including a wonderfully trained fisher channel to now move things along and i think its working we had the best quarter so far with fisher they just keep getting better so well keep feeding that beast and hopefully it keeps working well theyre very committed to us theyre very good with our teams weve had absolutely no channel conflict its been marvelous to watch how we all work together on that they really like having us on board as a partner and as  content rules in this space it helps to pull through all the other million products they do so its a good thing for all of us amanda l murphy  william blair  co llc so netnet the market share gains were driven by fisher and then the website is that fair charles r kummeth  president chief executive officer  director i would say less the website its been a month amanda l murphy  william blair  co llc yeah charles r kummeth  president chief executive officer  director giving some good initial data but it isnt material yet probably fisher definitely helped on the academic side in the quarter no doubt about it amanda l murphy  william blair  co llc got it okay and then just last one on the proteinsimple side i dont think you guys talked specifically about the whole revenue synergy opportunity and what that added if anything in the quarter charles r kummeth  president chief executive officer  director for like the antibody catalogue amanda l murphy  william blair  co llc exactly yeah charles r kummeth  president chief executive officer  director its growing its still not material enough to say again no victory lap here either we are over  antibodies now were on track for over  end of the year annual here and we like what we see i think this is the kind of thing that takes some time youre trying to woo academics mainly online into taking – going after your certification process were getting traction and its going the right direction i think its the right strategy and for us its probably all incremental growth so thats important amanda the other revenue synergy thats much harder to measure is how much of additional instruments were selling because theres an antibody solution geared for it and it doesnt really show up in the numbers either so it is hard to measure but we believe that the combined offering helps both sides of the business no doubt amanda l murphy  william blair  co llc got it thank you operator there are no questions in queue at this time james t hippel  cfo vpfinance  principal accounting officer all right well i want to thank everybody for joining in the number of people listening in here is increasing every quarter were

biotechne corporation website at wwwbiotechnecom and with that i will turn the call over to chuck charles r kummeth  president chief executive officer  director thank you dave and good morning everyone thank you for joining us for our third quarter conference call this morning we reported revenue growth of  for the third quarter with the majority of our end markets remaining strong organically plus a solid contribution from our recent acquisition im extremely pleased with the achievement of  organic growth corporatewide with our core biotech business growing  organically in fact this is biotechnes strongest quarter since i joined the company three years ago providing evidence that the strategy to reaccelerate biotechnes top line by growing our core business and expanding to adjacent markets continues to gain traction protein platforms increased over  organically in the quarter with our commercial reorganization and focused strategy beginning to yield results im also very pleased with our teams operational performance in the quarter with both growth and operating margins exceeding our internal plan driving operating margins once again above  and contributing to a  yearoveryear increase in our adjusted net income in our biotechnology business overall we experienced broadbased growth across the portfolio with proteins antibodies and assays all contributing to solid performance i would like to highlight the performance of our antibody portfolio in the quarter which grew high singledigits overall including a  increase in our novus biologicals brand in the us our biopharma end markets remain strong with revenue increasing midteens for the quarter our biopharma customers continue to partner with biotechne for the outsourcing of complex molecules with our reputation for ultrapure highly bioreactive reagents driving additional business within our existing biopharma client base and creating opportunities with new customers our academia and government end market grew in the low singledigits similar to the trend weve experienced in recent quarters weve been experiencing growth in this end market since the major update of our website last summer we will continue to invest in the ongoing evolution of our website by making navigation improvements and adding content and active links to thousands of products that resonate with our academia customers since the release of our updated website internal internet traffic has continued to increase and encouragingly the visitors to our site are spending more time on the site increasing the probability of ordering we are also investing in search engine optimization to drive traffic to our website these investments are starting to pay off with our novus biologicals brand which was the first of our brands to use the enhanced website seeing an uppersingledigit increase in website visits and a midteen increase in webgenerated revenue overall we are making tremendous progress with our website redesign and view this as a key for longterm growth within our academic customer base moving on to other regions europe organic growth was flat overall in q however underlying trends within our european biotech business remain healthy adjusting for the timing of the easter holiday which occurred in q this year versus q last year as well as the timing of some large biopharma orders normalized growth rates would have been a midsingle digit increase thus as these timing issues reverse in q we expect to end fiscal year  with a solid midsingledigit organic growth rate for the year china remains a very strong geography for biotechne with organic revenue increasing in the mids year over year we are particularly impressed with the sustained growth in china especially considering the  increase we experienced in this geography last quarter our new gmp factory for primegene is complete and fully functional giving biotechne the competitive edge in our china for china strategy and supporting our expectations for continued strong doubledigit growth in this geography we anticipate the growing chinese middle class will be driving ongoing demand for improved access to healthcare driving additional investments in life science research and benefiting our rapidly growing business in this geography overall we are very pleased with the strong performance within our core biotech product portfolio with q representing the fourth consecutive quarter of at least midsingle digit organic growth in the segment getting our core back to consistent midsingle digit growth has been the most challenging and complex part of our fiveyear strategic plan and im proud of our teams effort to get us there and have confidence in their ability to maintain this momentum moving on to our clinical controls division we experienced a strong performance from our acquired business cliniqa although the timing of oem delivery dates impacted organic growth in the quarter as a reminder our bionostics and cliniqa businesses both include chemistrybased reagent product lines with longer shelf lives allowing oem customers to buy in bulk introducing the potential for quartertoquarter volatility our legacy hematology controls business remains stable growing midsingledigits given the relatively shorter shelf life of our hematology control products we view growth of these products as an indicator of stable underlying demand within our clinical controls end market cliniqa a controls and reagent supplier for diagnostic market that we acquired last july continues to outperform our expectations importantly the addition of cliniqa to the biotechne clinical controls division continues to open up additional pipeline opportunities for the business making biotechne an even more important supplier to the biopharma and diagnostics industries cliniqa under the biotechne umbrella we are now focused on filling and expanding the growing pipeline of opportunities for our clinical controls division i would like to point out that the growth of our organic business combined with cliniqa has created a business with critical mass and annualized revenue run rate approaching  million lastly the work we have done over the last couple of quarters to improve our protein platforms sales force and commercialization strategy is beginning to bear fruit of organic growth above  for the quarter i want to update everyone on some of the positive developments within our protein platforms segment that give us confidence in our ability to maintain doubledigit growth in this business exiting fiscal  and beyond our strength in simple western sales force has been in place for two quarters now and given the sixmonth to ninemonth instrumentation selling cycle i believe we are in the early innings of realizing the efforts of our strengthened commercial team additionally we continue to augment the simple western sales force with the entire rd systems commercial team to generate leads crosssell and demo this gamechanging western blot technology this gamechanging technology continues to resonate with the scientific community and we anticipate significant western blot share capture by automating a timeconsuming manual and poorly reproducible process that has been in place for over  years we remain very pleased with the performance of simple plex product line within the protein platforms segment this quarter as a reminder this is the rebranded cyvek startup business we acquired a year ago in november consisting of the ella line of multiplex elisa instruments and associated assay cartridges we continue to see growing interest from our customers for the workflow enhancements that simple plex testing platform delivers we remain in the very early stages of ella instrument adoption and the associated revenue ramp and anticipate simple plex to become a significant revenue contributor in future quarters during the quarter we strengthened our protein platforms offering with the launch of maurice an advanced imaging capillary electrophoresis or ice instrument all pharmaceutical customers utilize ice instruments for the quantitative analysis of identity purity and heterogeneity maurice improves our legacy ice platforms by delivering higher sensitivity easier workflow and shorter run times compared to legacy technologies allowing researchers to shorten drug development timelines we are very pleased of the early traction maurice is gaining with biopharmaceutical customers with the initial launch exceeding our expectations we anticipate maurice to be a solid addition to the growing lineup of protein platforms instruments we further strengthened our protein platforms segment through the acquisition of zephyrus biosciences adding a singlecell western blot instrument we named milo to our growing portfolio of instruments zephyrus is currently a prerevenue business although we plan to commercialize milo in july of  we view zephyruss singlecell western blot technology as a natural fit with our proteinsimple business and are excited to leverage our protein platforms sales force to bring another innovative instrument to market to summarize we are very pleased with the protein platforms overall performance in q and believe we remain on track for continued momentum in this business in coming quarters based on the sales pipeline and positive momentum in both lead generation and quote activity we believe q was the start of a new longterm trend of doubledigit growth for the protein platforms segment i also want to provide a quick update on our ma pipeline following the zephyrus acquisition our pipeline of potential ma targets remained stronger than ever with our strong balance sheet and cash flow providing biotechne flexibility in our disciplined ma approach we plan to continue to augment our organic business with acquisitions that strengthen our position in existing businesses and geographies or leverage our reagent expertise in adjacent markets with that ill pass the call over to jim for a more detailed review of the financials before we open the line up for qa jim james t hippel  chief financial officer yeah thank you chuck as in our prior earnings call i will provide an overview of our q financial performance for the total company and then provide some color on each of our three segments starting with the overall third quarter financial performance adjusted earnings increased  yearoveryear to  million while adjusted eps was  a share versus  in the prior year the impact of currency translation represented a headwind to eps of approximately  gaap eps for the quarter was  compared to  in the prior year q reported revenue was  million an increase of  yearoveryear with organic revenue increasing  third quarter reported sales included  growth contribution from acquisitions partially offset by a  unfavorable foreign exchange headwind please note that the components of q growth do not sum due to rounding moving on to the details of the pl total company adjusted gross margin was  in q decreasing  basis points from the prior year strong volume leverage and productivity gains in our protein platforms and biotech divisions were more than offset by the lower margin cliniqa acquisition and unfavorable fx impact excluding the impact of acquisitions and fx core gross margins improved  basis points yearoveryear in the third quarter adjusted sga in q was  of revenue  basis points higher than last year the sga increase was driven primarily by investments made to improve our website capabilities and commercial execution as well as the additional sga from the acquisitions made since the beginning of the third quarter of last year rd expense in q was  of revenue  basis points lower than last year reflecting the volume leverage achieved from protein platforms the resulting adjusted operating margin for q was  relatively flat to prior year and a sequential improvement of  basis points from q looking at our numbers below operating income net interest expense in q was  million compared to  million of net interest expense last year due to higher draws on our line of credit which partially funded our cliniqa acquisition last july other nonoperating expense for the quarter was  million compared to  million of nonoperating expense in the prior year quarter with unfavorable transactional fx explaining the yearoveryear variance our adjusted effective tax rate in q was  down  basis points from the third quarter of last year due to recognition of rd tax credits in terms of returning capital we continue to pay our dividend and paid out  million in the quarter average diluted shares were relatively flat over the year ago at  million shares outstanding turning to cash flow and the balance sheet  million of cash was generated from operations in the third quarter a  increase from the prior year and our investment in capital expenditures was  million we ended the quarter with  million of cash and shortterm available for sale investments our longterm debt obligations at the end of q stood at  million a decrease of  million from end of q going forward our capital deployment priorities remain opportunistic ma our dividend and debt pay down now ill discuss the performance of our three business segments starting with the biotechnology segment q reported sales were  million with organic growth of  foreign exchange negatively impacted reported sales growth by approximately  by geography the us grew approximately  organically with midteens biopharma sales growth and low singledigit academic results europe was flat organically with biopharma sales in this region increasing low singledigits offsetting a low singledigit decline in academia as chuck mentioned in his comments the timing of the easter holiday impacted our european results representing an unfavorable  impact to our growth in this geography however this timing impact should reverse in q china experienced strong organic growth in the mids while pacific rim declined upper singledigits yearoveryear excluding japan however the pacific rim grew in the low teens japan remains challenged by government funding reductions and delays adjusted operating income for the biotech segment increased  in q compared to the prior year adjusted operating margin was  a decrease of  basis points yearoveryear due to the timing of certain commercial investments partially offset by the impact of productivity initiatives and volume leverage turning now to clinical controls segment sales in q were  million with reported growth of  over last year the acquisition of cliniqa contributed  to growth while organic revenue decreased  as with prior quarters the timing of oem shipment orders introduces variability to clinical controls segment with customer ordering patterns weighing on our q segment results given the quarterly variability introduced by the oem ordering patterns from our chemistrybased controls and now cliniqa we believe a trailing month organic rate is more indicative of our clinical controls segment performance on a pro forma basis assuming cliniqa was included in our results last year as well as this year the trailing month organic growth rate for the segment is  clinical controls adjusted operating income increased  in q and adjusted operating margin was  an increase of  basis points from the prior year the higher adjusted operating income and margin was primarily attributable to strong volume leverage associated with the cliniqa acquisition moving on to our protein platforms segment net sales in q were  million an organic increase of  from the prior year period unfavorable currency translation impacted revenues by less than  growth in the segment was broadbased with most major regions and product lines growing by solid doubledigits quarter ended march  was the first march end quarter to grow sequentially from the previous december end quarter in the history of proteinsimple including the years predating the acquisition of biotechne we believe this provides further evidence that our new commercial strategy is taking hold and the reacceleration of protein platforms have begun revenue from simple plex also continues to ramp and we remain pleased with the revenue trajectory of this business as chuck discussed we acquired zephyrus biosciences in q and anticipate to commercialize the associated singlecell western blot analysis instrument milo during the first quarter of our fiscal  adjusted operating income in q for the protein platforms segment was  million representing an operating margin of  compared to a  million adjusted operating loss one year ago with strong volume leverage and productivity driving the yearoveryear improvement we continue to expect additional improvement in protein platforms profitability as topline growth and productivity gains drive operating leverage in coming quarters so in summary q was a record quarter for biotechne on an adjusted bottomline result accomplished by solid commercial and operational execution in all of our businesses we expect to finish the year strong as well with q looking very similar to q from a topline perspective however we expect the mix to change somewhat with the biotechnology segment in particular facing a rather tough comp from prior year when they grew  organically thus the margin profile in q may not be as strong as q due to a change in mix that concludes my prepared comments and with that i will turn the call back over to melanie to open the lines for some questions questionandanswer session operator thank you well go first to dan leonard with leerink partners dan l leonard  leerink partners llc thank you so i just want to delve into the protein platforms performance a bit more can you talk more about the components of the growth there i know you said it was broadbased so maybe offer some color about how much of the strength was maurice versus simple western and any color on the consumable trends as opposed to the instrument revenue trends would be helpful charles r kummeth  president chief executive officer  director yeah well maurice has a strong takeup here as the beginning platform but its still not material to the overall performance performance of the division really is still around simple western we worked hard to get the commercial team really back into place and up to speed and focusing on lead generations and productivity and cross selling with our rd systems commercial force and thats all bearing fruit we really thought – were near the  kind of number of instruments per quarter and thats up from the s or so a year ago so its pretty good growth there overall the simple plex is also ramping and is close to plan still a small business but not a startup anymore its starting to bear fruit the revenue component in simple plex will be stronger in consumables the assays being a strong component because its a closed system we remain at about a  consumable rate on the rest of the biologics platform so really growth is really kind of across all the platforms with the biggest component being simple western biologics has always been a strong platform and even the existing product platforms are still selling well and maurice is a new category so almost the same size in general as simple western but the acceleration of simple western outpaces biologics of course we could have a surprise going forward maurice is exceeding our expectations but we are still banking on the fact that simple western will outdo it its a much larger market opportunity dan l leonard  leerink partners llc got it thats all helpful and then my followup question can you give us an update on how youre looking at japan charles r kummeth  president chief executive officer  director well the same way everybody else is with a lot of prayers so theyre – weve been hearing that theyre aimed at new consortium of funding pharma the government is starting to release funds were starting to see early i guess data from that its as much an issue of easy comps as anything probably but its still early i just – we dont – were not banking on any strong fast recovery in japan to be honest and i dont think anyone else is talking about it either i dont think were worse off than anybody else its just a matter of waiting on funding were still growing actually our team just came back from protein platforms division and they had a positive report on some uptake in japan but in general its kind of steady as she goes and just not enough happening waiting on funding dan l leonard  leerink partners llc got it thanks chuck operator well go next to jeff elliott with robert baird jeff t elliott  robert w baird  co inc broker thanks for the question jim can you just verify did you have any change in selling days in the quarter i get the easter impact but were you kind of same yearoveryear in terms of the number of days in the quarter james t hippel  chief financial officer yeah we didnt have any drastic change due to any kind of  calendar because we operate on a normalized typical calendar however admittedly there was an extra day with leap year so leap year was the extra day in february did provide an extra day of revenue there it may have had a  or so lift its hard to say exactly jeff t elliott  robert w baird  co inc broker okay so pretty minor though and just moving over to – i guess sticking with jim i guess looking at the segment margins given the moving pieces with cliniqa and some of the i guess deals i guess can you just help us think about the segment margins maybe in the next couple of quarters how should we think about modeling those james t hippel  chief financial officer yeah from a segment margin perspective i would say that with regards to our biotech and clinical controls divisions fairly steady margins from what weve seen its more around protein platforms that we can continue to see some expansion there with the margin pullthrough – with the net revenue pullthrough so like we saw from not only yearoveryear but quarteroverquarter perspective with protein platforms we saw some nice – very nice margin expansion there with the additional revenue and as they continue to recover on the top line we should see some continued leverage on their cost base so id say steady – chuck put it as steady as she goes in two of our three segments with some increasing margin pullthrough in protein platforms but also keep in mind the overall mix with that reacceleration of protein platforms revenue the overall mix will be a bit of a headwind due to the low margin overall of ppd versus our biotech division jeff t elliott  robert w baird  co inc broker okay charles r kummeth  president chief executive officer  director when you start doing the math when you start doing your math on ccd youre going to see the strong component tradition here from cliniqa we had a huge quarter for them it didnt count organically but its there in the numbers and its big it is a lumpier business and were going to go to a ttm kind of number it wont sustain at that run rate this quarter its going to be up and down just to realize that that would be – youre going to –  million is not a typical quarter for this segment jeff t elliott  robert w baird  co inc broker got it okay thanks guys thats helpful nice quarter operator and well go next to amanda murphy with william blair amanda l murphy  william blair  co llc hi good morning just a couple of quick ones so first i dont think you mentioned the fisher distribution agreement specifically i guess how thats gone this quarter i know its kind of been a little bit back and forth in terms of how much contribution its had so wondering if it was helpful and how youre thinking about it long term charles r kummeth  president chief executive officer  director well were still low singledigits in academia which is still way better than it used to be i think its kind of steady as she goes there i would say the fisher performance as a component of that was marginally better than last quarter still not as good as it was in the first early quarters in our relationship now we are starting to hit some size issues here its becoming a larger and larger percentage share of our channel in the academia sector i think if you compare it to their results overall and we study their results and we talk to them id say we came in under where they were at in their own performance so were working through that allinall though better than last quarter so were optimistic and it is still a crucial element to our channel strategy and helping us keep our costs down in our commercial organization and the attitude is good crossselling is good teams get along so were hanging in there with that and it would be nice to see them break it out and do at least as well as they talk about their entire segment as a company at thermo but we have not yet achieved that amanda l murphy  william blair  co llc is there any specific driver of that slowdown or is it just a function of kind of being early in the relationship and working through and as you said just similar size charles r kummeth  president chief executive officer  director no its not only that i think we had some great preliminary results for five quarters six quarters in a row really and i think what changed was a couple – the dynamics within their own company as they integrated life tech one youve added a lot of the portfolio theyve got a much bigger bag to sell and it opened up opportunities internally i think for a lot of their rock star salespeople and their technical people so theyve had more internal turnovers so people are jumping from the fisher side to the thermo fisher division and so were having to train and retrain and get a more – more of a rhythm going with their sales force i think as a bigger issue its how much is in the bag and staying current with their technical workforce our portfolio is – it doesnt sell itself its very complicated technical reagents and we trained their entire technical sales force from the beginning and weve got to keep the pace with that and i think thats probably why its been a little bit different the last couple of quarters but its coming back weve identified the issues there and they are very supportive and were working on that so amanda l murphy  william blair  co llc got it charles r kummeth  president chief executive officer  director it is a big company and its firing in all cylinders as you saw their report so theyve got lots of opportunities for people and people are moving around amanda l murphy  william blair  co llc makes sense and then just one i guess broader question i think in the past youve said that based on your current book of business that you could see a revenue run rate closer to  million if you include potential synergies that you might be able to drive and so i guess my question is is that still the case and then secondly you talked about the pipeline that you have being fairly strong and when you first came on board you outlined a plan of inorganic and organic growth so given what you have in the pipeline do you still see that those targets as being achievable charles r kummeth  president chief executive officer  director yeah so our strat plan is trying to get to  billion in five years i think were still within the range of that possibility it wasnt – its always been more of an ideal its not a forecast or anything of course i think we backed off to  million number a little over a year ago when fx kind of went crazy on us here europe especially really talking more of a steady state around  million or so if we did no other deals and then getting up into the low s the margin area i think we are on track for that theres no issue but we are going to do deals our pipeline remains very strong weve been in some actions we havent – one as of late we spent a lot of time on the affymetrix deal we really wanted that clearly we were outbid by a heavyweight that wanted it badly and had a lot more synergies than we could offer but were always working on many at the same time and we currently are as well they are probably leaning a little more toward the private side and well try to do a few things without attracting the big guys but theres a lot of opportunities we have strong cash flow weve got a great team weve got – were working together on some deals where the teams do get along so its just about making the numbers work and making investors happy and all that stuff but our pipeline remains on the order of  different targets from small to large so amanda l murphy  william blair  co llc got it very helpful thank you operator well go next to matt hewitt with craighallum capital group matt g hewitt  craighallum capital group llc good morning congratulations on the strong quarter a couple of questions from me first so if im understanding in the clinical controls segment you had some benefit with timing on shipments in the third quarter just trying to calibrate what that means for q is it – are you expecting something similar to q at  million  million or something similar to the year ago period with maybe a few basis points of growth so that would be closer to  million james t hippel  chief financial officer yeah matt well – were not going to give a specific guidance by segment i think what i would share with you is that it is lumpy and its – so in fact we had strong orders out of cliniqa which doesnt count organically but i mean out of our legacy chemistrybased controls business which in fact is organic and going forward it could be lumpy as well but again at a high level what we will share is that we expect our overall company revenues to be similar in q – or q and q the mix between the business units could change a little bit i think it will change somewhat in the sense that ppd overall revenue will be likely a lower percentage thats a negative mix impact thats what well share matt g hewitt  craighallum capital group llc okay charles r kummeth  president chief executive officer  director and we will also – hematology component has been and have been and remains and will remain steady as she goes at ish growth rates very much a run rate matt g hewitt  craighallum capital group llc okay all right thanks and then chuck maybe a question for you when you came on board there was a lot of heavy lifting on the investment side there was a lot of internal investments that need to be made where do you think you are in that stage what stage do you think you are in those heavy investments do you see that tailing off obviously investing for growth will be necessary but from some of those initial investments where do we sit and how does that play out over the next year or two years charles r kummeth  president chief executive officer  director thats a great question i think – id say were about in the seventh inning on that the investments kind of come in two categories for me one is theyre really operational and theyre really needed for productivity or theyre capital right and we have built out three different buildings already here on my watch and at the most we have one more to do here internally here and locally in headquarters that were playing around with in terms of ability to kind of rework our total work streams i mean youve been here right this place is like a honeycomb its like – changing around and making improvements is like working a rubiks cube so you need to start with a big enough blank sheet of paper or space to try and redo everything and clean it up so were in the middle of that were doing a lot of lean things as you saw our margins improved again we had absolutely phenomenal productivity again in this – in the biotech sector but software around email computers all being replaced lms system and were ready to pull the trigger on phase one of our erp system in july thats all on track which is fairly expensive weve got a lot of – and the team the executive team is pretty much in place i dont see a lot of new additions going forward the stock and equitybased compensation is all in place for the top  people theres not a big need to further do that right now unless theres need through acquisitions of new team members that way so i think were in a good place there we have capital needs going forward i think with the phase two and three of erp theres continued investment id say a steadystate on the website development nothing more but nothing less weve made improvements there so that will be a same as she goes going forward we are putting in place another – putting in place hyperion for consolidation weve gone from  sites to  sites and poor jim is tired of consolidating the spreadsheets on napkins so were getting a – the real system hes used to using from his days at thermo and most of the world uses and things like that you have to do but really the – you said it well the heavy lifting i think is really behind us were going through a – our – my third round of roundtables ive probably done over  different meetings with groups of employees on the last three months four months and theyre noticing it theyre very appreciative and they get it they see where were going and they see it matt g hewitt  craighallum capital group llc thats – go ahead thats great thank you very much thats a really good update thank you operator well go next to william march with janney montgomery scott william march  janney montgomery scott llc hey guys its bill march on for paul knight how are you guys doing charles r kummeth  president chief executive officer  director good james t hippel  chief financial officer good william march  janney montgomery scott llc first question maybe if you could – you saw middouble digit growth in the biopharma segment whats driving the growth from that end market charles r kummeth  president chief executive officer  director okay well a couple of things when we worked hard at getting our core back in place i mean we certainly took some arrows over proteinsimple a few quarters ago but the harder part of this company turning around and getting it going has been getting this core because it is just so fragmented as you know we still dont have really any reagent products over  million and we still have customer base is  or less in general we typically have done a lot of prioritization since ive come here around what were going to make and why instead of just throwing  or more new products at the wall and see what sticks every year were substantially down from that now somewhere around  but a lot quicker time to revenue a lot more focus on the marking end of it and why there is going to be quick takeup and part of that has been the trend i think in cro theres been a lot of custom in the industry and abcam reported won a lot of custom going on as well were seeing it too so were getting on the biotech pharma side were getting a lot of requests because were a quality producer weve got great scientists and we were in some cases the only game in town for the things we make and theyre coming more and more for special things we try to put as much of that into the catalogue as possible it doesnt all go if it doesnt go its always still a recurring revenue stream with that partner and the thing i like its immediate sales youre not waiting at all so weve had a dramatic improvement in our vitality index if you remember though our first year here we reported about  million in first year sales last year we reported  million this year were probably well over  million were thinking so its been a dramatic improvement in the core but also from custom and everything else and its largely biotech pharma which has been driving this double digit growth rate when you start adding the numbers up william march  janney montgomery scott llc great and then charles r kummeth  president chief executive officer  director and whats interesting much more visible too are the websites helping there were – i could go on and on about our tradeshow strategies and investments there the booth redesigns the comprehensive look we have around our family of brands we just came back from acr and the response was unbelievable we had a record number of leads and pretty much across the board customers are saying yeah we know who biotechne is now and were – and we like doing business with you we like the path you are on with all the different segments because youre becoming more and more of a onestop shop for us so william march  janney montgomery scott llc great and then secondly in terms of end markets maybe on the academic side what are you seeing from that end market in terms of with the new nih budget and maybe what you see for the rest of the calendar year thanks charles r kummeth  president chief executive officer  director yeah were seeing kind of what everyone else is reporting on i dont think weve seen too much of a takeup yet from that extra funding and spending maybe a little bit but were not really seeing a lot of evidence were – like everyone thinks its going to be really occurring mostly in the second half of the calendar year here and were hopeful it should be – weve talked about what it should give us when you roll it all through when you go through our analytics with our customers it should be about a  overall improvement for us is it there yet or not well we had a record quarter maybe a little bit there its hard to start separating the stuff under  like that so william march  janney montgomery scott llc understood thanks guys have a good day charles r kummeth  president chief executive officer  director at least were moving in the right direction at least were not contracting were going to – were in an expansion timeframe for a while we think so thats good william march  janney montgomery scott llc great thank you operator and that will conclude our questionandanswer session id like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks charles r kummeth  president chief executive officer  director well very proud of our team it was a great quarter im sure hope it continues we see a lot of – we see a very bright future here people are having fun and well talk to you again next quarter thank you operator that does conclude todays conference we thank you for your participation you may now disconnect copyright
