to magazine sleep retailer enews selling better sleep rsa marketing tips from michael j breaus hd the sleep doctor homeaccessoriesselling better sleep rsa marketing tips from michael j breaus hd the sleep doctor it’s a common scenario—a customer walks into your store wanting to buy a new mattress but doesn’t feel comfortable enough to even sit much lay down on the bed…now what the purchase of a mattress is like no other product to a consumer it is a big ticket item with a very intimate purpose you know it’s a product that has the ability to change your customer’s quality of life in a very short time consumers have a multitude of mattress products to choose from and the choices can be overwhelming most consumers approach the purchase with reluctance or can be clueless as to where or how to start the buying process but an rsa that knows how to start a conversation about sleep can be a hero to these consumers the rsa can be educated to ask mattress shoppers “conversation starters” that bring the customer comfortably into the buying process and ultimately help the rsa identify the best product choice for the customer the rsa will also be able to help communicate product expectations to the customers that can result in better product satisfaction so how do you start this sleep conversation the first question is one you probably already ask how well did you sleep last night the answer will tell you about their overall sleep satisfaction and asks a question about their current sleep quality find out what was good and what wasn’t good about their sleep this can tell you if their sleep issues relate to their environment their health or life stresses something as simple as knowing that they sleep with two kids and two dogs might let you know they need a bigger bed has their sleep changed recently do they think they sleep too much or too little this is a great time to engage your customer in a discussion about their beliefs about sleep and remind them of the benefits of great sleep reduces weight strengthens immune system increases mood increases performance leads us to better decision making quicker and more creative thinking is snoring temperature or reflux a problem when they are sleeping the answer to this question leads to a discussion of specialty products materials and accessories does pain affect your sleep when pain affects sleep it is usually in one of two ways acute pain or pain from injury this type of pain may require stabilization and memory foam near the surface will help chronic pain this type of pain may benefit from more nighttime movement and a material like latex can help a resting body when it’s moving you don’t have to add sleep expert to your title to be successful at selling mattresses but engaging your customer in a conversation about their sleep—and knowing how your product can benefit your customers’ sleep habits—is instrumental in keeping your customers happy and wellrested in short the more you know about customers’ specific sleep needs and expectations the more likely you are to sell products that will benefit and satisfy them and keep them coming back   january   tweet this article written by
