underlying funds fees and expenses are based on a weighted average of the fees and expenses of the underlying funds in which it invests the amount of fees and expenses of the underlying funds borne by

could lose money on an investment in the portfolio the value of your investment in the portfolio changes with the values of the underlying funds and their investments any of the following risks among others could affect the portfolio’s or an underlying fund’s performance or cause the portfolio or an underlying fund to lose money or to underperform market averages of other fundsasset allocation  assets will be allocated among underlying funds and markets based on judgments by the adviser or subadviser there is a risk that the portfolio may allocate assets to an underlying fund or asset class that underperforms other funds or asset classescall   during periods of falling interest rates a bond issuer may “call” or repay its highyielding bond before the bond’s maturity date if forced to invest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates an underlying fund would experience a decline in incomecommodities  the operations and financial performance of companies in natural resources industries may be directly affected by commodity prices this risk is exacerbated for those natural resources companies that own the underlying commoditycompany  the price of a given company’s stock could decline or underperform for many reasons including among others poor management financial problems or business challenges if a company declares bankruptcy or becomes insolvent its stocks could become worthlesscredit  prices of bonds and other debt securities can fall if the issuer’s actual or perceived financial health deteriorates whether because of broad economic or issuerspecific reasons in severe cases the issuer could be late in paying interest or principal or could fail to pay altogethercurrency  to the extent that an underlying fund invests directly in foreign currencies or in securities denominated in or that trade in foreign nonus currencies it is subject to the risk that those currencies will decline in value relative to the us dollar or in the case of hedging positions that the us dollar will decline in value relative to the currency being hedgedforeign investmentsdeveloping and emerging markets investing in foreign nonus securities may result in the underlying funds experiencing more rapid and extreme changes in value than a fund that invests exclusively in securities of us companies due to smaller markets differing reporting accounting and auditing standards and nationalization expropriation or confiscatory taxation foreign currency fluctuations currency blockage or political changes or diplomatic developments foreign investment risks typically are greater in developing and emerging markets than in developed marketshighyield securities  investments rated below investmentgrade or of similar quality if unrated are known as “highyield securities” or “junk bonds” highyield securities are subject to greater levels of credit and liquidity risks highyield securities are considered primarily speculative with respect to the issuer’s continuing ability to make principal and interest paymentsinterest rate  with bonds and other debt securities a rise in interest rates generally causes values to fall conversely values generally rise as interest rates fall the higher the credit quality of the security and the longer its maturity or duration the more sensitive it is likely to be to interest rate riskliquidity  if a security is illiquid an underlying fund might be unable to sell the security at a time when the underlying fund’s manager might wish to sell and the security could have the effect of decreasing the overall level of the underlying fund’s liquidity further the lack of an established secondary market may make it more difficult to value illiquid securities which could vary from the amount an underlying fund could realize upon disposition an underlying fund may make investments that become less liquid in response to market developments or adverse investor perception an underlying fund could lose money if it cannot sell a security at the time and price that would be most beneficial to the underlying fundmarket  stock prices are volatile and are affected by the real or perceived impacts of such factors as economic conditions and political events the stock market tends to be cyclical with periods when stock prices generally rise and periods when stock prices generally decline any given stock market segment may remain out of favor with investors for a short or long period of time and stocks as an asset class may underperform bonds or other asset classes during some periods from time to time the stock market may not favor the growth or valueoriented securities in which the underlying funds invest rather the market could favor securities to which the underlying funds are not exposed or may not favor equities at allmarket capitalization  stocks fall into three broad market capitalization categories  large mid and small investing primarily in one category carries the risk that due to current market conditions that category may be out of favor with investors if valuations of largecapitalization companies appear to be greatly out of proportion to the valuations of mid or smallcapitalization companies investors may migrate to the stocks of mid and smallsized companies causing the underlying funds that invest in these companies to increase in value more rapidly than a fund that invests in larger fullyvalued companies investing in mid and smallcapitalization companies may be subject to special risks associated with narrower product lines more limited financial resources smaller management groups and a more limited trading market for their stocks as compared with larger companies as a result stocks of mid and smallcapitalization companies may decline significantly in market downturnsother investment companies  the main risk of investing in other investment companies including exchangetraded funds is the risk that the value of the securities underlying an investment company might decrease because the portfolio or an underlying fund may invest in other investment companies you will pay a proportionate share of the expenses of that other investment company including management fees administration fees and custodial fees in addition to the expenses of the portfolio and a proportionate share of the expenses of each underlying fund proprietary hedge fund beta strategy  because the portfolio allocates assets to an underlying fund that seeks to deliver returns that approximate the beta component of the broad universe of hedge fund returns the portfolio’s performance may be lower than the returns of the broader stock marketreal estate companies and real estate investment trusts “reits”  investing in real estate companies and reits may subject an underlying fund to risks similar to those associated with the direct ownership of real estate including losses from casualty or condemnation changes in local and general economic conditions supply and demand interest rates zoning laws regulatory limitations on rents property taxes and operating expenses in addition to terrorist attacks war or other acts that destroy real propertyshort exposures  the portfolio may invest in an underlying fund that takes short exposure on market indices by investing in an instrument or derivative that rises in value with a fall in the related index if the price of the index rises while an underlying fund has a short exposure to it the underlying fund may have to cover its short exposure at a loss short exposures are subject to credit risks related to the counterparty’s ability to perform its obligations and further that any deterioration in the counterparty’s creditworthiness could adversely affect the value of the instrument or derivative the potential loss on a short exposure is unlimited because the loss increases as the price of the instrument sold short increases top voya strategic allocation growth
