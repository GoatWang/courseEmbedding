accounts sprite  4 call us location contact menu product liability description joshua silverman is a product liability lawyer who fights to obtain compensation for his clients after personal injuries from a defective product it is important in a product liability case that the faulty product equipment or machinery is preserved as it critical to proving the liability of the manufacturer or seller of the defective product product liability actions include defective automobiles workplace machinery household products and consumer goods view transcript a products liability case is a case involving somebody who was injured because of a product that they have either purchased or somebody else was using that caused them to sustain a very serious injury and that includes a defective automobile where for example the seat belts or the airbags dont work properly a medical device if you go into surgery and the medical device doesnt work properly or even thinking about cribs and toys and things that we presume are going to be safe for our children in a products liability case one of the most important things is that weve got to preserve the evidence from the beginning and thats why i always encourage people if they think theyve been injured by a defective product to call me promptly because if we dont have whatever it is that caused the injury were probably not going to be able to make a case weve got to prove that it was defective so i encourage people to bring them in to me or ill go out to them to secure the evidence and in many cases well rent a storage unit to secure it when youre selecting a products liability lawyer the critical question is how long have you been handling products liability have you handled cases similar to mine in my practice ive been dealing with products liability cases since day one and weve handled cases involving defective automobiles defective baby products defective medical devices but weve run the gamut on the types of products that have caused very serious injuries to our client if you would like more information what i would encourage you to do is to give me a call and ill be happy to discuss with you your situation at no fee or from the website you can click your questions to me and ill get back in touch with you promptly silverman law firm lc  about attorney joshua d silverman  nursing home and assisted living facility
