enters into a license agreement with btemia the developer of the keeogo commentary on executives perspectives max schederbieschin cfo ekso bionics posted on february   by bobby marinov in business   comments tweet csuite tv with jeffery hayzlett has published an interview with ekso bionics cfo max schederbieschin  in the interview max schederbieschin focuses on the current and future medical exoskeleton offerings by ekso bionics  however his thoughts and opinions have many overarching ideas that can be applied to all medical exoskeletons as well as the entire exoskeleton industry according to its website the csuite network is an information resources and relationship private online community reserved exclusively for business executives with vp level careers and above  the full interview between jeffery hayzlett and max schederbieschin was filmed at the csuite conference in san francisco and can be found on csuitetvcom httpwwwcsuitetvcomvideoexecutiveperspectivesmaxschederbieschineksobionics whether due to editing or perhaps that is just how max speaks there are various interesting thoughts are covered in just a few sentences and deserve some elaboration exoskeletons will fit under the clothing vintage nokia mobira talkman via ebaycom in the interview max reflects how within five years exoskeletons will shrink to the point that they can fit underneath clothing  we have already seen this with the ski mojo and the most recently released pictures of the superflex suit  overall exoskeletons are becoming smaller and more streamlined  many thought leaders within the industry now equate the shape of current exoskeletons to those of cell phones from the s and s some of which were so large that they even came with a carryon box in addition to the handle the analogy to cell phones is a double edged sword one  on one hand it is exciting that business and technology experts see plenty of potential for improvement  on the other hand it demonstrates how much the exoskeleton industry is still in its infancy  it took many decades for cell phone technology to become accessible to the average consumer the cell phone analogy doesn’t have to be used just for the size of current exoskeletons  cellular technology is now bundled together with music and video playback digital photography and text editing  the same could be happening to exoskeleton devices  some medical exoskeletons have already been bundled with data logging wireless communication cloud integration haptic feedback fes integration virtual reality mobility testing and emg sensors  we can only guess what other technologies can become integrated with wearable robotics in the future safe from falls vs safe to fall with in the interview max talks briefly how home use exoskeletons are not safe enough  what he is eluding to is that after fda approvals and insurance coverage are implemented there will be hundreds of thousands of walking assist exoskeletons  once you are dealing with such large numbers it is impossible to imagine that people will not start falling down while using their wearables  therefore it is necessary to make the exoskeleton devices safe safer for users to fall down with  as it stands the current ekso gt and many of its counterparts are heavy bulky rigid metal wearable robots and falling down with one sounds potentially dangerous  how is ekso bionics addressing this  we have a partial picture thanks to the work of our contributors timothy retter exoskeleton safety on ekso bionics research and marcus pyles building in reflexes and closedloop communication into exoskeleton design return on investment exoskeleton technology has the potential to benefit many so it always seems cold hearted to talk about return on investment roi  the reality is however that most of the exoskeleton companies are entirely privately funded and therefore are accountable to their investors  in the interview max emphasizes the importance of having a clear view of the roi and providing a clear solution to targeted markets  this is a big departure from a decade ago where many thought that once the exoskeletons are made they will naturally find market applications where they fit max sees the rehabilitation devices as a stepping stone towards the much larger home market but the return on investment isn’t there yet  to be clear ekso bionics and medical device developers are not trying to rip off hospitals and people that can benefit from this technology  instead they are trying to create a product that is so good that it has high enough roi so it can be purchased with profit margin left for the manufacturer the business connection csuite tv is a resource center for discussions from business leaders  but if you want to directly connect with vps from dozens of exoskeleton companies from around the world don’t forget to register for the wearracon  wearracon will be this april in phoenix and is the

   close  x max schederbieschin name max schederbieschin title chief financial officer company ekso bionics ekso ekso is a worldwide pioneer in the field of robotic exoskeletons this means we wrap robots around humans to enhance human strength endurance and mobility whether ablebodied or a person with physical disabilities we are particularly well known for our ekso gt which allows those who have suffered a stroke or spinal cord injury to rehabilitate earlier and more effectively than they could under todays standard of care birthplace i was born in new york i moved to california when i studied at stanford and although i live here now i love to travel whenever possible education ba – economics stanford university i also attended new york university and stanford universitys executive program i was in banking for most of my career but was traveling a lot and missed out on many family opportunities i left the banking industry and promised myself that in my next career i would choose to do business with really smart people who have an impact on future generations first i built and sold barefoot motors which designed and manufactured electric allterrain vehicles and then i met ekso which has really helped to put that vision into practice when i left banking my gift to my wife on her milestone birthday was to take a year off and travel the world with our kids we have always been passionate about the environment so we wanted to experience the great wonders of the world as a family we spent  months in new zealand and  months in australia where we got to see firsthand the impact of global warming on a glacier my son who was  at the time asked me why my generation was ruining the world for his generation it was a wake up call for me to do something meaningful and impactful business briefing whats the background to the business a friend of the founders first introduced me to ekso in  i had just sold my previous business barefoot motors but i wasnt ready to retire i worked initially as a consultant but was so inspired by the technology that i transitioned to full time cfo in  as soon as i saw a spinal chord injured person stand up with the help of the ekso skeleton i turned to the founders and said im in we developed a business plan and i helped to arrange the first round of funding the  founders are all technologists  professor kazarooni and  of his students russ angold and nate harding at the time they were all members of the berkeley robotics and human engineering laboratory at the university of california the technology was developed initially to assist soldiers with carrying heavy loads not for treating stroke or spinal cord injured patients during their research they had a revolutionary breakthrough which allowed them to carry a weight of lbs using  watts of power instead of the traditional  watts in addition russs brother was a navy seal and had suffered a spinal chord injury thankfully since recovered and they noticed similarities between their technology and how they could assist people with a spinal injury right now we sell to hospitals with the goal of rehabilitating people who have sustained some sort of lower limb paralysis the product is not yet available for home use business goal for the next  months we have had  very exciting developments in the past year first we made the transition from a founderled business to hiring an experienced ceo tom looby second we received fda approval to treat individuals with hemiplegia due to stroke  of gait therapy is stroke related individuals with spinal cord injuries at levels t to l and individuals with spinal cord injuries at levels of t to c this is a major breakthrough for the company and we look forward to building our clinical evidence further by collaborating with a rehabilitation center on a clinical trial called wise that is designed to prove the functional benefits of exoskeletons for spinal cord injury patients third we did a financing and uplisted to nasdaq ekso going forward we want to take our product from enthusiastic buyin among key opinion leaders to a recognized standard of care in the larger market we also want our next generation product to be focused on the home market in addition we have received inquiries about helping construction workers carry heavy loads these are exciting times advice you wish you had received i dont have very many regrets people like to believe they could have done something sooner better faster  but thats always going to be the case at ekso we talk a lot about experience being like steps we take like taking steps with our product –we want to explore and learn new things everybody who is learning to walk will fall and thats ok its a learning experience we have to get up and take the next step at ekso bionics we dont want to make too many mistakes but we also realize that we are going to make them best business decision my best decision was to take a year off after  years in investment banking it helped me to take a step back and reassess what was important to me it was a risk  i didnt know if my family wanted me    but i felt i had missed out on some early exciting times with our kids so it gave me real time to reconnect toughest business decision it was probably here at ekso in  we were running out of money but we strongly believed in what we were doing we had to figure out how to extend our runway and the question became how to go about restructuring we had great people we didnt want to lose so we had to furlough up to  of our workforce everyone who stayed had to take a  haircut every employee accepted the terms and when we raised our next round of funding many of the furloughed employees came back full time person most admired there are so many people you can learn from – its not just about what one person did i admire people making an impact on future generations thinking beyond themselves and selflessly for the greater good like most about job i love the impact we have on people and how we can change their lives for the better like least about job there is not one thing in particular i dislike but sometimes i dont feel were doing as good a job as we could be when explaining some of the decisions were making as a public company this can lead to some frustration with investors for the most part having investors has encouraged the company to be more transparent to have a sense of urgency and to seek out best practices we believe we are making the best decisions for the longterm health of company but some people have short time views and will create difficulties for us dream job i love what i do but if i werent doing this id probably be skiing in montana behind the suit favorite book moby dick by herman melville it is a story about obsession revenge adversity and the ocean favorite movie remember the titans starring denzel washington its the true story of an africanamerican coach and his high school team on their first season as a racially integrated unit and really emphasizes the importance of diversity outside of work im passionate about the outdoors i particularly enjoy skiing sailing and triathlons i have done many triathlons with team in training which raises money for the leukemia  lymphoma society when i was training for an ironman a long race that features a mile swim a mile bike ride and a mile run my year old daughter decided that she wanted to train with me she roped in  of her friends and we all trained together she loved it and actually went on to compete internationally she was ranked rd in the us and placed th in the  world triathlon championships in budapest hungary community we encourage awareness of health we are very active with the mark pollock trust whose mission it is to find a cure for paralysis mark suffered a spinal chord injury that left him paralyzed and he is also blind he has not let his disabilities limit him and has competed in ultra endurance races across deserts mountains and the polar ice caps we sponsor all employees to participate in the run in the dark a multilocation night run and have fielded teams at the ragnar relay series – a long distance running
