credit save save share former sony president phil molyneux joins williams wearable startup devindra hardawar devindra  comments  shares share tweet share save phil molyneux the man who led sony into the k era as its chief operating officer and president is making a surprising move for his next gig hes now williams righthand man for iam the musicians wearable technology startup molyneux joined the company as its president and coo a few weeks ago where hes basically tasked with making williams dreamy vision of computing come true the first example of that is the  puls wristband a bulky gequipped wearable that the company believes can replace your phone aside from the star power behind it there wasnt much about the puls that seemed compelling when it was announced last fall but molyneuxs participation has us thinking that williams crazy wearable idea might actually have legs think about it youll no longer need to carry around a huge chunk of glass molyneux told us in an interview a mobile phone is not really mobile in its purist sense but of course with the puls youll be swapping the glass slab in your pocket for a chunky wristband thats on display all day molyneux got to know william several years ago and the two kept in touch when he moved on from sony he was particularly intrigued by the musicians take the combination of fashion and technology something molyneux calls fashionology thats something were hearing more from other wearable companies without the silly branding  its not enough just to have a practical wearable it has to be something with style that people want to wear molyneux describes himself as a practical guy with plenty of experience scaling consumer electronics businesses globally basically hes exactly what william needed to build his wearable outfit while he admits that theres still work to be done with the puls  the company needs to offer more sizing options and further optimize the devices battery  molyneux was proud that puls managed to pass atts rigorous lab approval processthe magnitude of that achievement really underlines how far the team has come  its a tacit acknowledgement of how to build a product of this complexity he saidiam still has plenty to prove while the puls is already shipping to some buyers its broader release is coming in a year where were seeing refined wearables like the apple watch and jawbones up  fitness band williams company may be thinking hard about fashion but right now the puls seems more like a scifi shackle than something truly stylish its also not the only company pursuing a standalone computer for your wrist we saw something very similar from neptune a few weeks ago molyneux hinted that there will be some intriguing announcements coming from the company soon in particular he says theyll address the pulss battery life concerns a wristband cant really replace your phone if it doesnt last all day after allwe have lots of creative ideas on the table to define where we go next what do we do next molyneux said given my background and knowledge of the consumer electronics industry i know that focus is the key were a small startup we need to put our energy into a couple of core

challenge i saw an ad for a position with the computer and components division of sony electronics outside london in staines building this new business from scratch was an exciting startup opportunity with just a handful of employees we did everything from sales to imports our first product was sony’s compact disc drive which was then the size of a shoe box and came with no content applications or driver softwareover the next decade and after several new product developments we expanded sony’s component business to include many other computer peripherals semiconductors and eventually component solutions for mobile telephones the business expanded across europe giving me the opportunity to work in many different countries travel became my middle namemy wife debbie and i moved with our two sons who were then toddlers to budapest as i took up the reins as managing director of sony central and southeast europe my eldest son max came to visit regularly from london our time in hungary was both exciting and challenging being responsible for  countries across eastern europe was a fascinating experience and my adaptability came in handy as i tackled the uniqueness of each culturein  the sony corporation’s then chief executive sir howard stringer — a great mentor — asked me if i wanted to move to san diego to lead the company’s united states electronics business that sounded pretty good after the long winters in hungary and it was also a great opportunity i was able to apply the brandbuilding experience i gained in europe to a much bigger marketi am often asked why i never left

los angeles — iam the wearables manufacturer helmed by musician william brought on former sony exec phil molyneux as president and coo molyneux officially stepped into the role about a month ago he told twice during a phone interview last week to discus what how he started his new venture and what’s planned going forward twice so what have you been up to since sony molyneux i took on some consulting roles with various companies and i enjoyed that there was a very diverse collection of companies i was working with board roles etc i suddenly became extremely busy from that venture but then of course this great opportunity came up this really really pulled me in and got me very excited so this was one i really had to commit to twice how did you and william get acquainted what’s the story behind that molyneux i met will in  at the clinton global initiative in new york will and i were introduced by our mutual friend and we started to talk about all things technology and trends and where we saw the market going and what we thought were the key players i quickly inferred that will had this very significant understanding of the consumer electronics and the tech world amongst all the other great things that he’s highly capable of doing we kept in contact and will started to share with me his thoughts on what he wanted to build and where he was going with his technology venture fastforward a bit more and i was lucky enough to be able to have an early puls and i was blown away with what he had managed to bring to life as a startup and as a small company the puls being the first telephone in reality that is on your wrist in a smart band was highly highly significant to me not only is it a smart band that’s very elegantly and beautifully designed fusing technology together with fashion — we call that fashionology around here and that’s a beautiful term for what needs to happen to wearables and will had cracked it — but more than that they’ve taken opensource android and built out the unique operating system they put in a virtual assistant that’s bordering on artificial intelligence they built a whole back end of plumbing to deliver content and rich experiences to the puls for consumers so when i looked at all of those things together frankly i was hooked and it came to the point where will said “i need somewhere there who has the capability of building the team out building the strategy out to the next level someone who has the capability to scale for not only the us and the uk basis but on a global basis as we go forward” so fastforward just a few weeks later and here i was i’m just into my fourth week this week and i’m enjoying every second of it twice do you have an update on the puls molyneux we had a controlled launch of the puls and the controlled launch was to selected individuals who we called fashionologists who really wanted to try it the controlled launch was built around something called the “make it great” campaign it was a very smart initiative this was way of getting the first product down into people’s hands or more importantly on people’s wrists so they could give us rich feedback on what they enjoyed for the device what experiences it delivered what areas would need to be improved and what we need to add to the product they purchased it full price from an online platform and we’ve had immensely rich feedback that we’ve been able to filter through and will apply to future iterations of where we go as we build out new products and experiences i see that as really strategically important because the big guys out there can’t have this level of connection with their customer base they just can’t do it and i know that i sit from a position of authority both to be able to talk to individuals who have experienced and use this and love this device the freedom that it gives people is quite something twice how do you think your experience at sony will play out in your new position molyneux i’ve run very very large operations at sony i’ve run smaller operations over time going back in history at sony but i’ve always somewhere in the larger operations had what i called a skunkworks where i could concentrate on innovation with a small group of people who are able to freethink in order to come up with new innovations that we’ve taken to market more recently one i led the sony k ultra high definition ecosystem development and that was really about how do we create a download service with k content through a media server for our k tvs … and i worked on that with less than  people engineers marketers people from sony pictures etc in order to bring that live in a very short window of time all done primarily in the us so i have the experience of guiding small teams to success from product creation ideas right the way through gotomarket i can apply those principles and learnings and experience to iam and the work we’ve got on the table here if you couple that together with my global experience and global manufacturing through to mass market and through to global distribution that’s going to come into play somewhere down the line in the nottoodistant future twice how large is iam molyneux today we have  people the headquarters are in la which is where i am we have a team of hardware engineers in singapore we have the core head of software development operating systems platforms and applications in la we have an extension of resources in bangalore in india  i just brought in a cfo ro peschken just last week which i think is a very important step in order to bring another level of control what startups always need is more control as well as a highly credible supplychain specialist because we’re in an industry with great partners like att and telefonica in the uk these large companies that when we go to market we’re talking about potential millions of units that we’ve got to put into the supply chain the supply chain becomes one of the core components that we need to put our hands around early so we can feed demand effective and tidily so we’re adding new resources as we speak but with a measured focus perspective on what we can do at this stage twice smart watches and wearables are getting to be a pretty crowded market does the company plan to diversify beyond this category how do they plan to stand out from the competition if you look at the puls itself it’s truly merging tech and fashion a very unique compelling design that fits on the wrist no  it has its own operating system something we heard back from the “make it great” campaign anita the virtual assistant is really appreciated by customers and really better than anything else on the market our device is a standalone telecommunication device my experience is this really quite liberating because you put the puls on your wrist just this morning i left my phone at home and thought to myself “should i turn around and pick my phone up” and i thought “well i don’t need to because everyone can call me or i can call them from my puls” and i text and i can read email and if i have time to post to social media today i can do that as well … of course this is aimed at the user who wants to be free who doesn’t want to go to a nightclub or go out for the weekend with a large piece of glass in their pocket or purse just to have it on the wrist and have your hands free to do whatever you want with that’s true mobility twice can you give a hint if future products will be in wearables space or something completely different molyneux committed direction is wearables space but very importantly from a different perspective just remember fashionology anything you wear whether it’s technology or clothes should have fashion embedded into dna twice what’s your perspective on the overall wearables marketplace is everyone on hold to see how the apple watch shakes out molyneux it is a crowded market i think there will be some shakeout there will be a need for some differentiation  i think apple coming into their fray with their smart watch i think will help all boats rise as they come in but it tethers at the end of the day to the iphone it’s not standalone it hasn’t got a radio in it you can’t make calls without your mobile phone being tethered to it but i think that will be a positive they will widen the market appeal we know our demographic we know where we’re shooting for initially so we’re clear on our targets so i welcome apple it will stimulate the whole market twice can you provide any insight on the company’s retail and distribution strategies going forward molyneux we’re fortunate enough to already have great partnerships with att in the us the puls itself went through validation and certification process through att and that is really significant att has a very rigorous and robust approval process we now have our product approved that’s why we can launch this controlled launch with the support of att and more importantly we now have tactic knowledge with how to work with att in the future we have telefonica in the uk and that’s certainly something to build on in the future and part of my role is looking at the global rollout and where do we go next and why do we go next i’m in the midst of building that strategy as part of our overall strategy it’s a big world out there and we’re fortunate to have fantastic initial investors that are very well connected and very credible businesspeople and strategic in the point they can help connect us up wherever we need connected up in order to roll into other countries want
