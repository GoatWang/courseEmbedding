chicago  — constellation brands beer division announced today a voluntary recall of select corona extra packs and packs of  ounce clear bottles with deposit labels in the us and guam that may contain small particles of glass this recall is very limited in scope as potentially affected bottles represent less than onetenth of one percent of corona extra ounce clear bottles in the marketplace production codes for the potentially impacted bottles are listed below this recall comes after routine quality assurance inspections at two ab inbev breweries that produce some of constellation brands’ beer products on an interim basis while the number of impacted bottles is relatively small constellation is recalling select packages of corona extra that may contain defective bottles as a precaution to ensure the safety of consumers to date the company has received no consumer complaints or reports of injuries resulting from the affected bottles “the safety and wellbeing of consumers is our top priority and we take matters pertaining to the quality of our products very seriously” said paul hetterich president constellation brands beer division “since learning of this issue we immediately began working with ab inbev and jointly took prompt action to investigate the issue we’re actively working with our distributor partners and retailers to quickly resolve the matter we’re committed to doing everything possible to complete this recall quickly and ensure the safety of our consumers and integrity of our products” all recalled products are being removed from the market the company encourages consumers who have packages and bottles marked with the production codes below to visit httpwwwcoronaextrausacomrecall or call   for instructions on reimbursement the vast majority of corona extra products including those listed below are not part of this recall unaffected corona extra packs note most packs are unaffected corona extra pack and pack bottles corona extra cans
