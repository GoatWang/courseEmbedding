asset allocation plan targeted to meet your individualized return objectives and risk parameters   andina capital management specializes in providing clients with an institutional quality investment analysis so they can better plan and prepare for their future  after analyzing and understanding each client’s investment objectives and holdings we develop a customized investment strategy that is based on capital preservation transparency ongoing portfolio monitoring risk management and delivering riskadjusted absolute returns andina assists clients to structure portfolios for longterm consistency by analyzing an array of performance attributes  we utilize proprietary software called performex® that uses an array of performance attributes to evaluate riskreturn tradeoffs and then optimally combines the portfolio’s components to help reduce overall exposure to market risk our asset allocation framework combines asset class selection timing qualifying manager identification and individual security selection topdown and bottomup  our opportunistic multiasset class portfolios aim to capture value across less efficient or dislocated financial markets   in current market environments it is more important than ever to have a proven strategy in place for all market conditions  this includes having your offense and defense on the field at the same time  we believe investors must have a well thought out plan that protects assets in declining markets but allows them to still participate in rising markets  our approach is focused on maintaining and building wealth for our clients   through years of extensive research due diligence and statistical analysis andina and its partners have uncovered an array of bestinclass money managers who perform well at different times in different market conditions and are complementary to each other  the selected managers ultimately have very different risk and return profiles  by statistically combining them clients of andina typically have much lower volatility than the general market and in most cases much better longterm asset compounding  results   our key objective is to preserve and prudently compound client portfolios through timely opportunistic and comprehensive global asset allocation over a full market cycle like all investments an investment in any andina product or strategy involves the risk of loss and such an investment is not suitable for all investors  potential investors should carefully consider the investment objectives and the risk and expenses of a potential investment in andina before making such investment  in addition potential investors are strongly advised to consult with their own independent advisor regarding a potential investment with andina  past andina results are not necessarily indicative of future results  an investment with andina is speculative and any person subscribing for an investment must be able to bear the risks set forth in andina’s offering
