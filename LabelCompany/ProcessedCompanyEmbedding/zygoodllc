stimulation for the treatment of pain” ser no  filed with the uspto on jun  field of usethis invention is in the field of methods and devices to be used by human subjects to decrease or eliminate pain without the use of ingested or injected drugs or implanted medical devicesbackground of the inventionit is well known that there are literally millions of patients throughout the world who suffer pain in various parts of their bodies three of the most frequent sites for pain are  foot pain caused by chemotherapy or diabetic neuropathy  shoulder pain often resulting from a tear or inflammation of the rotator cuff and  lower back pain caused by a large variety of medical problems particularly associated with the spine and the nerves surrounding the vertebrae although there are many pain medications to reduce the level of pain experienced by such patients these drugs often are not sufficiently palliative and they typically can cause serious side effectsone early invention to utilize magnetic fields to treat pain is described by robert r holcomb in international publication number wo  the invention described in that document consists of four magnetic coils that are placed in the back of a chair or under a table where the patients back would be exposed to the magnetic field a dc current is placed through the four coils which results in an unchanging magnetic field to be experienced by the patientin us pat no  robert e fischell et al describe a device to be placed on the head which can eliminate or reduce the pain of migraine headaches by the application of an intense magnetic pulse this device was approved by the us fda on may   and is currently in use to treat patients with migraine headaches the fischell et al device operates by charging capacitors to a high voltage and then discharging them into a magnetic coil to create a magnetic pulse as high as one tesla in intensity by faradays law this changing magnetic pulse creates an electrical pulse within the brain that has been shown to eliminate migraine headaches because it takes about  seconds to charge the condensers from a battery within this transcranial magnetic stimulation tms device the rate of applying magnetic pulses to the brain is extremely slow i e only one pulse in about  seconds even at that the time rate of change of the magnetic field within the brain results in an electrical current in the neurons of the brain which eliminates most migraine headaches however the application of more pulses per unit time could result in a more effective treatment for the relief of pain from other parts of the human body such as the feet the shoulders or the backan existing system that is currently available to treat lower back pain is called tens which is an acronym for transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator this device has two adhesive covered electrodes that are pasted onto the skin along the lower back the device can then be turned on and adjusted so that the pain in the skin is acceptable while some electrical pulses enter the body in the vicinity of the spine where they can provide some relief for lower back pain however it would be highly advantageous to use a system that could introduce higher intensity electrical pulses into that region without causing any skin pain that can be accomplished with transcutaneous magnetic stimulation or tcms as described hereinsummary of the inventionthe present invention is a means and method to apply transcutaneous magnetic stimulation tcms to relieve pain in a human subject without the use of an analgesic drug the tcms system consists of a computercontrolled electrical pulse generator that would typically be plugged into a wall electrical socket and would provide repeated magnetic pulses through the skin at a site where a patient was experiencing pain the magnetic pulses would be created by means of a pulse of electric current through a magnetic coil that has been placed in close proximity to the patients skin at that location where the patient is experiencing painfor different locations on the patients body the magnetic coil would have a different shape for example for the treatment of lower back pain a racetrack shaped coil could be placed at that region of the lower back typically the lumbar or sacral region where the pain is felt by the patient the racetrack shaped coil could be attached to and placed within a specially designed belt that would place that coil in close proximity to the skin on the lower back with the buckle for the belt being located at the abdomen as is typical for belts used with male trousers it should also be understood that pressure or inflammation of a nerve in the back can also result in pain in the buttocks and into the leg and feet thus a device located on the lower back to apply tcms in that region could also be used to reduce or even eliminate referred pain in regions of the body below the location of that nerve in the back that causes the pain in the extremitiesanother application of the present invention is a magnetic coil that is placed around the shoulder for the treatment of rotator cuff pain or any other source of shoulder pain the unique shape for the shoulder magnetic coil would ideally be in the form of two separate coils one on each side of the shoulder the coil portion on each side of shoulder would cause magnetic fields that are in the same direction so as to enhance the magnetic field acting upon the tissue in the shoulder this type of coil could also be used to wrap around the neck or the knee or any other generally cylindrical portion of a human body to reduce pain in that part of the bodystill another application of the present invention is a coil to be used for the treatment of foot andor ankle pain this type of coil could be extended around the ankle to reduce pain in both the foot and the ankle this unique design for a magnetic coil would be particularly advantageous for those patients who suffer foot and ankle pain resulting from chemotherapy or from diabetic neuropathystill another application of the present invention is a flat circular coil with an adhesive placed onto one surface so that it could be removably attached to the patients skin at any location on a human bodyit should be understood that the electrical pulse generator would typically get its power by being plugged into a wall electrical socket however the use of a primary or rechargeable battery for the electrical pulse generator is certainly possible still further the design described herein could obtain its electrical power from a cigar lighter electrical receptacle as located in an automobile or a truckthe waveform for treatment would be a magnetic pulse with a rise time between  and  microseconds a pulse length of approximately  microseconds would be ideal for this purpose the stimulation pulse rate would optimally be at a rate between  hz and  hz with an optimum frequency being approximately  to  hz it is also conceived that the wave form could be approximately half of one sine wave or a square wave to optimize the relief of pain the peak amplitude for the magnetic pulses at the patients skin should be at least  tesla with an optimum magnetic pulse strength at the skin being between  and  teslait should also be understood that the present invention could be used for the relief of pain that extends through a major or limited portion of a human body such as the pain of fibromyalgia spinal stenosis arthritis pinched or otherwise damaged nerves vascular inflammation diabetic neuropathy pain caused by chemotherapy or any other source of pain in a human bodythus one object of the present invention is to provide a means and method to treat pain of a human patient by the application of high intensity magnetic pulsations through the patients skin at a location where those magnetic pulsations create subcutaneous electrical currents that result in a decrease of the patients level of painanother object of this invention is to optimize the size and shape of the magnetic coil to best fit at that specific location on the patients body where the pain is to be treatedstill another object of this invention is to have two magnetic coils on each side of a body part with each of the two coils enhancing the magnetic field to which that body part is exposedstill another object of this invention is a method to diminish the pain caused by diabetic neuropathystill another object of this invention is a method to diminish the pain caused by chemotherapystill another object of this invention is a method to diminish the pain caused by pressure or inflammation on the nerves in the back in the vicinity of the spine the pain being observed in the back or below that region into the buttocks legs and feetstill another object of this invention is the use of a racetrack shaped coil to be within a covering that has belt loops that can be attached around the patients abdomen by means of a typical belt the belt being selected to have a length ideally suited for the girth of a particular patientstill another object of this invention is to have an electrical current pulse generator designed to be used with a variety of shapes and sizes of magnetic coils to provide the electrical current pulses that generate the desired magnetic pulses when attached to any one of a number of different designs for magnetic coils some of which designs are described in detail hereinstill another object of this invention is to have an electrical current pulse generator that indicates to the operator of the generator whether it is a medical practitioner or the patient himselfherself as to several attributes of the treatment about to be obtained with that electrical current pulse generatorthese and other objects and advantages of this invention will become obvious to a person of ordinary skill in this art upon reading the detailed description of this invention including the associated drawings as presented hereinbrief description of the drawingsfig  illustrates a magnetic coil placed around the foot and ankle of a patient for the treatment of foot andor ankle pain the

coilfig  is a side view of a device that has two tcms coils for the treatment of shoulder painfig  is a front view of the tcms coil system shown in fig fig  is a layout view of the two tcms coils shown in figs  and  and also shows the attachment of the coils to an electrical pulse generatorfig  illustrates six different cross sections for the magnetic coil wire that can be used for the tcms coils that are shown in figs  through  inclusivefig  is the layout of the front panel of an advanced electrical current pulse generator that can be used with any of the magnetic coils as described hereindetailed description of the inventionfig  illustrates a transcutaneous magnetic stimulator tcms magnetic coil system  connected to an electrical pulse generator system  for the treatment of foot pain the electrical pulse generator system  receives its electrical power from the wire  that is connected to the plug  that would be placed into a conventional electrical socket not shown the electrical pulse generator system  is similar in design and function to the magstim  device that is manufactured by the magstim company in wales uk and sold in the usa by jali medical incalthough the optimum electrical pulse generator system  would get its power as shown in fig  it is conceived that the electrical pulse generator  could get its power from a primary or a rechargeable battery the dials  and  on the face of the electrical pulse generator  would be used to adjust the pulse frequency and pulse amplitude for the electrical current pulses created by the electrical pulse generator system  to create the magnetic pulses that would be delivered by the magnetic coil system  these electrical current pulses would be delivered to the magnetic coil system  by means of the wires a and b as shown in fig  electrical pulses with a pulse amplitude as high as  amperes could be generated by pulse generator  the lowest pulse amplitude would be at least  amperes to obtain the desired intensity for the magnetic pulses to be delivered by the magnetic coil system the electrical pulse generator system  would include conventional circuitry to generate a pulse waveform a sinusoidal wave form a square wave waveform or any other wave form that is found to be effective for stimulation of nerves the frequency of the pulses could be anything between  hz and  hz with an optimum pulse rate being approximately  to  hz the pulse amplitude generated by the magnetic coil  could be anything between  tesla and  tesla with an optimum magnetic pulse peak intensity being between approximately  and  tesla when pulses are used for tcms the pulse rise time could be between  and  microseconds with an optimum pulse rise time being approximately ± microsecondsfig  is a cross section of the magnetic coil system  mounted onto the foot and ankle of a patient who suffers from foot pain this foot pain would typically be caused by chemotherapy or would be a result of diabetic neuropathy the inner lining  of the magnetic coil system  would be situated closely around the patients foot and ankle surrounding the inner lining  would be a soft elastic type of material  that is contained within the inner lining  and the outer covering  it should be noted that as shown in fig  the inner lining  and outer covering  could in fact be formed from one piece of material such as leather or a plastic material the porous material  could be formed from a material such as cotton or foam rubber or any other material that would make it moderately easy for the patient to place hisher foot within the magnetic coil system  it is also conceived to have the patient wear a tight fitting and somewhat slippery sock when placing hisher foot into the magnetic coil system  that would be especially needed if the same magnetic coil system  is made available in a commercial medical facility for many different patientsfig  also shows the cross section of square wire magnetic coil  that is wrapped around the outer covering  a total of ½ turns of the magnetic coil  are shown in fig  any number of turns between  and  could be used for such a magnetic coil  with an optimum number of turns being approximately ± turns it should also be understood that the wire of the coil  would be insulated on its exterior and would have a cross section that could be of any type as shown in fig surrounding the magnetic coil  would be a coil covering member  that could be formed from a plastic material or from certain cloth materials it should also be understood that the wires  could be adhesively attached to the outer layer  or there could be a plastic fill material situated between each turn of the wires of the magnetic coil  fig  also shows the wires a and b which are attached to the electrical pulse generator  as shown in fig the present invention conceives of the magnetic coil system  being made available to the patient in at least three different shoe sizes with as many as  different shoe sizes being envisaged as being possible for this productfigs   and  illustrate a tcms magnetic coil system  that is designed to eliminate or at least decrease lower back pain for patients who suffer from that all too common afflictionfig  shows the electrical pulse generator system  that has an electrical pulse generator  attached by the wires a and b to the magnetic coil  that is attached to the belt  as can be seen in figs  and  the magnetic coil  is in the general shape of a racetrack with multiple turns of a conducting wire that has a square cross section two layers of the coil  are shown in fig  but anywhere from one to five layers of wires could be used to accommodate approximately ± turns of wire the wire cross section could be of any type as illustrated in fig an important aspect of the present invention is the design of the back of the magnetic coil system  as shown in figs  and  the outer belt cover  has a generally elliptical shape as it covers the magnetic coil  and it also has a filler material  as seen in fig  having the consistency of foam rubber or an equivalent spongy materialfig  shows the front of the patients body showing the belt  that has a conventional width that is secured around the patients body with a conventional buckle it should be understood that the design of the tcms system  to treat lower back pain allows the system  to be applied while a patient is working at hisher desk or even if the patient is lying in bed thus the pain relief can be applied at most times when it would be truly convenient for such a patient to utilize such a devicefigs   and  illustrate a type of magnetic coil system  that can be used to treat shoulder pain such as that caused by an inflammation of the rotator cuff in that patients shoulderfig  is a side view of the magnetic coil system  that has a front coil system  a rear coil system  each of which coil system includes a magnetic coil covered by some cloth or plastic material the magnetic coil system  also includes a flexible connecting member  and a velcro attachment tab  fig  shows a front view of the magnetic coil system  having front coil  into which is shown the outer outline  of the magnetic coil  a flexible connecting member  and the velcro attachment tab  placing this magnetic coil system  onto the shoulder would be accomplished by putting the front coil  on hisher shoulder in front with the rear coil  in back with the flexible connecting member  being placed on top of the shoulder the velcro attachment tab  would then be brought around from the rear coil  under the armpit and then it would be attached to the velcro surface  as shown in fig  for securely holding the magnetic coil system  onto the patients shoulderfig  is a layout view of the magnetic coil system  as used for decreasing pain at a patients shoulder shown in fig  is the front coil  the rear coil  the flexible connecting member  and the velcro attachment tab  that is designed to be placed through a patients armpit for attachment to the velcro attachment surface  that is placed on the outer surface of the front coil  also shown in fig  is the inner outline  and the outer outline  of the magnetic coil  a similar magnetic coil not shown would be placed in the front coil  these two magnetic coils would be similar to those shown in fig  and they would be placed within a cloth or plastic coverfig  also shows the wires a and b that connect the magnetic coil system  to the electrical pulse generator  the electrical pulse generator system  includes the electrical pulse generator  having electric current pulse amplitude and frequency control knobs  and  and a wire  having a plug  that connects into a conventional wall socket not shownfig  illustrates the cross section of various wires that could be used for the magnetic coils in any of the designs as described herein wire a is a typical square wire that could have a dimension of anything from × inch to × inch wire b could have the same outer dimensions as wire a but would have a wall thickness between  inch and  inch wire c is a typical round cross section wire that could be any size from  awg to  awg wire d is a hollow wire whose outer cross section is circular the wall thickness range for wire d is the same as for wire b wire e has a rectangular cross section with a width between  inch to  inch and a height that could lie between  inch and  inch wire f would have the same external dimensions as wire e with a wall thickness similar to wire b not shown in fig  is the insulation that would always be placed on the exterior surface of any such wireit should be understood that any of the hollow wires shown in fig  could be used to have either gas or a liquid flow through such a wire in order to either heat or cool the magnetic coil some patients may be more comfortable with a magnetic coil that would cool the body part feeling pain and some patients may feel less pain if heating was used to warm the magnetic coil to improve the patients comforta useful and novel attribute of the system shown in fig  is that it could be readily adapted for placement around any essentially cylindrical type of surface of a human body in that case the dimensions of the front coil  and the rear coil  would be such as to exactly go around such a cylindrical surface for example the system shown in fig  could be used to wrap the electrical pulse generator system  around a knee for knee pain the neck for neck pain around any arm or leg for treatment of pain in those regions or any other generally cylindrical surfaces of a human body the present invention envisages that the outer shape of the front coil  and the rear coil  could be made to be square or round or any other shape that would be ideal for placement around any part of a human bodyalthough the electrical pulse generator system  as described herein is always shown to have knobs  and  to adjust the intensity and frequency of the electrical current pulses emanating from that device it should be understood that it could also have fixed values of frequency and pulse amplitude so that adjustment knobs would not be needed it should also be understood that the magnetic pulse generator  could have an electrical switch to turn it to on or off or it could turn on automatically when plugged into a wall socketa patient who has significant pain in at least one of the regions described herein may very well wish to transport his tcms system from home to work and back or to take each system on travel to that end it is envisaged that each of the magnetic coil systems   and  as described herein and also the magnetic coil system  could have a special carrying case that has wheels and a pullup handle as is commonly used for suitcases the electrical pulse generator system  may also be designed with wheels and a pullup handle so as to make moving it from one place to the other less difficultfig  illustrates the face plate of an electrical current pulse generator  that has unique and superior characteristics as compared to the pulse generator  as previously described herein the electrical pulse generator  as described herein allows the operator of this equipment to control only the amplitude andor the frequency of the electrical pulses emitted by the electrical pulse generator  and does not indicate to the operator what the values are of those parameters that are being adjusted the electrical current pulse generator  as described herein can also control the amplitude and frequency of the electrical pulses generated by its electronics to power a variety of magnetic coil systems however the electrical current pulse generator  also provides several additional novel and useful features to enhance the operation of the complete system for the control of human painthe electrical current pulse generator  of fig  has an onoff switch  that is used by the operator to turn the electrical current pulse generator  on or off when not being used the switch  would typically be in the off position as shown in fig  when the switch  is turned to the on position two things happen namely  power is provided to all the electronics of the electrical current pulse generator  and  the wait light  turns to on or still better to flashing on and off preferably with an amber caution light from an led when all the electronics of the electrical current pulse generator  is warmed up the wait light  turns off and all the indicator boxes that show a particular measurement namely indicators   and  come on with either there last number that was in that indicator box or each number could be zero after the wait light  goes off the electrical current pulse generator  is all warmed up and ready to provide electrical current pulses to create magnetic pulses using any one of the several magnetic coils as described herein at that time the number in the indicator box  goes to zerowhen the wait light  has gone to its off state the operator can then  rotate the knob  to set the number of seconds between each pulse as indicted in the box   rotate the knob  to set the total number of pulses that the operator feels will be sufficient to ease the pain of the patient to be treated as indicated in box  and  rotate the knob  to adjust the amplitude of the magnetic pulses that are expected to be delivered just below the patients skin as indicated in box  after the operator feels that each of the settings are optimum for a particular patient and for a particular magnetic coil design then the operator can press the button  which turns on a green light surrounding that button to start the treatment with a series of magnetic pulses into the patients tissues using the settings as shown in fig  the patient would receive  magnetic pulses at an interval of  seconds between each of the pulses and the peak magnetic pulse intensity just below the patients skin would be approximately  tesla the number in the box  would indicate to the operator how many pulses  at this instant that have been delivered into the patient when the treatment is concluded the numbers in the boxes  and  would be identical if at any time during this treatment it was desired to stop the treatment the operator could press the stop button  and the treatment would be stopped it should be understood that the operator could be either a health care professional or the patient herself or himselfthere are many advantages to this type of design for a generator that is used to create electrical current pulses that enter magnetic coils to create magnetic pulses into a patients body it is anticipated that some patients would be more comfortable and gain more pain relief if the time between pulses was either less than or more than  seconds thus the operator could use any number of seconds for the treatment between approximately  second and let us say  seconds later research might even show that pulse periods either less than one second or greater than  seconds may be beneficial for some pain patientsin a similar manner it might be shown that more or less than  pulses would be optimum for some patients for some levels of pain in different parts of a human body it is also possible that magnetic pulse peak amplitudes greater than or less than  tesla may be advantageous for some patientsthe advantages of the novel features of the electrical current pulse generator  as described herein are that it teaches that each of these most significant parameters can be adjusted to optimize pain relief for different patients and for different body locations the settings shown in fig  indicate that this treatment would have a peak magnetic pulse intensity of  tesla at about  cm from the surface of the coil placed against the patients body although the knob  could be used to lower the highest magnetic field strength that this system could deliver it is actually unlikely that lower levels of magnetic field strength would improve treatment outcomes since there is no adverse side effects from even the highest level of magnetic field strength that the electrical current pulse generator  could deliver it is unlikely that lower magnetic pulse intensities would be useful however some patients may be able to have an effective treatment that is accomplished in less time by using either a shorter time between pulses or a decreased number of pulses for the settings shown in fig  with  pulses having a time between pulses of  seconds this would provide for a treatment that lasts  minutes before the treatment has been completed and the green light of the start button  goes off for some patients an effective treatment in a shorter period of time could provide a satisfactory result for pain reduction or elimination other patients may benefit from a longer time between each pulse andor a higher number of pulses it is expected that the selection of pulse period and pulse number can only be determined by trial and error with each specific patient and for each location of the pain in the human body a unique advantage of the electrical current pulse generator  of fig  is that it can be readily adjusted to optimize the treatment for pain for each pain location and for each different patient by the adjustment of these various parametersanother significant advantage of the design of the face plate for the electrical current pulse generator  shown in fig  has to do with its use in countries where languages other than english are required by law to be used for any medical device that is approved for treatments in that particular country specifically essentially all nonenglish speaking countries in europe and asia require that any medical device used in that country be labeled with the language of that country the face plate of the electrical current pulse generator  of fig  can have all words placed on that front plate with either printing or a clear plastic sheet pasted onto the front plate that has the word or symbol for that feature in the language of the country where it will be used thus the word “treatment” could be written in german or the chinese character for the word “treatment” could be placed to replace the english word “treatment” shown in fig  however the lights for the start button  or the stop button  would be respectively in green and red for all countries as would the amber flashing light for the wait button  still further each of the boxes    and  would have a number controlled by a computer system within the electrical current pulse generator  that provides a number as is used by essentially all nations on this planet in this way the need to reprogram the software for different languages for the front plate display would be avoided this is a novel and useful advantage for the design of any medical device that is to be used in many counties having different languagesalthough the use of the electrical current pulse generator  as described herein consistently discusses its use for human patients it should be understood that this equipment can also be useful to reduce the pain suffered by animals such as dogs cats or horses or any other animal that has pain to that end wherever herein the word “patient” is used that patient could also be considered to be any animal that is suffering from a condition of painvarious other modifications adaptations and alternative designs are of course possible in light of the teachings as presented herein therefore it should be understood that while still remaining within the scope and meaning of the appended claims this invention could be practiced in a manner other than that which is specifically described herein   previous patent
