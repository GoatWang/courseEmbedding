biocardia  product pipeline overview overview biotherapeutics cardiamp therapy biotherapeutics cardiallo therapy enabling devices helix system enabling devices morph products product pipeline overview biocardia is developing two comprehensive biotherapeutic candidates for cardiac regenerative medicine with an initial focus on heart failure resulting from a heart attack cardiamp – autologous minimally processed bone marrow cells a patient’s own cells cardiallo –allogenic culture expanded mesenchymal stem cells derived from bone marrow  donorderived   both programs have demonstrated safety and efficacy in clinical studies they provide compelling and synergistic approaches to replicating the natural response of bone marrow cells to cardiac injury cardiamp harnesses the potential of autologous minimally processed bone marrow cells using a companion diagnostic to identify patients most likely to benefit from the therapy  cardiallo utilizes younger universal donor mesenchymal stem cells and may be appropriate for patients who are not optimal candidates for the cardiamp therapy                     the company currently has several commercial devices which are used as part of its biotherapeutic solutions and can be used for other interventional procedures the helix transendocardial delivery system is also being used by several clinical partners in biotherapeutic clinical

business built on steerable thin walled catheter shaft technology this technology platform has countless applications in vascular access and is competitive with far more expensive robotic and magnetic techniques to control catheters the morph catheter family is a fully scalable platform we are working hard to enable it to be available to physicians who can benefit from its ability to navigate through tortuous anatomy customize the shape of the catheter to the patients anatomy and their clinical needs during the procedure and to have stellar back up support once positioned morph universal deflectable guides and morph accesspro steerable introducers sheaths can improve physician control and reduce procedural times and radiation exposure these in turn have potential to enhance patient safety there has been a growing body of literature that plaque emboli is dislodged during procedures due to catheter manipulation instead of using multiple preshaped catheters and potentially scraping the soft curves along the aorta the morph guides and sheaths enable a physician to use a catheter that is inserted in a straight configuration and deflected into the desired shape when at the target lesion or vessel it is estimated that the morph catheters pay for themselves in any procedure where they save  minutes of expensive procedure room time the maximal control and minimal manipulation approach the morph steerable guides and sheaths is intended to provide should have benefits to patient physician hospital and insurer     biocardia inc   shoreway road suite b san carlos ca

opportunity heart failure is a clinical condition in which the output of blood from the heart is insufficient to meet the metabolic demands of the body in  the american heart association or aha report on heart disease statistics estimated that there are  million americans over the age of  that have heart failure heart failure is increasingly prevalent due to the aging population and the increase in major cardiovascular risk factors including obesity and diabetes the aha also estimates that one in five adults will develop heart failure after the age of  during heart failure progression the heart steadily loses its ability to respond to increased metabolic demand and mild exercise soon exceeds the heart’s ability to maintain adequate output towards the end stage of the disease the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body’s needs at rest at this stage fluids accumulate in the extremities or in the lungs making the patient bedridden and unable to perform the activities of daily living the longterm prognosis associated with heart failure is approximately  mortality at five years following the initial diagnosis hospitalizations for heart failure are expensive and the risk of death increases with each recurrent heart failure related hospitalization in  the journal of the american college of cardiology reported that the one and six month readmission rates after heart failurerelated hospitalization are close to  and  respectively in  the aha estimated that the direct and indirect cost of heart failure in the united states was  billion half of which was related to repeated hospitalizations and by  the total cost of heart failure in the united states is projected to increase to  billion the affordable care act recently established the “hospital readmissions reduction program” which requires the centers for medicare  medicaid services to reduce payments to hospitals with excessive heart failure readmissions as such there is growing pressure on hospitals to reduce readmissions for heart failure heart failure is classified in relation to the severity of the symptoms experienced by the patient the most commonly used classification system established by the new york heart association or nyha is as follows • class i mild patients experience no or very mild symptoms with ordinary physical activity • class ii mild patients experience fatigue and shortness of breath during moderate physical activity • class iii moderate patients experience shortness of breath during even light physical activity and • class iv severe patients are exhausted even at rest despite guidelinedirected therapies employing a wide range of pharmacologic device and surgical options many patients deteriorate over time and develop advanced heart failure symptoms that cannot be effectively managed by existing medical therapies at the end stage of heart failure current treatment options include heart transplant surgery or implantation of a left ventricular assist device or lvad a battery operated mechanical circulatory device used to partially or completely replace the function of the left ventricle of the heart lvads are used for patients awaiting a heart transplant or as a destination therapy for patients with nyha class iv heart failure who may never receive a heart transplant both of these endstage treatment options require invasive openchest surgery and can cost in excess of  per procedure as reported by the journal of heart and lung transplantation there are approximately  million nyha class ii and class iii heart failure patients of which we estimate approximately  are patients with ischemic systolic heart failure of this subset of  million patients we estimate that approximately  or over  million patients will have a cell
