pm gmt subscribe search search sports peyton manning vs tom brady endorsements whos no  in commercial appeal by thomas barrabi tbarrabi on  at  pm denver broncos quarterback peyton manning  and new england patriots quarterback tom brady  shake hands after the  afc championship playoff football game at sports authority field at mile high photo reutersmatthew emmonsusa today sports within the lines of the gridiron peyton manning and tom brady are as accomplished as pro quarterbacks come as the two stars match up once again this sunday in a marquee clash both bring super bowl titles passing records and nearcertain locks on hall of fame enshrinementyet in another competition one measured in endorsement dollars secured manning is the clear leader with his classic good looks and supermodel wife brady earned some  million through endorsement deals last year according to forbes  far less than the  million taken home by manning who outearned every other nfl playerthe gap indicates nothing about qualitative differences on the field and everything about how starpower translates into endorsement deals say people who make their living moving product brady and manning both rank as icons in american life yet manning brings something demonstrably more valuable  an ability to project regularguy cred and a sense of humor about himself  “peyton manning seems like a guy you want to grab a beer with at a sports bar and talk football all day he seems like an approachable guy” said tom o’grady a sports branding expert and chief creative officer at gameplan creative “brady has a little more of a ‘hollywood’ persona even though he’s playing in new england if la ever got a team he’d be a great los angeles quarterback”brady has endorsement deals with uggs movado watches and glaceau smartwater premium brands that aim to sell to the guy in the luxury box the affable manning appears in commercials for papa john’s pizza in fact manning purchased  papa johns locations in colorado directv buick and nationwide which aim for the fan sitting in the bleachers and there are many many more fans sitting in the bleachers than in the luxury box“those are mainstream brands that are somewhat a reflection of peyton i would assume that he’s probably more comfortable supporting brands like those just because of who he is those are just extensions of his own character” o’grady said “the agencies have used that kind of nextdoor ‘can i grab your hedgecutters’ type of approach and he sells it very well”“i just can’t see peyton manning wearing a set of ugg boots”conversely the same attributes that make it difficult for brady to seem relatable to the common man make him the perfect pitchman for luxury products brady and his associates have limited his visibility focusing on brands that establish the patriots star as the embodiment of class this selectivity detracts from brady’s mass appeal but bolsters the perception that a bradyendorsed item is a prestigious itemgisele bundchen’s presence may also play a role in brady’s business decisions the quarterback’s glamorous wife a former victoria’s secret angel has been the world’s highestpaid model for the last eight years with lucrative endorsements that include deals with hm chanel and countless other highfashion brands in  she joined brady in endorsing under armour a company that is pushing to compete with nike at the pinnacle of the sports apparel industry“they seem to feed off one another in that respect” o’grady said “they’ve got this quasiconnected brand the husband and wife thing it’s a modern day joe dimaggiomarilyn monroe thing there’s a certain kind of star chemistry to that and maybe tom’s very comfortable in those shoes”brady’s approach to endorsement deals is also more sustainable argues allen adamson north america region chairman at landor associates a sports performance company like gatorade will lose interest in manning once he’s out of football but brady will be able to sell watches long after he retires manning’s willingness to promote papa john’s discount pizza deals or wear a wig in a fauxmusic video could hinder his ability to go “offmarket” to promote a higherend product adamson said“you have to make a choice if you’re going to go for the premier premium brands you have to stay there and be that” he said “the minute you cross over and try to do everyday brands you won’t be appealing anymore to the prestige brands manning may be making more money in the shortterm but it’s a very long game”but for now the quarterbacks strategies could hardly be working better in pursuing their offfield ventures brady and manning have each established marketable personas that satisfy their unique dispositions  and made a ton of money in the process“if they were competing for the same products off the field they probably wouldn’t be as successful” o’grady said “it’s almost like peyton’s like ‘you stay out of my category i’ll stay out of your category and we’ll both make a lot of money’” most read the newsletterexclusive articles delivered to your inbox dailysubscriberelated stories manningbrady rivalry stays interesting manning rips broncos scoreboard operator

nfl history and has peyton manning ahead of tom brady heres why hes wrong by rich hillpprichhill jul   am edt tweet share pin rec matthew emmonsusa today sports i really respect football perspective and all of the work that chase stuart and company have produced over the years theyve helped better the worlds understanding of advanced statistics and historical perspective guest writer and football historian brad oremland just completed his list of the  best quarterbacks in nfl history and its a truly tremendous work i dont have the knowledge or background to compile a list as thoroughly as oremland and for that i respect his product the list includes the like of matt hasselbeck doug flutie and drew bledsoe it has eli manning ahead of andrew luck but behind russell wilson it has john elway at th overall it has tom brady at th and peyton manning at st oremland makes a compelling argument as to why manning should be considered the best quarterback of all time especially because best is a subjective measure he notes that manning will likely hold all of the cumulative quarterback records by the time he retires with regards to both production and regular season awards he highlights that a record seven different players have posted  yards receiving under manning and six of them havent posted a  yard season without manning the next closest quarterback has four unique receivers mannings made the playoffs with each head coach that hes had and hes done it all throughout his career his playoff performances fluctuate between outstanding and ghastly but his bustitutde is overblown oremland calls manning an artist with his visionary approach to presnap reads and audibles changing the modern game as a whole the argument on behalf of manning as the best quarterback of all time hinges on his total production his individual accolades the length of his career and the drop in performance by the colts when manning was injured thats fine so with his support of manning in mind lets do a linebyline breakdown of his tom brady analysis  tom bradynew england patriots  yards  td  int  rating like john elway or roger staubach a multiple super bowl loser famous for his clutch play an interesting way to use the phrase a multiple super bowl loser as if thats supposed to be evidence against the claim of his clutch play tom bradys career has something to please everyone he has career milestones like  tds and  yards he has four super bowl rings and three super bowl mvps hes been regular season mvp twice hes thrown for  yards in a season  tds in a season a  passer rating no matter what measure you prefer tom brady is one of the greatest quarterbacks ever to play this is all true brady spent a few years throwing to randy moss and wes welker and rob gronkowski could become the greatest tight end of all time if he stays healthy but for much of his career brady has played with noname receivers sometimes hes had a running game and sometimes not for most of the last decade there have been questions about new englands defense no matter who else is on the team bill belichick and brady find ways to succeed such dramatic shifts in approach are not unprecedented but theyre very rare also true brady had moss for two and a quarter seasons and one of those years was his recovery from a torn acl moss combined for  yards and  touchdowns during the  and  seasons he had the undrafted wes welker for six record breaking seasons welker had a down  due to a torn acl rob gronkowski is the best tight end in football but even hes finished three of the past four seasons as an injured mess i really dont have anything negative to say about tom brady but i suppose i need to explain why he only ranks seventh — and in particular some readers will require me to explain why i rank brady beneath peyton manning they are contemporaries so that makes sense lets begin with the manning comparison i think most fans would agree that brady and manning have been roughly equal from  during those years manning was  as starter compared to  for brady each has one super bowl victory and two super bowl losses with one super bowl mvp bradys others came prior to  its hard to find much difference there likewise with passing stats searchquarterback att yds nya rating td to manning       brady        okay so were agreed that theres not much difference over the last  seasons this ignores that manning spent half that time frame in a dome which absolutely leads to higher statistical performances and it also conveniently cuts off at nine seasons played to remove both a brady super bowl and mannings best season as a quarterback since  mannings top five receivers by yards have been st round pick reggie wayne st round pick demaryius thomas st round pick dallas clark st round pick marvin harrison and rd round pick eric decker his top three running backs by yards have been st round pick joseph addai st round pick knowshon moreno and st round pick edgerrin james it should be noted that all of these players were drafted by mannings team in comparison bradys top five receivers are undrafted acquired by trade wes welker nd round pick rob gronkowski st round pick acquired by trade randy moss th round pick julian edelman and nd round pick acquired by trade deion branch his top three running backs have been rd round pick stevan ridley st round pick laurence maroney and undrafted benjarvus greenellis when bill belichick says that its important for the chef to purchase the ingredients its absolutely obvious that mannings shopping in the gourmet aisle while brady is buying secondhand when comparing the statistical production of manning and brady after  its critical to highlight that manning has been playing within a far more talented offense the question is whether brady was a greater qb from  than manning from  the answer is no through  brady made two pro bowls and won two super bowl mvp awards manning made five pro bowls and won two nfl mvp awards brady passed for almost  yards manning for almost  manning had six yard seasons brady none manning broke the singleseason records for tds  and passer rating  while bradys singleseason highs were  and  respectively manning had a perfect passer rating  in a playoff game which brady has never done and led a point comeback in the final five minutes of a monday night football game against the defending super bowl champions which no one else has done ignoring that this a flawed method of comparison that highlights circles and underlines the fact that oremland values volume and that he rounds bradys  yards to almost  and mannings  yards to almost  we have something to work with we are comparing seven seasons of manning to four seasons of brady peyton averaged roughly  attempts and completions more per game than brady for a  greater completion rate including  more yards per game and a touchdown rate of  greater than brady of course mannings  is a major outlier remember that arbitrary nine season cutoff compared to his  seasons bradys four seasons from  yield near identical touchdown rates to mannings  and also features an interception rate  better manning had a better yards per attempt by  but more on that in a bit for their careers brady has thrown fewer completions with a lower completion percentage many fewer yards and fewer yards per attempt fewer touchdowns and a lower td more sacks for more yards and many more fumbles he does have a lot fewer interceptions and a better int hes less wild than manning and he doesnt seem to get rattled or frustrated as easily id add that he also has fewer attempts per game but yes mannings rates are superior but again heres that dome effect in play per mr dan marowni quarterbacks complete passes at a  greater rate indoors than outdoors their touchdown rate is  greater and average  more yards per attempt mannings career completion rate is  better than bradys his touchdown rate is  better and he averages  more yards per attempt all of that falls within a potential realm of indoor benefit coincidentally manning has played exactly  of his games inside so a fairly easy projection could be made for brady under the same circumstances split g cmp att cmp yds ya ypg td td int int rate brady              manning              if brady had the same indooroutdoor split as manning his rates would be nearly identical to mannings and hes done it with a much weaker supporting cast as for bradys composure its to bradys credit that hes played well without elite receivers but its also true that he hasnt looked like the best in the game without weapons like welker and gronkowski that doesnt apply to manning edgerrin james left and the colts won the super bowl marvin harrison retired and manning won nfl mvp and then we all said well okay but its not like reggie wayne is chopped liver so manning overcame a careerthreatening neck injury switched to an entirely different team with entirely new receivers and set singleseason records for yardage and tds eric decker left in free agency and welker got suspended so manning turned emmanuel sanders into a pro bowler every receiver manning plays with turns into a superstar what does weapons like welker and gronkowski mean it doesnt apply to peyton because manning has never played without a weapon like harrison or wayne or thomas mannings number two weapon has gone from marshall faulk and edgerrin james to reggie wayne dallas clark and a season of pierre garcon to eric decker and emmanuel sanders harrison wayne faulk and james are all hall of fame worthy brady had a couple seasons of wes welker and julian edelman as his  target but david patten david givens ben watson in the reche caldwell season postseahawks deion branch brandon lloyd and danny amendola have been his second options only wes welker and maybe edelman would have had the chance to crack any of peytons starting lineups and sure manning switched teams already stacked with talent and managed to set records in their second season in that second year brady met manning in the  afc championship with receivers who picked up less than  of the patriots  receiving yards in fact bradys been the center point of three of the six largest receiver turnovers in league history and in each year he brought the patriots to the afc championship game and even lost to peyton in two of them every receiver manning plays with turns into a superstar is a little bit much as oremland stated manning hasnt been lining up with chopped liver hes been lining up with multiple top players and yes of course he makes them better but deion branch would top out as peytons third most talented receiver in any given year kenbrell thompkins wouldnt make the roster in the two seasons that the patriots featured offensive talent that could rival peytons talent  and  bradys numbers were right in line with mannings top years and that quarterback with four unique yard receivers that was second to manning thats brady troy brown wes welker rob gronkowski julian edelman and he didnt have the benefit of joining a brand new team to add to his counter i just dont know how you look at these two qbs and conclude that brady is more critical to his team than manning it doesnt match up in the eye test the passing stats the receivers or the team results when brady missed the  season the patriots still went  when manning missed the  season the colts dropped to  how about framing it this way the patriots went  to  net loss of  wins from brady to matt cassel who is still considered a starter albeit a terrible one in the league against the easiest nfl schedule since the realignment in  while mannings colts went from  to  net loss of  wins with two rookies and a third new starter on the offensive line and two quarterbacks that have a  combined career record and neither of whom have started a game since their disastrous  with the colts its not a fair comparison when bradys replacement made the pro bowl with the kansas city chiefs while mannings replacements couldnt find their way out of the locker room additionally the  patriots scored a record setting  points per drive ppd while the  patriots scored  ppd the colts fell from  ppd in  to  ppd in  and if we want to use standard deviations the patriots fell from  to  while the colts fell from  to  the matt casselled patriots attack was so stacked and played such weak competition they performed better than the  peyton manningled colts offense for what thats worth tom brady has been one of the best qbs in the league for over a decade hes passed for  yards nearly  tds and hes never thrown  or more ints in any season he holds several postseason records hes started in six super bowls quarterbacked four super bowl winners and won three super bowl mvps hes an obvious hall of famer a great quarterback by any measure several how about nearly all the postseason records including fourth quarter comebacks and game winning drives oremland highlights mannings  comeback against the patriots but neglects to mention that game is the only time that manning has ever comeback to win or led a game winning drive in the playoffs the idea that hes the greatest ever — better than his contemporary manning or better than fellow fourtime champion joe montana — i think represents incomplete oversimplified analysis or recency bias this could also very well be true although no other quarterback in nfl history has enjoyed the same degree of statistical individual and team success as tom brady the idea that brady might be the best qb in super bowl history is absurd joe montana and terry bradshaw at least are comfortably ahead of him brady is still a good player and its likely he will rise on this list before his career is over theres no question that montanas four super bowls are fantastic although some might point at his   yards and  touchdown in his first super bowl as a lackluster performance but the terry bradshaw who went  for  yards and  touchdown in his first super bowl or the terry bradshaw that went  for   touchdowns and  interceptions in his fourth super bowl no way of quarterbacks with at least  pass attempts in four or more super bowls bradshaw didnt break  attempts in two of his and jim kelly was injured in his third super bowl and only had  attempts brady stacks up well against them all theres montana bradshaw brady john elway and roger staubach staubach had a stinker against bradshaws steelers in  going  for  yards  touchdowns and  interceptions elway had three lousy performances in   and  combining for   for  total yards  touchdown and  interceptions bradys weakest outing was his   yards  touchdown and  interception game against the giants in  of the stinkers his is better than anyone elses if theres any playoff quarterback that brady might be chasing its montana and montana alone and even that argument is fading brady shouldnt be penalized for attending two more super bowls than montana and montana has the edge in oneanddones with  out of  seasons versus just  out of  for brady theres no question in my mind that manning and brady both rank in the top five quarterbacks of all time along with joe montana johnny unitas and bart starr and the order just comes down to personal preference oremland prefers to value quarterbacks on cumulative individual statistics as exampled by his usage of bradys first four seasons and mannings first seven as a justifiable tiebreaker and the disregard for full evaluation and appreciation for the difference in quality of supporting cast others value championships and others highlight individual accolades its impossible to separate the quarterbacks individual performance from that of the team when looking through a statistical lens offenses hinge upon the success of the lineman and the quality of the skill players team success will not come unless the defensive side of the ball performs at critical times brady is just as close to  in super bowls as he is to  as oremland notes brady will continue to climb the ladder as he marches down the winter of his career he will leap john elway into th alltime in pass attempts this upcoming season to match his th place in passer rating and passing yards hell need two more seasons to pass dan marino in yards with  touchdown passes hell jump marino into th alltime in touchdown passes and if he throws for four more touchdowns than drew brees brady will rank rd hes nd in alltime interception rate and with two fourth quarter comebacks hell rank nd as well hes had nine over the past two seasons in fact if brady is able to play at his current level for at least three more seasons after manning retires to match the three season head start manning received at the beginning of his career it wouldnt be a surprise to see him match or pass mannings accumulation of regular season statistics i dont think theres much argument over who is the more talented quarterback just like how manning was the most talented quarterback for the first half of bradys career so has aaron rodgers been the most talented for the second half from my perspective talent alone doesnt make a player the best for all of the reasons that oremland lists for justification that manning is the best in the history of the league other than the most valuable peyton awards its hard to overlook that brady should be right alongside him if not ahead for the exact same reasons more from pats pulpit how will the patriots fill their two open roster spots heading into training camp patriots veterans will report to training
