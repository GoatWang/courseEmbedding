search wynn resorts ltd the bear case from a bull the casino operators stock may be worth the gamble but its still a gamble travis hoium tmfflushdraw jul   at pm ive been a big fan of wynn resorts nasdaqwynn for a long time mainly because steve wynn always manages to build resorts that outperform their neighbors and in recent years the stock fell to a level where i thought it was a great value  but my bullishness doesnt mean i dont see risks ahead for wynn resorts heres the best case against owning the stock  front view rendering of wynn palace in macau image source wynn resorts macaus growth is just a mirage the biggest driver of wynns recovery is that macaus gaming market began returning to growth just as wynn palace opened so far in  gaming revenue is up  in the chinese territory and theres hope that revenue from its key industry will continue to grow as more resorts are completed and infrastructure improves  so far in  the bull theory has held up but conditions can change on a dime china has been cracking down on corruption over the last few years and its worried about money being laundered through macau in the worst case it could put restrictions on the junket operators that provide loans to chinese high rollers in patacas in macau and then collect on the debts in renminbi after the gamblers return to the chinese mainland squeezing those middlemen could quickly disrupt the vip market which accounts for nearly twothirds of macaus gaming revenue  theres also the risk that a recession could strike the us or chinese economy or both which would be a broad negative for the gaming industry overall the economy is a macro risk for wynn resorts but its one investors need to be aware of given the leverage wynn has on its balance sheet  debt is adding more risk than wynn would like to build wynn palace in macau and fund the current construction of wynn boston harbor the company has taken on billions of dollars in new debt and its leverage as measured by its debttoebitda ratio a proxy for cash flow is increasing as well with wynn palace in operation this measure of leverage will fall but its current level is high nonetheless  wynn total long term debt quarterly data by ycharts the sheer leverage of debt is whats most worrying about wynn resorts today when gaming companies went into financial turmoil and bankruptcy during the financial crisis it was primarily because they had more debt than they could handle wynn is walking a tightrope right now with its rising debt load  wynns risk is very real bullish investors in wynn resorts know these risks exist  they just think the upside is greater than the downside and that the macau market in particular will keep growing but theres a case to be made that macau could go through another downturn like it did from  to  if that happens wynn resorts growing debt load could become a very real problem for the company travis hoium owns shares of wynn resorts the motley fool has no position in any of the

and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no
