opportunityperformancelibrarycontact uscontact uslocationhotels  restaurants summary of our investment approach on this page philosophy selection criteria value investing risk management conviction philosophy our views on the equity markets combined with our specific skill set provide a framework for our investment methodology nature of insights we believe the market often misprices stocks due to neglect emotion misinterpretation and a shortterm perspective the best way to capitalize on these inefficiencies is through bottomup company research stock selection is limited to those businesses we are able to confidently value and purchase at a significant discount our analyses of companies allow us to establish an informational edge with an emphasis on identifying how our insights about a company differ from the market’s as well as our degree of conviction in these insights time horizon we think of our universe of companies not as a stock market but as a cross section of opportunities we are owners of partial interests in businesses and our investment time horizon reflects this mindset our holding period is conceptually varied as we are always looking for the valuation gap to narrow or close and in many cases companies are purchased based on a specific investment premise that we expect to unfold over time we constantly assess the riskreward relationships more a function of discount to intrinsic value and the volatility of a company’s operating results than the volatility of its market price associated with the stocks we own concentration we believe good ideas should be positioned to have a meaningful impact on client portfolio performance our portfolios own the  to  best ideas we can find individual position sizes range from  to  and weightings are directly correlated to our level of conviction our portfolio structure is not influenced by a given benchmark we emphasize effective diversification thinking in terms of investment opportunities instead of active exposures back to top selection criteria in an early edition of security analysis by graham and dodd the authors stated that nearly every stock could conceivably be a good investment at the right price the foundation of our investment approach is built on several of the principles formulated by graham and dodd however price is not our only investment consideration we often find and purchase businesses with more vibrant qualities our selection criteria include the following businesses we understand that possess sound capital structures and maintain conservative accounting policies a current market price that is – below our estimate of intrinsic value a business model that provides strong potential for per share intrinsic value growth management teams led by strong operators and proven capital allocators who have clearly aligned incentives in place to maximize shareholder value back to top value investing we consider our investment style to have a clear value orientation but our investments are not limited to low expectation and out of favor companies or industries we tend to avoid very high growth businesses because they are often hard to value and therefore do not correspond with our riskaverse mindset and skeptical tendencies we allocate client assets to companies that fall into three subcategories of value deep discount opportunities based on current earnings and asset values companies where a recognized catalyst is in place to uncover value — spinoffs restructurings and turnarounds discounted franchise businesses that possess durable competitive advantages and compete in markets with attractive longterm prospects we believe this “controlled flexibility” is integral to meeting our return objectives valuation methodology in assessing the intrinsic value of our portfolio companies we utilize the valuation technique that best reflects the true economic worth of a company’s assets our superseding goal is to determine what we would pay to own the whole enterprise based on the cash flow we believe the business will produce over the long haul discounted at an appropriate rate accordingly we primarily rely on discounted cash flow analysis and comparable private market transactions however we also often employ other methodologies such as liquidation analysis or replacement cost when appropriate back to top risk management our approach to risk management focuses on controlling against permanent capital loss our risk control efforts emphasize diligence and knowhow in developing accurate insights about the companies we own avoiding companies we cannot effectively value or business models that we do not understand requiring a significant “margin of safety” between price and intrinsic value when we purchase businesses effectively diversifying exposure to stockspecific risks and macroeconomic factor variables and maintaining adequate industry and sector diversification partnering with competent management teams whose interests are aligned with those of their shareholders maintaining objectivity in evaluating winning and losing positions also worth mentioning are the risk control methods which are common to our industry that we do not emphasize we do not manage portfolios to a low tracking error target we do not consider traditional beta or price volatility metrics as a proxy for risk and we do not own lowconviction stocks solely for diversification purposes back to top conviction among the various labels that are used to describe investment managers “having high conviction” is one that we embrace we believe investing is about knowledge and interpretation and the term suggests that clients are receiving a good value for their active fees our decisions regarding purchase sale and portfolio weighting of individual companies within our portfolios are directly correlated to our assessment of these variables the size of the discount the potential for intrinsic value growth identification of and confidence in a variant view identification of a meaningful catalyst a positive impact on portfolio diversification liquidity back to top newsouth capital management inc   s

provider of software and solutions for the investment management industry today announced that registered investment advisor newsouth capital management inc recently migrated to advent portfolio exchange apx and implemented the newly enhanced version of advent corporate actions aca to achieve substantial time savings and greater reliability across a broad range of corporate actions newsouth capital management inc which manages approximately  billion in assets had long relied on a combination of axys advents original portfolio accounting product qube advents crm module and aca for the collection of corporate actions data on its holdings the firm realized that a single secure platform integrating portfolio management with client relationship management crm data could provide enhanced functionality and time savings over their existing configurationwhen the firm migrated to apx it simultaneously upgraded to the apxenhanced version of aca to harness an even more powerful solution aca simplifies the process of compiling data from key sources and updating portfolios on corporate actions that affect portfolio values such as mergers and acquisitions name and tickersymbol changes spinoffs and exchanges this data is essential to ensuring accuracy in valuations trading and reportingtracking and processing corporate actions is still a largely manual process at many investment firms making it prone to errors and delays aca automates this key process aggregating data from highquality data providers matching it to a firms holdings and providing timely reports and transactions on actions that affect those holdingswe are particularly excited about the ability to deal with complex mergers acquisitions and other actions through aca with apx over and above what we were able to do in axys said andrew l macqueen newsouth capital management inc head trader and director of information systems processing the more complex mergers and spinoffs used to take about two or three hours with aca on apx we expect to shave that down to  or  minutes which is pretty amazing given the complexity of the dealsamong the new features available in aca for apx is the ability to have multiple updates on reorganization transactions in real time automatically revising fair market values cashinlieu and cost bases this new functionality creates extraordinary efficiency gains eliminating the need to back out and repost transactionswere very pleased to welcome newsouth capital management inc to the growing list of investment advisors using advents nextgeneration suite said pete hess evp and general manager of the investment management group for advent the combination of apx and aca is just the latest example of how advent continues to innovate our suite of
