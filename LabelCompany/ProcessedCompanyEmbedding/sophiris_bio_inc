clinically significant localized prostate cancer in the plus study prx also demonstrated a favorable safety profile with no evidence of any treatment related sexual or cardiovascular side effects the phase  trial called plus achieved its primary endpoint — a single treatment with prx topsalysin demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in bph symptoms over a  month period in our

optimize the delivery of a single and potentially a second transperineal intraprostatic treatment of topsalysin prx in march  we initiated a second phase  clinical trial to confirm the dose and optimize the delivery of topsalysin for the treatment of clinically significant localized prostate cancer this study will also utilize previously obtained mri images of each patient’s prostate mapped to real time d ultrasound to target the delivery of topsalysin directly into and around a preidentified clinically significant tumor the primary objective of the study is safety and tolerability of an injection of topsalysin and the key efficacy variable is focal ablation of a clinically significant lesion on biopsy after six months approximately  patients will be enrolled across clinical sites in the uk and us patient screening into the study has begun we expect to receive biopsy data for all patients for biopsies conducted six months after the initial dose late  or early  based upon the results of the month biopsy the study includes an option to potentially retreat the targeted lesion area with a second dose of topsalysin with a targeted biopsy to occur six months following the second dose in order to be eligible for a second dose the patient cannot have experienced a significant adverse event attributable to topsalysin or the dosing procedure from the first dose and the patient will need to have had a clinical response from the first dose but still have the presence of a clinically significant lesion area we expect to have final biopsy data on all patients who

reduction in gleason pattern and seven patients had no response to treatment see additional details of the results of this study here phase  openlabel clinical trial in prostate cancer in september  we completed a phase  clinical trial of prx in six patients with biopsyproven locallyrecurrent prostate cancer that following radiation therapy showed signs of disease progression evidenced by rising
