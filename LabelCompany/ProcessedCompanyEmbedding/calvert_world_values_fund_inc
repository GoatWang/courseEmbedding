time the fund uses independent pricing services approved by the board of directors to value its investments wherever possible� investments for which market quotations are not available or deemed not reliable are fair valued in good faith under the direction of the board of directors� in determining fair value the board considers all relevant qualitative and quantitative information available these factors are subject to change over time and are reviewed periodically the values assigned to fair value investments are based on available information and do not necessarily represent amounts that might ultimately be realized further because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation those estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed and the differences could be material � the following securities were fair valued in good faith under the direction of the board of directors as of december   � � total investments  of net assets capital accumulation   international equity   �� the fund utilizes various methods to measure the fair value of its investments generally accepted accounting principles gaap establishes a disclosure hierarchy that categorizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to value assets and liabilities at measurement date these inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below � level  � quoted prices in active markets for identical securities level  � other significant observable inputs including quoted prices for similar securities interest rates prepayment speeds credit risk etc � � � level  � significant unobservable inputs including the fund�s own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments � the inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities � changes in valuation techniques may result in transfers in or out of an investment�s assigned level within the hierarchy during the period� valuation techniques used to value the funds investments by major category are as follows � equity securities including restricted securities and venture capital securities for which market quotations are readily available are valued at the last reported sale price or official closing price as reported by an independent pricing service on the primary market or exchange on which they are traded and are categorized as level  in the hierarchy foreign securities are valued based on quotations from the principle market in which such securities are normally traded if events occur after the close of the principle market in which foreign securities are traded and before the close of business of the fund that are expected to materially affect the value of those securities then they are valued at their fair value taking these events into account the calvert world values international equity fund and calvert international opportunities fund have retained a third party fair value pricing service to quantitatively analyze the price movement of its holdings on foreign exchanges and to automatically fair value if the variation from the prior day�s closing price exceeds specified parameters� such securities would be categorized as level  in the hierarchy in these circumstances utilizing this technique may result in transfers between level  and level � for restricted securities and private placements where observable inputs are limited assumptions about market activity and risk are used and are categorized as level  in the hierarchy � venture capital securities for which market quotations are not readily available are fair valued by the fund�s board of directors and are categorized as level  in the hierarchy� venture capital direct equity securities are generally valued using the most appropriate and applicable method to measure fair value in light of each company�s situation� methods may include market income or cost approaches with discounts as appropriate based on assumptions of liquidation or exit risk examples of the market approach are subsequent rounds of financing comparable transactions and revenue times an industry multiple� an example of the income approach is the discounted cash flow examples of the cost approach are replacement cost salvage value or net asset percentage venture capital limited partnership lp securities are valued at the fair value reported by the general partner of the partnership adjusted as necessary to reflect subsequent capital calls and distributions and any other available information in the absence of a reported lp unit value it may be estimated based on the fund�s percentage equity in the partnership andor other balance sheet information and portfolio value for the most recently available period reported by the general partner� in some cases adjustments may be made to account for daily pricing of material public holdings within the partnership venture capital debt securities are valued based on assumptions of credit and market risk for venture capital securities denominated in foreign currency the fair value is marked to the daily exchange rate debt securities including restricted securities are valued based on evaluated prices received from independent pricing services or from dealers who make markets in such securities and are generally categorized as level  in the hierarchy shortterm instruments of sufficient credit quality with a maturity at issuance�of sixty days or less for which quotations are not readily available are valued at amortized cost which approximates fair value and are categorized as level  in the hierarchy when independent prices are unavailable or unreliable debt securities may be valued utilizing pricing matrices which consider similar factors that would be used by independent pricing services these are generally categorized as level  in the hierarchy but may be level  depending on the circumstances �

the fund charges a  redemption fee on redemptions including exchanges made within  days of purchase in the same fund within seven days for class i shares the redemption fee is paid to the class of the fund from which the redemption is made and is accounted for as an addition to paidin capital� the fee is intended to discourage markettimers by ensuring that shortterm trading costs are borne by the investors making the transactions and not the shareholders already in the fund � expense offset arrangement the fund has an arrangement with its custodian bank whereby the custodian�s fees may be paid indirectly by credits earned on the fund�s cash on deposit with the bank these credits are used to reduce the fund�s expenses such a deposit arrangement may be an alternative to overnight investments

transactions in financial futures contract and related options for hedging purposes and invest in warrants stock rights and repurchase agreements these investment techniques and the related risks are described in more detail in the statement of additional information options on foreign currencies will be covered by securities denominated in that currency options on securities indices will be covered by securities that substantially replicate the movement of the index cwvf international equity may not write options on more than  of its total assets management presently intends to cease writing options in and as long as  of such total assets are subject to outstanding options contracts cwvf international equity may invest up to an aggregate of  of its total assets in exchangetraded or overthecounter call and put options on securities and securities indices and foreign currencies purchases of such options may be made for the purpose of hedging against changes in the market value of the underlying securities or foreign currencies lending portfolio securities cwvf international equity may lend its portfolio securities to member firms of the new york stock exchange and commercial banks with assets of one billion dollars or more provided the value of the securities loaned will not exceed  of assets any such loans must be secured continuously in the form of cash or cash equivalents such as us treasury bills the amount of the collateral must on a current basis equal or exceed the market value of the loaned securities and cwvf international equity must be able to terminate such loans upon notice at any time international equity will exercise its right to terminate a securities loan in order to preserve its right to vote upon matters of importance affecting holders of the securities the advantage of such loans is that cwvf international equity continues to receive the equivalent of the interest earned or dividends paid by the issuers on the loaned securities while at the same time earning interest on the cash or equivalent collateral securities loans are usually made to brokerdealers and other financial institutions to facilitate their delivery of such securities as with any extension of credit there may be risks of delay in recovery and possibly loss of rights in the loaned securities should the borrower of the loaned securities fail financially however international equity will make loans of its portfolio securities only to those firms the advisor or subadvisor deems creditworthy and only on such terms the advisor or subadvisor believes should compensate for such risk on termination of the loan the borrower is obligated to return the securities international equity will realize any gain or loss in the market value of the securities during the loan period and may pay reasonable custodial fees in connection with the loan international equity funds investment objective and those policies set forth as fundamental investment restrictions may not be changed without shareholder approval risk factors  cwvf international equity an investment in international equity is subject to various risks international equitys use of certain investment techniques such as foreign currency options involves special risks see investment techniques and related risks there are substantial and different risks involved in investing in foreign securities you should consider these risks carefully for example there is generally less publicly available information about foreign companies than is available about companies in the us foreign companies are not subject to uniform audit and financial reporting standards practices and requirements comparable to those in the us foreign securities involve currency risks the us dollar value of a foreign security tends to decrease when the value of the dollar rises against the foreign currency in which the security is denominated and tends to increase when the value of the dollar falls against such currency fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the earning power and asset value of the foreign entity issuing the security dividend and interest payments may be returned to the country of origin based on the exchange rate at the time of disbursement and restrictions on capital flows may be imposed losses and other expenses may be incurred in converting between various currencies in connection with purchases and sales of foreign securities foreign stock markets are generally not as developed or efficient as those in the us in most foreign markets volume and liquidity are less than in the us and at times volatility of price can be greater than that in the us fixed commissions on foreign stock exchanges are generally higher than the negotiated commissions on us exchanges there is generally less government supervision and regulation of foreign stock exchanges brokers and companies than in the us there is also the possibility of adverse changes in investment or exchange control regulations expropriation or confiscatory taxation limitations on the removal of funds or other assets political or social instability or diplomatic developments which could adversely affect investments assets or securities transactions of international equity in some foreign countries cwvf international equity is not aware of any investment or exchange control regulations which might substantially impair the operations of cwvf international equity as described although this could change at any time the dividends and interest payable on certain of international equitys foreign securities may be subject to foreign withholding taxes thus reducing the net amount available for distribution to international equity shareholders the expense ratio of cwvf international equity can be expected to be higher than those of investment companies investing only in domestic securities since the costs of operations are higher investment selection process investments are selected on the basis of their ability to contribute to the dual objectives of financial soundness and social criteria potential investments for a fund are first screened for financial soundness and then evaluated according to that funds social criteria to the greatest extent possible investments are made in companies exhibiting unusual positive accomplishments with respect to one or more of the criteria companies must meet the funds minimum standards for all its criteria with respect to government securities csif invests primarily in debt obligations issued or guaranteed by agencies or instrumentalities of the us government whose purposes further or are compatible with csifs social criteria such as obligations of the student loan marketing association rather than general obligations of the us government such as treasury securities although each funds social criteria and consideration tend to limit the availability of investment opportunities more than is customary with other investment companies camco and the subadvisors of the funds believe there are sufficient investment opportunities to permit full investment among issuers which satisfy each funds investment and social objectives the selection of an organization for investment by a portfolio does not constitute endorsement or validation by each fund nor does the exclusion of an organization necessarily reflect failure to satisfy each funds social criteria investors in each fund are invited to send a brief description of companies they believe might be suitable for investment all investments are selected with a concern for the social impact of each investment calvert social investment fund calvert social investment fund invests in accordance with its philosophy that longterm rewards to investors will come from those organizations whose products services and methods enhance the human condition and the traditional american values of individual initiative equality of opportunity and cooperative effort csif has developed the following criteria for the selection of organizations in which it invests csif recognizes however that these criteria represent standards of behavior which few if any organizations totally satisfy and that as a matter of practice evaluation of a particular organization in the context of these criteria will involve subjective judgment by camco and csifs subadvisors given these considerations csif seeks to invest in a producer or service provider which  delivers safe products and services in ways which sustain our natural environment for example csif looks for companies that produce energy from renewable resources while avoiding consistent polluters  is managed with participation throughout the organization in defining and achieving objectives for example csif looks for companies that offer employee stock ownership or profitsharing plans  negotiates fairly with its workers provides an environment supportive of their wellness does not discriminate on the basis of race gender religion age disability ethnic origin or sexual orientation does not consistently violate regulations of the equal employment opportunity commission and provides opportunities for women disadvantaged minorities and others for whom equal opportunities have often been denied for example csif considers both unionized and nonunion firms with good labor relations  fosters awareness of a commitment to human goals such as creativity productivity selfrespect and responsibility within the organization and the world and continually recreates a context within which these goals can be realized for example csif looks for companies with an above average commitment to community affairs and charitable giving csif will not invest in an issuer which the advisors determine to be significantly engaged in  the production of nuclear energy or the manufacture of equipment to produce nuclear energy  business activities in support of repressive regimes  the manufacture of weapon systems csif will not as a matter of operating policy which may be changed without the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares invest in an issuer primarily engaged in the manufacture of alcoholic beverages or tobacco products or the operation of gambling casinos csif believes that social and technological change will continue to transform america and the world into the next century those enterprises which exhibit a social awareness measured in terms of the above attributes and considerations should be better prepared to meet future societal needs for goods and services by responding to social concerns these enterprises should maintain flexibility and further social goals in so doing they should not only avoid the liability that may be incurred when a product or service is determined to have a negative social impact or has outlived its usefulness but also be better positioned to develop opportunities to make a profitable contribution to society these enterprises should be ready to respond to external demands and ensure that over the longer term they will be viable to provide a positive return to both investors and society as a whole calvert world values international equity fund cwvf international equity carefully reviews company policies and behavior regarding social issues important to global quality of life cwvf international equity currently observes the following operating policies which may be changed by its board of directors without shareholder approval  it actively seeks to invest in companies that achieve excellence in both financial return and environmental soundness selecting issuers that take positive steps toward preserving and enhancing our natural environment through their operations and products and avoiding companies with poor environmental records  cwvf international equity seeks to invest in companies with positive labor practices we consider the international labor organizations basic conventions on worker rights as a guideline for our labor criteria international equity avoids investing in companies that demonstrate a pattern of engaging in forced compulsory or child labor in addition we seek to invest in companies that hire and promote women and ethnic minorities respect the right to form unions comply at a minimum with domestic hour and wage laws and provide good health and safety standards  international equity will not invest in issuers which the advisor or subadvisor ascertains contribute to human rights abuses in other countries  it will not invest in producers of nuclear power or nuclear weapons or companies with more than  of revenues derived from the production or sale of weapons systems and  it will not invest in companies which derive more than  of revenues from the production of alcohol or tobacco products and actively seeks to invest in companies whose products or services improve the quality of or access to health care including public health and preventative medicine cwvf international equity believes that there are longterm benefits inherent in an investment philosophy that demonstrates concern for the environment human rights economic priorities and international relations those enterprises which exhibit a social awareness measured in terms of the above attributes and considerations should be better prepared to meet future societal needs for goods and services by responding to social concerns these enterprises should not only avoid the liability that may be incurred when a product or service is determined to have a negative social impact or has outlived its usefulness but also be better positioned to develop opportunities to make a profitable contribution to society cwvf international equity believes these enterprises should be ready to respond to external demands and ensure that over the longer term they will be viable to provide a positive return to both investors and society as a whole the spirit of calvert world values international equity funds social vision is similar to calvert social investment fund but the application of the social analysis is significantly different international investing brings unique challenges in terms of corporate disclosure regulatory structures environmental standards and differing national and cultural priorities due to these factors the cwvf social investment standards are less stringent than those of csif cwvf may invest in companies that operate in countries with poor human rights records if we believe the companies are making a positive contribution special equities and private placements  csif and international equity due to the particular social objective of the funds opportunities may exist to promote especially promising approaches to social goals through privately placed investments the special equities committee of each funds board identifies evaluates and selects certain of these investments subject to ratification by the boards the private placement investments undertaken by the funds if any may be subject to a high degree of risk such investments may involve relatively small and untried enterprises that have been selected in the first instance because of some attractive social objectives or policies many private placement investments have no readily available market and may therefore be considered illiquid investments in private placements and other securities for which market quotations are not readily available are valued under the direction and control of the boards high social impact investments  csif and international equity each portfolio may invest a small portion of its respective assets in investments in securities that offer a rate of return below the then prevailing market rate and that present attractive opportunities for furthering the funds social criteria high social impact investments such high social impact investments must be less than  of the applicable csif portfolios assets and less than  of cwvf international equitys assets such securities are typically illiquid and unrated and generally considered noninvestmentgrade debt securities which involve a greater risk of default or price decline than investmentgrade securities through diversification and credit analysis and limited maturity investment risk can be reduced although there can be no assurance that losses will not occur the high social impact investments committee of the boards identifies evaluates selects and values these investments subject to ratification by the boards yield and total return the portfolios may advertise different types of yield and total return performance which is calculated separately for each class all performance figures are based on historical earnings and are not intended to indicate future performance further information about each portfolios performance is contained in its annual report to shareholders which may be obtained without charge csif money market portfolio the money market portfolio may advertise yield and effective yield the yield refers to the actual income generated by an investment over a particular base period stated in the advertisement if the base period is less than one year the yield will be annualized that is the amount of income generated by the investment during the base period is assumed to be generated over a oneyear period and is shown as a percentage of the investment the effective yield is calculated like yield but assumes reinvestment of earned income the effective yield will be slightly higher than the yield because of the compounding effect of this assumed reinvestment csif bond portfolio yield measures the bond portfolios current investment performance that is the rate of income on its portfolio investments divided by the share price yield is computed by annualizing the result of dividing the net investment income per share over a day period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of that period yields are calculated according to accounting methods that are standardized for all stock and bond funds csif managed growth bond equity and cwvf international equity portfolios total return differs from yield in that yield figures measure only the income component of a portfolios investments while total return includes not only the effect of income dividends but also any change in net asset value or principal amount during the stated period the total return of a class shows its overall change in value including changes in share price and assuming all of its dividends and capital gain distributions are reinvested a cumulative total return reflects the performance of the class over a stated period of time an average annual total return reflects the hypothetical annual compounded return that would have produced the same cumulative total return if the performance had been constant over the entire period because average annual returns tend to smooth out variations in the returns you should recognize that they are not the same as actual yearbyyear results both types of total return for class a shares usually will include the effect of paying the frontend sales charge of course total returns will be higher if sales charges are not taken into account quotations of return without maximum sales charge do not reflect deduction of the sales charge you should consider these figures only if you qualify for a reduced sales charge or for purposes of comparison with comparable figures which also do not reflect sales charges such as mutual fund averages compiled by lipper analytical services inc fund management each fund is not required to hold annual shareholder meetings but special meetings may be called for certain purposes such as electing trustees or directors changing fundamental policies or approving a management contract as a shareholder you receive one vote for each share you own except that matters affecting classes differently such as distribution plans will be voted on separately by the affected classes calvert social investment fund the board of trustees supervises csifs activities and reviews its contracts with companies that provide it with

january   which may be obtained free of charge by writing the fund at the above address or calling the fund investment objective calvert world values fund inc international equity fund the fund seeks to achieve a high total return consistent with reasonable risk by investing primarily in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities to the extent possible investments are made in enterprises that make a significant contribution to our global society through their products and services and through the way they do business foreign securities additional costs may be incurred which are related to any international investment since foreign brokerage commissions and the custodial costs associated with maintaining foreign portfolio securities are generally higher than in the united states fee expense may also be incurred on currency exchanges when the fund changes investments from one country to another or converts foreign securities holdings into us dollars foreign companies and foreign investment practices are not subject to uniform accounting auditing and financial reporting standards and practices or regulatory requirements comparable to those applicable to united states companies there may be less public information available about foreign companies united states government policies have at times in the past through imposition of interest equalization taxes and other restrictions discouraged united states investors from making certain investments abroad they may be reinstituted from time to time as a means of fostering a favorable united states balance of payments in addition foreign countries may impose withholding and taxes on dividends and interest see risk factors in the prospectus american and european depositary receipts many foreign securities are represented by american depositary receipts adrs or other receipts evidencing ownership of foreign securities such as international depositary receipts and global depositary receipts adrs are us dollardenominated and are traded in the us on exchanges or over the counter adrs do not eliminate all the risk inherent in investing in the securities of foreign issuers however by investing in adrs rather than directly in foreign issuers stock the fund may avoid some currency risks and liquidity risks during the settlement period for either purchases or sales the information available for adrs is subject to the more uniform and more exacting accounting auditing and financial reporting standards of the domestic market or exchange on which they are traded in general there is a large liquid market in the us for many adrs the fund may also invest in european depositary receipts edrs which are receipts evidencing an arrangement with a european bank similar to that for adrs and are designed for use in the european securities markets edrs are not necessarily denominated in the currency of the underlying security credit quality the fund invests only in investment grade bonds as has been the industry practice this determination of credit quality is made at the time the fund acquires the bond however because it is possible that subsequent downgrades could occur if a bond held by the fund is later downgraded the funds subadvisor under the supervision of the funds board of directors will consider whether it is in the best interest of the funds shareholders to hold or to dispose of the bond among the criteria that may be considered by the subadvisor and the board are the probability that the bonds will be able to make scheduled interest and principal payments in the future the extent to which any devaluation of the bond has already been reflected in the fund net asset value and the total percentage if any of bonds currently rated below investment grade held by the fund noninvestment grade securities have moderate to poor protection of principal and interest payments and have speculative characteristics they involve greater risk of default or price declines due to changes in the issuers creditworthiness than investmentgrade debt securities because the market for lowerrated securities may be thinner and less active than for higherrated securities there may be market price volatility for these securities and limited liquidity in the resale market market prices for these securities may decline significantly in periods of general economic difficulty or rising interest rates options and futures contracts the fund may purchase put and call options and engage in the writing of covered call options and secured put options on securities which meet the funds social criteria and employ a variety of other investment techniques specifically the fund may engage in the purchase and sale of stock index future contracts foreign currency futures contracts interest rate futures contracts and options on such futures as described more fully below such investment policies and techniques may involve a greater degree of risk than those inherent in more conservative investment approaches the fund will engage in such transactions only to hedge existing positions it will not engage in such transactions for the purposes of speculation or leverage the fund will not engage in such options or futures transactions unless it receives any necessary regulatory approvals permitting it to engage in such transactions the fund may write covered options on securities in standard contracts traded on national or foreign securities exchanges or in individually negotiated contracts traded overthecounter it may write such options in order to receive the premiums from options that expire and to seek net gains from closing purchase transactions with respect to such options purchasing call and put options warrants and stock rights the fund may purchase put options by buying a put the fund has the right to sell the security at the exercise price thus limiting its risk of loss through a decline in the market value of the security until the put expires the amount of any appreciation in the value of the underlying security will be partially offset by the amount of the premium paid for the put option and any related transaction costs prior to its expiration a put option may be sold in a closing sale transaction and any profit or loss from the sale will depend on whether the amount received is more or less than the premium paid for the put option plus the related transaction costs the fund may purchase call options such transactions may be entered into in order to limit the risk of a substantial increase in the market price of the security which the fund intends to purchase prior to its expiration a call option may be sold in a closing sale transaction any profit or loss from such a sale will depend on whether the amount received is more or less than the premium paid for the call option plus the related transaction costs a call option on a security security index or a foreign currency gives the purchaser of the option in return for the premium paid to the writer seller the right to buy the underlying security index or foreign currency at the exercise price at any time during the option period upon exercise by the purchaser the writer of a call option on an individual security or foreign currency has the obligation to sell the underlying security or currency at the exercise price a call option on a securities index is similar to a call option on an individual security except that the value of the option depends on the weighted value of the group of securities comprising the index and all settlements are to be made in cash a call option may be terminated by the writer seller by entering into a closing purchase transaction in which it purchases an option of the same series as the option previously written a put option on a security security index or foreign currency gives the purchaser of the option in return for the premium paid to the writer seller the right to sell the underlying security index or foreign currency at the exercise price at any time during the option period the fund may sell a call option or a put option which it has previously purchased prior to the purchase in the case of a call or the sale in the case of a put of the underlying security or foreign currency any such sale would result in a net gain or loss depending on whether the amount received on the sale is more or less than the premium and other transaction costs paid on the call or put which is sold purchasing a call or put option involves the risk that the fund may lose the premium it paid plus transaction costs warrants and stock rights are almost identical to call options in their nature use and effect except that they are issued by the issuer of the underlying security rather than an option writer and they generally have longer expiration dates than call options the fund may invest up to  of its net assets in warrants and stock rights but no more than  of its net assets in warrants and stock rights not listed on the new york stock exchange or the american stock exchange covered options the fund may write covered options on equity and debt securities and indices this means that in the case of call options so long as the fund is obligated as the writer of a call option it will own the underlying security subject to the option and in the case of put options it will through its custodian deposit and maintain either cash or securities with a market value equal to or greater than the exercise price of the option when the fund writes a covered call option it gives the purchaser the right to purchase the security at the call option price at any time during the life of the option as the writer of the option it receives a premium less a commission and in exchange foregoes the opportunity to profit from any increase in the market value of the security exceeding the call option price the premium serves to mitigate the effect of any depreciation in the market value of the security writing covered call options can increase the income of the fund and thus reduce declines in the net asset value per share of the fund if securities covered by such options decline in value exercise of a call option by the purchaser however will cause the fund to forego future appreciation of the securities covered by the option when the fund writes a secured put option it will gain a profit in the amount of the premium less a commission so long as the price of the underlying security remains above the exercise price however the fund remains obligated to purchase the underlying security from the buyer of the put option usually in the event the price of the security funds falls below the exercise price at any time during the option period if the price of the underlying security falls below the exercise price the fund may realize a loss in the amount of the difference between the exercise price and the sale price of the security less the premium received the fund may purchase securities which may be covered with call options solely on the basis of considerations consistent with the investment objectives and policies of the fund the funds turnover may increase through the exercise of a call option this will generally occur if the market value of a covered security increases and the fund has not entered into a closing purchase transaction to preserve the funds status as a regulated investment company under subchapter m of the internal revenue code it is the funds policy to limit any gains on put or call options and other securities held less than three months to less than  of the funds annual gross income risks related to options transactions the fund can close out its respective positions in exchangetraded options only on an exchange which provides a secondary market in such options although it intends to acquire and write only such exchangetraded options for which an active secondary market appears to exist there can be no assurance that such a market will exist for any particular option contract at any particular time this might prevent the fund from closing an option position which could impair its ability to hedge effectively the inability to close out a call position may have an adverse effect on liquidity because the fund may be required to hold the securities underlying the option until the option expires or is exercised overthecounter otc options otc options differ from exchangetraded options in several respects they are transacted directly with dealers and not with a clearing corporation and there is a risk of nonperformance by the dealer however the premium is paid in advance by the dealer otc options are available for a greater variety of securities and foreign currencies and in a wider range of expiration dates and exercise prices than exchangetraded options since there is no exchange pricing is normally done by reference to information from a market maker which information is carefully monitored or caused to be monitored by the subadvisor and verified in appropriate cases a writer or purchaser of a put or call option can terminate it voluntarily only by entering into a closing transaction in the case of otc options there can be no assurance that a continuous liquid secondary market will exist for any particular option at any specific time consequently the fund may be able to realize the value of an otc option it has purchased only by exercising it or entering into a closing sale transaction with the dealer that issued it similarly when the fund writes an otc option it generally can close out that option prior to its expiration only by entering into a closing purchase transaction with the dealer to which it originally wrote the option if a covered call option writer cannot effect a closing transaction it cannot sell the underlying security or foreign currency until the option expires or the option is exercised therefore the writer of a covered otc call option may not be able to sell an underlying security even though it might otherwise be advantageous to do so likewise the writer of a secured otc put option may be unable to sell the securities pledged to secure the put for other investment purposes while it is obligated as a put writer similarly a purchaser of an otc put or call option might also find it difficult to terminate its position on a timely basis in the absence of a secondary market the fund understands the position of the staff of the securities and exchange commission the sec to be that purchased otc options and the assets used as cover for written otc options are illiquid securities the fund has adopted procedures for engaging in otc options transactions for the purpose of reducing any potential adverse effect of such transactions upon the liquidity of the fund futures transactions the fund may purchase and sell futures contracts futures contracts but only when in the judgment of the subadvisor such a position acts as a hedge against market changes which would adversely affect the securities held by the fund these futures contracts may include but are not limited to market index futures contracts and futures contracts based on us government obligations a futures contract is an agreement between two parties to buy and sell a security on a future date which has the effect of establishing the current price for the security although futures contracts by their terms require actual delivery and acceptance of securities in most cases the contracts are closed out before the settlement date without the making or taking of delivery of securities upon buying or selling a futures contract the fund deposits initial margin with its custodian and thereafter daily payments of maintenance margin are made to and from the executing broker payments of maintenance margin reflect changes in the value of the futures contract with the fund being obligated to make such payments if its futures position becomes less valuable and entitled to receive such payments if its positions become more valuable the fund may only invest in futures contracts to hedge its existing investment positions and not for income enhancement speculation or leverage purposes although some of the securities underlying the futures contract may not necessarily meet the funds social criteria any such hedge position taken by the fund will not constitute a direct ownership interest in the underlying securities futures contracts have been designed by boards of trade which have been designated contracts markets by the commodity futures trading commission cftc as a registered investment company the fund is eligible for exclusion from the cftcs definition of commodity pool operator meaning that it may invest in futures contracts under specified conditions without registering with the cftc among these conditions are requirements that to the extent that the fund enters into future contracts and options on futures positions that are not for bona fide hedging purposes as defined by the cftc the aggregate initial margin and premiums on these positions excluding the amount by which options are inthemoney may not exceed  of the funds net assets options on futures contracts the fund may purchase and write put or call options and sell call options on futures contracts in which it could otherwise invest and which are traded on a us exchange or board of trade it may also enter into closing transactions with respect to such options to terminate an existing position that is to sell a put option already owned and to buy a call option to close a position where the fund has already sold a corresponding call option the fund may only invest in options on futures contracts to hedge its existing investment positions and not for income enhancement speculation or leverage purposes although some of the securities underlying the futures contract underlying the option may not necessarily meet the funds social criteria any such hedge position taken by the fund will not constitute a direct ownership interest in the underlying securities an option on a futures contract gives the purchaser the right in return for the premium paid to assume a position in a futures contract  a long position if the option is a call and a short position if the option is a put  at a specified exercise price at any time during the period of the option the fund will pay a premium for such options purchased or sold in connection with such options bought or sold the fund will make initial margin deposits and make or receive maintenance margin payments which reflect changes in the market value of such options this arrangement is similar to the margin arrangements applicable to futures contracts described above put options on futures contracts the purchase of put options on futures contracts is analogous to the sale of futures contracts and is used to protect the portfolio against the risk of declining prices the fund may purchase put options and sell put options on futures contracts it already owns the fund will only engage in the purchase of put options and the sale of covered put options on market index futures for hedging purposes call options on futures contracts the sale of call options on futures contracts is analogous to the sale of futures contracts and is used to protect the portfolio against the risk of declining prices the purchase of call options on futures contracts is analogous to the purchase of a futures contract the fund may only buy call options to close an existing position where the fund has already sold a corresponding call option or for a cash hedge the fund will only engage in the sale of call options and the purchase of call options to cover for hedging purposes writing call options on futures contracts the writing of call options on futures contracts constitutes a partial hedge against declining prices of the securities deliverable upon exercise of the futures contract if the futures contract price at expiration is below the exercise price the fund will retain the full amount of the option premium which provides a partial hedge against any decline that may have occurred in the funds securities holdings risks of options and futures contracts if the fund has sold futures or takes options positions to hedge its portfolio against decline in the market and the market later advances it may suffer a loss on the futures contracts or options which it would not have experienced if it had not hedged correlation is also imperfect between movements in the prices of futures contracts and movements in prices of the securities which are the subject of the hedge thus the price of the futures contract or option may move more than or less than the price of the securities being hedged where the fund has sold futures or taken options positions to hedge against decline in the market the market may advance and the value of the securities held in the fund may decline if this were to occur the fund might lose money on the futures contracts or options and also experience a decline in the value of its portfolio securities however although this might occur for a brief period or to a slight degree the value of a diversified portfolio will tend to move in the direction of the market generally the fund can close out futures positions only on an exchange or board of trade which provides a secondary market in such futures although the fund intends to purchase or sell only such futures for which an active secondary market appears to exist there can be no assurance that such a market will exist for any particular futures contract at any particular time this might prevent the fund from closing a futures position which could require the fund to make daily cash payments with respect to its position in the event of adverse price movements options on futures transactions bear several risks apart from those inherent in options transactions generally the funds ability to close out its options positions in futures contracts will depend upon whether an active secondary market for such options develops and is in existence at the time the fund seeks to close its positions there can be no assurance that such a market will develop or exist therefore the fund might be required to exercise the options to realize any profit closing out a futures position  risks the fund may close out its position in a futures contract or an option on a futures contract only by entering into an offsetting transaction on the exchange on which the position was established and only if there is a liquid secondary market for the futures contract if it is not possible to close a futures position entered into by the fund the fund could be required to make continuing daily cash payments of variation margin in the event of adverse price movements in such situations if the fund has insufficient cash it may have to sell portfolio securities to meet daily margin requirements at a time when it would be disadvantageous to do so the inability to close futures or options positions could have an adverse effect on the funds ability to hedge effectively there is also risk of loss by the fund of margin deposits in the event of bankruptcy of a broker with whom the fund has an open position in a futures contract the success of a hedging strategy depends on the subadvisors ability to predict the direction of interest rates and other economic factors the correlation is imperfect between movements in the prices of futures or options contracts and the movements of prices of the securities which are subject to the hedge if the fund used a futures or options contract to hedge against a decline in the market and the market later advances or viceversa the fund may suffer a greater loss than if it had not hedged foreign currency transactions forward foreign currency exchange contracts a forward foreign currency exchange contract involves an obligation to purchase or sell a specific currency at a future date which may be any fixed number of days term from the date of the contract agreed upon by the parties at a price set at the time of the contract these contracts are traded directly between currency traders usually large commercial banks and their customers the fund will not enter into such forward contracts or maintain a net exposure in such contracts where it would be obligated to deliver an amount of foreign currency in excess of the value of its portfolio securities and other assets denominated in that currency the subadvisor believes that it is important to have the flexibility to enter into such forward contracts when it determines that to do so is in the funds best interests foreign currency options a foreign currency option provides the option buyer with the right to buy or sell a stated amount of foreign currency at the exercise price at a specified date or during the option period a call option gives its owner the right but not the obligation to buy the currency while a put option gives its owner the right but not the obligation to sell the currency the option seller writer is obligated to fulfill the terms of the option sold if it is exercised however either seller or buyer may close its position during the option period for such options any time prior to expiration a call rises in value if the underlying currency appreciates conversely a put rises in value if the underlying currency depreciates while purchasing a foreign currency option can protect the fund against an adverse movement in the value of a foreign currency it does not limit the gain which might result from a favorable movement in the value of such currency for example if the fund was holding securities denominated in an appreciating foreign currency and had purchased a foreign currency put to hedge against a decline in the value of the currency it would not have to exercise its put similarly if the fund had entered into a contract to purchase a security denominated in a foreign currency and had purchased a foreign currency call to hedge against a rise in the value of the currency but instead the currency had depreciated in value between the date of purchase and the settlement date it would not have to exercise its call but could acquire in the spot market the amount of foreign currency needed for settlement foreign currency futures transactions the fund may use foreign currency futures contracts and options on such futures contracts through the purchase or sale of such contracts it may be able to achieve many of the same objectives attainable through the use of foreign currency forward contracts but more effectively and possibly at a lower cost unlike forward foreign currency exchange contracts foreign currency futures contracts and options on foreign currency futures contracts are standardized as to amount and delivery period and are traded on boards of trade and commodities exchanges it is anticipated that such contracts may provide greater liquidity and lower cost than forward foreign currency exchange contracts the value of the funds assets as measured in united states dollars may be affected favorably or unfavorably by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and exchange control regulations and the fund may incur costs in connection with conversions between various currencies the fund will conduct its foreign currency exchange transactions either on a spot ie cash basis at the spot rate prevailing in the foreign currency exchange market or through forward contracts to purchase or sell foreign currencies a forward foreign currency exchange contract involves an obligation to purchase or sell a specific currency at a future date which may be any fixed number of days from the date of the contract agreed upon by the parties at a price set at the time of the contract these contracts are traded directly between currency traders usually large commercial banks and their customers when the fund enters into a contract for the purchase or sale of a security denominated in a foreign currency it may want to establish the united states dollar cost or proceeds as the case may be by entering into a forward contract in united states dollars for the purchase or sale of the amount of foreign currency involved in the underlying security transaction the fund is able to protect itself against a possible loss between trade and settlement dates resulting from an adverse change in the relationship between the united states dollar and such foreign currency however this tends to limit potential gains which might result from a positive change in such currency relationships the fund may also hedge its foreign currency exchange rate risk by engaging in currency financial futures and options transactions when the advisor or the subadvisor believes that the currency of a particular foreign country may suffer a substantial decline against the united states dollar it may enter into a forward contract to sell an amount of foreign currency approximating the value of some or all of the funds portfolio securities denominated in such foreign currency the forecasting of shortterm currency market movement is extremely difficult and whether such a shortterm hedging strategy will be successful is highly uncertain it is impossible to forecast with precision the market values of portfolio securities at the expiration of a contract accordingly it may be necessary for the fund to purchase additional currency on the spot market and bear the expense of such purchase if the market value of the security is less than the amount of foreign currency the fund is obligated to deliver when a decision is made to sell the security and make delivery of the foreign currency in settlement of a forward contract conversely it may be necessary to sell on the spot market some of the foreign currency received upon the sale of the portfolio security if its market value exceeds the amount of foreign currency the fund is obligated to deliver if the fund retains the portfolio security and engages in an offsetting transaction it will incur a gain or a loss as described below to the extent that there has been movement in forward contract prices if the fund engages in an offsetting transaction it may subsequently enter into a new forward contract to sell the foreign currency should forward prices decline during the period between the fund entering into a forward contract for the sale of a foreign currency and the date it enters into an offsetting contract for the purchase of the foreign currency it would realize gains to the extent the price of the currency it has agreed to sell exceeds the price of the currency it has agreed to purchase should forward prices increase the fund would suffer a loss to the extent the price of the currency it has agreed to purchase exceeds the price of the currency it has agreed to sell although such contracts tend to minimize the risk of loss due to a decline in the value of the hedged currency they also tend to limit any potential gain which might result should the value of such currency increase the fund may have to convert its holdings of foreign currencies into united states dollars from time to time although foreign exchange dealers do not charge a fee for conversion they do realize a profit based on the difference the spread between the prices at which they are buying and selling various currencies the subadvisor may occasionally invest in the debt instruments of foreign sovereign governments these may include shortterm treasury bills notes and longterm bonds and will only be considered for investment by the fund if they have the full guarantee of the government in question the subadvisor will not invest in foreign government securities with a rating by moodys investor services lower than aa investment restrictions fundamental investment restrictions the fund

and sell securities outside the us that are not registered with the sec or marketable in the us  as an operating policy excluding special equities and high social impact investments the fund will limit its investment in securities of us issuers to  of the funds net assets for purposes of the funds concentration policy contained in restriction  above the fund intends to comply with the sec staff position that securities issued or guaranteed as to principal and interest by any single foreign government are considered to be securities of issuers in the same industry any investment restriction which involves a maximum percentage of securities or assets shall not be considered to be violated unless an excess over the applicable percentage occurs immediately after an acquisition of securities or utilization of assets and results therefrom investment selection process investments in the fund are selected on the basis of their ability to contribute to the dual objective of the fund the subadvisor uses its best efforts to select investments for the fund that satisfy the funds investment and social criteria to the greatest practical extent the subadvisor has developed a number of techniques for evaluating the performance of issuers in each of these areas the primary sources of information are reports published by the issuers themselves the reports of public agencies and the reports of groups which monitor performance in particular areas these sources of information are sometimes augmented with direct interviews or written questionnaires addressed to the issuers it should be recognized however that there are few generally accepted measures by which achievement in these areas can be readily distinguished therefore the development of suitable measurement techniques is largely within the discretion and judgment of the advisors of the fund in making investment selections the subadvisor determines and evaluates the appropriate portfolio composition on the basis of asset prices and the perceived consequences and probabilities of various economic outcomes that the subadvisor deems possible the subadvisor then evaluates numerous individual securities as candidates to fulfill the funds investment objective and policies securities remain candidates for inclusion in the fund only if their prices and other characteristics indicate that they have the potential to perform in a way that is representative of their class of securities under the different economic outcomes considered more probable by the subadvisor candidates for inclusion in any particular class of assets are then examined according to the social criteria the subadvisor classifies the issuers into three categories of suitability under the social criteria in the first category are those issuers which exhibit unusual positive accomplishment with respect to some of the criteria and do not fail to meet minimum standards with respect to the remaining criteria to the greatest extent possible investment selections are made from this group in the second category are those issuers which meet minimum standards with respect to all the criteria but do not exhibit outstanding accomplishment with respect to any criterion this category includes issuers which may lack an affirmative record of accomplishment in these areas but which are not known by the subadvisor to violate any of the social criteria the third category under the social criteria consists of issuers which flagrantly violate or have violated one or more of those values for example a company which repeatedly engages in unfair labor practices the fund will not knowingly purchase the securities of issuers in this third category it should be noted that the funds social criteria tend to limit the availability of investment opportunities more than is customary with other investment companies the advisors of the fund however believe that within the first and second categories there are sufficient investment opportunities to permit full investment among issuers which satisfy the funds social investment objective dividends distributions and taxes the fund declares and pays dividends from net investment income on an annual basis distributions of realized net capital gains if any are normally paid once a year however the fund does not intend to make any such distributions unless available capital loss carryovers if any have been used or have expired dividends and distributions paid may differ among the classes generally dividends including shortterm capital gains and distributions are taxable to the shareholder in the year they are paid however any dividends and distributions paid in january but declared during the prior three months are taxable in the year declared investors should note that the internal revenue code code may require investors to exclude the initial sales charge if any paid on the purchase of fund shares from the tax basis of those shares if the shares are exchanged for shares of another calvert group fund within  days of purchase this requirement applies only to the extent that the payment of the original sales charge on the shares of the fund causes a reduction in the sales charge otherwise payable on the shares of the calvert group fund acquired in the exchange and investors may treat sales charges excluded from the basis of the original shares as incurred to acquire the new shares the fund is required to withhold  of any longterm capital gain dividends and  of each redemption transaction occurring in the fund if a the shareholders social security number or other taxpayer identification number tin is not provided or an obviously incorrect tin is provided b the shareholder does not certify under penalties of perjury that the tin provided is the shareholders correct tin and that the shareholder is not subject to backup withholding under section ac of the code because of underreporting however failure to provide certification as to the application of section ac will result only in backup withholding on capital gain dividends not on redemptions or c the fund is notified by the internal revenue service that the tin provided by the shareholder is incorrect or that there has been underreporting of interest or dividends by the shareholder affected shareholders will receive statements at least annually specifying the amount withheld the fund is required to report to the internal revenue service the following information with respect to each redemption transaction a the shareholders name address account number and taxpayer identification number b the total dollar value of the redemptions and c the funds identifying cusip number certain shareholders are exempt from the backup withholding and broker reporting requirements exempt shareholders include corporations financial institutions taxexempt organizations individual retirement plans the us a state the district of columbia a us possession a foreign government an international organization or any political subdivision agency or instrumentality of any of the foregoing us registered commodities or securities dealers real estate investment trusts registered investment companies bank common trust funds certain charitable trusts foreign central banks of issue nonresident aliens certain foreign partnerships and foreign corporations are generally not subject to either requirement but may instead be subject to withholding under sections  or  of the internal revenue code shareholders claiming exemption from backup withholding and broker reporting should call or write the fund for further information net asset value the public offering price of the shares of the fund is the respective net asset value per share plus for class a shares the applicable sales charge the net asset values fluctuates based on the respective market value of the funds investments the net asset value per share for each class is determined every business day at the close of the regular session of the new york stock exchange normally  pm eastern time and at such other times as may be necessary or appropriate the fund does not determine net asset value on certain national holidays or other days on which the new york stock exchange is closed new years day martin luther king day presidents day good friday memorial day independence day labor day thanksgiving day and christmas day the funds net asset value per share is determined by dividing total net assets the value of its assets net of liabilities including accrued expenses and fees by the number of shares outstanding for that class the assets of the fund are valued as follows a securities for which market quotations are readily available are valued at the most recent closing price mean between bid and asked price or yield equivalent as obtained from one or more market makers for such securities b securities maturing within  days may be valued at cost plus or minus any amortized discount or premium unless the board of directors determines such method not to be appropriate under the circumstances and c all other securities and assets for which market quotations are not readily available will be fairly valued by the advisor in good faith under the supervision of the board of directors securities primarily traded on foreign securities exchanges are generally valued at the preceding closing values on their respective exchanges where primarily traded equity options are valued at the last sale price unless the bid price is higher or the asked price is lower in which event such bid or asked price is used exchange traded fixed income options are valued at the last sale price unless there is no sale price in which event current prices provided by market makers are used overthecounter fixed income options are valued based upon current prices provided by market makers financial futures are valued at the settlement price established each day by the board of trade or exchange on which they are traded because of the need to obtain prices as of the close of trading on various exchanges throughout the world the calculation of the funds net asset value does not take place for contemporaneously with the determination of the prices of us portfolio securities for purposes of determining the net asset value all assets and liabilities initially expressed in foreign currency values will be converted into united states dollar values at the mean between the bid and offered quotations of such currencies against united states dollars at last quoted by any recognized dealer if an event were to occur after the value of an investment was so established but before the net asset value per share was determined which was likely to materially change the net asset value

return is calculated separately for each class total return is computed by taking the total number of shares purchased by a hypothetical  investment after deducting any applicable sales charge adding all additional shares purchased within the period with reinvested dividends and distributions calculating the value of those shares at the end of the period and dividing the result by the initial  investment for periods of more than one year the cumulative total return is then adjusted for the number of years taking compounding into account to calculate average annual total return during that period total return is computed according to the following formula p  tn  erv where p  a hypothetical initial payment of  t  total return n  number of years and erv  the ending redeemable value of a hypothetical  payment made at the beginning of the period total return is historical in nature and is not intended to indicate future performance all total return quotations reflect the deduction of

to shareholder accounts in full and fractional shares rounded to the nearest th of a share share certificates will not be issued unless requested in writing by the investor no charge will be made for share certificate requests no certificates will be issued for fractional shares a service fee of  plus any costs incurred by the fund will be charged investors whose purchase checks are returned for insufficient funds telephone redemption requests are processed upon the date of receipt if received prior to  pm redemption proceeds are normally transmitted or mailed the next business day although payment by check of redemption proceeds shares may take up to five business days however telephone redemption requests which would require the redemption of shares purchased by check or electronic funds transfer within the previous  business days may not be honored the fund reserves the right to modify the telephone redemption privilege amounts redeemed by telephone may be mailed by check to the investor to the address of record without charge amounts of more than  and less than  may be transferred electronically at no charge to the investor amounts of l or more will be transmitted by wire without charge by the fund to the investors account at a domestic bank or savings association that is a member of the federal reserve system or to a correspondent bank a charge of  is imposed on wire transfers of less than  if the institution is not a federal reserve system member failure of immediate notification to that institution by the correspondent bank could result in a delay in crediting the funds to the investors account at the institution to change redemption instructions already given shareholders must send a notice to the fund with a voided copy of a check for the bank wiring instructions to be added if a voided check does not accompany the request then the request must be signature guaranteed by a commercial bank trust company savings association or member firm of any national securities exchange other documentation may be required from corporations fiduciaries and institutional investors the funds redemption check normally will be mailed to the investor on the next business day following the date of receipt by the fund of a written redemption request if the investor so instructs in such written redemption request the check will be mailed or the redemption proceeds wired or transferred electronically to a preauthorized account at the investors bank or savings association the right of redemption may be suspended or the date of payment postponed for any period during which the new york stock exchange is closed other than customary weekend and holiday closings when trading on the new york stock exchange is restricted or an emergency exists as determined by the commission or if the commission has ordered such a suspension for the protection of shareholders redemption proceeds are normally mailed wired or transferred electronically the next business day but in no event later than seven days after a proper redemption request has been received unless redemptions have been suspended or postponed as described above redemption proceeds are normally paid in cash however the fund has the right to redeem shares in assets other than cash for redemption amounts exceeding in any day period  or  of the net asset value of the fund whichever is less reduced sales charges class a the fund imposes reduced sales charges for class a shares in certain situations in which the principal underwriter and the dealers selling fund shares may expect to realize significant economies of scale with respect to such sales generally sales costs do not increase in proportion to the dollar amount of the shares sold the perdollar transaction cost for a sale to an investor of shares worth say  is generally much higher than the perdollar cost for a sale of shares worth  thus the applicable sales charge declines as a percentage of the dollar amount of shares sold as the dollar amount increases when a shareholder agrees to make purchases of shares over a period of time totaling a certain dollar amount pursuant to a letter of intent the underwriter and selling dealers can expect to realize the economies of scale applicable to that stated goal amount thus the fund imposes the sales charge applicable to the goal amount similarly the underwriter and selling dealers also experience cost savings when dealing with existing fund shareholders enabling the fund to afford existing shareholders the right of accumulation the underwriter and selling dealers can also expect to realize economies of scale when making sales to the members of certain qualified groups which agree to facilitate distribution of fund shares to their members for

decreases over time  management fees are restated to reflect current contractual fees rather than the fees paid during the previous fiscal year    the investment advisor has agreed to contractually limit direct net annual fund operating expenses through january   direct net operating expenses will not exceed  for class a  for class c and  for class y only the board of directors of the fund may terminate the fund’s expense limitation before the contractual period expires upon  days’ prior notice to shareholders example this example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds the example assumes that • you invest  in the fund for the time periods indicated and then either redeem or hold your shares at the end of those periods • your investment has a  return each year • the fund’s operating expenses remain the same and • any calvert expense limitation is in effect for the period indicated in the fee table above

turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account these costs which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the “example” affect the fund’s performance during the most recent fiscal year the fund’s portfolio turnover rate was  of its portfolio’s average value summary prospectus january    investments risks and performance principal investment strategies the fund invests primarily in common and preferred stocks of nonus smallcap to midcap companies which the fund defines as companies whose market capitalization falls within the range of the morgan stanley capital international “msci” europe australasia and far east “eafe” smallmid “smid” index at the time of investment as of december   the market capitalization of the msci eafe smid companies ranged from  million to  billion with a weighted average level of  billion the fund invests no more than  of its net assets in us companies excluding high social impact and special equities investments see “special investment programs” in this prospectus the fund primarily holds stocks of companies in developed countries but as an internationally diverse fund it may invest in any geographic region of the world at least three different countries if a subadvisor deems the company attractive the stock selection process of each subadvisor does not utilize a predetermined geographic allocation and each subadvisor primarily uses a bottomup approach focused on fundamental analysis of stocks of individual companies across all geographic regions the advisor attempts to control the portfolio’s risk level and maximize the fund’s return potential relative to the msci eafe smid benchmark by balancing the risks and opportunities between the portion of the portfolio managed by each subadvisor the advisor may shift allocations between the subadvisors depending on market conditions the subadvisors’ respective style biases and performance opportunities the fund may invest up to  of its assets in securities of issuers in emerging market countries the securities in which the fund invests are often denominated and traded in foreign currencies the fund may enter into foreign currency derivatives including forward currency contracts and currency futures contracts to hedge foreign currency exposure the fund may invest in american depositary receipts “adrs” which may be sponsored or unsponsored and global depositary receipts “gdrs” attractive companies are identified through a combination of valuation and growth metrics that seeks to identify companies with a sustainable competitive advantage stocks chosen for the fund combine growth and value characteristics or offer the opportunity to buy growth at a reasonable price responsible investing  the fund seeks to invest in companies and other enterprises that demonstrate positive environmental social and governance performance as they address corporate responsibility and sustainability challenges calvert believes that there are longterm benefits in an investment philosophy that attaches material weight to the environment workplace relations human rights indigenous peoples’ rights community relations product safety and impact and corporate governance and business ethics calvert also believes that managing risks and opportunities related to these issues can contribute positively to company performance as well as to investment   performance over time the fund has sustainable and socially responsible investment criteria that reflect specific types of companies in which the fund seeks to invest and seeks to avoid investing investments are selected for financial soundness and evaluated according to the fund’s sustainable and socially responsible investment criteria investments must be consistent with the fund’s current investment criteria including financial sustainability and social responsibility factors the application of which is in the economic interest of the fund and its shareholders principal risks you could lose money on your investment in the fund or the fund could underperform because of the risks described below an investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency management risk individual investments of the fund may not perform as expected and the fund’s portfolio management practices may not achieve the desired result the advisor’s allocation of fund assets between the portion of the portfolio managed by each subadvisor may cause the fund to underperform stock market risk the market prices of stocks held by the fund may fall common stock risk although common stocks have a history of longterm growth in value their prices fluctuate based on changes in a company’s financial condition on overall market and economic conditions and on investors’ perception of a company’s wellbeing preferred stock risk the market value of preferred stock generally decreases when interest rates rise and is affected by the issuer’s ability to make payments on the preferred stock foreign securities risk investing in foreign securities involves additional risks relating to political social and economic developments abroad other risks result from differences between regulations that apply to us and foreign issuers and markets and the potential for foreign markets to be less liquid and more volatile than us markets foreign securities include adrs and gdrs unsponsored adrs involve additional risks because us reporting requirements do not apply and the issuing bank will recover shareholder distribution costs from movement of share prices and payment of dividends foreign currency risk securities that trade or are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates when the us dollar strengthens relative to a foreign currency the us dollar value of an investment denominated in that currency will typically fall gdrs can involve direct currency risk since unlike adrs they may not be us dollardenominated adrs indirectly bear currency risk because they represent an interest in securities that are not denominated in us dollars foreign currency hedge and derivatives risk transactions in foreign currency and foreign currency derivatives in connection  summary prospectus january   with the purchase and sale of investments in foreign markets may result in foreign currency exposure and the potential for losses due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates without regard to the quality or performance of the investment itself the use of foreign currency and foreign currency derivatives may also prevent the fund from realizing profits on favorable movements in exchange rates in addition the value of a foreign currency derivative may not correlate to the value of the underlying foreign currency to the extent expected derivative instruments are subject to a number of risks including the risk of changes in the market price of the underlying asset credit risk with respect to the counterparty and liquidity risk the fund’s use of certain derivatives may also have a leveraging effect which may increase the volatility of and reduce the fund’s returns or result in a loss that exceeds the value of the assets allocated to establish and maintain a position in the derivative instrument emerging markets risk the risks of investing in emerging market securities are greater than those of investing in securities of developed foreign countries these risks include volatile currency exchange rates periods of high inflation increased risk of default greater social economic and political uncertainty and instability less governmental supervision and regulation of securities markets weaker auditing and financial reporting standards lack of liquidity in the markets and the significantly smaller market capitalizations of emerging market issuers smallcap and midcap company risk prices of smallcap and midcap stocks can be more volatile than those of larger more established companies smallcap and midcap companies are more likely to have more limited product lines fewer capital resources and less depth of management than larger companies growth company risk prices of growth company securities may fall more than the overall equity markets due to changing economic political or market conditions or disappointing growth company earnings results growth stocks also generally lack the dividends of some value stocks that can cushion stock prices in a falling market value stock risk value stocks may perform differently from the stock market as a whole  the price of a value stock may take an unexpectedly long time to reflect the portfolio manager’s calculation of a stock’s intrinsic value or may not appreciate as anticipated the valueoriented investing approach may fall out of favor with investors from time to time and during those periods the fund may underperform other funds using different investment approaches multimanager risk while the advisor monitors the overall management of the fund the subadvisors make investment decisions independently from each other it is possible that the subadvisors’ investment styles may not always be complementary which could affect the performance and transaction costs of the fund responsible investing risk  investing primarily in securities that meet certain sustainable and socially responsible investment criteria carries the risk that under certain market conditions the fund may underperform funds that do not utilize such criteria when selecting investments the application of responsible   investment criteria may affect the fund’s exposure to certain sectors or types of investments and may impact the fund’s relative investment performance depending on whether such sectors or investments are in or out of favor in the market a company’s esg performance or the advisor’s assessment of a company’s esg performance may change over time which could cause the fund to temporarily hold securities that do not comply with the fund’s responsible investment principles in evaluating a company the advisor is dependent upon information and data that may be incomplete inaccurate or unavailable which could cause the advisor to incorrectly assess a company’s esg performance successful application of the fund’s responsible investment strategy will depend on the advisor’s skill in properly identifying and analyzing material esg issues performance the following bar chart and table show the fund’s annual returns and its longterm performance which give some indication of the risks of investing in the fund the bar chart shows how the performance of the class a shares has varied from year to year the table compares the fund’s performance over time with that of a benchmark and a performance average of
