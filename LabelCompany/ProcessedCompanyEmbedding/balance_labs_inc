finder request info get a quote  mass comparators from mettler toledo continuous innovation  accompanying your future what is the definition of a comparatora mass comparator or comparator balance is a balance with best possible resolution and repeatability allowing determining even the smallest difference is mass while windowrange mass comparators are purely used for mass calibration and mass determination fullrange mass comparators are versatile and can be used for weight determination but as well for general weighing applications where small samples meet large tare loads or the large and small amounts need to be combined in one weighing process contact your local mettler toledo representative to receive a gwp recommendation identifying the models suiting your personal needs  what makes mass calibration so differentin a regular weighing process the balanced is calibrated and the individual weighing are against zero g therefore the process is called absolute weighing with weight calibration which is a specific type of differential weighing the reference point is not the calibrated comparator balance its the reference weight against which the test weight is compared to reference weight need to be at least one weight class higher than the test weight each of the reference weights is again calibrated against another weight of higher class resulting to a traceability to the national prototype and finally to the international prototype of the kilogram at the bipm in paris france what applications are comparators used forthe primary applications where mass comparators are used for is mass calibration for lower class weights in particular m  f   classes manual mass comparators provide results of sufficient accuracy for weights of e or e class it is recommended to use either robotic or automated mass comparators as the measurement uncertainty is significantly lower this mainly due to the obsolescence of the operators influence in national metrology institutes nmis which strive continuously for measurements with smallest uncertainty vacuum or constant pressure mass comparators are utilized as these allow performing measurements at constant conditions influences such as geographic altitude air buoyancy or weather conditions can be eliminated national metrology institutes and metrology research center apply mass comparators for scientific research to measure smallest changes in mass or forcebesides the metrology application mass comparator are as well in use in other industries where the performance of a regular balance cannot meet the customer demand for these applications the comparators are referred to as higher performance balancessome of these industrial applications areformulation – if tolerance levels are low and the save weighing range of the balance does not fulfil the instrument demandsdifferential weighing applications – if the difference in mass is very small and an ordinary balance cannot provide trustworthy resultsgas filling – heavy gas bottles are filled with a small amount of precious reference gasscuffing – gears are analyzed on abrasion after the engine was run for a specified time in the lubricant of investigationforce measurements – measurements where an applied force is compensated by the weighing cell  what is the difference between a mass comparator and a balancemass comparators are of identical design and principle as an electronic balance what differentiates the balance to the comparator is the performance in particular the readability and repeatabilityprecision balance with  kg capacity and  mg readabilitymanual mass comparator  higher performance balance with  kg capacity and  mg readabilitywindowrange mass comparator  kg capacity and  mg readabilityautomated mass comparator  kg capacity and  mg readabilityconstant vacuum mass comparators  kg capacity and  mg readabilityregular laboratory balances are specified by the main properties repeatability rp eccentricity ec nonlinearity nl and sensitivity se as weight calibration is subject of differential weighing mass comparators are additionally specified with differential weighing repeatability aba rp aba  how to calibrate a mass comparatoraccording to regulations mass comparators in use for mass calibration do not need to be calibrated as the reference weight is calibrated and ensures for traceability to the bipm and the definition of the kilogram to protect your investment and ensure continuous constant measurement performance mettler toeldo recommends performing preventive maintenance on a routine basewhere mass comparators are in use in applications different than weight calibration it is crucial to apply existing quality standards on the xprc balances
