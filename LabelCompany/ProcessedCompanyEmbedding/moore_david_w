retired from the army after  years of service photo credit denise rule view original aberdeen proving ground md july    as a young infantry officer david m moore pieced together a new company of soldiers recruiting from all over europe to “build something from absolutely nothing” as a colonel he set up an information technology infrastructure to coincide with the troop surge in southern afghanistan  eventually forming the basis for unprecedented collaboration with us allies as leader of the army’s project manager for battle command he launched an ambitious strategy to “collapse” the boundaries between software applications providing commanders with a clearer picture of the fight the ability to start from scratch execute a plan and create something with lasting benefit to the army characterized moore’s year military career which came to a close on july   as he retired from the service “those are the kinds of things that make one most proud  where there’s little that was there you saw a need and you built something” moore said moore’s contributions were recognized during a retirement ceremony at aberdeen proving ground md where he received several awards and tributes including the presidential certificate of appreciation for service in the armed forces of the united states that followed a change of charter ceremony when moore formally passed leadership of his organization to col jonas vogelhut the event also marked the transition of pm battle command to pm mission command a name change that reflects the army’s most recent doctrine the centrality of the commander and the focus on fielding capabilities suitable for fullspectrum operations “colonel moore and his team were renowned for consistently going above and beyond original expectations to fulfill each soldier’s requirement” said brig gen n lee s price program executive officer for the army’s peo command control and communicationstactical or peo ct to which pm bc now pm mc is assigned “colonel moore’s vision initiative and innate leadership skills have transformed and streamlined the way future soldiers will collaborate on the battlefield” while his missions changed throughout the years  from deploying to the middle east to helping the army acquire bradley fighting vehicles to promoting agile software development  moore relied on the same guiding principles and “boots on the ground” beliefs his leadership precepts were inherited from his father retired lt gen hal moore whose service as a lieutenant colonel in vietnam was depicted in the movie “we were soldiers” among the “dad’s rules” that moore likes to hand out to his team there is always one more thing you can do to influence the situation in your favor three strikes and you’re not out there’s nothing wrong when there’s nothing wrong  except that there’s nothing wrong “those three core rules are what i’ve really tried to lead much of my life by” he said in an interview “all of my dad’s rules although oriented towards combat apply in life they don’t just apply to combat leadership but they apply to any kind of leadership” born in norway during one of his father’s assignments david moore would grow comfortable with the constant movement of army life korea california georgia virginia “i just enjoyed the life” he said when it came time to decide on his own military career path moore’s thoughts initially turned to the sky he was one week away from attending auburn university with plans to join the air force rotc when an opportunity to attend west point changed his plans his father and brother were west point graduates and the appeal to join the ranks of these alumni outweighed his initial impulse “i thought well i’ll fly in the army” moore said instead he was commissioned as a second lieutenant and started his career in the infantry serving with the rd armored division as a platoon leader and as the executive officer of e company st infantry  where he was “the fifth guy in” and built the rest of the company from the ground up moore took the most pride he said in his service with the nd airborne division where together with his men he jumped into panama and deployed to operations desert shield and desert storm after joining the army’s acquisition corps moore held several leadership positions culminating with his appointment as project manager for battle command in  he deployed to afghanistan where his mission quickly changed from an “outsider” conducting an initial assessment of brigade tactical communications to a key resource for the st airborne division as it struggled to build the signal and information technology infrastructure needed to support thousands of additional troops moore was awarded the bronze star for his efforts “when an  colonel walks into your area and says ‘i’m here to help’ most people run the other way” moore said but working with the unit they “found a much broader mission that needed to be accomplished i was able to lead them to a successful it expansion in rc regional command south and i’m very proud of that” moore’s “boots on the ground” observations in afghanistan also had a major impact on the creation of the afghan mission network which allows the us and coalition partners to share a common operating picture and exchange battlefield data on an unprecedented scale at the time of his deployment the amn was a concept backed by the us central command but “lacked the real materiel development legs to make it work” moore said he successfully urged the leadership of peo ct and the peo for intelligence electronic warfare and sensors known as iews to devote their resources to building the network infrastructure and migrating all appropriate data from the previous usonly network “as a result of the strong engineering teams and the materiel support now you have an afghan mission network in afghanistan that would not have occurred had those two organizations not committed the way they did two years ago” moore said “that shows the value of boots on the ground my dad’s big thing was ‘get boots on the ground you can’t understand the situation from the rear’” the afghanistan deployment was also a turning point for moore’s pursuit of the battle command collapse strategy the idea of “collapsing” maneuver fires sustainment air defense and airspace management applications into a common workstation had long been a stated goal of the organization but there was no decisive way forward moore’s observations in the field provided that clarity “the collapse strategy was really borne of going to afghanistan and realizing that the solutions we’re providing are good  they do well for their functional areas  but they also fundamentally disconnect the staff from each other and the commander from the staff because each person is fighting within their own system and they are not naturally linked at a higher level” moore said he decided that taking immediate action would be far better for those soldiers than continuing to analyze what the “perfect” architecture might be choosing command post of the future or cpof as the foundation moore and his team moved forward with integrating the different software applications while at the same time crafting a battle command web version to reduce the hardware footprint “the strategy was coupled with the demand to do something now” he said “we wanted to show progress and we wanted people to see that something positive was occurring so they could jump on and reinforce the success” adopting agile methodologies including “scrum sessions” that brought together users from the field with software developers to directly implement feedback pm battle command moved ahead with execution today the first release of battle command collapse is getting a test drive with soldiers from the nd brigade combat team st armored division as part of the network integration evaluation at white sands missile range nm the next release is scheduled for october and the plan remains fundamentally on track moore said quoting retired gen eric k shinseki the former army chief of staff who pushed to implement the stryker armored vehicle “he would always say ‘i want irreversible momentum now’” moore said as the army’s momentum shifts from “battle command” to “mission command” both the collapse strategy and agile software development are supporting that change with all mission command applications sharing data in a “collapsed” environment a commander will prepare for battle with a single view of the fires logistics air and ground pictures this data will enhance how commanders collaborate with their counterparts allowing them to make more informed decisions as the battle progresses moore said software that is flexible and scalable to a broad spectrum of operations also supports the goals of mission command he said “we cannot design systems that are good for only a small niche of these missions” he said “so we have to continually assess how we deploy software is it agile is it flexible can it do things on the fly that we didn’t anticipate if we had to build a branch or a sequel off of a software product how quickly could we do that because guys’ lives may be at stake based on how quickly we can adjust our software to meet the needs of the commander” none of moore’s achievements can compete with what makes him the most proud which is his family he and his wife teresa have three daughters ages   and eight “outside of the military what makes me most proud is to see my kids grow up with a brain frankly  able to think for themselves and work for themselves” he said with moore’s retirement his family will leave fort monmouth nj for civilian life in alabama where moore’s father lives he has not finalized his future plans but said he would like to continue to contribute to the army’s mission “i’m really proud of the people who have made battle command i think truly the best acquisition organization in the army” he said “it’s a great job to have and a tremendously hard job to walk away from” related links peo ct website peo ct on facebook army consolidating battle command applications armymil science and technology news

in mexico on august   contents  plot  cast  reception  see also  references  external links plotedit kate steve mick and jenn jones move into an upscale suburb under the pretense of being a typical family relocating because of the changing nature of kates and steves careers in reality kate is the leader of a team of stealth marketers professional salespeople who disguise product placement as a daily routine their clothing accessories furniture and even food are carefully planned and stocked by various companies to create visibility in a desirable consumer market while kates team is highly effective steve is new to the team jenn is a closet nymphomaniac with a penchant for hitting on her fake fathers and a day review is fast approaching the team quickly ingratiates itself into the community slowly shifting from displaying products to recommending them soon local stores and businesses are stocking products based on the joneses trendsetting styles however at the end of the day review steve discovers that he has the lowest sales numbers of the team and kates job is endangered unless he can get his numbers up before the next review in  days eventually steve begins to find a sales tactic that works by playing on the fears of his neighbors and sympathizing with their dull repetitive unfulfilled careers as someone who is frustrated with his job and disconnected from his fake family steve turned to their products to keep himself entertained when he recognizes this same pattern in his neighbors his sales begin to steadily increase as he starts pitching products as the solution for suburban boredom and generating product buzz through unwitting ropers the teams dynamics become more complicated when kate applies herself to the technique as well realizing that they can boost sales by perfecting their fake family dynamic to sell the image of a lifestyle the lines between acting and reality start to break down things also get more complicated when mick finds himself growing closer to an unpopular girl at the high school naomi christine evangelista in whom he can confide while jenns flirtation with alex bayner robert pralgo one of the men in the neighborhood raises the suspicions of the neighbors the teams cover is almost blown at several times once when an old acquaintance of steves recognizes him at a restaurant again when jenns indiscretions nearly expose her real age and after a party where mick markets alcohol to minors eventually each member of the team finds that the constant pretense slowly erodes their individual desires jenns dreams of running away with a rich older man come to a close when she realizes that she was being used by alex mick has a crisis of conscience when naomi gets into a car accident after drinking too much of a wine cooler that the family was marketing to teens worse when he makes a pass at naomis brother he punches mick in rage after creating nearly recordbreaking numbers steve is offered the chance to join an icon unit alone he refuses knowing that this is kates dream and because he believes that the family can do it together when steves closest friend in the community larry gary cole reveals that hes going to lose his house because hes overextended his credit steve tries again to see if kate wants something more than a pretend marriage she rebuffs him and the next day steve discovers to his horror that larry has committed suicide over the debts griefstricken steve confesses to the community about the real nature of his job with their covers blown the rest of the joneses leave quickly and are reassigned to a new home steve refuses the offer to join an icon cell and tracks the family down to their new location there he reunites with kate and tries one last time to convince her to leave though hesitant she follows him out of town and agrees to meet his family in arizona castedit david duchovny as steve jones demi moore as kate jones amber heard as jenn jones ben hollingsworth as mick
