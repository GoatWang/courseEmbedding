frequent flier by kim metcalfkupres feb  4 continue reading the main story share this page continue reading the main story photo kim metcalfkupres chief marketing officer at johnson controls in davos switzerland at the world economic forum i’ve traveled most of my career but until about five years ago most of my business trips were domestic i’m starting my th year with johnson controls and as its chief marketing officer now most of my trips are international whether i like flying is debatable it’s probably fairer to say that i’ve gotten used to flying at one time i was a horrible “whiteknuckle” flier and now i’m just kind of numb to it takeoffs and landings don’t worry me as much anymore and i don’t even think twice about turbulencedespite flying so much i don’t seem to have misfortune when traveling for work actually i may prefer airline turbulence to driving with my husband on a trip to maui for a mechanical contractors convention i had the opportunity to bring my family along so they could experience hawaii for the first time we arrived during a notsopleasant rainy season but still decided to make the best of our time and exploremy husband was behind the wheel of our rental car and we drove up a hillside to see a volcano we were ducking in and out of oncoming traffic and he eventually pulled over on the edge of a cliff unfortunately one of the car’s rear tires was partly hanging off the edge of that cliff i love my husband dearly but there was really no polite way to tell him “dear we are hanging off a cliff” everything is relative and considering that my husband nearly drove us off a cliff i much prefer the planei’m very polite to seatmates but not much of a talker but when i was flying back to chicago from china a gentleman struck up a conversation with me he was intrigued that a woman who happened to be me was reading technical industry trade publications on cars and batteries we started talking and i explained that my interest in this literature stemmed from my job being polite i asked him what he did for a living he was a physicist and somehow we landed on a subject that actually piqued my interest — dark matter as the daughter of a physics and chemistry teacher dark matter is something i’d always been interested in and didn’t quite understand this gentleman didn’t help me understand it any betterafter about  minutes of conversation with me saying very little i had heard more about dark matter than i’d anticipated it still made no sense i thought i was asking decent questions like “what is dark matter” his answer “we really don’t know” it is kind of tough to come up with a question after that but i tried something logical if you don’t know what it is how do you study it his answer “we don’t study it” i must have looked very confused because he clarified by saying that scientists study things around it every time i asked something the answers became less satisfying i’m a good listener and i like talking about technical subjects i like learning new things too i was done with dark matterhe was very proud of his work as i’m sure he should be he was part of a team on some big government grant studying dark matter though i’m not sure because i didn’t understand the specifics i eventually excused myself and hid out in the restroom for a while which is something i have never done before when i got back to my seat i put in my earbuds for the rest of my 4hour flight i had learned enough about dark matter continue reading the main story we’re interested in your feedback on this page tell us
