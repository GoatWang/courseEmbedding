operating activities   the fund commenced investment operations on february   the fund commenced trading on the nyse arca inc the “nyse arca” on february   and trades under the symbol “rise”   sit is paid a fee equal to  per annum effective january   of the value of the fund’s average daily net assets for its services as the commodity trading advisor to the fund payable by the fund sit is a subsidiary of sit investment associates inc   the fund’s investment objective is to profit from rising interest rates by tracking the performance of a portfolio the “benchmark portfolio” consisting of exchange traded futures contracts and options on futures on   and  year us treasury securities “treasury instruments” weighted to achieve a targeted negative year average effective portfolio duration the “benchmark component instruments” the fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing in the benchmark component instruments currently constituting the benchmark portfolio the benchmark portfolio is maintained by sit and will be rebalanced reconstituted or both monthly typically on the  th of each month and on the next business day if the  th is a holiday weekend or other day on which the national exchanges are closed to maintain a negative year average effective duration the benchmark portfolio and the fund will each maintain a short position in treasury instruments the fund does not use futures contracts or options to obtain leveraged investment results the fund will not invest in swaps or other over the counter derivative instruments   the weighting of the treasury instruments constituting the benchmark component instruments will be based on each maturity’s duration contribution the expected range for the duration weighted percentage of the  year and  year maturity treasury instruments will be from  to  the expected range for the duration weighted percentage of the year maturity treasury instruments will be from  to  the relative weightings of the benchmark component instruments will be shifted between maturities when there are material changes in the shape of the yield curve for example if the federal reserve began raising short term interest rates more than long term interest rates in such an instance sit which maintains the benchmark portfolio will elect to increase the weightings of the  year and reduce the weighting in the year maturity conversely sit will do the opposite if the federal reserve began raising long term interest rates more than short term interest rates reconstitution and rebalancing each will occur monthly on the th except for as noted above or if there are radical changes in the yield curve such that effective duration is outside of a range from negative nine to negative year average effective duration in which case sit will adjust the maturities of the treasury instruments before the next expected monthly reconstitution               etf managers group commodity trust i notes to financial statements march   unaudited continued   the sponsor anticipates that approximately  to  of the fund’s assets will be used as payment for or collateral for treasury instruments in order to collateralize its treasury instrument positions the fund will hold such assets from which it will post margin to its futures commission merchant “fcm” sg americas securities llc in an amount equal to the margin required by the relevant exchange and transfer to its fcm any additional amounts that may be separately required by the fcm when establishing positions in treasury instruments the fund will be required to deposit initial margin with a value of approximately  to  of the value of each treasury instrument position at the time it is established these margin requirements are subject to change from time to time by the exchange or the fcm on a daily basis the fund will be obligated to pay or entitled to receive variation margin in an amount equal to the change in the daily settlement level of its treasury instruments positions any assets not required to be posted as margin with the fcm will be held at the fund’s administrator in cash or cash equivalents as discussed below   the benchmark portfolio will be invested in benchmark component instruments and rebalanced as noted above to maintain a negative average effective portfolio duration of approximately  years duration is a measure of estimated price sensitivity relative to changes in interest rates portfolios with longer durations are typically more sensitive to changes in interest rates for example if interest rates rise by  the market value of a security with an effective duration of  years would decrease by  with all other factors being constant and likewise the market value of a security with an effective duration of negative  years would increase by  with all other factors being constant the correlation between duration and price sensitivity is greater for securities rated investmentgrade than it is for securities rated below investmentgrade   duration estimates are based on assumptions by sit and are subject to a number of limitations effective duration is calculated based on historical price changes of us treasuries and treasury instruments held by the benchmark portfolio and therefore is a more accurate estimate of price sensitivity provided interest rates remain within their historical range investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise the risk is usually greater for longerterm debt securities   the fund will incur certain expenses in connection with its operations the fund will hold cash or cash equivalents such as us treasuries or other high credit quality shortterm fixedincome or similar securities for direct investment or as collateral for the treasury instruments and for other liquidity purposes and to meet redemptions that may be necessary on an ongoing basis these expenses and income from the cash and cash equivalent holdings may cause imperfect correlation between changes in the fund’s net asset value “nav” and changes in the benchmark portfolio because the benchmark portfolio does not reflect expenses or income   the fund seeks to trade its positions prior to maturity accordingly natural market forces may cost the fund while rebalancing each time the fund seeks to reconstitute its positions barring movement in the underlying securities the futures and option prices may be higher or lower such differences in price barring a movement in the price of the underlying security will constitute “roll yield” and may inhibit the fund’s ability to achieve its investment objective   several factors determine the total return from investing in a futures contract position one factor that impacts the total return that will result from investing in near month futures contracts and “rolling” those contracts forward each month is the price relationship between the current near month contract and the next month contract   when the fund purchases an option that expires “out of the money” the fund will realize a loss the fund may not be able to invest the its assets in futures and options contracts having an aggregate notional amount exactly equal to that which is required to achieve a negative year average effective duration for example as standardized contracts us treasury futures contracts are denominated in specific dollar amounts and the fund’s nav and the proceeds from the sale of a creation basket are unlikely to be an exact multiple of the amounts of those contracts as a result in such circumstances the fund may be better able to achieve the exact amount of exposure desired through the use of other investments   the sponsor will close existing positions when it determines it would be appropriate to do so and reinvest the proceeds in other positions positions may also be closed out to meet orders for redemption baskets               etf managers group commodity trust i notes to

which that futures contract trades   g financial instruments and fair value   the fund discloses the fair value of its investments in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb fair value measurement and disclosure guidance which requires a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value the disclosure requirements establish a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between  market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from sources independent to the fund observable inputs and  the fund’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available under the circumstances unobservable inputs the three levels defined by the disclosure requirements hierarchy are as follows   level i quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date   level ii inputs other than quoted prices included within level i that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly level ii inputs include the following quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means marketcorroborated inputs   level iii unobservable pricing input at the measurement date for the asset or liability unobservable inputs shall be used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available               etf managers group commodity trust i notes to financial statements march   unaudited continued   in some instances the inputs used to measure fair value might fall in different levels of the fair value hierarchy the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls shall be determined based on the lowest input level that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety   fair value measurements also require additional disclosure when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased as well as when circumstances indicate that a

not aware of any tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change in the next twelve months on an ongoing basis

seeking to achieve the fund’s investment objective sit uses a mathematical approach to investing using this approach sit determines the type quantity and mix of investment positions that sit believes in combination should produce returns consistent with the fund’s objective   all open derivative positions at march   and june   for the fund are disclosed in the schedules of investments and the notional value of these open positions relative to the shareholders’ capital of the fund is generally representative of the notional value of open positions to shareholders’ capital throughout the reporting periods for the fund the volume associated with derivative positions varies on a daily basis as the fund transacts in derivative contracts in order to achieve the appropriate exposure as expressed in notional value in comparison to shareholders’ capital consistent with the fund’s investment objective   following is a description of the derivative instruments used by the fund during the reporting period including the primary underlying risk exposures   c futures contracts   the fund enters into futures contracts to gain exposure to changes in the value of the benchmark portfolio a futures contract obligates the seller to deliver and the purchaser to accept the future cash settlement of a specified quantity and type of a treasury futures contract at a specified time and place the contractual obligations of a buyer or seller of a treasury futures contract may generally be satisfied by making an offsetting sale or purchase of an identical futures contract on the same or linked exchange before the designated date of delivery   upon entering into a futures contract the fund is required to deposit and maintain as collateral at least such initial margin as required by the exchange on which the transaction is affected the initial margin is segregated as cash held by broker as disclosed in the statements of financial condition and is restricted as to its use pursuant to the futures contract the fund agrees to receive from or pay to the broker an amount of cash equal to the daily fluctuation in value of the futures contract such receipts or payments are known as variation margin and are recorded by the fund as unrealized gains or losses the fund will realize a gain or loss upon closing a futures transaction   futures contracts involve to varying degrees elements of market risk specifically treasury price risk and exposure to loss in excess of the amount of variation margin the face or contract amounts reflect the extent of the total exposure the fund has in the particular classes of instruments additional risks associated with the use of futures contracts include imperfect correlation between movements in the price of the futures contracts and the market value of the underlying securities and the possibility of an illiquid market for a futures contract with futures contracts there is minimal counterparty risk to the fund since futures contracts are exchangetraded and the exchange’s clearinghouse as counterparty to all exchangetraded futures contracts guarantees the futures contracts against default                etf managers group commodity

nav of the fund’s shares relates directly to the value of the us treasuries cash and cash equivalents held by the fund and the portfolio’s negative effective duration established and maintained through the fund’s investment in treasury instruments fluctuations in the prices of these assets could materially adversely affect the value and performance of an investment in the fund’s shares past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results all or substantially all of an investment in the fund could be lost   investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise however the fund attempts to maintain a portfolio with a negative effective duration and therefore anticipates that an increase in interest rates may increase the fund’s value and a decrease in rates may lower the fund’s value the nav of the fund’s shares relates directly to the value of us treasuries and treasury instruments held by the fund which are materially impacted by interest rate movements the magnitude of the impact on value from a change in interest rates is often greater for longerterm fixed income than shorterterm securities interest rates have been near historic lows since the market events of  and may remain low   interest rate movements are heavily influenced by the action of the board of governors of the federal reserve system and other central banks their actions are based on judgments and policies which involve numerous political and economic factors which are unpredictable recent interest rate and monetary policies have been unprecedented and may continue to be so               etf managers group commodity trust i notes to financial statements march   unaudited continued   the fund attempts to track a portfolio benchmark the performance of the fund may not closely track the performance of the benchmark portfolio for a variety of reasons for example the fund incurs operating expenses and portfolio transaction costs not

contents of its benchmark at all times or may hold securities not included in its benchmark   the fund invests in treasury instruments and us treasuries with exposure to different maturity dates generally the fund’s exposure to securities with maturities of  and  years will be greater than its exposure to securities with maturities of  years interest rates do not change uniformly for us treasuries of different maturities and therefore if interest rates rise the investment performance of the fund will be impacted by the fund’s current maturity exposure which may be different from the expectations of the sponsor and investors in the fund at any time the fund’s maturity exposure may not be optimal with respect to a movement in interest rates which would negatively impact performance   b liquidity risk   in certain circumstances such as the disruption of the orderly markets for the futures contracts or financial instruments in which the fund invests the fund might not be able to dispose of certain holdings quickly or at prices that represent what the market value may have been in an orderly market futures and option positions cannot always be liquidated at the desired price it is difficult to execute a trade at a specific price when there is a relatively small volume of buy and sell orders in a market a market disruption can also make it difficult to liquidate a position the large size of the positions that the fund may acquire increases the risk of illiquidity both by making its positions more difficult to liquidate and by potentially increasing losses while trying to do so such a situation may prevent the fund from limiting losses realizing gains or achieving a high correlation with the benchmark portfolio    profit and loss allocations and distributions

targeted negative year average effective portfolio duration the “benchmark component instruments”               the investment objective of the fund   the fund’s investment objective is to profit from rising interest rates by tracking the performance of the benchmark portfolio consisting of exchange traded futures contracts and options on futures on   and year us treasury securities weighted to achieve a targeted negative year average effective portfolio duration the fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing in the benchmark component instruments currently constituting the benchmark portfolio   the benchmark portfolio   the benchmark portfolio is maintained by sit fixed income advisors ii llc “sit” which also serves as the fund’s commodity trading advisor the benchmark portfolio will be rebalanced reconstituted or both monthly typically on the th of each month or on the next business day if the th is a holiday weekend or other day on which the national exchanges are closed to maintain a negative year average effective duration the benchmark portfolio and the fund will each maintain a short position in treasury instruments the fund does not use futures contracts or options to obtain leveraged investment results   the fund will not invest in swaps or other overthecounter derivative instruments   the benchmark component instruments currently constituting the

contribution the expected range for the duration weighted percentage of the year and year maturity treasury instruments will be from  to  the expected range for the duration weighted percentage of the year maturity treasury instruments will be from  to  the relative weightings of the benchmark component instruments will be shifted between maturities when there are material changes in the shape of the yield curve for example if the federal reserve began raising short term interest rates more than long term interest rates in such an instance sit which maintains the benchmark portfolio will increase the weightings of the year and reduce the weighting in the year maturity treasury instruments conversely sit will do the opposite if the federal reserve began raising long term interest rates more than short term interest rates reconstitution and rebalancing each will occur monthly on the th except for as noted above or if there are radical changes in the yield curve such that effective duration is outside of a range from negative nine to negative year average effective duration in which case sit will adjust the maturities of the treasury instruments before the next expected monthly reconstitution   the sponsor anticipates that approximately  to  of the fund’s assets will be used as payment for or collateral for treasury instruments in order to collateralize its treasury instrument positions the fund will hold such assets from which it will post margin to its fcm in an amount equal to the margin required by the relevant exchange and transfer to its fcm any additional amounts that may be separately required by the fcm when establishing positions in treasury instruments the fund will be required to deposit initial margin with a value of approximately  to  of the value of each treasury instrument position at the time it is established these margin requirements are subject to change from time to time by the exchange or the fcm on a daily basis the fund will be obligated to pay or entitled to receive variation margin in an amount equal to the change in the daily settlement level of its treasury instruments positions any assets not required to be posted as margin with the fcm will be held at the fund’s administrator in cash or cash equivalents as discussed below               the benchmark portfolio will be invested in benchmark component instruments and rebalanced as noted above to maintain a negative average effective portfolio duration of approximately  years duration is a measure of estimated price sensitivity relative to changes in interest rates portfolios with longer durations are typically more sensitive to changes in interest rates for example if interest rates rise by  the market value of a security with an effective duration of  years would decrease by  with all other factors being constant and likewise the market value of a security with an effective duration of negative  years would increase by  with all other factors being constant duration estimates are based on assumptions by sit and are subject to a number of limitations duration is a more accurate estimate of price sensitivity provided interest rate changes are small and occur equally in shortterm and longterm securities investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise the risk is usually greater for longerterm debt securities   the fund will incur certain expenses in connection with its operations the fund will hold cash or cash equivalents such as us treasuries or other high credit quality shortterm fixedincome or similar securities for direct investment or as collateral for the treasury instruments and for other liquidity purposes and to meet redemptions that may be necessary on an ongoing basis these expenses and income from the cash and cash equivalent holdings may cause imperfect correlation between changes in the fund’s nav and changes in the benchmark portfolio because the benchmark portfolio

and options contracts of  and the net investment loss of    calculating nav   the fund’s nav is calculated by     · taking the current market value of its total assets     · subtracting any liabilities and     · dividing that total by the total number of outstanding shares               the administrator calculates the nav of the fund once each nyse arca trading day the nav for a particular trading day is released after  pm new york time trading during the core trading session on the nyse arca typically closes at  pm new york time the administrator uses the cme closing price determined at the earlier of the close of the cme or  pm new york time for the contracts traded on the cme but calculates or determines the value of all other fund investments using market quotations if available or other information customarily used to determine the fair value of such investments as of the earlier of the close of the nyse arca or  pm new york time in accordance with the current administrative agency agreement among us bancorp fund services the fund and the sponsor “other information” customarily used in determining fair value includes information consisting of market data in the relevant market supplied by one or more third parties including without limitation relevant rates prices yields yield curves volatilities spreads correlations or other market data in the relevant market or information of the types described above from internal sources if that information is of the same type used by the fund in the regular course of its business for the valuation of similar transactions the information may include costs of funding to the extent costs of funding are not and would not be a component of the other information being utilized third parties supplying quotations or market data may include without limitation dealers in the relevant markets endusers of the relevant product information vendors brokers and other sources of market information   in addition in order to provide updated information relating to the fund for use by investors and market professionals the nyse arca calculates and disseminates throughout the core trading session on each trading day an updated indicative fund value the indicative fund value is calculated by using the prior day’s closing nav per share of the fund as a base and updating that value throughout the trading day to reflect changes in the most recently reported trade price for the futures and options held by the fund traded on the cme the indicative fund value share basis disseminated during nyse arca core trading session hours should not be viewed as an actual real time update of the nav because the nav is calculated only once at the end of each trading day based upon the relevant end of day values of the fund’s investments   the indicative fund value is disseminated on a per share basis every  seconds during regular nyse arca core trading session hours of  am new york time to  pm new york time the normal trading hours of the cme are  am new york time to  pm new york time this means that there is a gap in time at the beginning and the end of each day during which the fund’s shares are traded on the nyse arca but realtime cme trading prices for contracts traded on the cme are not available during such gaps in time the indicative fund value will be calculated based on the end of day price of such contracts from the cme’s immediately preceding trading session in addition other investments and us treasuries held by the fund will be valued by the administrator using rates and points received from clientapproved third party vendors such as reuters and wm company and advisor quotes these investments will not be included in the indicative fund value   the nyse arca disseminates the indicative fund value through the facilities of ctacq high speed lines in addition the indicative fund value is published on the nyse arca’s website and is available through online information services such as bloomberg and reuters   dissemination of the indicative fund value provides additional information that is not otherwise available to the public and is useful to investors and market professionals in connection with the trading of the fund shares on the nyse arca investors and market professionals are able throughout the trading day to compare the market price of the fund and the indicative fund value if the market price of the fund shares diverges significantly from the indicative fund value market professionals will have an incentive to execute arbitrage trades for example if the fund appears to be trading at a discount compared to the indicative fund value a market professional could buy the fund shares on the nyse arca and take the opposite position in treasury instruments such arbitrage trades can tighten the tracking between the market price of the fund and the indicative fund value and thus can be beneficial to all market participants   critical accounting policies   the fund’s critical accounting policies are as follows   preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires the application of appropriate accounting rules and guidance as well as the use of estimates the fund’s application of these policies involves judgments and the use of estimates actual results may differ from the estimates used and such differences could be material the fund holds a significant portion of its assets in futures contracts and a money market fund which are held at fair value   the fund calculates its net asset value as of the nav calculation time as described above               the values which are used by the fund for its treasury instruments are provided by its commodity broker who uses market prices when available in addition the fund estimates interest income on a daily basis using prevailing rates earned on its cash and cash equivalents these estimates are adjusted to the actual amount received on a monthly basis and the difference if any is not considered material   credit risk   when the fund enters into benchmark component instruments it will be exposed to the credit risk that the counterparty will not be able to meet its obligations for purposes of credit risk the counterparty for the benchmark component instruments traded on the cme and other futures exchanges is the clearinghouse associated with those exchanges in general clearinghouses are backed by their members who may be required to share in the financial burden resulting from the nonperformance of one of their members which should significantly reduce credit risk there can be no assurance that any counterparty clearinghouse or their financial backers will satisfy their obligations to the fund   the sponsor will attempt to minimize certain of these market and credit risks by normally     · executing and clearing trades with creditworthy counterparties as determined by the sponsor   · limiting the outstanding amounts due from counterparties of the fund   · not posting margin directly with a counterparty   · limiting the amount of margin or premium posted at the fcm and   · ensuring that deliverable contracts are not held to such a date when delivery of an underlying asset could be called for   the commodity exchange act “cea” requires all fcms such as the fund’s clearing broker to meet and maintain specified fitness and financial requirements to segregate customer funds from proprietary funds and account separately for all customers’ funds and positions and to maintain specified books and records open to inspection by the staff of the cftc the cftc has similar authority over introducing brokers or persons who solicit or accept orders for commodity interest trades but who do not accept margin deposits for the execution of trades the cea authorizes the cftc to regulate trading by fcms and by their officers and directors permits the cftc to require action by exchanges in the event of market emergencies and establishes an administrative procedure under which customers may institute complaints for damages arising from alleged violations of the cea the cea also gives the states powers to enforce its provisions and the regulations of the cftc   on november   the cftc published final regulations that require enhanced customer protections risk management programs internal monitoring and controls capital and liquidity standards customer disclosures and auditing and examination programs for fcms the rules are intended to afford greater assurances to market participants that customer segregated funds and secured amounts are protected customers are provided with appropriate notice of the risks of futures trading and of the fcms with which they may choose to do business fcms are monitoring and managing risks in a robust manner the capital and liquidity of fcms are strengthened to safeguard the continued operations and the auditing and examination programs of the cftc and the selfregulatory organizations are monitoring the activities of fcms in a thorough manner   liquidity and capital resources   the fund does not anticipate making use of borrowings or other lines of credit to meet its obligations the fund meets its liquidity needs in the normal course of business from the proceeds of the sale of its investments or from the cash cash equivalents andor the collateralizing treasury securities that it holds the fund’s liquidity needs include redeeming its shares providing margin deposits for existing benchmark component instruments the purchase of additional benchmark component instruments and paying expenses   the fund generates cash primarily from i the sale of creation baskets and ii interest earned on cash cash equivalents and their investments in collateralizing treasury securities generally all of the net assets of the fund are allocated to trading in benchmark component instruments most of the assets of the fund are held in treasury instruments cash andor cash equivalents that could or are used as margin or collateral for trading in benchmark component instruments the percentage that such assets bear to the total net assets will vary from period to period as the market values of the benchmark component instruments change interest earned on interestbearing assets of the fund is paid to the fund               the investments of the fund in benchmark component instruments could be subject to periods of illiquidity because of market conditions regulatory considerations and other reasons such conditions could prevent the fund from promptly liquidating a position in benchmark component instruments   market risk   trading in benchmark component instruments such as futures contracts will involve the fund entering into contractual commitments to purchase or sell specific amounts of instruments at a specified date in the future the gross or face amount of the contracts is expected to significantly exceed the future cash requirements of the fund as the fund intends to close out any open positions prior to the contractual expiration date as a result the fund’s market risk is the risk of loss arising from the decline in value of the contracts not from the need to make delivery under the contracts the fund considers the “fair value” of derivative instruments to be the unrealized gain or loss on the contracts the market risk associated with the commitment by the fund to purchase a specific contract will be limited to the aggregate face amount of the contracts held   the exposure of the fund to market risk will depend on a number of factors including the markets for the specific instrument the volatility of interest rates and foreign exchange rates the liquidity of the instrumentspecific market and the relationships among the contracts held by the fund   regulatory environment   the regulation of futures markets futures contracts and futures exchanges has historically been comprehensive the cftc and the exchanges are authorized to take extraordinary actions in the event of a market emergency including for example the retroactive implementation of speculative position limits increased margin requirements the establishment of daily price limits and the suspension of trading   the regulation of commodity interest transactions in the united states is a rapidly changing area of law and is subject to ongoing modification by governmental and judicial action considerable regulatory attention has been focused on nontraditional investment pools that are publicly distributed in the united states there is a possibility of future regulatory changes within the united states altering perhaps to a material extent the nature of an investment in the fund or the ability of the fund to continue to implement its investment strategy the effect of any future regulatory change on the fund is impossible to predict but could be substantial and adverse   the cftc possesses exclusive jurisdiction to regulate the activities of commodity pool operators and has adopted regulations with respect to the activities of those persons andor entities under the cea a registered cpo such as the sponsor is required to make annual filings with the cftc describing its organization capital structure management and controlling persons in addition the cea authorizes the cftc to require and review books and records of and documents prepared by registered cpos pursuant to this authority the cftc requires cpos to keep accurate current and orderly records for each pool that they operate the cftc may suspend the registration of a commodity pool operator  if the cftc finds that the operator’s trading practices tend to disrupt orderly market conditions  if any controlling person of the operator is subject to an order of the cftc denying such person trading privileges on any exchange and  in certain other circumstances suspension restriction or termination of the sponsor’s registration as a commodity pool operator would prevent it until that registration were to be reinstated from managing the fund and might result in the termination of the fund if a successor sponsor is not elected pursuant to the trust agreement   the fund’s investors are afforded prescribed rights for reparations under the cea investors may also be able to maintain a private right of action for violations of the cea the cftc has adopted rules implementing the reparation provisions of the cea which provide that any person may file a complaint for a reparations award with the cftc for violation of the cea against a floor broker or an fcm introducing broker commodity trading advisor cpo and their respective associated persons                pursuant to authority in the cea the nfa has been formed and registered with the cftc as a registered futures association at the present time the nfa is the only selfregulatory organization for commodity interest professionals other than futures exchanges the cftc has delegated to the nfa responsibility for the registration of cpos and fcms and their respective associated persons the sponsor and the fund’s clearing broker are members of the nfa as such they will be subject to nfa standards relating to fair trade practices financial condition and consumer protection the nfa also arbitrates disputes between members and their customers and conducts registration and fitness screening of applicants for membership and audits of its existing members neither the trust nor the fund is required to become a member of the nfa   the regulations of the cftc and the nfa prohibit any representation by a person registered with the cftc or by any member of the nfa that registration with the cftc or membership in the nfa in any respect indicates that the cftc or the nfa has approved or endorsed that person or that person’s trading program or objectives the registrations and memberships of the parties described in this summary must not be considered as constituting any such approval or endorsement likewise no futures exchange has given or will give any similar approval or endorsement   futures exchanges in the united states are subject to varying degrees of regulation under the cea depending on whether such exchange is a designated contract market exempt board of trade or electronic trading facility clearing organizations are also subject to the cea and the rules and regulations adopted thereunder as administered by the cftc the cftc’s function is to implement the cea’s objectives of preventing price manipulation and excessive speculation and promoting orderly and efficient commodity interest markets in addition the various exchanges and clearing organizations themselves exercise regulatory and supervisory authority over their member firms   the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” was enacted in response to the economic crisis of  and  and it significantly altered the regulatory regime to which the securities and commodities markets are subject to date the cftc has issued proposed versions of all of the rules it is required to promulgate under the doddfrank act and it continues to issue proposed versions of additional rules that it has authority to promulgate the provisions of the new law include the requirement that position limits be established on a wide range of commodity interests including agricultural energy and metalbased commodity futures contracts options on such futures contracts and cleared and uncleared swaps that are economically equivalent to such futures contracts and options new registration and recordkeeping requirements for swap market participants capital and margin requirements for “swap dealers” and “major swap participants” as determined by the new law and applicable regulations and the mandatory use of clearinghouse mechanisms for sufficiently standardized swap transactions that were historically entered into in the overthecounter market   in addition to the rules and regulations imposed under the doddfrank act certain participants that are european banks may also be subject to european market infrastructure regulation these regulations have not yet been fully implemented   current rules and regulations under the doddfrank act require enhanced customer protections risk management programs internal monitoring and controls capital and liquidity standards customer disclosures and auditing and examination programs for fcms the rules are intended to afford greater assurances to market participants that customer segregated funds and secured amounts are protected customers are provided with appropriate notice of the risks of futures trading and of the fcms with which they may choose to do business fcms are monitoring and managing risks in a robust manner the capital and liquidity of fcms are strengthened to safeguard the continued operations and the auditing and examination programs of the cftc and the selfregulatory organizations are monitoring the activities of fcms in a thorough manner               the effect of future regulatory change on the fund and the exact timing of such changes is impossible to predict but it may be substantial and adverse specifically the new law the rules that have been promulgated thereunder and the rules that are expected to be promulgated may negatively impact the ability of the fund to meet its investment objectives either through position limits or requirements imposed on it andor on their counterparties in particular new position limits imposed on the fund or any counterparties may impact the ability of the fund to invest in a manner that most efficiently meets its investment objective new requirements including capital imposed on the counterparties of the fund may increase the cost of the fund’s investments and doing business   in addition considerable regulatory attention has recently been focused on nontraditional publicly distributed investment pools such as the fund furthermore various national governments have expressed concern regarding the disruptive effects of speculative trading in certain commodity markets and the need to regulate the derivatives markets in general the effect of any future regulatory change on the fund is impossible to predict but could be substantial and adverse   management believes that as of march   it had fulfilled in a timely manner all doddfrank reporting requirements both historical and ongoing for the categories under which the firm operates and is registered   off balance sheet financing   as of march   neither the trust nor the fund has any loan guarantees credit support or other offbalance sheet arrangements of any kind other than agreements entered into in the normal course of business which may include indemnification provisions relating to certain risks service providers undertake in performing services which are in the best interests of the fund while the exposure of the fund under these indemnification provisions cannot be estimated they are not expected to have a material impact on the financial position of the fund   redemption basket obligation   other than as necessary to meet the investment objective of the fund and pay the contractual obligations described below the fund will require liquidity to redeem redemption baskets the fund intends to satisfy this obligation through the transfer of cash of the fund generated if necessary through the sale of treasury instruments in an amount proportionate to the number of shares being redeemed   contractual obligations   the fund pays the sponsor an annual management fee monthly in arrears in an amount calculated as the greater of  of its average daily net assets or as of january    the “management fee” the management fee is paid in consideration of the sponsor’s advisory services to the fund additionally sit receives an annual fee monthly in arrears for its services equal to  of the fund’s average daily net assets as of february   sit has agreed to waive its license and services fee and the sponsor has voluntarily agreed to correspondingly assume the remaining expenses of the fund so that fund expenses do not exceed an annual rate of  excluding brokerage commissions interest expense and extraordinary expenses of the value of the fund’s average daily net assets the assumption of expenses and waiver of the license and services fee are contractual on the part of the sponsor and sit respectively through june   the “expense cap”   the fund’s ongoing fees costs and expenses of its operation not subject to the expense cap include brokerage and other fees and commissions incurred in connection with the trading activities of the fund and extraordinary expenses including but not limited to legal claims and liabilities and litigation costs and any indemnification related thereto expenses subject to the expense cap include i expenses incurred in connection with registering additional shares of the fund or offering shares of the fund ii the routine expenses associated with the

services whether performed by an outside service provider or by affiliates of the sponsor v postage and insurance vi costs and expenses associated with client relations and services vii costs of preparation of all federal state local and foreign tax returns and any taxes payable on the income assets or operations of the fund               while the sponsor has agreed to pay registration fees to the sec and any other regulatory agency in connection with the offer and sale of the shares offered through the fund’s prospectus the legal printing accounting and other expenses associated with such registration and the initial fee of  for listing the shares on the nyse arca the fund will be responsible for any registration fees and related expenses incurred in connection with any future offer and sale of shares of the fund in excess of those offered through its prospectus   any general expenses of the trust will be allocated among the fund and any other series of the trust as determined by the sponsor in its sole and absolute discretion the trust is also responsible for extraordinary expenses including but not limited to legal claims and liabilities and litigation costs and any indemnification related thereto the trust andor the sponsor may be required to indemnify the trustee distributor or administrator under certain circumstances   the parties cannot anticipate the amount of payments that will be required under these arrangements for future periods as the nav and trading levels to meet investment objectives for the fund will not be known until a future date

trustee and the sponsor with respect to the offering of the shares and fund management and the shareholders are governed by the provisions of the dsta and by the trust agreement on january   the initial form s for the fund was declared effective by the us securities and exchange commission sec on january    creation baskets for the fund were issued representing  shares and  the fund began trading on the new york stock exchange nyse arca on february   the fund is designed and managed to track the performance of a portfolio the benchmark portfolio consisting of exchange traded futures contracts and options on futures on   and year us treasury securities treasury instruments weighted to achieve a targeted negative  year average effective portfolio duration the benchmark component instruments    the investment objective of the fund the funds investment objective is to profit from rising interest rates by tracking the performance of the benchmark portfolio consisting of exchange traded futures contracts and options on futures on   and year us treasury securities weighted to achieve a targeted negative  year average effective portfolio duration the fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing in the benchmark component instruments currently constituting the benchmark portfolio the benchmark portfolio is maintained by sit fixed income advisors ii llc sit and will be rebalanced reconstituted or both monthly typically on the th of each month and on the next business day if the th is a holiday weekend or other day on which the national exchanges are closed to maintain a negative  year average effective duration the benchmark portfolio and the fund will each maintain a short position in treasury instruments the fund does not use futures contracts or options to obtain leveraged investment results the benchmark component instruments currently constituting the benchmark portfolio as of march   include name ticker market value usd us yr futr optn mayc fvkc  us yr note cbt jun fvm   us  yr note cbt jun tum   us yr fut optn mayp tykp  the benchmark component instruments currently constituting the benchmark portfolio and anticipated rebalancing dates as well as the daily holdings of the fund are available on the funds website at wwwrisingrateetfcom the weighting of the treasury instruments constituting the benchmark component instruments will be based on each maturitys duration contribution the expected range for the duration weighted percentage of the  year and  year maturity treasury instruments will be from  to  the expected range for the duration weighted percentage of the  year maturity treasury instruments will be from  to  the relative weightings of the benchmark component instruments will be shifted between maturities when there are material changes in the shape of the yield curve for example if the federal reserve began raising short term interest rates more than long term interest rates in such an instance sit which maintains the benchmark portfolio will increase the weightings of the  year and reduce the weighting in the  year maturity treasury instruments conversely sit will do the opposite if the federal reserve began raising long term interest rates more than short term interest rates reconstitution and rebalancing each will occur monthly on the th except for as noted above or if there are radical changes in the yield curve such that effective duration is outside of a range from negative nine to negative year average effective duration in which case sit will adjust the maturities of the treasury instruments before the next expected monthly reconstitution the sponsor anticipates that approximately  to  of the funds assets will be used as payment for or collateral for treasury instruments in order to collateralize its treasury instrument positions the fund will hold such assets from which it will post margin to its fcm in an amount equal to the margin required by the relevant exchange and transfer to its fcm any additional amounts that may be separately required by the fcm when establishing positions in treasury instruments the fund will be required to deposit initial margin with a value of approximately  to  of the value of each treasury instrument position at the time it is established these margin requirements are subject to change from time to time by the exchange or the fcm on a daily basis the fund will be obligated to pay or entitled to receive variation margin in an amount equal to the change in the daily settlement level of its treasury instruments positions any assets not required to be posted as margin with the fcm will be held at the funds administrator in cash or cash equivalents as discussed below    the benchmark portfolio will be invested in benchmark component instruments and rebalanced as noted above to maintain a negative average effective portfolio duration of approximately  years duration is a measure of estimated price sensitivity relative to changes in interest rates portfolios with longer durations are typically more sensitive to changes in interest rates for example if interest rates rise by  the market value of a security with an effective duration of  years would decrease by  with all other factors being constant and likewise the market value of a security with an effective duration of negative  years would increase by  with all other factors being constant duration estimates are based on assumptions by sit and are subject to a number of limitations duration is a more accurate estimate of price sensitivity provided interest rate changes are small and occur equally in shortterm and longterm securities investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise the risk is usually greater for longerterm debt securities the fund will incur certain expenses in connection with its operations the fund will hold cash or cash equivalents such as us treasuries or other high credit quality shortterm fixedincome or similar securities for direct investment or as collateral for the treasury instruments and for other liquidity purposes and to meet redemptions that may be necessary on an ongoing basis these expenses and income from the cash and cash equivalent holdings may cause imperfect correlation between changes in the funds nav and changes in the benchmark portfolio because the benchmark portfolio does not reflect expenses or income the sponsor etf managers capital llc is the sponsor of the trust and the fund the sponsor is a delaware limited liability company formed on june   the principal office is located at  beechwood road suite b summit nj  the sponsor is registered as a commodity pool operator cpo with the commodity futures trading commission

discretion appoint an affiliate or affiliates of the sponsor as additional sponsors and retain such persons including affiliates of the sponsor as it deems necessary to effectuate and carry out the purposes business and objectives of the trust results of operations comparison of per share rise nav to rise market value for the period from february   to march   image removed neither the past

the benchmark portfolio returns for the period from february   to march   the difference in the nav price and the benchmark value often results in the appearance of a nav discount to the benchmark the difference is related to the cumulative impact on nav of the funds expenses for the period from february   to march   fund share price performance during the period from february   commencement of shares trading on the nyse arca to march   the nyse arca market value of each share decreased  from  per share representing the initial trade on february   to  per share representing the closing price on march   the share price high and low for the period from february   to march   and related change from the initial share price on february   was as follows shares traded from a high of  per share

decreased  from  per share to  per share for the period from february   to march   losses in the futures and options contracts and fund expenses resulted in the overall decrease in the nav per share during the period from february   to march   net loss for the period from february   to march   was  resulting from net realized losses on futures and options contracts of  net unrealized losses on futures and options contracts of  and the net operating loss of  calculating nav the funds nav is calculated by � taking the current market value of its total assets    the administrator calculates the nav of the fund once each nyse arca trading day the nav for a particular trading day is released after  pm new york time trading during the core trading session on the nyse arca typically closes at  pm new york time the administrator uses the cme closing price determined at the earlier of the close of the cme for the contracts traded on the cme but calculates or determines the value of all other fund investments using market quotations if available or other information customarily used to determine the fair value of such investments as of the earlier of the close of the nyse arca or  pm new york time in accordance with the current administrative agency agreement among us bancorp fund services the fund and the sponsor other information customarily used in determining fair value includes information consisting of market data in the relevant market supplied by one or more third parties including without limitation relevant rates prices yields yield curves volatilities spreads correlations or other market data in the relevant market or information of the types described above from internal sources if that information is of the same type used by the fund in the regular course of its business for the valuation of similar transactions the information may include costs of funding to the extent costs of funding are not and would not be a component of the other information being utilized third parties supplying quotations or market data may include without limitation dealers in the relevant markets endusers of the relevant product information vendors brokers and other sources of market information in addition in order to provide updated information relating to the fund for use by investors and market professionals the nyse arca calculates and disseminates throughout the core trading session on each trading day an updated indicative fund value the indicative fund value is calculated by using the prior days closing nav per share of the fund as a base and updating that value throughout the trading day to reflect changes in the most recently reported trade price for the futures and options held by the fund traded on the cme the indicative fund value share basis disseminated during nyse arca core trading session hours should not be viewed as an actual real time update of the nav because the nav is calculated only once at the end of each trading day based upon the relevant end of day values of the funds investments the indicative fund value is disseminated on a per share basis every  seconds during regular nyse arca core trading session hours of  am new york time to  pm new york time the normal trading hours of the cme are  am new york time to  pm new york time this means that there is a gap in time at the beginning and the end of each day during which the funds shares are traded on the nyse arca but realtime cme trading prices for contracts traded on the cme are not available during such gaps in time the indicative fund value will be calculated based on the end of day price of such contracts from the cmes immediately preceding trading session in addition other investments and us treasuries held by the fund will be valued by the administrator using rates and points received from clientapproved third party vendors such as reuters and wm company and advisor quotes these investments will not be included in the indicative fund value the nyse arca disseminates the indicative fund value through the facilities of ctacq high speed lines in addition the indicative fund value is published on the nyse arcas website and is available through online information services such as bloomberg and reuters dissemination of the indicative fund value provides additional information that is not otherwise available to the public and is useful to investors and market professionals in connection with the trading of the fund shares on the nyse arca investors and market professionals are able throughout the trading day to compare the market price of the fund and the indicative fund value if the market price of the fund shares diverges significantly from the indicative fund value market professionals will have an incentive to execute arbitrage trades for example if the fund appears to be trading at a discount compared to the indicative fund value a market professional could buy the fund shares on the nyse arca and take the opposite position in treasury instruments such arbitrage trades can tighten the tracking between the market price of the fund and the indicative fund value and thus can be beneficial to all market participants critical accounting policies the funds critical accounting policies are as follows preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires the application of appropriate accounting rules and guidance as well as the use of estimates the funds application of these policies involves judgments and the use of estimates actual results may differ from the estimates used and such differences could be material the fund holds a significant portion of its assets in futures contracts and a money market fund which are held at fair value the fund calculates its net asset value as of the nav calculation time as described above    the values which are used by the fund for its treasury instruments are provided by its commodity broker who uses market prices when available in addition the fund estimates interest income on a daily basis using prevailing rates earned on its cash and cash equivalents these estimates are adjusted to the actual amount received on a monthly basis and the difference if any is not considered material credit risk when the fund enters into benchmark component instruments it will be exposed to the credit risk that the counterparty will not be able to meet its obligations for purposes of credit risk the counterparty for the benchmark component instruments traded on the cme and other futures exchanges is the clearinghouse associated with those exchanges in general clearinghouses are backed by their members who may be required to share in the financial burden resulting from the nonperformance of one of their members which should significantly reduce credit risk there can be no assurance that any counterparty clearinghouse or their financial backers will satisfy their obligations to the fund the sponsor will attempt to minimize certain of these market and credit risks by normally � executing and clearing trades with creditworthy counterparties as determined by the sponsor � limiting the outstanding amounts due from counterparties of the fund � not posting margin directly with a counterparty � limiting the amount of margin or premium posted at the fcm and � ensuring that deliverable contracts are not held to such a date when delivery of an underlying asset could be called for the commodity exchange act cea requires all fcms such as the funds clearing broker to meet and maintain specified fitness and financial requirements to segregate customer funds from proprietary funds and account separately for all customers funds and positions and to maintain specified books and records open to inspection by the staff of the cftc the cftc has similar authority over introducing brokers or persons who solicit or accept orders for commodity interest trades but who do not accept margin deposits for the execution of trades the cea authorizes the cftc to regulate trading by fcms and by their officers and directors permits the cftc to require action by exchanges in the event of market emergencies and establishes an administrative procedure under which customers may institute complaints for damages arising from alleged violations of the cea the cea also gives the states powers to enforce its provisions and the regulations of the cftc on november   the cftc published final regulations that require enhanced customer protections risk management programs internal monitoring and controls capital and liquidity standards customer disclosures and auditing and examination programs for fcms the rules are intended to afford greater assurances to market participants that customer segregated funds and secured amounts are protected customers are provided with appropriate notice of the risks of futures trading and of the fcms with which they may choose to do business fcms are monitoring and managing risks in a robust manner the capital and liquidity of fcms are strengthened to safeguard the continued operations and the auditing and examination programs of the cftc and the selfregulatory organizations are monitoring the activities of fcms in a thorough manner liquidity and capital resources the fund does not anticipate making use of borrowings or other lines of credit to meet its obligations the fund meets its liquidity needs in the normal course of business from the proceeds of the sale of its investments or from the cash cash equivalents andor the collateralizing treasury securities that it holds the funds liquidity needs include redeeming its shares providing margin deposits for existing benchmark component instruments the purchase of additional benchmark component instruments and paying expenses the fund generates cash primarily from i the sale of creation baskets and ii interest earned on cash cash equivalents and their investments in collateralizing treasury securities generally all of the net assets of the fund are allocated to trading in benchmark component instruments most of the assets of the fund are held in treasury instruments cash andor cash equivalents that could or are used as margin or collateral for trading in benchmark component instruments the percentage that such assets bear to the total net assets will vary from period to period as the market values of the benchmark component instruments change interest earned on interestbearing assets of the fund is paid to the fund    the investments of the fund in benchmark component instruments could be subject to periods of illiquidity because of market conditions regulatory considerations and other reasons such conditions could prevent the fund from promptly liquidating a position in benchmark component instruments market risk trading in benchmark component instruments such as futures contracts will involve the fund entering into contractual commitments to purchase or sell specific amounts of instruments at a specified date in the future the gross or face amount of the contracts is expected to significantly exceed the future cash requirements of the fund as the fund intends to close out any open positions prior to the contractual expiration date as a result the funds market risk is the risk of loss arising from the decline in value of the contracts not from the need to make delivery under the contracts the fund considers the fair value of derivative instruments to be the unrealized gain or loss on the contracts the market risk associated with the commitment by the fund to purchase a specific contract will be limited to the aggregate face amount of the contracts held the exposure of the fund to market risk will depend on a number of factors including the markets for the specific instrument the volatility of interest rates and foreign exchange rates the liquidity of the instrumentspecific market and the relationships among the contracts held by the fund regulatory environment the regulation of futures markets futures contracts and futures exchanges has historically been comprehensive the cftc and the exchanges are authorized to take extraordinary actions in the event of a market emergency including for example the retroactive implementation of speculative position limits increased margin requirements the establishment of daily price limits and the suspension of trading the regulation of commodity interest transactions in the united states is a rapidly changing area of law and is subject to ongoing modification by governmental and judicial action considerable regulatory attention has been focused on nontraditional investment pools that are publicly distributed in the united states there is a possibility of future regulatory changes within the united states altering perhaps to a material extent the nature of an investment in the fund or the ability of the fund to continue to implement its investment strategy the effect of any future regulatory change on the fund is impossible to predict but could be substantial and adverse the cftc possesses exclusive jurisdiction to regulate the activities of commodity pool operators and has adopted regulations with respect to the activities of those persons andor entities under the cea a registered cpo such as the sponsor is required to make annual filings with the cftc describing its organization capital structure management and controlling persons in addition the cea authorizes the cftc to require and review books and

sponsor causes the fund to transfer the proceeds from the sale of creation baskets to the custodian or other custodian for trading activities the sponsor will invest the proceeds in us treasuries with a maturity of  days or less cash andor cash equivalents and in futures contracts and options on futures contracts on us treasuries when the fund purchases a futures contract the fund is required to deposit with the selling fcm on behalf of the exchange a portion of the value of the contract or other interest as security to ensure payment for the obligation at maturity this deposit is known as initial margin the fund will receive or pay depending on market movement variation margin as the value of the futures position increase or decreases the fund will pay premiums on the options contracts that it purchases the sponsor will invest the assets that remain after margin and collateral are posted in us treasuries cash andor cash equivalents subject to these margin and collateral requirements the sponsor has sole authority to determine the percentage of assets that are · held on deposit with the fcm or other custodian · used for other investments and · held in bank accounts to pay current obligations and as reserves approximately  of the fund’s assets are expected to normally be committed as margin for futures contracts however from time to time the percentage of assets committed as margin may be substantially more or less than such range ongoing margin and collateral payments will generally be required for exchangetraded contracts based on changes in their value in light of the differing requirements for initial payments under exchangetraded contracts and the fluctuating nature of ongoing margin and collateral payments it is not possible to estimate what portion of the fund’s assets will be posted as margin or collateral at any given time the us treasuries cash and cash equivalents held by the fund will constitute reserves that will be available to meet ongoing margin and collateral requirements all interest income will be used for the fund’s benefit the sponsor invests the balance of the fund’s assets not invested in futures or options on us treasuries with a maturity of  days or less cash and cash equivalents and such funds are available as reserves for changes in margin all interest income is used for the fund’s benefit an fcm counterparty government agency or commodity exchange could increase margin or collateral requirements applicable to the fund to hold trading positions at any time moreover margin is merely a security deposit and has no bearing on the profit or loss potential for any positions held the assets of the fund posted as margin for futures contracts will be held in segregation pursuant to the cea and cftc regulations not specified company description the etf managers group commodity trust i the “trust” is a delaware statutory trust formed on july   the trust is a series trust formed pursuant to the delaware statutory trust act of which the fund is currently the sole series the fund is a commodity pool that continuously issues common shares of beneficial interest that may be purchased and sold on the nyse arca stock exchange “nyse arca” the fund is managed and controlled by etf managers capital llc the “sponsor” a delaware limited liability company the sponsor is registered with the commodity futures trading commission “cftc” as a commodity pool operator “cpo” and is a member of the national futures association “nfa” sit fixed income advisors ii llc “sit” is registered as a “commodity trading advisor” “cta” and will act as such for the fund the fund’s investment objective is to profit from rising interest rates by tracking the performance of a portfolio the “benchmark portfolio” consisting of exchange traded futures contracts and options on futures on   and year us treasury securities “treasury instruments” weighted to achieve a targeted negative  year average effective portfolio duration the “benchmark component instruments” the fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing in the benchmark component instruments currently constituting the benchmark portfolio the benchmark portfolio is maintained by sit and will be rebalanced reconstituted or both monthly typically on the th of each month and on the next business day if the th is a holiday weekend or other day on which the national exchanges are closed to maintain a negative  year average effective duration the benchmark portfolio and the fund will each maintain a short position in treasury instruments the fund does not use futures contracts or options to obtain leveraged investment results the benchmark component instruments currently constituting the benchmark portfolio and anticipated rebalancing dates as well as the daily holdings of the fund are available on the fund’s website at wwwrisingrateetfcom the weighting of the treasury instruments constituting the benchmark component instruments will be based on each maturity’s duration contribution the expected range for the duration weighted percentage of the  year and  year maturity treasury instruments will be from  to  the expected range for the duration weighted percentage of the  year maturity treasury instruments will be from  to  the relative weightings of the benchmark component instruments will be shifted between maturities when there are material changes in the shape of the yield curve for example if the federal reserve began raising short term interest rates more than long term interest rates in such an instance sit which maintains the benchmark portfolio will increase the weightings of the  year and reduce the weighting in the  year maturity treasury instruments conversely sit will do the opposite if the federal reserve began raising long term interest rates more than short term interest rates reconstitution and rebalancing each will occur monthly on the th except for as noted above or if there are radical changes in the yield curve such that effective duration is outside of a range from negative nine to negative year average effective duration in which case sit will adjust the maturities of the treasury instruments before the next expected monthly reconstitution the sponsor anticipates that approximately  to  of the fund’s assets will be used as payment for or collateral for treasury instruments in order to collateralize its treasury instrument positions the fund will hold such assets from which it will post margin to its futures commission merchant “fcm” in an amount equal to the margin required by the relevant exchange and transfer to its fcm any additional amounts that may be separately required by the fcm when establishing positions in treasury instruments the fund will be required to deposit initial margin with a value of approximately  to  of the value of each treasury instrument position at the time it is established these margin requirements are subject to change from time to time by the exchange or the fcm on a daily basis the fund will be obligated to pay or entitled to receive variation margin in an amount equal to the change in the daily settlement level of its treasury instruments positions any assets not required to be posted as margin with the fcm will be held at the fund’s administrator in cash or cash equivalents as discussed below the benchmark portfolio will be invested in benchmark component instruments and rebalanced as noted above to maintain a negative average effective portfolio duration of approximately  years duration is a measure of estimated price sensitivity relative to changes in interest rates portfolios with longer durations are typically more sensitive to changes in interest rates for example if interest rates rise by  the market value of a security with an effective duration of  years would decrease by  with all other factors being constant and likewise the market value of a security with an effective duration of negative  years would increase by  with all other factors being constant duration estimates are based on assumptions by sit and are subject to a number of limitations duration is a more accurate estimate of price sensitivity provided interest rate changes are small and occur equally in shortterm and longterm securities investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise the risk is usually greater for longerterm debt securities the fund will incur certain expenses in connection with its operations the fund will hold cash or cash equivalents such as us treasuries or other high credit quality shortterm fixedincome or similar securities for direct investment or as collateral for the treasury instruments and for other liquidity purposes and to meet redemptions that may be necessary on an ongoing basis these expenses and income from the cash and cash equivalent holdings may cause imperfect correlation between changes in the fund’s nav and changes in the benchmark portfolio because the benchmark portfolio does not reflect expenses or income  the principal office of the trust and fund is located at  beechwood road suite b summit nj  the
