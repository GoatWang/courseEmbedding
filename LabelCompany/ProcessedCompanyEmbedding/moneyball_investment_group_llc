excessive adulation for an entertainer who died almost four decades ago and whose music and movies were hits long before the arrival of millennials but if salter knows ­anything it’s how to raise the

restructuring at peter j solomon co an investment banking advisory firm with a retail focus “it’s a hamster wheel once you get on it you’ve got to keep running” he sayssalter says he deals with that problem by working with studios and other media to create new content take monroe who salter says is “more ­relevant than she ever was” he says her biggest fans today are  to  in part because of the actress’s continuing presence on social media she was the first deceased celebrity to be verified on twitter where she boasts  followers on an account run by authentic  million users like her on

started a campaign “ali in all of us” which will include an app that helps people find outlets for volunteer work touching on the boxing legend’s extensive public servicesalter says he uses a “moneyball” system that weighs a brand’s or name’s social media presence its demographics and the income level and involvement of followers celebrities account for about  percent of authentic’s
