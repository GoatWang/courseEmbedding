the gas previous article halcón resources to acquire georesources for b  next article  domestic active with large private equity role untitled document untitled document floyd wilson aims to turn halcón into a new petrohawk – minus the gas  by don stowers editor an interview with floyd c wilson chairman president and ceo of halcón resources corp don stowers editor – ogfj editors note floyd wilson has not been idle last year he oversaw the sale of the tremendously successful petrohawk energy a company he founded to bhp billiton for  billion he has since recapitalized another company ram energy changed the name to halcón resources and in april acquired still another company georesources for over  billion in cash and stock ogfj editor don stowers recently caught up with wilson for a short qa session oil  gas financial journal why did you decide to go back into business right on the heels of the sale of petrohawk didnt you need a little time for rr floyd wilson the unconventional business here in the us is growing by leaps and bounds so i felt there was a good opportunity to build a company similar to petrohawk but start from scratch basically and build an oil company rather than a largely natural gas company like petrohawk having been reasonably successful with this i thought it would be a good idea to jump right back in and follow up on some ideas i had ogfj so why did you choose ram energy to recapitalize wilson well both ram and georesources came to me so it was a little different than me going out and looking in the case of ram they had a mature production base largely oil low decline good ebida production nonrisky and access to one of the emerging oil plays in the us – not a shale but the mississippi lime which is a conventional reservoir being completed in unconventional ways horizontal drilling multistage fracing and so on and with ram you had a company in which a majority of the shareholders were willing to look into the future and allow themselves to be recapitalized and basically taken over so there were a number of attractive elements there – oil a new play and speed with my experience and background you might notice that speed seems to be important to me and my colleagues and it is ogfj what do you see as the upside to the georesources acquisition how is this a good fit for halcón wilson on the surface there were a number of similarities to ram there was a mature solid largely oil production base this was a company that was in very good shape financially – very little debt – so this played a part in the decision process as well georesources had taken a look at some of the things that had gone on with petrohawk with respect to companies that we acquired and what had happened to their shareholders they saw that the shareholders had been treated very well financially in those transactions so they decided to talk to us about the possibility of a buyout the company was attractive to us because it provided access to three really interesting plays the eagle ford down in fayette county the bakken which i had been looking at for years but never gotten into and a large acreage position in the austin chalk all these things combined made the company very interesting to me and the fact that they were interested in a significant component of stock in the transaction was a major consideration ogfj if i heard correctly pursuant to the sale of petrohawk to bhp you are prohibited from operating in the eagle ford until november of this year since the acquisition of georesources puts halcón squarely in that play what is the status of those assets and must they be divested wilson im not actually constrained from operating in the eagle ford but under the noncompete agreement that we constructed im not supposed to operate within  miles of a current bhp billiton operation in existence at the time of the transaction since the georesources eagle ford assets are within that halo i contacted bhp they said to go ahead with the transaction but that we would have to divest the eagle ford assets which ive agreed to do having said that its a great piece of property and a great location its oil and whether its a development project inhouse or a divestiture project its worth a lot of money and its in the early stages so by the time we get the deal closed well have a few more wells drilled by ourselves and by a competitor itll bring top dollar so i wasnt at all dismayed by the fact that bhp preferred that we stick strictly to our agreement they paid a very fair price for petrohawk and they deserve to have us live up to our end of the bargain well divest those properties shortly after closing the deal with georesources ogfj what is the origin of the companys name – halcón resources wilson halcón is a spanish word that means hawk or falcon most people say halcon but with the accent mark over the o its halcone ogfj rumor has it that halcón has been acquiring a leasehold position in the emerging tuscaloosa marine shale in louisiana would you care to comment on this wilson there was a blog out there that mentioned that weve been acquiring land in four announced areas we added these areas with the georesources acquisition and then we announced that we had been acquiring land in three undisclosed plays and then we added a fourth on our recent analyst conference call weve been leasing underneath the radar screen so to speak because that is very effective in keeping the costs down were leasing purely oilbiased reservoirs and those are very attractive to nearly everyone these days so were just keeping quiet about those where were building our position other than that im not really in a position where i can discuss those plays however we will be talking about them later this year were well on the road toward our acreage target and we are moving rigs in as we speak so well have a lot to talk about in a couple of months ogfj rice university recently released a report about projected oil production in the us and its impact on oil imports it stated that currently only about  of our offshore areas are open to drilling and that the other  could add significantly to our reserves combine this with our unconventional reserves and thats a lot of oil are you optimistic that the us is headed toward greater selfsufficiency in energy and that well be less reliant on oil imports from nations in politically unstable areas wilson im not a big macro economist or anything but im highly confident that the us is headed toward a much higher degree of energy selfsufficiency when the explosion of gas production from the shales started to hit the market in  and  our system of supply and demand got really out of whack supply outdistanced demand quickly and gas prices fell dramatically oil is a little different were a significant user and importer of oil however i believe i read that weve recently become the largest producer of oil in the world on a daily basis thats due largely to the eagle ford and bakken shale plays over time theres a huge opportunity for greater independence its hard to say what this will do to prices because oil is a global commodity and globally priced other countries will eventually see shale development as well but right now theyre so far behind in terms of infrastructure and technical expertise its going to be some time before that occurs we have plenty of room for us production to increase dramatically over the next five or  years which will be very good for the country im not a politician either but we seem to be taking very slow steps to take advantage of this explosion of natural gas onshore us there is a huge opportunity for us to use more of this ample supply of natural gas for power generation industrial consumption and transportation ogfj is the current low price for natural gas out of whack wilson its the supply and demand that is out of whack the price for natural gas is based on supply and demand which is a fair enough way to price things its a tremendous opportunity for the united states to have all this gas also with the increased production of natural gas liquids and crude from these shales were going to see a resurgence of the petrochemical business here in the us due to two things  the feedstock of natural gas is so inexpensive and  all the ngls being produced also play a part in this there doesnt seem to be a downside to what is going on ogfj unless youre in the coal business wilson laughs well as far as power generation is concerned natural gas is the only good bridge fuel to other sources of electricity that are not that commercial right now low gas prices have put a damper on the outlook for some of these solar and wind projects that require so much development capital and sometimes subsidies back to crude though there is a really solid chance we can achieve or move toward energy independence because of these unconventional reservoirs and conventional reservoirs that are being dealt with in an unconventional manner that is through horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing so our target at halcón is strictly those kinds of formations in just a few short months weve acquired hundreds of thousands of acres all geared toward oil and liquids production its been not as expensive as you might think even though everyone is interested in those kinds of things theyre still very frontend loaded in terms of technology and geoscience you have to figure out all these things in advance and then get in there and compete with peers who have the same idea so its not an easy business but weve been able to amass quite a bit of acreage in just a couple of months ogfj currently i believe that roughly  of your production is in texas  in oklahoma and about  in louisiana do you expect these proportions to remain about the same in the next year and what projects will account for most of your production growth in the next  to  months wilson if youll allow me to think about georesources in a proforma way the basic production mix doesnt change that much when you add them to halcóns current basics except that theyve got a couple of thousand barrels per day up in the rockies weve recently acquired acreage up in pennsylvania and ohio in the uticapoint pleasant shale play and are moving a rig in almost as we speak so this is clearly in a different area for us we intend to grow the bakken component that geo is going to provide us as a starter kit and that is also in a different area than texas oklahoma and louisiana well also see growth in the mississippi lime oklahoma the woodbine east texas and the wilcox central louisiana but were very excited about whats going on in pennsylvania and ohio the utica is an oily play ogfj i saw a map somewhere that indicated that the western portion of the utica in ohio is the oily area of that play is that correct wilson well weve spent a lot of time and money trying to figure that out i suspect that statement is not quite right laughs these plays have a tendency to have a dry gas window a volatile condensate window then a black oil window and an area where the oil is immature the eagle ford is that way and it seems as if the uticapoint pleasant is the same way its too general to say that the western portion is the oily part but in any one single area the westernmost part of that specific area is the oilier part if that makes sense ogfj thanks for setting me straight on that i know you need to go but i have one final question earlier this year you completed a  million equity offering how will you use the proceeds from that offering and how is the capital being allocated wilson to keep it in context we brought  million into ram and then changed the name to halcón we added  million to that so in round numbers we have about  billion of capital available to us we paid off a few credit lines but we established new credit lines so in terms of liquidity today we have about  million available to us we will use that money strictly to buy land in the oily shale and conventional plays that weve announced and in ones that we havent identified yet and of course some drilling we have a fairly strong drilling program this year for a company thats only been around a couple of months i think were spending well over  million this year drilling so we have quite an appetite for capital ogfj would you ever consider forming a joint venture with another company to develop acreage to reduce land and drilling costs wilson this may be a good strategy for companies that want to pursue that but we dont my view is more old school if someone wants to do a jv with us they can jv the whole company we pursue earlystage development projects with decades and decades of drilling ahead of them and i dont like selling off chunks of that id rather raise money in some other way and weve always been able to do that at the end of the day the value thats created through a transaction such as the one we did at petrohawk is much more lucrative for the shareholders than the fleeting value created by a jv which generally is driven by a balance sheet in trouble in terms of liquidity ogfj thanks very much for your time more oil  gas financial journal current issue articles more oil  gas financial journal archives issue articles view oil and gas
