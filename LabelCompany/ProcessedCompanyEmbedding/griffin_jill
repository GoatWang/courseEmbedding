washington on the “essential characteristics or traits of the general officers of the continental army character professional ability integrity prudence and loyalty many times since i have thought how timeless and relevant this formula is—not just for military people but for people in the business world and in fact in any professional endeavor in the language of his day general washington spoke of the importance of competence professional ability good judgment prudence and the enduring virtues of character integrity and loyalty reflecting on these qualities it seems to me that the first four

griffin jill johnson named after the greek goddess of dawn and the word time eosera inc represents a time for new beginnings for the cofounders and focuses on healing humansthe cofounders of the fort worthbased company are ceo elyse dickerson and joe griffin chief scientific officer and while griffin says his skills are on the scientific side dickerson’s skills are in commercialization and marketingeosera is the biotechnology company that created earwax md an earwax dissolvent product that the news release said was sold out on amazon exclusives in the first month after it was released in may during the development process they worked with groups such as tmac texas manufacturing assistance center and tech fort worth they both took time to talk with the fort worth business press about creating the product why earwax mddickerson the first two months all we did … was talk to people and we would just set meetings with all types of doctors all types of patients and it was really just us listening with every doctor especially we would ask “okay so what are some conditions that you see on a regular basis that you think are not being met or that could be treated more efficiently or effectively” and surprisingly earwax impaction rose to the top …after we kept hearing this over and over we went back to the medical literature and started reading about it and trying to understand more about it and what we realized was it’s not a real what i’d call sexy or exciting topic and so i think big pharmaceutical companies have sort of just said “it’s not cancer it’s not life threatening” so they’ve kind of stayed away from it but it is something that our health care systems spend a tremendous amount of money on trying to remedy the problemwhat is your relationship with tech fort worthdickerson we had a few friends tell us about this incubator and it sits right at the corner of rosedale and i in a cityowned building and the city really supports this mission of entrepreneurship and growing small businesses in fort worth to help the economy tech fort worth has one of three buildings and they have clients then that are startup companies and you essentially apply to be part of the program and so we office here we have access to really incredible mentorship on a weekly basistech fort worth has a partnership with unt health science center and we were able to use their shared lab space which as a startup there’s no way we could have afforded to build our own lab or even really pay retail price for renting a real lab so we got a significantly discounted rate … we were at unt health science center pretty much every day for the first year in their lab developing our product and we would never have had that access if not for tech fort worth and their partnerships they createdwhat was the process for working with tmacgriffin tmac was recommended to us and we were introduced to them through tech fort worth we had an initial meeting with the tmac team and we basically had a little interview and meeting with them to find out what services they provided and what services we neededthen we got kind of assigned to initially a couple of the different tmac departments one related to quality understanding quality systems and how the us food and drug administration and other regulatory agencies look at product development … one was related to design of products and design of packaging …as we continued to develop our product and as we continued to refine our target product we ended up working almost exclusively with one of the departments at tmac that helped us again complete the quality program …it wasn’t a static time and we’re still working with tmac really weekly… and as we begin the development of our next product we’re fully hoping that we can continue the relationship in a similar mannerwhy did the company choose both inhouse and thirdparty manufacturingdickerson we could save on the cost by doing it ourselves really the emphasis behind us taking it on was one of our key advisors who is the director of tech fort worth darlene boudreaux she ran a contract manufacturing company for her entire career and then sold that business and as one of our mentors she sort of sat us down and said “look you guys you can do this”we decided to sort of step our toe into it and now we’ve taken on more of the production ourselves it really was driven by cost that we could do it more efficiently and have a tighter control over the finished goodswhy was the product launched with amazon first dickerson i had a goal of really wanting to have a controlled launch mainly because we were new to this to running the business ourselveswe both had come from the pharmaceutical industry but we also had huge divisions that did the manufacturing and the distribution we had all these support networks that we didn’t have to worry about all those kinds of thingswhen it was really just me and joe we decided that let’s launch small and controlled so if there are any issues we can pivot quickly and test and learn if you will and so launching on amazon really gave us a lot of control …and we learned we had some product that was leaking in our first shipment that we had to pull back and we ended up changing the bottle and the cap we also ended up changing the label … because it wasn’t holding up the way we thought that it should little things like that we were able to pivot really quickly based on just a few hundred units out into the market so that was really the reason we launched on amazonhow is the company holding to conscious capitalismdickerson the philosophy is that you have a higher purpose over profit and that purpose can vary depending on the type of company you havebut for us for example we put people before profits and the belief is that if you have something a bigger reason for being that the profits will follow …when we decided to start our company the foundation of our company is healing humans and that’s really in a broader sense yes we want our medications or our products that we bring to market to physically heal people but we also want to provide a work environment where our employees feel valued and encouraged and have opportunities to grow in their careerour investors feel like we have their best interest at heart and that we’re open too it’s a twoway street we’re open to listening from them and learning from them just as much as they are from usthen the patient really listening to the patient and the doctor and understanding what are unmet
