free trial request a demo net promoter® score measurement  referral measuring loyalty at scale  identifying brand amabssadors financial institutions like most businesses need to measure and improve customer loyalty – and compare current levels to competitive benchmarks  net promoter® score nps® is a widely adopted method for measuring comparing and improving customer loyalty  as nps adoption has grown so has digital banking now reaching more than half of the entire customer base  this presents a unique opportunity to move beyond statistical sampling to measure each customer’s loyalty and act     history of nps net promoter score or nps is a management tool that can be used to gauge the loyalty of a firms customer relationships it serves as an alternative to traditional customer satisfaction research and claims to be correlated with revenue growth   net promoter score is a customer loyalty metric developed by fred reichheld of bain  company  it was introduced by reichheld in his  harvard business review article one number you need to grow    net promoter score nps measures the loyalty that exists between a provider and a consumer the provider can be a company employer or any other entity the provider is the entity that is asking the questions on the nps®survey or interview the consumer is the customer employee or respondent to an nps survey  nps can be as low as − everybody is a detractor or as high as  everybody is a promoter an nps that is positive ie higher than zero is believed to be good and an nps of  is considered excellent   net promoter programs are not traditional customer satisfaction programs and simply measuring your nps does not lead to success companies must follow an associated discipline to actually drive improvements in customer loyalty and enable profitable growth they must have leadership commitment and the right software and business processes in place to deliver realtime information to employees so they can act on customer feedback and achieve results    millions of logout opportunities lost and found instead of statistical sampling involving a relatively small number of customers from which inferences can be drawn and applied to all customers or members – micronotes enables financial institutions to individually measure nps for a significant fraction of the entire customer population  micronotes harnesses digital banking logouts to interview customers on their willingness to recommend the bank or credit union to a friend or colleague and why  instead of statistical sampling involving a relatively small number of customers from which inferences can be drawn and applied to all customers or members – micronotes enables the bank to individually measure a significant fraction of the entire customer population enabling the bank to act individually to correct specific problems with individual high value customers  and conversely to request referrals from selfidentified promoters or brand ambassadors    how it works the net promoter score is based on the fundamental perspective that every company’s customers can be divided into three categories promoters passives and detractors nps is based on a direct question  “how likely is it that you would recommend our companyproductservice to a friend or colleague”  the scoring for this answer is most often based on a  to  scale   promoters are those who respond with a score of  or   loyal enthusiasts who will keep buying and refer others fueling growth passives are those who respond with a score of  or    customers who are vulnerable to competitive offerings detractors are those who respond with a score of  to   unhappy customers who can damage your brand and impede growth through negative wordofmouth nps is calculated by subtracting the percentage of customers who are detractors from the percentage of customers who are promoters  passives scores are ignored   micronotes automatically computes and reports nps along with the reasons why promoters promote and detractors detract  individual reasons for detractors are provided to frontline employees and management teams for followup action  local office branch managers at charles schwab corporation for example callback customers to engage them in a discussion about the feedback they provided through the nps® survey process solve problems and learn more so they can coach account representatives the micronotes nps campaign automatically reengages with detractors for followup conversation and invitation for a callback – all at digital banking scale  conversely the micronotes nps campaign together with micronotes social™ enables the bank to retarget promoters in social media to help promoters – well… promote      the primary purpose of the nps methodology is to evaluate customer loyalty to a brand or company not to evaluate their satisfaction with a particular product or transaction which is why micronotes makes this measurement at enterprise scale the ability to measure customer loyalty is a more effective methodology to determine the likelihood that the customer will buy again talkup the company and resist market pressure to defect to a competitor example of nps interview at logout   example of nps campaign report key benefits provides benchmark measurements of customer loyalty and willingness to refer identifies brand ambassadors enables

engagement more revenue faster micronotes crosssell radically improves the productivity of bank crosssell efforts by leveraging digital banking channel traffic to interview customers and deliver individually tailored offers for financial products without interfering with core banking functions micronotes crosssell can engage the same number of customers in six months that it would take decades to reach with banner ads    invitation to communicate effectively instead of a banner ad we present an interview in mobile or online banking not an offer because we don’t know exactly what each customer wants until we ask  the customer selfselects an offer by responding to simple questions in about  seconds or no offer at all  interviews are powerful because sometimes mortgage conversations turn into heloc or wealth management conversations  in other cases the customer may request a call about a mortgage — in spanish    regardless of the way the conversation proceeds micronotes automatically captures the segment information and acts on it for example a life events interview produces very different segments   ip address or unique id segment detail  customermember is buying a home in the next few months and requested help with a mortgage  customermember wants home insurance help plans to buy a new house within a few months  customermember is buying a home in the next  months and requested help with a mortgage  customermember plans to retire within a month requested help with retirement planning  customermember is changing jobs and would like assistance moving their retirement funds from their old employer    same interview  very different needs each captured and handled in realtime     how it works digital banking customers answer two to three questions about their situation and needs and select an offer if appropriate micronotes automatically followsup on leads with segment appropriate followup campaigns micronotes reports full funnel

whether its a weather forecast for mountaineers or a pregnancy prediction by targets coupon marketing machine good predictions matter good predictions are particularly important in crossselling and retention where customers expect that the enterprise knows them – and the best way to demonstrate that you know your customers is to accurately anticipate their needs and intentions     anticipating customer needs and intentions was easier when customers came into branches and talked to their bankers about their lives today bankers have millions of digital breadcrumbs from which to piece together a life story  this level of analysis and prediction just isnt possible with a spreadsheet a pot of coffee and a long night machines have to do the work      how it works micronotes predict™ consumes the financial institutions’ marketing customer information file mcif via a secure file transfer protocol sftp joins that data file with a micronotes interview response file – where available – processes the data using predictive algorithms and outputs propensity values between zero and  which represent the probability that the customer will acquire a particular product based upon their unique attributes  a file containing a score for each customer for each product is then sent to the financial institution for consumption by email direct mail and crm based marketers – as well as

customer experience marketing roi and retention the value of a marketing campaign is equal to the value of good leads produced minus the cost of mistargeting  all else being equal reducing mistargeting improves both campaign value and customer experience simultaneously   for example we’re able to improve the probability that a conversation will generate a mortgage sale by  using machine learning  we generate fewer mortgage leads but more sales  thats good for everyone   we also use machine learning to predict which profitable customers are at risk of leaving to initiate account

electronic banking and social media continue to grow the opportunity to market to existing customers and leverage social media based referrals has never been greater bridge the gap between online banking and social media deepen customer relationships and supercharge referrals with micronotes social™  micronotes social enables financial institutions to target customers in social media based on bank held data to broaden the bank’s digital footprint and crosssell more effectively   deepening relationships with existing customers is the most efficient way to achieve growth yet realizing the full potential of cross selling has been difficult for most financial institutions with the migration of customers to digital and social channels and with inbranch conversations becoming rare the need to provide a coherent and relevant crosschannel digital experience has never been greater   digital banking and social media growup… separately  an increasing number of customers are using online banking and social media to conduct their lives  however these two digital spaces are disconnected and lack coherence  wouldn’t it be rewarding if your banking provider used the data they already had to inform their social media advertising  for example if you explicitly told your bank that you were buying a car wouldn’t it be nice to receive car buying tips in your facebook or twitter feeds  micronotes social enables financial institutions to do just that perceive a need reason a solution and act across channels automatically    select and target existing customers in facebook® and twitter®  advanced data analytics and digital interviews help financial institutions understand individual customer needs and target those with a propensity to buy  however leveraging those insights to reach existing customers on facebook and twitter has been difficult given only a small fraction of the customers of financial institutions are facebook fans or twitter followers   micronotes social enables financial institutions to target select existing customers for retargeting in social media  for example a marketer may wish to target all customers who have a high propensity for an auto loan or who explicitly said during an online conversation through the micronotes platform that they were buying a vehicle soon  using micronotes social that audience can be defined and retargeted in the facebook news feed as shown below     how micronotes social works micronotes social leverages the analytics targeting interviewing and campaign management systems of micronotes crosssell™ to tag select customers for targeting or retargeting in facebook and twitter     an audience definition based on bankheld data and a social communication are created in micronotes campaign manager and a campaign is launched ad images and text are loaded into the facebook and twitter campaign management systems select customers are automatically tagged for specific ads during online banking visits tags are read by facebook and twitter and segment appropriate ads are rendered in addition micronotes’ managed service system ensures that the financial institution’s staff doesn’t have to learn new software or manage content across social media sites we do that all with the financial institution acting in an approval role     better targeting to existing customers equals better engagement  micronotes social complements micronotes crosssell by adding the power of social media to the channel mix banks and credit unions should expect materially higher clickthrough and conversion rates with micronotes social because of the superrelevant targeting of advertising to existing customers who are inherently more likely to buy    key benefits materially higher clickthrough and conversion rates for social media advertising targets existing customers in social media using bankheld data broadens financial institutions’ digital footprint into more existing customers’ social media experience leverages the power of social media to gain more referrals from existing customers through likes shares and retweets      inquiries microinterview trademark of micronotes inc serial number
