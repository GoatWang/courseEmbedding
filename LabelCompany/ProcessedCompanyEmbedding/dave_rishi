marketers — vb engage stewart rogerstherealsjrtravis wright ccpdigitalteedubya july    am this week travis and stewart discuss google’s latest lab project — vr ads apparently we can’t escape ads even in our virtual realities we also talk about some smart aipowered video solutions and analytics for smart speakers rishi dave is our guest in this episode which gives us a chance to be schooled by one of the leading cmos on everything martechrelated including the future of ai by listening to this episode of vb engage you will hear welcome to vb engage episode   stewart and travis hung out in vancouver at the unbounce cta conference  ctaconf was a spectacular marketing conference with some of the top minds in marketing speaking at the event  we interviewed unbounce ceo oli gardner on the stage in front of  marketers  there will be an upcoming series of vb engage ctaconf interviews with the likes of mari smith rand fishkin scott stratton and wil reynolds  adobe launches voice analytics for siri alexa and other intelligent assistants  adobe has done a bit of rebranding on its cloud it has the marketing cloud the analytics cloud and the creative cloud  adobe analytics for intelligent assistants tracks metrics like  user id intent number of users number of sessions session length frequency of use error rate frequency of use and error rate are the two the most important metrics in conversational ui  google wants to bring advertising into virtual reality with the ad cube  google makes  percent of its money from advertising — did you think they would not create vr ads  in vr there will be few moments when we have buyer’s intent while in vr  get your ad blockers ready for the cube  google’s aipowered video analyzer hits public beta this week  one big use case for this ai video analyzer is with the identification of adult content to help with safe search  it is getting better at reading emotions  this will certainly evolve into vrar visual analytics  back in the day travis imagined buying a jacket that joey was wearing on this one episode of friends with this tech you’ll be able to identify products easily  when this product identification interface is embedded into ar glasses buying products will be inspired by real world interactions  now let’s chat with rishi dave cmo of dun  bradstreet  rishi calls himself “the chief madness officer”  each week we discuss something new with artificial intelligence and how that impacts the life of the marketer  before we can tackle ai marketers need to tackle data quality and predictive models for your data  marketers are not thinking about their data enough still  start with the data and leverage thirdparty data to help you clean up and optimize your data  create a master data set by cleaning your data the duns number is the unifying id  now you can build models on top of that data with artificial intelligence to gain insights  how can you better surface those insights  dnb recently acquired avention to help with sales acceleration  every week we are covering companies that are using ai in marketing but none of that matters if your data is bad  beyond ai what can marketers be doing now to get back to being good marketers  the biggest thing that marketers can do is to accept that change is happening with ai and think about the change management within your organization  marketing is madness and we need more specialists dnb hires specialists  experts like to work within their silos rishi creates “tiger teams” crossfunctional teams in service of particular customers and personas  start to create processes that take advantage of these changes  hire people who are not just specialists but can collaborate  how can organizations break down the silo between sales and marketing  if you have a blurred line between sales and marketing that’s how you know you have effective alignment  pipeline doesn’t pay the bills  marketing has to metric itself to sales like sales metrics itself to sales  joint metrics based on bottom line sales  facial recognition via your ar glasses to gain insights on the people in the room with you is not science fiction  with elon musk’s neurallink we will become sales and marketing cyborgs before we know it  next week we chat with the one and only ben parr cofounder of octaneai and he shares with us the secret to a killer facebook chatbot last week travis and stewart interviewed damien mahoney ceo of stackla who tells us everything we need to know about usergenerated content machine learning ai and what the future holds for consumer engagement as always thanks for tuning in to vb engage please review it and rate it on your favorite podcast platform i mean after all it’s the least you could do after listening to all of these episodes until next week vb recommendations mount  blade is a much bigger deal than you think sec must improve how it protects its networks against cyberattacks says watchdog ‘uber’s ceo will not be

exec brings marketing tech content strategy to yearold company by kate maddox published on october   most popular rishi dave was named cmo at dun  bradstreet in february  the first cmo in recent history at the financial services company and one of the first major hires by bob carrigan the former ceo of idg communications who was appointed presidentceo of db last september mr dave who previously served as executive directordigital marketing for the btob business at dell is bringing his skills in social media content marketing and mobile to transform the yearold companys marketing team into a more digitally focused organization rishi dave one of his first moves was selecting droga new york as creative agency of record to handle a brand relaunch that will be unveiled early next year including everything from a new visual identity to a redefined brand purpose in the following interview mr dave discusses how hes bringing change to an established financial services company and using new technologies and strategies to achieve his goals advertising age what is your biggest challenge mr dave the challenge is dun  bradstreet is a yearold company that is known for credit reporting but that is only a part of what we do as we modernize our company our brand must reflect not just what we have been but where we are today  which is providing data to some of the biggest corporations in the world  and where we will be tomorrow the biggest challenge is really locking down in a very simple way what our purpose is and building a communications and messaging strategy behind that the next big piece is how we activate it we dont want to activate it in a traditional way  it wont be a traditional bigbang tvtype launch the btob buyer is very different now  very digitally focused so a lot of what were doing is modern digitally focused activation ad age what will the relaunch include mr dave were looking at the whole stack there are really three components to the activation the first is a marketing and content platform things like marketing automation content management and content operations the second is analytics  how we manage analytics track and report the third is content and thought leadership we just hired a head of content our customers interact with us through content and thought leadership and were focused on building scalable alwayson content to drive inbound marketing ad age you did a lot of mobile at dell are you using mobile as part of your strategy at db mr dave we are absolutely doing mobile we have a product called mobile iq that enables the field sales team to have data on mobile phones and were looking at executing all of our marketing with a mobilefirst mentality the site today is responsivedesign and in the future it will be completely mobileoptimized ad age what are some of the differences in moving from a hightech computer company to an established financial services company mr dave one of the differences is because its an iconic yearold company theres a lot of history there as we looked at our history  president lincoln was an employee of db  it helped guide how we brand ourselves and where were going there are also different skill sets in terms of marketing at dell i ran digital marketing and here i run marketing across all the different functions one of the big differences when i came on is that all aspects of marketing around the world were pulled together under the cmo directly reporting to the ceo marketing became a global function across all aspects whereas before it was more
