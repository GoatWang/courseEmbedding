management  probity advisors inc  a member of wealth services alliance client login custom portfolio management individually managed accounts for every client every client is unique with different goals and levels of risk tolerance but to us it goes beyond that every client has a story – a dream of early retirement a goal of traveling around the world or the basic desire not to outlive your money that’s why we believe in individually managed accounts and a customized plan – for every client an individually managed account is a professionally managed portfolio of securities that are owned directly by the client unlike mutual funds these assets aren’t commingled with those of other investors that means we can customize the investments to reflect your personal preferences and manage these accounts for minimum tax impact in short you get all the benefits of professional money management with the flexibility control and potential tax advantages of owning individual securities in the past individually managed accounts were only an option for the very wealthy investor using advanced technology experience and resources probity advisors has made these customized portfolios available to a broader range of clients so more people can take advantage of the benefits we’ve developed our investment methodology to focus on longterm wealth creation and capital preservation it’s how we can help you achieve your individual goals – no matter the size of your portfolio our investment philosophy probity advisors approaches the investment process with four basic goals in mind fully understand your needs and objectives design a custom diversified portfolio that is consistent with your needs and objectives regularly review and optimize holdings based on economic conditions our analysis and research approach everything we do with honesty and integrity our investment methodology probity advisors takes a comprehensive approach when investing client portfolios – including profiling and suitability analysis securities research and portfolio execution and monitoring the cornerstone of our custom portfolios is the frontier analytic where we take qualitative feedback from you – then determine the appropriate return objective given your risk tolerance this risk tolerance profile guides our portfolio managers in developing an asset allocation strategy that is both unique and suited to your needs the investment process doesn’t end there our team regularly reviews portfolios to ensure they are best positioned for the current environment and according to your changing life circumstances a oneofakind investment experience our methodology is based on extensive research our clients’ specific goals and preferences our knowledge and our expertise each one of our clients’ portfolios is managed individually with its own goals objectives and risk tolerance levels as a result every portfolio is unique – holding different securities and asset classes – each customdesigned for the individual needs of the client the result is a wellplanned wellresearched oneofakind investment experience for every client no matter what size that portfolio may be that’s true value that’s the probity advisors difference personal portfolio personal service some say it we do it probity advisors keeps the communication going from our first meeting on you can expect a level of access you’ve never had before and a higher level of commitment from everyone at our firm our mission is simple – to empower clients through solid individualized financial management and we deliver on that promise every day what makes individually managed accounts better customization probity advisors customizes every portfolio around our client’s need for growth or income social and moral concerns and tax liabilities tax sensitivity investors in mutual funds can be exposed to unanticipated tax liabilities resulting from excessive trading or prior capital gains which can negatively impact the portfolio’s overall performance individually managed accounts help minimize tax liability by managing securities with the individual investor’s tax consequences in mind individual market entry and exit with individually managed accounts security sale and purchase points can be carefully selected or targeted this strategy provides the opportunity for enhanced returns but creates a cost basis and profitloss that are unique to the individual – unlike pooled accounts where investors could share tax liability regardless of personal gain diversification investments are allocated in a variety of investment styles and disciplines to better insulate the portfolio from market fluctuations transparency clients are always aware of the investments they hold and better informed of the fees charged
