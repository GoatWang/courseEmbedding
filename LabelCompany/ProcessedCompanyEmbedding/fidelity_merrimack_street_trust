altman who was at the time an assistant professor of finance at new york university the formula may be used to predict the probability that a firm will go into bankruptcy within two years zscores are used to predict corporate defaults and an easytocalculate control measure for the financial distress status of companies in academic studies the zscore uses multiple corporate income and balance sheet values to measure the financial health of a company the zscore is a linear combination of four or five common business ratios weighted by coefficients the coefficients were estimated by identifying a set of firms which had declared bankruptcy and then collecting a matched sample of firms which had survived with matching by industry and approximate size assets professor altman applied the statistical method of discriminant analysis to a dataset of publicly held manufacturers the estimation was originally based on data from publicly held manufacturers but has since been reestimated based on other datasets for private manufacturing nonmanufacturing and service companies zscore applies to us manufacturing companies zscore applies to us private manufacturing companies and zscore applies to all other companies us nonmanufacturing and all nonus companies the original data sample consisted of  firms half of which had filed for bankruptcy under chapter  all businesses in the database were manufacturers and small firms with assets of less than  million were eliminated dr altman found that the ratio profile for the bankrupt group fell at  average and for the nonbankrupt group at  average classification of zseries scores zscore went through further development zscore and zscore models were added laterzscore  us public manufacturing companiesz score  us private
