rental for three years and never had any problems with the company or the house we actually had to break our lease early but davidson and the owner worked with us and after paying the reletting fees the house was quickly on the market which was good for us because someone leased it a week later the owner was wonderful and understanding of our situation so we are very blessed we did have to have pest control come out a few times a year but thats pretty typical of san antonio we have to do the same thing at our new place too here in houston hendricks property management llcrlewis ratedit has been a pleasure to be a tenant of hendricks from day one the whole team has been very easy to deal with and super responsive with issues from the office staff to the maintenance guys youll find nothing but helpful people you can rely on even their website is great and makes paying rent online a breeze as someone who has rented for almost  years across various cities and states from private owners other management companies and huge corporate highrises i can easily say hendricks property services is one of the bestdavidson properties incappleblossom ratedthe staff has been very polite and helpful we needed to move immediately and they were willing to work with us to get us in quick and easy they emailed us the lease and we went through the whole process electronically which was soo convenient the house is in good shape but weve had a few maintenance issues since moving in primarily ac and they have been quick to get the problems fixed still getting used to the texas heat lol

with the tenants so i dont have to they only contact me if there is a big issue that i need to be aware of i get monthly electronic statements with a full accounting of what happened that month at tax time i simply print out their year end statement and give that to my accountanthendricks property management llcmartyyost ratedhendricks property management is really easy to deal with they are very direct and down to earth yet friendly and always ready to help they understand that it is best to deal with potential problems before they happen rather than rushing around to solve things after they happen he also sees the tenants as real people and deals with them that way rather than viewing them as potential adversaries they’ve always been up front with mehallada property managementlinds s ratedhorrible customer service they will get around to taking care of maintenence only when you hound them to death my home owner doesnt want to pay for vents to be cleaned because it isnt federally regulated i payed for it  hallada had to be called x and i still havent received an answer whether or not the owner would cover the expense i was tired of my fam having on and off sinus trouble for a year and a half davidson properties inccilla w ratedi dont have a single bad thing to say about davidson properties we love the house we are renting we love the neighborhood and the price is right we deal with ashley in the office for maintenance requests and she has been a doll actually all the ladies have been great and super sweet  they always have smiles on their faces we will definitely be
