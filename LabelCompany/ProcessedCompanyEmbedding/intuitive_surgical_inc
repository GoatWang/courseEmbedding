surgery where is the da vinci surgical system being used now will the da vinci surgical system make the surgeon unnecessary while using the da vinci surgical system can the surgeon feel anything inside the patients chest or abdomen is a surgeon using the da vinci surgical system operating in virtual reality is this robotic surgery is this telesurgery can surgeons operate over long distances is intuitive surgical developing theda vinci system for telesurgical applications is intuitives technology patented why isnt intuitive surgical getting involved in the defense advanced research projects agency darpa defense sciences project to develop robotic technology for use on the battlefield where is intuitive headquartered what is the average cost of the da vinci surgical system   q why is the company called intuitive surgical a the company is called intuitive surgical because its technologies allow surgeons to operate intuitively with the same direct approach as open surgery but through small incisions laparoscopically unlike with traditional laparoscopy when a da vinci surgeon moves the hand controls at the surgeon console clockwise the tiny wristed instruments inside the patient also move clockwise with the da vinci system left means left and right means right similar to the maneuvers of open surgery q what is minimally invasive surgery mis a minimally invasive surgery also called laparoscopy or laparoscopic surgery is used on patients diagnosed with many different conditions during minimally invasive surgery surgeons operate through one or more small incisions depending on the type of surgery the da vinci® surgical system is a form of laparoscopic surgery that enables surgeons to operate using a d hd vision system and tiny instruments that bend and rotate far greater than the human hand as a result of this technology da vinci enables surgeons to operate with enhanced vision precision and control q why is the product called the da vinci® surgical system a the da vinci surgical system enables surgeons to operate minimally invasively through a few small incisions or the belly button similar to traditional laparoscopy using the da vinci system surgeons site at a nearby ergonomic console da vinci features a magnified d hd vision system and tiny wristed instruments that bend and rotate far greater than the human hand as a result of this technology da vinci enables surgeons to operate with enhanced vision precision and control learn more about da vinci surgery q has the da vinci surgical system been cleared by the fda a the us food and drug administration fda has cleared the da vinci surgical system for use in a wide range of procedures for additional information please see indications for use q what procedures have been performed using the da vinci surgical system a da vinci surgical procedures are routinely performed in the specialties of general urologic gynecologic transoral cardiac thoracic and pediatric surgery da vinci® singlesite™ technology enables surgeons to remove the gallbladder and uterus through one small incision in the belly button over the last decade the da vinci system has brought minimally invasive surgery to over  million patients worldwide q are there studies showing that da vinci surgery is better than traditional open surgery a since  more than  peerreviewed publications have appeared in various clinical journals on da vinci surgery the amount of clinical evidence on the da vinci system is increasing at a rate of  publications per month q where is the da vinci surgical system being used now a the da vinci surgical system is used in major centers in the united states france italy germany and spain as well as in many other countries around the world to locate a hospital or surgeon go to httpwwwdavincisurgeonlocatorcom q will the da vinci surgical system make the surgeon unnecessary a on the contrary the da vinci system is designed to enable surgeons to operate with enhanced vision precision and control the da vinci system translates the surgeons hand movements into smaller precise movements of the miniaturized instruments inside the patients body the da vinci system is  controlled by the surgeon and can never be programmed to make surgical maneuvers on its own q while using the da vinci surgical system can the surgeon feel anything inside the patients chest or abdomen a motors on the system move the robotic arms and instruments in response to the surgeon’s hand movements on the controls as a result the surgeon receives or feels subtle physical “feedback” while holding the controls this feedback provides a substitute for the actual sense of touch and is augmented by the enhanced vision provided by the high definition d view while surgeons are not able to touch or feel the anatomy as in open surgery they indicate that the visualization precision dexterity and control that da vinci offers them during surgery more than compensates for the loss of touch q is a surgeon using theda vinci surgical system operating in virtual reality a no although seated at a console a few feet from the patient the surgeon views an actual image inside the patient’s body while operating in realtime at no time does the surgeon see a virtual image or program the system to perform any independent maneuvers outside of the surgeons direct realtime control q is this robotic surgery a robotic surgical devices are designed to perform entirely independent movements after being programmed by a surgeon the da vinci surgical system is a computerenhanced system that introduces a computer interface and dhd vision system between the surgeons eyes hands and the tips of microinstruments the system mimics the surgeons hand movements in real time it cannot be programmed nor can it make decisions on its own to move or perform any type of surgical maneuver so while the general term robotic surgery is often used to refer to our technology it is not robotic surgery in the strictest sense of the term q is this telesurgery can you operate over long distances a our robotic surgical platforms currently allow surgeons to perform complex procedures using a minimally invasive approach in the interest of improving the surgeon training experience and expanding training programs we are exploring telesurgery as a way to provide more convenient or expedient surgeontosurgeon proctoring and coaching we see telesurgery as a means to allow surgeons to learn and optimize their roboticassisted surgery skills under the guidance of leading specialists – with less disruption to clinical schedules due to travel — and therefore less impact on patients q is intuitive surgical developing the da vinci system for telesurgical applications a intuitive surgicals goal is to extend the benefits of minimally invasive surgery to as many patients as possible our strategy to achieve this includes the development of products that allow doctors to rapidly expand their surgical techniques and capabilities our robotic surgical platforms currently allow surgeons to perform complex procedures using a minimally invasive approach in the interest of improving the surgeon training experience and expanding training programs we are exploring telesurgery as a way to provide more convenient or expedient surgeontosurgeon proctoring and coaching we see telesurgery as a means to allow surgeons to learn and optimize their roboticassisted surgery skills under the guidance of leading specialists – with less disruption to clinical schedules due to travel — and therefore less impact on patients q is intuitives technology patented a intuitive has an extensive patent portfolio of internally developed technology as well as a variety of patents acquired or exclusively licensed from leaders in surgical robotics q why isnt intuitive surgical getting involved in the defense advanced research projects agency darpa defense sciences project to develop robotic technology for use on the battlefield a the darpa project was in fact the project that inspired the creation of the first da vinci system and intuitive surgicals da vinci surgical system could theoretically be used to operate over long distances however optimizing the da vinci system for remote or telesurgery applications is not the primary focus of the companys product design and development efforts and this capability is not available with the current da vinci surgical system intuitive surgical is optimizing its products for applications in minimally invasive surgery today q where is intuitive headquartered a intuitives principal corporate offices are located in sunnyvale california united states which is in silicon valley near san jose q how are intuitives products sold a we currently market our system in the united states through a direct sales organization to hospitals we have european operations headquartered in aubonne switzerland and asiapacific operations headquartered in shanghai china we sell directly in some european countries and in korea and we use distributors and agents throughout the rest of the world q what is the average cost of the da vinci surgical system a the average selling price of the da vinci system varies according to model features service contract etc please see our investor presentation for more

surgical system  overview  criticism  references  external links historyedit the research that eventually led to the development of the da vinci surgical system was performed in the late s at nonprofit research institute sri international in  sri received funding from the national institutes of health sri developed a prototype robotic surgical system that caught the interest of the defense advanced research projects agency darpa which was interested in the system for its potential to allow surgeons to operate remotely on soldiers wounded on the battlefield in  dr frederic moll became interested in the sri system as the device was known at the time at the time moll was employed by guidant he tried to interest guidant in backing it to no avail in  moll was introduced to john freund who had recently left acuson corporation freund negotiated an option to acquire sris intellectual property and incorporated a new company that he named intuitive surgical devices inc at that point freund moll and robert younge also from acuson wrote the business plan for the company and raised its initial venture capital early investors included the mayfield fund sierra ventures and morgan

surgical system da vinci surgical system manufacturer intuitive surgical type robotic surgery the da vinci surgical system is a robotic surgical system the system is controlled by a surgeon from a console it is commonly used for prostatectomies and increasingly for cardiac valve repair and gynecologic surgical procedures overviewedit the da vinci system has been designed to improve upon conventional laparoscopy in which the surgeon operates while standing using handheld longshafted instruments which have no wrists the da vinci system consists of a surgeon’s console that is typically in the same room as the patient and a patientside cart with four interactive robotic arms controlled from the console three of the arms are for tools that hold objects act as a scalpel scissors bovie or unipolar or bipolar electrocautery instruments the fourth arm is for an endoscopic camera with two lenses that gives the surgeon full stereoscopic vision from the console the surgeon sits at the console and looks through two eye holes at a d image of the procedure meanwhile maneuvering the arms with two hand controllers right sided foot controls operate the energy supplied to the instruments to cauterize coagulate or cut the tissue left sided foot controls help to move the endoscopic camera in or out and therefore bring the surgical image closer or further away the da vinci system scales filters and translates the surgeons hand movements into more precise micromovements of the instruments which operate through small incisions in the body by providing surgeons with superior visualization enhanced dexterity greater precision and ergonomic comfort the da vinci surgical system makes it possible for more surgeons to perform minimally invasive procedures involving complex dissection or reconstruction for the patient a da vinci procedure can offer all the potential benefits of a minimally invasive procedure including less pain less blood loss and less need for blood transfusions moreover the da vinci system can enable a shorter hospital stay a quicker recovery and faster return to normal daily activities a da vinci surgical system costs approximately  million the new da vinci si released in april  cost about  million in addition there are maintenance contracts plus expenditures for instruments used during surgery surgical procedures performed with the robot

procedures with the use of the da vinci shortening lengthofstay in the hospital and reducing recovery times but because of the hefty cost of the robotic system it is not clear that it is costeffective

that these increased costs can be justified another problem is that in the medical literature very experienced surgeons tend to publish their results these however may not be representative of surgeons with lesser experience and there is a steep learning curve for surgeons who adopt use of the systemcitation needed on the other hand as more surgeons are being trained on davinci systems from the outset of their careers it is becoming apparent that the skills needed to become a successful davinci surgeon are similar to those that any good surgeon must develop good handeye coordination a talent for tissue handling and a thorough knowledge of anatomy are only enhanced through the davinci interface the difficult learning curve of handling the robot is merely familiarity with how to bring the machine close to the operating table and attaching it to the patient and how best to position the operating ports to allow optimal access to the target anatomy these obstacles are overcome quickly and enthusiastically when the surgeon realizes that the actual performance of the operation in the sitting position at the console is less physically demanding and more precise than with traditional laparoscopy this translates into a more relaxed and incontrol surgeon who may suffer fewer of the longterm physical consequences that result from prolonged standing precarious balancing

surgeons who devote themselves to nonrobotic laparoscopy onlycitation needed it is clearcitation needed that nonrobotic laparoscopic techniques are harder to learn and master than robotic techniques hospitals with successful davinci programs are finding that their costs are marginally but not significantlyclarification needed higher with robotic surgery greater numbers of patients especially

vinci robotic surgical system has been soaring but there are reasons to fear turbulence ahead keith speights tmffishbiz jun   at am intuitive surgical nasdaqisrg stock is on a roll so far in  shares of the robotic surgical system developer are up more than  year to date and recently hit an alltime high the obvious question for investors when a stock has been enjoying the kind of tremendous momentum that intuitive surgical has recently is can it last the answer depends on the level of risk thats associated with investing in the stock how risky is intuitive surgical right now  image source getty images not too risky theres a good case to be made that intuitive surgical isnt very risky at all from a business perspective demand for its da vinci robotic surgical systems is growing steadily in  around  surgical procedures were performed across the world with da vinci up more than  from the prior year in the us general surgery is the systems fastestgrowing specialty this includes hernia repair colorectal procedures and gallbladder removal outside of the us urology procedures generated the most growth hospitals that buy the da vinci system have an inherent motivation to maximize the value of their investment as a result they perform as many procedures as they can using it this benefits intuitive surgical because the company sells instruments and accessories for the system that either wear out frequently or are disposable last year recurring revenue primarily from these sales accounted for  of its total revenue the company also stands to benefit from demographic trends over the next few years the two largest us generations  baby boomers and millennials  will hit the age ranges in which several of the most common da vinciassisted procedures are most likely to be required while intuitive surgical should be able to count on growing recurring revenue from these factors it should also be in good position to sell plenty of new systems less than  of da vinci surgical systems sold have been installed outside of the us which means a large international market remains for the company to pursue intuitive surgical is also exploring new and more complex types of procedures for da vinci which should open the door to additional sales opportunities image source intuitive surgical very risky investors with a bearish view on intuitive surgical would be quick to point out that the companys growth was achieved during a period where there wasnt much competition thats about to change  and it could mean that intuitive surgical is at more risk than its ever been before medtronic nysemdt could be the most formidable rival waiting in the wings the medicaldevice companys market cap is more than three times that of intuitive surgical and it expects to launch its own robotic surgical system next year and the company has inroads with more hospitals across the world than intuitive surgical does then theres the potential disruptive innovator verb surgical its a joint venture between google parent alphabet nasdaqgoog nasdaqgoogl and healthcare giant johnson  johnson nysejnj verb surgical probably wont have a product on the market until  but when it arrives it could be a gamechanger the company plans to connect machine learning robotic surgery instrumentation advanced visualization and data analytics together in a way no other company has attempted while competitors could present a business risk to intuitive surgical the hazard to its stock price could be even greater intuitive surgical shares trade at a premium valuation of more than  times expected earnings its growth prospects are solid but they dont make the stock look more attractive intuitive surgicals peg ratio is   a very high level given the stocks ambitious valuation it could take a steep hit if the broader market goes through a correction  the best answer my view is that the best way to assess intuitive surgicals risk is to look at the question in terms of shortterm risk versus longterm risk over the short term its business seems to be at low risk thanks to the solid recurring revenue and trends discussed earlier its possible that the stock could decline but smart investors wont be too concerned about temporary pullbacks over the long term the company does face increased risk as more competitors enter the market however my guess at this point is that the risk is only moderate intuitive surgical enjoys a long history in the robotic surgical systems market that should give it a competitive advantage i expect the company to continue to develop new technologies that will allow it to compete effectively against new rivals how risky is intuitive surgical for now id say not too risky but investors should keep their eyes on medtronic and

da vinci surgical system was performed in the late s at nonprofit research institute sri international in  sri received funding from the national institutes of health sri developed a prototype robotic surgical system that caught the interest of the defense advanced research projects agency darpa which was interested in the system for its potential to allow surgeons to operate remotely on soldiers wounded on the battlefield in  dr frederic moll became interested in the sri system as the device was known at the time at the time moll was employed by guidant he tried to interest guidant in backing it to no avail in  moll was introduced to john freund who had recently left acuson corporation freund negotiated an option to acquire sris intellectual property and incorporated a new company that he named intuitive surgical devices inc at that point freund moll and robert younge also from acuson wrote the business plan for the company and raised its initial venture capital early investors included the mayfield fund sierra ventures and morgan stanleycitation needed the company refined the sri system into a prototype known originally as lenny after the young leonardo da vinci which was ready for testing in  as the companys prototypes became more advanced they were named using da vinci themes one was named leonardo and another was mona the final version of the prototype was nicknamed the da vinci surgical system and the name stuck when the system was eventually commercialized after further testing intuitive surgical began marketing this system in europe in  while awaiting fda approval in the united statescitation needed the company raised  million in an initial public offering in  that same year the fda approved use of the da vinci surgical system for general laparoscopic surgery which can be used to address gallbladder disease and gastroesophageal disease in  the fda approved use of the system for prostate surgery the fda has subsequently approved the system for thoracoscopic surgery cardiac procedures performed with adjunctive incisions and gynecologic procedures shortly before going public intuitive surgical was sued for patent infringement by computer motion inc its chief rival computer motion had actually gotten into the robotic surgery field earlier than intuitive surgical with its own system the zeus robotic surgical system although the zeus system was approved in europe the us food and drug administration had not yet approved it for any procedure at the time that the fda first approved the da vinci system the uncertainty created by the litigation between the companies was a drag on each companys growth in  intuitive surgical and computer motion agreed to merge thus ending the litigation between them the zeus system was ultimately phased out in favor of the da vinci system before the buyout of computer motion the stock of intuitive was selling at around  per share adjusted for stock splits after the merger the stock price rose significantly and by  it was at about  primarily because of the growth in systems sold  in  compared with  in  and the number of surgical procedures performed less than  in  compared with  in  da vinci surgical systemedit main article da vinci surgical system da vinci surgical system manufacturer intuitive surgical type robotic surgery the da vinci surgical system is a robotic surgical system the system is controlled by a surgeon from a console it is commonly used for prostatectomies and increasingly for cardiac valve repair and gynecologic surgical procedures overviewedit the da vinci system has been designed to improve upon conventional laparoscopy in which the surgeon operates while standing using handheld longshafted instruments which have no wrists the da vinci system consists of a surgeon’s console that is typically in the same room as the patient and a patientside cart with four interactive robotic arms controlled from the console three of the arms are for tools that hold objects act as a scalpel scissors bovie or unipolar or bipolar electrocautery instruments the fourth arm is for an endoscopic camera with two lenses that gives the surgeon full stereoscopic vision from the console the surgeon sits at the console and looks through two eye holes at a d image of the procedure meanwhile maneuvering the arms with two hand controllers right sided foot controls operate the energy supplied to the instruments to cauterize coagulate or cut the tissue left sided foot controls help to move the endoscopic camera in or out and therefore bring the surgical image closer or further away the da vinci system scales filters and translates the surgeons hand movements into more precise micromovements of the instruments which operate through small incisions in the body by providing surgeons with superior visualization enhanced dexterity greater precision and ergonomic comfort the da vinci surgical system makes it possible for more surgeons to perform minimally invasive procedures involving complex dissection or reconstruction for the patient a da vinci procedure can offer all the potential benefits of a minimally invasive procedure including less pain less blood loss and less need for blood transfusions moreover the da vinci system can enable a shorter hospital stay a quicker recovery and faster return to normal daily activities a da vinci surgical system costs approximately  million the new da vinci si released in april  cost about  million in addition there are maintenance contracts plus expenditures for instruments used during surgery surgical procedures performed with the robot take longer than traditional ones critics have pointed out that hospitals have a hard time recovering the cost and that most clinical data does not support the claim of improved patient outcomes criticismedit on may   computer motion inc of goleta california filed suit against intuitive surgical alleging infringement by intuitive surgical of seven us patents relating to robotic surgery while the use of robotic surgery has become an item in the advertisement of medical services critics point out a lack of studies that indicate longterm results are superior to results following laparoscopic surgery on the other hand there is no questioncitation needed that some procedures that have traditionally been performed with large incisions can be converted to minimally invasive endoscopic procedures with the use of the da vinci shortening lengthofstay in the hospital and reducing recovery times but because of the hefty cost of the robotic system it is not clear that it is costeffective for hospitals and physicians despite any benefits to patients since there is no additional reimbursement paid by the government or insurance companies when the system is used data are absent to show that these increased costs can be justified another problem is that in the medical literature very experienced surgeons tend to publish their results these however may not be representative of surgeons with lesser experience and there is a steep learning curve for surgeons who adopt use of the systemcitation needed on the other hand as more surgeons are being trained on davinci systems from the outset of their careers it is becoming apparent that the skills needed to become a successful davinci surgeon are similar to those that any good surgeon must develop good handeye coordination a talent for tissue handling and a thorough knowledge of anatomy are only enhanced through the davinci interface the difficult learning curve of handling the robot is merely familiarity with how to bring the machine close to the operating table and attaching it to the patient and how best to position the operating ports to allow optimal access to the target anatomy these obstacles are overcome quickly and enthusiastically when the surgeon realizes that the actual performance of the operation in the sitting position at the console is less physically demanding and more precise than with traditional laparoscopy this translates into a more relaxed and incontrol surgeon who may suffer fewer of the longterm physical consequences that result from prolonged standing precarious balancing and neck craning that often accompany traditional laparoscopic surgerycitation needed and finally davinci robotic surgical techniques are learned more quickly by more surgeons than are learned by surgeons who devote themselves to nonrobotic laparoscopy onlycitation needed it is clearcitation needed that nonrobotic laparoscopic techniques are harder to learn and master than robotic techniques hospitals with successful davinci programs are finding that their costs are marginally but not significantlyclarification needed higher with robotic surgery greater numbers of patients especially those that suffer from obesity can undergo a safe robotic operation whereas before nonsurgical options were emphasized for those with high bmi values one advantage to davinci may well be its ability to extend safe surgical options to more individuals referencesedit  a b c d e f g h intuitive surgical inc  annual report form k xbrl united states

surgical systems most notably the da vinci surgical system the da vinci surgical system allows surgery to be performed using robotic manipulators the company is part of the nasdaq and sp  intuitive surgical has installed over  systems worldwide as of july  computer motion was a competitor that merged with intuitive surgical in  contents  history  da vinci surgical system  overview  criticism  references  external links historyedit the research that eventually led to the development of the da vinci surgical system was performed in the late s at nonprofit research institute sri international in  sri received funding from the national institutes of health sri developed a prototype robotic surgical system that caught the interest of the defense advanced research projects agency darpa which was interested in the system for its potential to allow surgeons to operate remotely on soldiers wounded on the battlefield in  dr frederic moll became interested in the sri system as the device was known at the time at the time moll was employed by guidant he tried to interest guidant in backing it to no avail in  moll was introduced to john freund who had recently left acuson corporation freund negotiated an option to acquire sris intellectual property and incorporated a new company that he named intuitive surgical devices inc at that point freund moll and robert younge also from acuson wrote the business plan for the company and raised its initial venture capital early investors included the mayfield fund sierra ventures and morgan stanleycitation needed the company refined the sri system into a prototype known originally as lenny after the young leonardo da vinci which was ready for testing in  as the companys prototypes became more advanced they were named using da vinci themes one was named leonardo and another was mona the final version of the prototype was nicknamed the da vinci surgical system and the name stuck when the system was eventually commercialized after further testing intuitive surgical began marketing this system in europe in  while awaiting fda approval in the united statescitation needed the company raised  million in an initial public offering in  that same year the fda approved use of the da vinci surgical system for general laparoscopic surgery which can be used to address gallbladder disease and gastroesophageal disease in  the fda approved use of the system for prostate surgery the fda has subsequently approved the system for thoracoscopic surgery cardiac procedures performed with adjunctive incisions and gynecologic procedures shortly before going public intuitive surgical was sued for patent infringement by computer motion inc its chief rival computer motion had actually gotten into the robotic surgery field earlier than intuitive surgical with its own system the zeus robotic surgical system although the zeus system was approved in europe the us food and drug administration had not yet approved it for any procedure at the time that the fda first approved the da vinci system the uncertainty created by the litigation between the companies was a drag on each companys growth in  intuitive surgical and computer motion agreed to merge thus ending the litigation between them the zeus system was ultimately phased out in favor of the da vinci system before the buyout of computer motion the stock of intuitive was selling at around  per share adjusted for stock splits after the merger the stock price rose significantly and by  it was at about  primarily because of the growth in systems sold  in  compared with  in  and the number of surgical procedures performed less than  in  compared with  in  da vinci surgical systemedit main article da vinci surgical system da vinci surgical system manufacturer intuitive surgical type robotic surgery the da vinci surgical system is a robotic surgical system the system is controlled by a surgeon from a console it is commonly used for prostatectomies and increasingly for cardiac valve repair and gynecologic surgical procedures overviewedit the da vinci system has been designed to improve upon conventional laparoscopy in which the surgeon operates while standing using handheld longshafted instruments which have no wrists the da vinci system consists of a surgeon’s console that is typically in the same room as the patient and a patientside cart with four interactive robotic arms controlled from the console three of the arms are for tools that hold objects act as a scalpel scissors bovie or unipolar or bipolar electrocautery instruments the fourth arm is for an endoscopic camera with two lenses that gives the surgeon full stereoscopic vision from the console the surgeon sits at the console and looks through two eye holes at a d image of the procedure meanwhile maneuvering the arms with two hand controllers right sided foot controls operate the energy supplied to the instruments to cauterize coagulate or cut the tissue left sided foot controls help to move the endoscopic camera in or out and therefore bring the surgical image closer or further away the da vinci system scales filters and translates the surgeons hand movements into more precise micromovements of the instruments which operate through small incisions in the body by providing surgeons with superior visualization enhanced dexterity greater precision and ergonomic comfort the da vinci surgical system makes it possible for more surgeons to perform minimally invasive procedures involving complex dissection or reconstruction for the patient a da vinci procedure can offer all the potential benefits of a minimally invasive procedure including less pain less blood loss and less need for blood transfusions moreover the da vinci system can enable a shorter hospital stay a quicker recovery and faster return to normal daily activities a da vinci surgical system costs approximately  million the new da vinci si released in april  cost about  million in addition there are maintenance contracts plus expenditures for instruments used during surgery surgical procedures performed with the robot take longer than traditional ones critics have pointed out that hospitals have a hard time recovering the cost and that most clinical data does not support the claim of improved patient outcomes criticismedit on may   computer motion inc of goleta california filed suit against intuitive surgical alleging infringement by intuitive surgical of seven us patents relating to robotic surgery while the use of robotic surgery has become an item in the advertisement of medical services critics point out a lack of studies that indicate longterm results are superior to results following laparoscopic surgery on the other hand there is no questioncitation needed that some procedures that have traditionally been performed with large incisions can be converted to minimally invasive endoscopic procedures with the use of the da vinci shortening lengthofstay in the hospital and reducing recovery times but because of the hefty cost of the robotic system it is not clear that it is costeffective for hospitals and physicians despite any benefits to patients since there is no additional reimbursement paid by the government or insurance companies when the system is used data are absent to show that these increased costs can be justified another problem is that in the medical literature very experienced surgeons tend to publish their results these however may not be representative of surgeons with lesser experience and there is a steep learning curve for surgeons who adopt use of the systemcitation needed on the other hand as more surgeons are being trained on davinci systems from the outset of their careers it is becoming apparent that the skills needed to become a successful davinci surgeon are similar to those that any good surgeon must develop good handeye coordination a talent for tissue handling and a thorough knowledge of anatomy are only enhanced through the davinci interface the difficult learning curve of handling the robot is merely familiarity with how to bring the machine close to the operating table and attaching it to the patient and how best to position the operating ports to allow optimal access to the target anatomy these obstacles are overcome quickly and enthusiastically when the surgeon realizes that the actual performance of the operation in the sitting position at the console is less physically demanding and more precise than with traditional laparoscopy this translates into a more relaxed and incontrol surgeon who may suffer fewer of the longterm physical consequences that result from prolonged standing precarious balancing and neck craning that often accompany traditional laparoscopic surgerycitation needed and finally davinci robotic surgical techniques are learned more quickly by more surgeons than are learned by surgeons who devote themselves to nonrobotic laparoscopy onlycitation needed it is clearcitation needed that nonrobotic laparoscopic techniques are harder to learn and master than robotic techniques hospitals with successful davinci programs are finding that their costs are marginally but not significantlyclarification needed higher with robotic surgery greater numbers of patients especially those that suffer from obesity can undergo a safe robotic operation whereas before nonsurgical options were emphasized for those with high bmi values one advantage to davinci may well be its ability to extend safe surgical options
