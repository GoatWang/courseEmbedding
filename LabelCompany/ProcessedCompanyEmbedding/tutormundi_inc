paul odette louis bagger emily van evera malcolm bilsson and jessye norman  the discs are arranged chronologically and mirror the content and structure of the anthology features do you use a recorded anthology in your course six compact discs complement the text and anthology of scores  produced by naxos of america in close coordination with prentice hall these recordings draw on the resources of many different recording labels and feature some of the most distinguished artists and ensembles of our time such as the gothic voices anonymous  the hilliard ensemble the orlando consort les arts

the discs are arranged chronologically and mirror the content and structure of the anthology new  new worksnew selections illustrating thcentury virtuosity thcentury nationalism and thcentury jazz have been added new  internal trackingsmost longer works now have internal trackings crossreferenced in the anthology of scores  this makes it easier for students to follow complex notation and to skip to specific structural movements in any given work such as the beginning of the recapitulation in a sonataform work or the beginning of a new text section in a vocal work new  alternative performancesfor each historical era at least one work is provided with an alternative performance available on the supplement compact disc built into the textbook  the frottola el grillo ascribed to josquin de prez for example is performed in its notated version by four voices in volume one of the recorded anthology the supplemental disc offers an additional very different realization of this same work by a solo singer accompanying herself on the lute  students are thereby encouraged to think about the many options available to them as performers for all music of all eras table of contents
