services firms we simply don’t believe that investors look to advisors to park their assets in investments and council them to ‘hang on’ we believe that investors want advisors that are watching over their hardearned savings as though they were their own that is exactly what we do we have and continue to work tirelessly to create and identify investment management solutions to help our clients navigate a volatile world we are not content to ‘buy and hope’ after all managing investments for others is an enormous responsibility and we have to sleep at night also our guiding principle at accurate investment solutions inc is to be proactive in managing the risks inherent in investing passive investing works well only when the market is surging ahead but when the inevitable downturns hit you must have a game plan to control risk we are now just over one decade into the new century and we have already seen two devastating bear markets it took the major equity market indexes nearly  years to get back to the levels that they had achieved in  if you are close to retirement you simply don’t have the luxury of waiting ten years or more for your portfolio to recover if you are already taking income from your portfolio you run the greatest risk of all – running out of money in retirement a passive investment portfolio also known as ‘the asset allocation pie’ is the standard recommendation from the majority of the financial services firms but the past decade has proven that a buyandhold investment strategy is inadequate next   ‣ our investment philosophy    pages of
