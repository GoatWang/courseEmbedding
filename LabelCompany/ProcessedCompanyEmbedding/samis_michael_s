equal – but some are more about the lives of immigrants in transit camps in israel in the s the title of the novel – shavim veshavim yoter – became a wellknown phrase depicting the struggles for equality of jews from arab countries this book opened the door for profound discussion about the socioeconomic gaps in israel and also about the situation of the arabs in israel sami michael has published  novels and  nonfiction books focusing on cultural political and social affairs in israel  plays and a childrens book most of michaels books were published by am oved publishers michael left am oved in  and moved to kinneret zmorabitan dvir publishers after receiving a very attractive offer granting him a fixed monthly salary his first book that published with them was aida michael has also written numerous articles and essays his writings and his social and political activities have made him a household name in israel michael has never been an author of the establishment which meant that he did not enjoy promotional or financial assistance two cities feature in many of michaels novels victoria storm among the palms a handful of fog and aida are set in his home town baghdad and refuge a trumpet in the wadi water kissing water and nabila are set in haifa his adopted city michael wrote about his departure from iraq and arrival in haifa when he wrote of his first day in haifa israel each kilometer that the airplane gulped took me further into a one way tunnel the flight was a difficult separation from a pained love when i opened my eyes i imagined that i was looking at a fata morgana which was stranger than anything i had ever known i loved haifa then and about half a century later i am faithful to this love but at the beginning of my first day in israel there were no designated moments for love set aside in  he left haifa for  years moving to the rural northern galilee town of maalot on the hillside overlooking a valley it is here that he wrote the novel brown devils about rock hyraxes that frequently stole the fruits of his welltended garden in  michael he returned to haifa sami michaels way – the man is the crown of creation literary way – is a route in the wadi nisnas an arab quarter of haifa named after michael in  literary extracts from his novels are written along the walls of the route both in hebrew and in arabic michael dedicated three novels to wadi nisnas including a trumpet in the wadi in  michael was appointed as an honorary member of the arabic language academy in israel in  the israeli high court of justice appointed michael as arbitrator to decide on a matter of education and multiculturalism the subject was widely covered in the press and his decision was a precedent in israel which still stands michael is the chairperson of the aachi council a council of iraqi artists in israel he was a member of staff of the jewish quarterly in london in  michael hosted a part series on the educational television channel on world literature where he engaged writers researchers and scholars in discussion about their favorite literary masterpieces a number of documentaries films and programs on michael have been made michael is a nominee for the nobel prize for literature writingedit michaels mother tongue is arabic it took him roughly  years to make the move from writing in arabic to hebrew by sheer persistence and strong will lacking any formal training he managed to gain a complete mastery of his new language he learned from listening and obsessive reading he defines this move as a miracle it sometimes happens to me while writing that i seek a word mischievous as it is it appears in english it appears in arabic but refuses to come in hebrew to some extent i made up my hebrew unquestionably the influence of arabic is dominant my syntax is almost arabic –sami michael unbounded ideas when victoria came out in cairo in the preface it was written that this is an arabic novel written in hebrew i took it as a compliment he wrote his first novel in arabic which won a prize awarded by the communist party on leaving the party he ceded publication of the book throwing the handwritten copy away unbounded ideas in his study amongst books in hebrew arabic and english – novels poetry politics history and science – lies on the table a students folder and inside it neatly arranged pages of his next novel – all handwritten in exemplary fashion on white paper rows of sentences in perfectly straight lines that later he will cross out again and again until he decides that this is it it can be typed not by himself at my age you want me to write on a computer i belong to the generation that does not press buttons but rather turn them he explains i could not do otherwise i need the contact of the pen where the words flow from the hand on to the page  michael has fixed hours for writing twice a day – morning and afternoon while writing he disconnects from everything he does not have a telephone in his study where he writes he insists on finishing the novel in the same room in which he started it he started to write victoria in his garden shed in maalot and when he sold the house and moved back to haifa he had not complete his book he asked the buyer to allow him to continue living there until he finished writing victoria – paying full rent of course during his writing he does not show it not even a chapter to anyone nor does he consult with anyone a good writer in known not only in by good writing but also in his ability to throw away without mercy to erase and to leave a pure text at the end of the process – approximately three years from the beginning of a book it will be typed he does not show his unfinished handwriting not even to his editor here is the place where stubbornness and the joy of creating join to become one determined decision with the last word left to michael at all times he mostly discards the whole novel and begins writing again he wrote the novel water kissing water over  years and the version that was finally published was the eighth version during this time he had other novels published including unbounded ideas he declares that he writes from the gut without planning out the novel he likes to surprise himself although he adds at the heart of literature is the plot when there is no plot in my opinion it is not literature but rather another academic exercise his books are bestsellers and his readers are from diverse social strata his style has been nurtured by both the treasures of the hebrew language and the wealth of the arab language many would say that michael generated the revolution of pluralism in israeli literature in that his protagonists are always “the other” mainly focusing on arabs women refugees and immigrants michael says life experience has given me a whole gallery of characters michael my childhood was soaked in the wisdom of women i was amazed by the richness of their imagination i remember with wonder how a woman at the age of  toothless would become pretty when playing a princess waiting for her prince his novels explore a wide range of interlocking relationships – social ethnic and political – between jews and arabs moslems and christians nationalists and communists and iraq and israel at times comparable to the multiple political identities within michael himself it is as if sometimes i feel i am two persons one is an arab iraqi the other an israeli jew michaels writing is characterized by its humor painful irony empathy and tolerance his style is clean direct and bare of symbols yet with an outstanding expressiveness each story exudes authenticity and personal involvementhis writing rich in imagery with a scathing realism he exposes the weaknesses and virtue of the human being but always with a jealous regard for his honor freedom and compassion in his books he describes the jewisharab conflict of its deep national psychological and social aspects the longing for social justice equality between peoples communities and gender are a central motif in michaels writing that smashes stereotypes and prejudices michael was the first hebrew author to make the arab the protagonist in his stories and his referring to him neither with arrogance nor idealization his style of writing milks both the treasures of the hebrew language and the wealth of the arab language in all his writing the sanctity of life is uppermost michaels books have been translated into many languages and used as text books at universities and schools in israel and abroad awards and

since his youth he has been active in the struggle for equality and human rights in israel he has never ceased to work for human rights michael was amongst a group of leaders of the communist

where he worked as an editor for four years at the same time he had a weekly column in which he wrote stories and articles under the pseudonym samir mared in  a short time before the mass disillusionment with stalin he ended his affiliation with the communist party and concluded his work on both papers …because they transgressed against all my ideals today i am a marxist communism was a beautiful illusion despite the disillusionment i will always believe in the human spirit and justice said michael i joined communism as a jew and i left communism as a jew wrote michael in unbounded ideas since leaving the communist party michael chose not to belong to any political organization in order to keep his conceptual independence as an intellectual not once has michael said i am a party of one man michael was amongst the first in israel s to call for coexistence between jews and arabs signing the first petition of artists and public figures calling for the establishment of a palestinian state michael was invited to give lectures in cairo directly following the signing of the peace agreement between israel and egypt during the first palestinian intifada uprising he was amongst a delegation of intellectuals that broke through idf barriers that besieged hebron in  michael was invited together with palestinian author emil habibi to tunis at a time when israelis could not travel there sponsored by unesco and the tunisian ministry of culture for a conference in carthago on arabic literature michael is known as a peace activist there are many definitions of war in different countries according to my experience i find that war is a type of disease that damages both body and soul and horribly distorts the images of people i myself am a product of two cultures arab and jewish and to this day i do not understand the destructive power which has brought the two cultures to life and death confrontations there is so much beauty and wisdom in the two cultures it is so easy to be clever and give advice from afar so hard to be wise and sane from within the flames michael established together with activities people a movement against meir kahane an advocate for the arab transfer in maalot where he lived for  years – michael was a partner in the struggle against the expulsion of palestinian south hebron mountain cave dwellers the state of israel was established thanks to international recognition which was granted following the holocaust and the deportations stating that the jewish people were entitled to establish a national home where the proverbial wandering jew and the refugee will find safe and secure habitat this would be evil if we were to expel the caves inhabitants if only because they dont have any defense or savior the expulsion of these wretched people undermine our moral right to sit as free men and women in our secure homes in tel aviv jerusalem and haifa there is abominable personal terror but the use of militaristic power to banish citizens from their shacks and from their caves is no less abominable event at tzavta tel aviv  in  michael together with david sasson created the forum of the peace initiative with syria the forum included intellectuals academics and business people such as yaakov peri amnon lipikin shahak and alon liel an extract of the declaration composed by michael we gave up sinai and in return we gained peace with egypt we call upon the government of israel upon those amongst us who are responsible for designing policy to listen to the voices that are making themselves heard from damascus peace with syria means peace with the region in which we live the price of peace is much cheaper than the bitter and destructive price of war he has written extensively on social and political matters for arabic and hebrew newspapers and occasionally for foreign newspapers his stance against stereotyping prejudices and racism is also reflected in his novels even in his first novel all men are equal – but some are more  he writes of these prejudices within jewish society in israel the novel was influential for the second generation of the immigrants who saw michael as a spiritual leader the name of the book became a wellknown saying on the everwidening social and economic gap in israel sami michael has said this is dangerous shortsightedness poverty is a hothouse for the collapse of democracy and culture poverty is not a natural disaster the rich need to understand that widespread poverty threatens in essence the existence of socialorder the most secured mansion with all its inhabitants will not endure if the mansion is built in the center of a shantytown  when the annual report of acri came out on international human rights day december   it noted author sami michael the associations president said upon the release of the report that racism was so rife it was damaging civil liberty in israel israeli society is reaching new heights of racism that damages freedom of expression and privacy a hundred years of conflict has given us a majority poisoned by ideological education –a racist majority even more extreme than its leadership  at the hebrew book fair in tel aviv when michael made a solitary demonstration against racism in emanuel a settlement town lets call a spade a spade the lords of emanuel are racists who imperil the values of judaism and democracy this separation fence of defilement which shady rabbis plot to plant in our souls must be uprooted… i will definitely demonstrate during the celebration of hebrew book week for a school is called the house of the book in hebrew… every man woman and teenager will be welcome to join me to extirpate the racist crime in immanuel today – and should we remain silent in all of israel tomorrow about the immigrant and foreigner the fact that we are talking about christians and buddhists and those without religion does not negate from them the possibility to be helped as the poor of my city how could we as jews that groaned under the evils of fascistic regimes adopt the same fascistic measures towards those who are prepared to come here israel to look after our sick and elderly and to strengthen our factories and what about the children of these foreign workers that were born here and whose only language is hebrew they no longer have another homeland and in whose name exactly are we entitled to trample on these people and their rights we that claimed the right and the duty to take care of the migrant the orphan and the widow  for years michael was a volunteer in the eran organization – an emotionalmental crisis hotline – israels only emotional first aid service provides a confidential hour hotline seven days a week  days a year michael also lectures voluntarily in prisons to prisoners both jews and arabs in  the israeli high court of justice appointed michael as arbitrator to decide on a matter of education and multiculturalism the subject was widely covered in the press and his decision was a precedent in israel which still stands michael is chairman of the council of ahi the council of iraqi born artists for encouragement of research literature and art in israel ramatgan in the early s he was on the editorial staff of the jewish quarterly published in london in  he was elected president of the society for solidarity between the people of israel and the people of iraq a nonprofit society founded by key public figures from cultural academic and intellectual circles in israeli society the group attracting much attention in israel the arab world and elsewhere stresses that a clear distinction ought to be made between the iraqi oppressive regime and the iraqi people who have unjustifiably borne the horrifying consequences of the ongoing conflict in the region the request of the group however to be registered as an official nonprofit organization was denied by the interior ministry’s registrar claiming that israeli law forbids “contact with enemy states” in april  the founders reestablished the society michael was reelected as its president in the same year after the fall of saddam husseins regime michael was invited to join the group of composers of the new iraqi constitution as he did not reside in iraq nor had he for many years he felt that it would not be right he did however have one request which was to insert one important clause the defense of minorities michael has close relations with many iraqis both in iraq and throughout the world his novel aida  is set in iraq in the days of saddam hussein friends from iraq sent him uptodate pictures of the country so that michael could see the iraq of today he wrote thereon in the acknowledgements of the novel i will not forget the good people who extended me their help which was priceless but i am not able to mention their names as it may put them in danger amongst them university professors businessmen and women and journalists who risked their freedom to help and where one of whom was actually arrested for this literary mission on religion secularism and judaismedit sami michael defines himself first of all as a jew and only secondly as an israeli he comes from a secular jewish family in baghdad in the jewish community in iraq we lived in harmony almost absolute between the religious and the secular in israel i demand the religious to respect my secularity i have a personal permit to talk with my own personal god for this i do not need the rabbinate –unbounded ideas michael an atheist wrote on judaism the jewish religion is somewhat like a covenant between the people and godly justice and at the same time constitutes a treaty of brotherhood and solidarity between people judaism has taken a dangerous route with the last generation in israel from within it an unbending nationalistic leadership has arisen that strives tirelessly to recruit the faith for clearly political goals this leadership schemes to destroy the humane spiritual side of the religion and use it as a weapon of war regrettably this tendency is intensifying in these times judaism as a religion is in desperate need of redemption i had always thought that judaism is a religion of compassion and grace benevolence and of progress and freedom judaism is a religion where at its very center stands above all else the human being as a holy and superior entity life all life is supreme even above good deeds and religious obligations if freedom has meaning then mere attempts to free judaism from its chains will be likened to a miracle the marriage between politics and religion is the most destructive marriage that could be both to the state and to the religion this marriage has brought corruption of the jewish religion in israel you can see for example a rabbi who goes round with a pistol or an uzi and in his opinion he has the right to murder and kill without any judgment or judge like rabbi moshe levinger judaism originally is a religion of life but here in israel an elite of black suited men has been formed the jewish religion of every generation was never involved in the government and its intrigues joining the coalition since the beginning of the founding of the state and until today has ruined the religious establishment more if you define secularism according to the level of your struggle against the symbols of the religion you become religious i do not define my secularism by anti religious dimensions i am not anti religious like the orthodox secular in israel who does not ask questions and who is just left with a shallow puddle of anti religiosity and in which he wallows the highest degree of secularism is when a person becomes skeptic the true secular has a daily dialogue between him and himself with questions about the creation his relationship with his surroundings and his relationship between him and other people in general –unbounded ideas worksedit fictionedit all men are equal – but some are

focusing on cultural political and social affairs in israel  plays and a childrens book most of michaels books were published by am oved publishers michael left am oved in  and moved to kinneret

kissing water and nabila are set in haifa his adopted city michael wrote about his departure from iraq and arrival in haifa when he wrote of his first day in haifa israel each kilometer that the airplane gulped took me further into a one way tunnel the flight was a difficult separation from a pained love when i opened my eyes i imagined that i was looking at a fata morgana which was stranger than anything i had ever known i loved haifa then and about half a century later i am faithful to this love but at the beginning of my first day in israel there were no designated moments for love set aside in  he left haifa for  years moving to the rural northern galilee town of maalot on the hillside overlooking a valley it is here that he wrote the novel brown devils about rock hyraxes that frequently stole the fruits of his welltended garden in  michael he returned to haifa sami michaels way – the man is the crown of creation literary way – is a route in the wadi nisnas an arab quarter of haifa named after michael in  literary extracts from his novels are written along the walls of the route both in hebrew and in arabic michael dedicated three novels to wadi nisnas including a trumpet in the wadi in  michael was appointed as an honorary member of the arabic language academy in israel in  the israeli high court of justice appointed michael as arbitrator to decide on a matter of education and multiculturalism the subject was widely covered in the press and his decision was a precedent in israel which still stands michael is the chairperson of the aachi council a council of iraqi artists in israel he was a member of staff of the jewish quarterly in london in  michael hosted a part series on the educational television channel on world literature where he engaged writers researchers and scholars in discussion about their favorite literary masterpieces a number of documentaries films and programs on michael have been made michael is a nominee for the nobel prize for literature writingedit michaels mother tongue is arabic it took him roughly  years to make the move from writing in arabic to hebrew by sheer persistence and strong will lacking any formal training he managed to gain a complete mastery of his new language he learned from listening and obsessive reading he defines this move as a miracle it sometimes happens to me while writing that i seek a word mischievous as it is it appears in english it appears in arabic but refuses to come in hebrew to some extent i made up my hebrew unquestionably the influence of arabic is dominant my syntax is almost arabic –sami michael unbounded ideas when victoria came out in cairo in the preface it was written that this is an arabic novel written in hebrew i took it as a compliment he wrote his first novel in arabic which won a prize awarded by the communist party on leaving the party he ceded publication of the book throwing the handwritten copy away unbounded ideas in his study amongst books in hebrew arabic and english – novels poetry politics history and science – lies on the table a students folder and inside it neatly arranged pages of his next novel – all handwritten in exemplary fashion on white paper rows of sentences in perfectly straight lines that later he will cross out again and again until he decides that this is it it can be typed not by himself at my age you want me to write on a computer i belong to the generation that does not press buttons but rather turn them he explains i could not do otherwise i need the contact of the pen where the words flow from the hand on to the page  michael has fixed hours for writing twice a day – morning and afternoon while writing he disconnects from everything he does not have a telephone in his study where he writes he insists on finishing the novel in the same room in which he started it he started to write victoria in his garden shed in maalot and when he sold the house and moved back to haifa he had not complete his book he asked the buyer to allow him to continue living there until he finished writing victoria – paying full rent of course during his writing he does not show it not even a chapter to anyone nor does he consult with anyone a good writer in known not only in by good writing but also in his ability to throw away without mercy to erase and to leave a pure text at the end of the process – approximately three years from the beginning of a book it will be typed he does not show his unfinished handwriting not even to his editor here is the place where stubbornness and the joy of creating join to become one determined decision with the last word left to michael at all times he mostly discards the whole novel and begins writing again he wrote the novel water kissing water over  years and the version that was finally published was the eighth version during this time he had other novels published including unbounded ideas he declares that he writes from the gut without planning out the novel he likes to surprise himself although he adds at the heart of literature is the plot when there is no plot in my opinion it is not literature but rather another academic exercise his books are bestsellers and his readers are from diverse social strata his style has been nurtured by both the treasures of the hebrew language and the wealth of the arab language many would say that michael generated the revolution of pluralism in israeli literature in that his protagonists are always “the other” mainly focusing on arabs women refugees and immigrants michael says life experience has given me a whole gallery of characters michael my childhood was soaked in the wisdom of women i was amazed by the richness of their imagination i remember with wonder how a woman at the age of  toothless would become pretty when playing a princess waiting for her prince his novels explore a wide range of interlocking relationships – social ethnic and political – between jews and arabs moslems and christians nationalists and communists and iraq and israel at times comparable to the multiple political identities within michael himself it is as if sometimes i feel i am two persons one is an arab iraqi the other an israeli jew michaels writing is characterized by its humor painful irony empathy and tolerance his style is clean direct and bare of symbols yet with an outstanding expressiveness each story exudes authenticity and personal involvementhis writing rich in imagery with a scathing realism he exposes the weaknesses and virtue of the human being but always with a jealous regard for his honor freedom and compassion in his books he describes the jewisharab conflict of its deep national psychological and social aspects the longing for social justice equality between peoples communities and gender are a central motif in michaels writing that smashes stereotypes and prejudices michael was the first hebrew author to make the arab the protagonist in his stories and his referring to him neither with arrogance nor idealization his style of writing milks both the treasures of the hebrew language and the wealth of the arab language in all his writing the sanctity of life is uppermost michaels books have been translated into many languages and used as text books at universities and schools in israel and abroad awards and citationsedit  and  – zeev

since his youth he has been active in the struggle for equality and human rights in israel he has never ceased to work for human rights michael was amongst a group of leaders of the communist

a beautiful illusion despite the disillusionment i will always believe in the human spirit and justice said michael i joined communism as a jew and i left communism as a jew wrote michael in unbounded ideas since leaving the communist party michael chose not to belong to any political organization in order to keep his conceptual independence as an intellectual not once has michael said i am a party of one man michael was amongst the first in israel s to call for coexistence between jews and arabs signing the first petition of artists and public figures calling for the establishment of a

not travel there sponsored by unesco and the tunisian ministry of culture for a conference in carthago on arabic literature michael is known as a peace activist there are many definitions of war in different countries according to my experience i find that war is a type of disease that damages both body and soul and horribly distorts the images of people i myself am a product of two cultures arab and jewish and to this day i do not understand the destructive power which has brought the two cultures to life and death confrontations there is so much beauty and wisdom in the two cultures it is so easy to be clever and give advice from afar so hard to be wise and sane from within the flames michael established together with activities people a movement against meir kahane an advocate for the arab transfer in maalot where he lived for  years – michael was a partner in the struggle against the expulsion of palestinian south hebron mountain cave dwellers the state of israel was established thanks to international recognition which was granted following the holocaust and the deportations stating that the jewish people were entitled to establish a national home where the proverbial wandering jew and the refugee will find safe and secure habitat this would be evil if we were to expel the caves inhabitants if only because they dont have any defense or savior the expulsion of these wretched people undermine our moral right to sit as free men and women in our secure homes in tel aviv jerusalem and haifa there is abominable personal terror but the use of militaristic power to banish citizens from their shacks and from their caves is no less abominable event at tzavta tel aviv  in  michael together with david sasson created the forum of the peace initiative with syria the forum included intellectuals academics and business people such as yaakov peri amnon lipikin shahak and alon liel an extract of the declaration composed by michael we gave up sinai and in return we gained peace with egypt we call upon the government of israel upon those amongst us who are responsible for designing policy to listen to the voices that are making themselves heard from damascus peace with syria means peace with the region in which we live the price of peace is much cheaper than the bitter and destructive price of war he has written extensively on social and political matters for arabic and hebrew newspapers and occasionally for foreign newspapers his stance against stereotyping prejudices and racism is also reflected in his novels even in his first novel all men are equal – but some are more  he writes of these prejudices within jewish society in israel the novel was influential for the second generation of the immigrants who saw michael as a spiritual leader the name of the book became a wellknown saying on the everwidening social and economic gap in israel sami michael has said this is dangerous shortsightedness poverty is a hothouse for the collapse of democracy and culture poverty is not a natural disaster the rich need to understand that widespread poverty threatens in essence the existence of socialorder the most secured mansion with all its inhabitants will not endure if the mansion is built in the center of a shantytown  when the annual report of acri came out on international human rights day december   it noted author sami michael the associations president said upon the release of the report that racism was so rife it was damaging civil liberty in israel israeli society is reaching new heights of racism that damages freedom of expression and privacy a hundred years of conflict has given us a majority poisoned by ideological education –a racist majority even more extreme than its leadership  at the hebrew book fair in tel aviv when michael made a solitary demonstration against racism in emanuel a settlement town lets call a spade a spade the lords of emanuel are racists who imperil the values of judaism and democracy this separation fence of defilement which shady rabbis plot to plant in our souls must be uprooted… i will definitely demonstrate during the celebration of hebrew book week for a school is called the house of the book in hebrew… every man woman and teenager will be welcome to join me to extirpate the racist crime in immanuel today – and should we remain silent in all of israel tomorrow about the immigrant and foreigner the fact that we are talking about christians and buddhists and those without religion does not negate from them the possibility to be helped as the poor of my city how could we as jews that groaned under the evils of fascistic regimes adopt the same fascistic measures towards those who are prepared to come here israel to look after our sick and elderly and to strengthen our factories and what about the children of these foreign workers that were born here and whose only language is hebrew they no longer have another homeland and in whose name exactly are we entitled to trample on these people and their rights we that claimed the right and the duty to take care of the migrant the orphan and the widow  for years michael was a volunteer in the eran organization – an emotionalmental crisis hotline – israels only emotional first aid service provides a confidential hour hotline seven days a week  days a year michael also lectures voluntarily in prisons to prisoners both jews and arabs in  the israeli high court of justice appointed michael as arbitrator to decide on a matter of education and multiculturalism the subject was widely covered in the press and his decision was a precedent in israel which still stands michael is chairman of the council of ahi the council of iraqi born artists for encouragement of research literature and art in israel ramatgan in the early s he was on the editorial staff of the jewish quarterly published in london in  he was elected president of the society for solidarity between the people of israel and the people of iraq a nonprofit society founded by key public figures from cultural academic and intellectual circles in israeli society the group attracting much attention in israel the arab world and elsewhere stresses that a clear distinction ought to be made between the iraqi oppressive regime and the iraqi people who have unjustifiably borne the horrifying consequences of the ongoing conflict in the region the request of the group however to be registered as an official nonprofit organization was denied by the interior ministry’s registrar claiming that israeli law forbids “contact with enemy states” in april  the founders reestablished the society michael was reelected as its president in the same year after the fall of saddam husseins regime michael was invited to join the group of composers of the new iraqi constitution as he did not reside in iraq nor had he for many years he felt that it would not be right he did however have one request which was to insert one important clause the defense of minorities michael has close relations with many iraqis both in iraq and throughout the world his novel aida  is set in iraq in the days of saddam hussein friends from iraq sent him uptodate pictures of the country so that michael could see the iraq of today he wrote thereon in the acknowledgements of the novel i will not forget the good people who extended me their help which was priceless but i am not able to mention their names as it may put them in danger amongst them university professors businessmen and women and journalists who risked their freedom to help and where one of whom was actually arrested for this literary mission on religion secularism and judaismedit sami michael defines himself first of all as a jew and only secondly as an israeli he comes from a secular jewish family in baghdad in the jewish community in iraq we lived in harmony almost absolute between the religious and the secular in israel i demand the religious to respect my secularity i have a personal permit to talk with my own personal god for this i do not need the rabbinate –unbounded ideas michael an atheist wrote on judaism the jewish religion is somewhat like a covenant between the people and godly justice and at the same time constitutes a treaty of brotherhood and solidarity between people judaism has taken a dangerous route with the last generation in israel from within it an unbending nationalistic leadership has arisen that strives tirelessly to recruit the faith for clearly political goals this leadership schemes to destroy the humane spiritual side of the religion and use it as a weapon of war regrettably this tendency is intensifying in these times judaism as a religion is in desperate need of redemption i had always thought that judaism is a religion of compassion and grace benevolence and of progress and freedom judaism is a religion where at its very center stands above all else the human being as a holy and superior entity life all life is supreme even above good deeds and religious obligations if freedom has meaning then mere attempts to free judaism from its chains will be likened to a miracle the marriage between politics and religion is the most destructive marriage that could be both to the state and to the religion this marriage has brought corruption of the jewish religion in israel you can see for example a rabbi who goes round with a pistol or an uzi and in his opinion he has the right to murder and kill without any judgment or judge like rabbi moshe levinger judaism originally is a religion of life but here in israel an elite of black suited men has been formed the jewish religion of every generation was never involved in the government and its intrigues joining the coalition since the beginning of the founding of the state and until today has ruined the religious establishment more if you define secularism according to the level of your struggle against the symbols of the religion you become religious i do not define my secularism by anti religious dimensions i am not anti religious like the orthodox secular in israel who does not ask questions and who is just left with a shallow puddle of anti religiosity and in which he wallows the highest degree of secularism is when a person becomes skeptic the true secular has a daily dialogue between him and himself with questions about the creation his relationship with his surroundings and his relationship between him and other people in general –unbounded ideas worksedit fictionedit all men are equal – but some are

literature writingedit michaels mother tongue is arabic it took him roughly  years to make the move from writing in arabic to hebrew by sheer persistence and strong will lacking any formal training he managed to gain a complete mastery of his new language he learned from listening and obsessive reading he defines this move as a miracle it sometimes happens to me while writing that i seek a word mischievous as it is it appears in english it appears in arabic but refuses to come in hebrew to some extent i made up my hebrew unquestionably the influence of arabic is dominant my syntax is almost arabic –sami michael unbounded ideas when victoria came out in cairo in the preface it was written that this is an arabic novel written in hebrew i took it as a compliment he wrote his first novel in arabic which won a prize awarded by the communist party on leaving the party he ceded publication of the book throwing the handwritten copy away unbounded ideas in his study amongst books in hebrew arabic and english – novels poetry politics history and science – lies on the table a students folder and inside it neatly arranged pages of his next novel – all handwritten in exemplary fashion on white paper rows of sentences in perfectly straight lines that later he will cross out again and again until he decides that this is it it can be typed not by himself at my age you want me to write on a computer i belong to the generation that does not press buttons but rather turn them he explains i could not do otherwise i need the contact of the pen where the words flow from the hand on to the page  michael has fixed hours for writing twice a day – morning and afternoon while writing he disconnects from everything he does not have a telephone in his study where he writes he insists on finishing the novel in the same room in which he started it he started to write victoria in his garden shed in maalot and when he sold the house and moved back to haifa he had not complete his book he asked the buyer to allow him to continue living there until he finished writing victoria – paying full rent of course during his writing he does not show it not even a chapter to anyone nor does he consult with anyone a good writer in known not only in by good writing but also in his ability to throw away without mercy to erase and to leave a pure text at the end of the process – approximately three years from the beginning of a book it will be typed he does not show his unfinished handwriting not even to his editor here is the place where stubbornness and the joy of creating join to become one determined decision with the last word left to michael at all times he mostly discards the whole novel and begins writing again he wrote the novel water kissing water over  years and the version that was finally published was the eighth version during this time he had other novels published including unbounded ideas he declares that he writes from the gut without planning out the novel he likes to surprise himself although he adds at the heart of literature is the plot when there is no plot in my opinion it is not literature but rather another academic exercise his books are bestsellers and his readers are from diverse social strata his style has been nurtured by both the treasures of the hebrew language and the wealth of the arab language many would say that michael generated the revolution of pluralism in israeli literature in that his protagonists are always “the other” mainly focusing on arabs women refugees and immigrants michael says life experience has given me a whole gallery of characters michael my childhood was soaked in the wisdom of women i was amazed by the richness of their imagination i remember with wonder how a woman at the age of  toothless would become pretty when playing a princess waiting for her prince his novels explore a wide range of interlocking relationships – social ethnic and political – between jews and arabs moslems and christians nationalists and communists and iraq and israel at times comparable to the multiple political identities within michael himself it is as if sometimes i feel i am two persons one is an arab iraqi the other an israeli jew michaels writing is characterized by its humor painful irony empathy and tolerance his style is clean direct and bare of symbols yet with an outstanding expressiveness each story exudes authenticity and personal involvementhis writing rich in imagery with a scathing realism he exposes the weaknesses and virtue of the human being but always with a jealous regard for his honor freedom and compassion in his books he describes the jewisharab conflict of its deep national psychological and social aspects the longing for social justice equality between peoples communities and gender are a central motif in michaels writing that smashes stereotypes and prejudices michael was the first hebrew author to make the arab the protagonist in his stories and his referring to him neither with arrogance nor idealization his style of writing milks both the treasures of the hebrew language and the wealth of the arab language in all his writing the sanctity of life is uppermost michaels books have been translated into many languages and used as text books at universities and schools in israel and abroad awards and citationsedit  and  – zeev

since his youth he has been active in the struggle for equality and human rights in israel he has never ceased to work for human rights michael was amongst a group of leaders of the communist underground in iraq at this time there was no written material on communism in arabic which meant they had to translate everything from english during his time in iran michael joined tudeh the iranian communist party once in israel he joined the israeli communist party he was a youth leader and worked on the editorial board of al itihad and al jadid arabic language newspapers of the communist party where he worked as an editor for four years at the same time he had a weekly column in which he wrote stories and articles under the pseudonym samir mared in  a short time before the mass disillusionment with stalin he ended his affiliation with the communist party and concluded his work on both papers …because they transgressed against all my ideals today i am a marxist communism was a beautiful illusion despite the disillusionment i will always believe in the human spirit and justice said michael i joined communism as a jew and i left communism as a jew wrote michael in unbounded ideas since leaving the communist party michael chose not to belong to any political organization in order to keep his conceptual independence as an intellectual not once has michael said i am a party of one man michael was amongst the first in israel s to call for coexistence between jews and arabs signing the first petition of artists and public figures calling for the establishment of a

not travel there sponsored by unesco and the tunisian ministry of culture for a conference in carthago on arabic literature michael is known as a peace activist there are many definitions of war in different countries according to my experience i find that war is a type of disease that damages both body and soul and horribly distorts the images of people i myself am a product of two cultures arab and jewish and to this day i do not understand the destructive power which has brought the two cultures to life and death confrontations there is so much beauty and wisdom in the two cultures it is so easy to be clever and give advice from afar so hard to be wise and sane from within the flames michael established together with activities people a movement against meir kahane an advocate for the arab transfer in maalot where he lived for  years – michael was a partner in the struggle against the expulsion of palestinian south hebron mountain cave dwellers the state of israel was established thanks to international recognition which was granted following the holocaust and the deportations stating that the jewish people were entitled to establish a national home where the proverbial wandering jew and the refugee will find safe and secure habitat this would be evil if we were to expel the caves inhabitants if only because they dont have any defense or savior the expulsion of these wretched people undermine our moral right to sit as free men and women in our secure homes in tel aviv jerusalem and haifa there is abominable personal terror but the use of militaristic power to banish citizens from their shacks and from their caves is no less abominable event at tzavta tel aviv  in  michael together with david sasson created the forum of the peace initiative with syria the forum included intellectuals academics and business people such as yaakov peri amnon lipikin shahak and alon liel an extract of the declaration composed by michael we gave up sinai and in return we gained peace with egypt we call upon the government of israel upon those amongst us who are responsible for designing policy to listen to the voices that are making themselves heard from damascus peace with syria means peace with the region in which we live the price of peace is much cheaper than the bitter and destructive price of war he has written extensively on social and political matters for arabic and hebrew newspapers and occasionally for foreign newspapers his stance against stereotyping prejudices and racism is also reflected in his novels even in his first novel all men are equal – but some are more  he writes of these prejudices within jewish society in israel the novel was influential for the second generation of the immigrants who saw michael as a spiritual leader the name of the book became a wellknown saying on the everwidening social and economic gap in israel sami michael has said this is dangerous shortsightedness poverty is a hothouse for the collapse of democracy and culture poverty is not a natural disaster the rich need to understand that widespread poverty threatens in essence the existence of socialorder the most secured mansion with all its inhabitants will not endure if the mansion is built in the center of a shantytown  when the annual report of acri came out on international human rights day december   it noted author sami michael the associations president said upon the release of the report that racism was so rife it was damaging civil liberty in israel israeli society is reaching new heights of racism that damages freedom of expression and privacy a hundred years of conflict has given us a majority poisoned by ideological education –a racist majority even more extreme than its leadership  at the hebrew book fair in tel aviv when michael made a solitary demonstration against racism in emanuel a settlement town lets call a spade a spade the lords of emanuel are racists who imperil the values of judaism and democracy this separation fence of defilement which shady rabbis plot to plant in our souls must be uprooted… i will definitely demonstrate during the celebration of hebrew book week for a school is called the house of the book in hebrew… every man woman and teenager will be welcome to join me to extirpate the racist crime in immanuel today – and should we remain silent in all of israel tomorrow about the immigrant and foreigner the fact that we are talking about christians and buddhists and those without religion does not negate from them the possibility to be helped as the poor of my city how could we as jews that groaned under the evils of fascistic regimes adopt the same fascistic measures towards those who are prepared to come here israel to look after our sick and elderly and to strengthen our factories and what about the children of these foreign workers that were born here and whose only language is hebrew they no longer have another homeland and in whose name exactly are we entitled to trample on these people and their rights we that claimed the right and the duty to take care of the migrant the orphan and the widow  for years michael was a volunteer in the eran organization – an emotionalmental crisis hotline – israels only emotional first aid service provides a confidential hour hotline seven days a week  days a year michael also lectures voluntarily in prisons to prisoners both jews and arabs in  the israeli high court of justice appointed michael as arbitrator to decide on a matter of education and multiculturalism the subject was widely covered in the press and his decision was a precedent in israel which still stands michael is chairman of the council of ahi the council of iraqi born artists for encouragement of research literature and art in israel ramatgan in the early s he was on the editorial staff of the jewish quarterly published in london in  he was elected president of the society for solidarity between the people of israel and the people of iraq a nonprofit society founded by key public figures from cultural academic and intellectual circles in israeli society the group attracting much attention in israel the arab world and elsewhere stresses that a clear distinction ought to be made between the iraqi oppressive regime and the iraqi people who have unjustifiably borne the horrifying consequences of the ongoing conflict in the region the request of the group however to be registered as an official nonprofit organization was denied by the interior ministry’s registrar claiming that israeli law forbids “contact with enemy states” in april  the founders reestablished the society michael was reelected as its president in the same year after the fall of saddam husseins regime michael was invited to join the group of composers of the new iraqi constitution as he did not reside in iraq nor had he for many years he felt that it would not be right he did however have one request which was to insert one important clause the defense of minorities michael has close relations with many iraqis both in iraq and throughout the world his novel aida  is set in iraq in the days of saddam hussein friends from iraq sent him uptodate pictures of the country so that michael could see the iraq of today he wrote thereon in the acknowledgements of the novel i will not forget the good people who extended me their help which was priceless but i am not able to mention their names as it may put them in danger amongst them university professors businessmen and women and journalists who risked their freedom to help and where one of whom was actually arrested for this literary mission on religion secularism and judaismedit sami michael defines himself first of all as a jew and only secondly as an israeli he comes from a secular jewish family in baghdad in the jewish community in iraq we lived in harmony almost absolute between the religious and the secular in israel i demand the religious to respect my secularity i have a personal permit to talk with my own personal god for this i do not need the rabbinate –unbounded ideas michael an atheist wrote on judaism the jewish religion is somewhat like a covenant between the people and godly justice and at the same time constitutes a treaty of brotherhood and solidarity between people judaism has taken a dangerous route with the last generation in israel from within it an unbending nationalistic leadership has arisen that strives tirelessly to recruit the faith for clearly political goals this leadership schemes to destroy the humane spiritual side of the religion and use it as a weapon of war regrettably this tendency is intensifying in these times judaism as a religion is in desperate need of redemption i had always thought that judaism is a religion of compassion and grace benevolence and of progress and freedom judaism is a religion where at its very center stands above all else the human being as a holy and superior entity life all life is supreme even above good deeds and religious obligations if freedom has meaning then mere attempts to free judaism from its chains will be likened to a miracle the marriage between politics and religion is the most destructive marriage that could be both to the state and to the religion this marriage has brought corruption of the jewish religion in israel you can see for example a rabbi who goes round with a pistol or an uzi and in his opinion he has the right to murder and kill without any judgment or judge like rabbi moshe levinger judaism originally is a religion of life but here in israel an elite of black suited men has been formed the jewish religion of every generation was never involved in the government and its intrigues joining the coalition since the beginning of the founding of the state and until today has ruined the religious establishment more if you define secularism according to the level of your struggle against the symbols of the religion you become religious i do not define my secularism by anti religious dimensions i am not anti religious like the orthodox secular in israel who does not ask questions and who is just left with a shallow puddle of anti religiosity and in which he wallows the highest degree of secularism is when a person becomes skeptic the true secular has a daily dialogue between him and himself with questions about the creation his relationship with his surroundings and his relationship between him and other people in general –unbounded ideas worksedit fictionedit all men are equal – but some are

not travel there sponsored by unesco and the tunisian ministry of culture for a conference in carthago on arabic literature michael is known as a peace activist there are many definitions of war in different countries according to my experience i find that war is a type of disease that damages both body and soul and horribly distorts the images of people i myself am a product of two cultures arab and jewish and to this day i do not understand the destructive power which has brought the two cultures to life and death confrontations there is so much beauty and wisdom in the two cultures it is so easy to be clever and give advice from afar so hard to be wise and sane from within the flames michael established together with activities people a movement against meir kahane an advocate for the arab transfer in maalot where he lived for  years – michael was a partner in the struggle against the expulsion of palestinian south hebron mountain cave dwellers the state of israel was established thanks to international recognition which was granted following the holocaust and the deportations stating that the jewish people were entitled to establish a national home where the proverbial wandering jew and the refugee will find safe and secure habitat this would be evil if we were to expel the caves inhabitants if only because they dont have any defense or savior the expulsion of these wretched people undermine our moral right to sit as free men and women in our secure homes in tel aviv jerusalem and haifa there is abominable personal terror but the use of militaristic power to banish citizens from their shacks and from their caves is no less abominable event at tzavta tel aviv  in  michael together with david sasson created the forum of the peace initiative with syria the forum included intellectuals academics and business people such as yaakov peri amnon lipikin shahak and alon liel an extract of the declaration composed by michael we gave up sinai and in return we gained peace with egypt we call upon the government of israel upon those amongst us who are responsible for designing policy to listen to the voices that are making themselves heard from damascus peace with syria means peace with the region in which we live the price of peace is much cheaper than the bitter and destructive price of war he has written extensively on social and political matters for arabic and hebrew newspapers and occasionally for foreign newspapers his stance against stereotyping prejudices and racism is also reflected in his novels even in his first novel all men are equal – but some are more  he writes of these prejudices within jewish society in israel the novel was influential for the second generation of the immigrants who saw michael as a spiritual leader the name of the book became a wellknown saying on the everwidening social and economic gap in israel sami michael has said this is dangerous shortsightedness poverty is a hothouse for the collapse of democracy and culture poverty is not a natural disaster the rich need to understand that widespread poverty threatens in essence the existence of socialorder the most secured mansion with all its inhabitants will not endure if the mansion is built in the center of a shantytown  when the annual report of acri came out on international human rights day december   it noted author sami michael the associations president said upon the release of the report that racism was so rife it was damaging civil liberty in israel israeli society is reaching new heights of racism that damages freedom of expression and privacy a hundred years of conflict has given us a majority poisoned by ideological education –a racist majority even more extreme than its leadership  at the hebrew book fair in tel aviv when michael made a solitary demonstration against racism in emanuel a settlement town lets call a spade a spade the lords of emanuel are racists who imperil the values of judaism and democracy this separation fence of defilement which shady rabbis plot to plant in our souls must be uprooted… i will definitely demonstrate during the celebration of hebrew book week for a school is called the house of the book in hebrew… every man woman and teenager will be welcome to join me to extirpate the racist crime in immanuel today – and should we remain silent in all of israel tomorrow about the immigrant and foreigner the fact that we are talking about christians and buddhists and those without religion does not negate from them the possibility to be helped as the poor of my city how could we as jews that groaned under the evils of fascistic regimes adopt the same fascistic measures towards those who are prepared to come here israel to look after our sick and elderly and to strengthen our factories and what about the children of these foreign workers that were born here and whose only language is hebrew they no longer have another homeland and in whose name exactly are we entitled to trample on these people and their rights we that claimed the right and the duty to take care of the migrant the orphan and the widow  for years michael was a volunteer in the eran organization – an emotionalmental crisis hotline – israels only emotional first aid service provides a confidential hour hotline seven days a week  days a year michael also lectures voluntarily in prisons to prisoners both jews and arabs in  the israeli high court of justice appointed michael as arbitrator to decide on a matter of education and multiculturalism the subject was widely covered in the press and his decision was a precedent in israel which still stands michael is chairman of the council of ahi the council of iraqi born artists for encouragement of research literature and art in israel ramatgan in the early s he was on the editorial staff of the jewish quarterly published in london in  he was elected president of the society for solidarity between the people of israel and the people of iraq a nonprofit society founded by key public figures from cultural academic and intellectual circles in israeli society the group attracting much attention in israel the arab world and elsewhere stresses that a clear distinction ought to be made between the iraqi oppressive regime and the iraqi people who have unjustifiably borne the horrifying consequences of the ongoing conflict in the region the request of the group however to be registered as an official nonprofit organization was denied by the interior ministry’s registrar claiming that israeli law forbids “contact with enemy states” in april  the founders reestablished the society michael was reelected as its president in the same year after the fall of saddam husseins regime michael was invited to join the group of composers of the new iraqi constitution as he did not reside in iraq nor had he for many years he felt that it would not be right he did however have one request which was to insert one important clause the defense of minorities michael has close relations with many iraqis both in iraq and throughout the world his novel aida  is set in iraq in the days of saddam hussein friends from iraq sent him uptodate pictures of the country so that michael could see the iraq of today he wrote thereon in the acknowledgements of the novel i will not forget the good people who extended me their help which was priceless but i am not able to mention their names as it may put them in danger amongst them university professors businessmen and women and journalists who risked their freedom to help and where one of whom was actually arrested for this literary mission on religion secularism and judaismedit sami michael defines himself first of all as a jew and only secondly as an israeli he comes from a secular jewish family in baghdad in the jewish community in iraq we lived in harmony almost absolute between the religious and the secular in israel i demand the religious to respect my secularity i have a personal permit to talk with my own personal god for this i do not need the rabbinate –unbounded ideas michael an atheist wrote on judaism the jewish religion is somewhat like a covenant between the people and godly justice and at the same time constitutes a treaty of brotherhood and solidarity between people judaism has taken a dangerous route with the last generation in israel from within it an unbending nationalistic leadership has arisen that strives tirelessly to recruit the faith for clearly political goals this leadership schemes to destroy the humane spiritual side of the religion and use it as a weapon of war regrettably this tendency is intensifying in these times judaism as a religion is in desperate need of redemption i had always thought that judaism is a religion of compassion and grace benevolence and of progress and freedom judaism is a religion where at its very center stands above all else the human being as a holy and superior entity life all life is supreme even above good deeds and religious obligations if freedom has meaning then mere attempts to free judaism from its chains will be likened to a miracle the marriage between politics and religion is the most destructive marriage that could be both to the state and to the religion this marriage has brought corruption of the jewish religion in israel you can see for example a rabbi who goes round with a pistol or an uzi and in his opinion he has the right to murder and kill without any judgment or judge like rabbi moshe levinger judaism originally is a religion of life but here in israel an elite of black suited men has been formed the jewish religion of every generation was never involved in the government and its intrigues joining the coalition since the beginning of the founding of the state and until today has ruined the religious establishment more if you define secularism according to the level of your struggle against the symbols of the religion you become religious i do not define my secularism by anti religious dimensions i am not anti religious like the orthodox secular in israel who does not ask questions and who is just left with a shallow puddle of anti religiosity and in which he wallows the highest degree of secularism is when a person becomes skeptic the true secular has a daily dialogue between him and himself with questions about the creation his relationship with his surroundings and his relationship between him and other people in general –unbounded ideas worksedit fictionedit all men are equal – but some are

focusing on cultural political and social affairs in israel  plays and a childrens book most of michaels books were published by am oved publishers michael left am oved in  and moved to kinneret

essays his writings and his social and political activities have made him a household name in israel michael has never been an author of the establishment which meant that he did not enjoy promotional or financial assistance two cities feature in many of michaels novels victoria storm among the palms a handful of fog and aida are set in his home town baghdad and refuge a trumpet in the wadi water kissing water and nabila are set in haifa his adopted city michael wrote about his departure from iraq and arrival in haifa when he wrote of his first day in haifa israel each kilometer that the airplane gulped took me further into a one way tunnel the flight was a difficult separation from a pained love when i opened my eyes i imagined that i was looking at a fata morgana which was stranger than anything i had ever known i loved haifa then and about half a century later i am faithful to this love but at the beginning of my first day in israel there were no designated moments for love set aside in  he left haifa for  years moving to the rural northern galilee town of maalot on the hillside overlooking a valley it is here that he wrote the novel brown devils about rock hyraxes that

literature writingedit michaels mother tongue is arabic it took him roughly  years to make the move from writing in arabic to hebrew by sheer persistence and strong will lacking any formal training he managed to gain a complete mastery of his new language he learned from listening and obsessive reading he defines this move as a miracle it sometimes happens to me while writing that i seek a word mischievous as it is it appears in english it appears in arabic but refuses to come in hebrew to some extent i made up my hebrew unquestionably the influence of arabic is dominant my syntax is almost arabic –sami michael unbounded ideas when victoria came out in cairo in the preface it was written that this is an arabic novel written in hebrew i took it as a compliment he wrote his first novel in arabic which won a prize awarded by the communist party on leaving the party he ceded publication of the book throwing the handwritten copy away unbounded ideas in his study amongst books in hebrew arabic and english – novels poetry politics history and science – lies on the table a students folder and inside it neatly arranged pages of his next novel – all handwritten in exemplary fashion on white paper rows of sentences in perfectly straight lines that later he will cross out again and again until he decides that this is it it can be typed not by himself at my age you want me to write on a computer i belong to the generation that does not press buttons but rather turn them he explains i could not do otherwise i need the contact of the pen where the words flow from the hand on to the page  michael has fixed hours for writing twice a day – morning and afternoon while writing he disconnects from everything he does not have a telephone in his study where he writes he insists on finishing the novel in the same room in which he started it he started to write victoria in his garden shed in maalot and when he sold the house and moved back to haifa he had not complete his book he asked the buyer to allow him to continue living there until he finished writing victoria – paying full rent of course during his writing he does not show it not even a chapter to anyone nor does he consult with anyone a good writer in known not only in by good writing but also in his ability to throw away without mercy to erase and to leave a pure text at the end of the process – approximately three years from the beginning of a book it will be typed he does not show his unfinished handwriting not even to his editor here is the place where stubbornness and the joy of creating join to become one determined decision with the last word left to michael at all times he mostly discards the whole novel and begins writing again he wrote the novel water kissing water over  years and the version that was finally published was the eighth version during this time he had other novels published including unbounded ideas he declares that he writes from the gut without planning out the novel he likes to surprise himself although he adds at the heart of literature is the plot when there is no plot in my opinion it is not literature but rather another academic exercise his books are bestsellers and his readers are from diverse social strata his style has been nurtured by both the treasures of the hebrew language and the wealth of the arab language many would say that michael generated the revolution of pluralism in israeli literature in that his protagonists are always “the other” mainly focusing on arabs women refugees and immigrants michael says life experience has given me a whole gallery of characters michael my childhood was soaked in the wisdom of women i was amazed by the richness of their imagination i remember with wonder how a woman at the age of  toothless would become pretty when playing a princess waiting for her prince his novels explore a wide range of interlocking relationships – social ethnic and political – between jews and arabs moslems and christians nationalists and communists and iraq and israel at times comparable to the multiple political identities within michael himself it is as if sometimes i feel i am two persons one is an arab iraqi the other an israeli jew michaels writing is characterized by its humor painful irony empathy and tolerance his style is clean direct and bare of symbols yet with an outstanding expressiveness each story exudes authenticity and personal involvementhis writing rich in imagery with a scathing realism he exposes the weaknesses and virtue of the human being but always with a jealous regard for his honor freedom and compassion in his books he describes the jewisharab conflict of its deep national psychological and social aspects the longing for social justice equality between peoples communities and gender are a central motif in michaels writing that smashes stereotypes and prejudices michael was the first hebrew author to make the arab the protagonist in his stories and his referring to him neither with arrogance nor idealization his style of writing milks both the treasures of the hebrew language and the wealth of the arab language in all his writing the sanctity of life is uppermost michaels books have been translated into many languages and used as text books at universities and schools in israel and abroad awards and citationsedit  and  – zeev

not travel there sponsored by unesco and the tunisian ministry of culture for a conference in carthago on arabic literature michael is known as a peace activist there are many definitions of war in different countries according to my experience i find that war is a type of disease that damages both body and soul and horribly distorts the images of people i myself am a product of two cultures arab and jewish and to this day i do not understand the destructive power which has brought the two cultures to life and death confrontations there is so much beauty and wisdom in the two cultures it is so easy to be clever and give advice from afar so hard to be wise and sane from within the flames michael established together with activities people a movement against meir kahane an advocate for the arab transfer in maalot where he lived for  years – michael was a partner in the struggle against the expulsion of palestinian south hebron mountain cave dwellers the state of israel was established thanks to international recognition which was granted following the holocaust and the deportations stating that the jewish people were entitled to establish a national home where the proverbial wandering jew and the refugee will find safe and secure habitat this would be evil if we were to expel the caves inhabitants if only because they dont have any defense or savior the expulsion of these wretched people undermine our moral right to sit as free men and women in our secure homes in tel aviv jerusalem and haifa there is abominable personal terror but the use of militaristic power to banish citizens from their shacks and from their caves is no less abominable event at tzavta tel aviv  in  michael together with david sasson created the forum of the peace initiative with syria the forum included intellectuals academics and business people such as yaakov peri amnon lipikin shahak and alon liel an extract of the declaration composed by michael we gave up sinai and in return we gained peace with egypt we call upon the government of israel upon those amongst us who are responsible for designing policy to listen to the voices that are making themselves

and political matters for arabic and hebrew newspapers and occasionally for foreign newspapers his stance against stereotyping prejudices and racism is also reflected in his novels even in his first novel all men are equal – but some are more  he writes of these prejudices within jewish society in israel the novel was influential for the second generation of the immigrants who saw michael as a spiritual leader the name of the book became a wellknown saying on the everwidening social and economic gap in israel sami michael has said this is dangerous shortsightedness poverty is a hothouse for the collapse of democracy and culture poverty is not a natural disaster the rich need to understand that widespread poverty threatens in essence the existence of socialorder the most secured mansion with all its inhabitants will not endure if the mansion is built in the center of a shantytown  when the annual report of acri came out on international human rights day december   it noted author sami michael the associations president said upon the release of the report that racism was so rife it was damaging civil liberty in israel israeli society is reaching new heights of racism that damages freedom of expression and privacy a hundred years of conflict has given us a majority poisoned by ideological education –a racist majority even more extreme than its leadership  at the hebrew book fair in tel aviv when michael made a solitary demonstration against racism in emanuel a settlement town lets call a spade a spade the lords of emanuel are racists who imperil the values of judaism and democracy this separation fence of defilement which shady rabbis plot to plant in our souls must be uprooted… i will definitely demonstrate during the celebration of hebrew book week for a school is called the house of the book in hebrew… every man woman and teenager will be welcome to join me to extirpate the racist crime in immanuel today – and should we remain silent in all of israel tomorrow about the immigrant and foreigner the fact that we are talking about christians and buddhists and those without religion does not negate from them the possibility to be helped as the poor of my city how could we as jews that groaned under the evils of fascistic regimes adopt the same fascistic measures towards those who are prepared to come here israel to look after our sick and elderly and to strengthen our factories and what about the children of these foreign workers that were born here and whose only language is hebrew they no longer have another homeland and in whose name exactly are we entitled to trample on these people and their rights we that claimed the right and the duty to take care of the migrant the orphan and the widow  for years michael was a volunteer in the eran organization – an emotionalmental crisis hotline – israels only emotional first aid service provides a confidential hour hotline seven days a week  days a year michael also lectures voluntarily in prisons to prisoners both jews and arabs in  the israeli high court of justice appointed michael as arbitrator to decide on a matter of education and multiculturalism the subject was widely covered in the press and his decision was a precedent in israel which still stands michael is chairman of the council of ahi the council of iraqi born artists for encouragement of research literature and art in israel ramatgan in the early s he was on the editorial staff of the jewish quarterly published in london in  he was elected president of the society for solidarity between the people of israel and the people of iraq a nonprofit society founded by key public figures from cultural academic and intellectual circles in israeli society the group attracting much attention in israel the arab world and elsewhere stresses that a clear distinction ought to be made between the iraqi oppressive regime and the iraqi people who have unjustifiably borne the horrifying consequences of the ongoing conflict in the region the request of the group however to be registered as an official nonprofit organization was denied by the interior ministry’s registrar claiming that israeli law forbids “contact with enemy states” in april  the founders reestablished the society michael was reelected as its president in the same year after the fall of saddam husseins regime michael was invited to join the group of composers of the new iraqi constitution as he did not reside in iraq nor had he for many years he felt that it would not be right he did however have one request which was to insert one important clause the defense of minorities michael has close relations with many iraqis both in iraq and throughout the world his novel aida  is set in iraq in the days of saddam hussein friends from iraq sent him uptodate pictures of the country so that michael could see the iraq of today he wrote thereon in the acknowledgements of the novel i will not forget the good people who extended me their help which was priceless but i am not able to mention their names as it may put them in danger amongst them university professors businessmen and women and journalists who risked their freedom to help and where one of whom was actually arrested for this literary mission on religion secularism and judaismedit sami michael defines himself first of all as a jew and only secondly as an israeli he comes from a secular jewish family in baghdad in the jewish community in iraq we lived in harmony almost absolute between the religious and the secular in israel i demand the religious to respect my secularity i have a personal permit to talk with my own personal god for this i do not need the rabbinate –unbounded ideas michael an atheist wrote on judaism the jewish religion is somewhat like a covenant between the people and godly justice and at the same time constitutes a treaty of brotherhood and solidarity between people judaism has taken a dangerous route with the last generation in israel from within it an unbending nationalistic leadership has arisen that strives tirelessly to recruit the faith for clearly political goals this leadership schemes to destroy the humane spiritual side of the religion and use it as a weapon of war regrettably this tendency is intensifying in these times judaism as a religion is in desperate need of redemption i had always thought that judaism is a religion of compassion and grace benevolence and of progress and freedom judaism is a religion where at its very center stands above all else the human being as a holy and superior entity life all life is supreme even above good deeds and religious obligations if freedom has meaning then mere attempts to free judaism from its chains will be likened to a miracle the marriage between politics and religion is the most destructive marriage that could be both to the state and to the religion this marriage has brought corruption of the jewish religion in israel you can see for example a rabbi who goes round with a pistol or an uzi and in his opinion he has the right to murder and kill without any judgment or judge like rabbi moshe levinger judaism originally is a religion of life but here in israel an elite of black suited men has been formed the jewish religion of every generation was never involved in the government and its intrigues joining the coalition since the beginning of the founding of the state and until today has ruined the religious establishment more if you define secularism according to the level of your struggle against the symbols of the religion you become religious i do not define my secularism by anti religious dimensions i am not anti religious like the orthodox secular in israel who does not ask questions and who is just left with a shallow puddle of anti religiosity and in which he wallows the highest degree of secularism is when a person becomes skeptic the true secular has a daily dialogue between him and himself with questions about the creation his relationship with his surroundings and his relationship between him and other people in general –unbounded ideas worksedit fictionedit all men are equal – but some are

focusing on cultural political and social affairs in israel  plays and a childrens book most of michaels books were published by am oved publishers michael left am oved in  and moved to kinneret zmorabitan dvir publishers after receiving a very attractive offer granting him a fixed monthly salary his first book that published with them was aida michael has also written numerous articles and essays his writings and his social and political activities have made him a household name in israel michael has never been an author of the establishment which meant that he did not enjoy promotional or financial assistance two cities feature in many of michaels novels victoria storm among the palms a handful of fog and aida are set in his home town baghdad and refuge a trumpet in the wadi water kissing water and nabila are set in haifa his adopted city michael wrote about his departure from iraq and arrival in haifa when he wrote of his first day in haifa israel each kilometer that the airplane gulped took me further into a one way tunnel the flight was a difficult separation from a pained love when i opened my eyes i imagined that i was looking at a fata morgana which was stranger than anything i had ever known i loved haifa then and about half a century later i am faithful to this love but at the beginning of my first day in israel there were no designated moments for love set aside in  he left haifa for  years moving to the rural northern galilee town of maalot on the hillside overlooking a valley it is here that he wrote the novel brown devils about rock hyraxes that

researchers and scholars in discussion about their favorite literary masterpieces a number of documentaries films and programs on michael have been made michael is a nominee for the nobel prize for literature writingedit michaels mother tongue is arabic it took him roughly  years to make the move from writing in arabic to hebrew by sheer persistence and strong will lacking any formal training he managed to gain a complete mastery of his new language he learned from listening and obsessive reading he defines this move as a miracle it sometimes happens to me while writing that i seek a word mischievous as it is it appears in english it appears in arabic but refuses to come in hebrew to some extent i made up my hebrew unquestionably the influence of arabic is dominant my syntax is almost arabic –sami michael unbounded ideas when victoria came out in cairo in the preface it was written that this is an arabic novel written in hebrew i took it as a compliment he wrote his first novel in arabic which won a prize awarded by the communist party on leaving the party he ceded publication of the book throwing the handwritten copy away unbounded ideas in his study amongst books in hebrew arabic and english – novels poetry politics history and science – lies on the table a students folder and inside it neatly arranged pages of his next novel – all handwritten in exemplary fashion on white paper rows of sentences in perfectly straight lines that later he will cross out again and again until he decides that this is it it can be typed not by himself at my age you want me to write on a computer i belong to the generation that does not press buttons but rather turn them he explains i could not do otherwise i need the contact of the pen where the words flow from the hand on to the page  michael has fixed hours for writing twice a day – morning and afternoon while writing he disconnects from everything he does not have a telephone in his study where he writes he insists on finishing the novel in the same room in which he started it he started to write victoria in his garden shed in maalot and when he sold the house and moved back to haifa he had not complete his book he asked the buyer to allow him to continue living there until he finished writing victoria – paying full rent of course during his writing he does not show it not even a chapter to anyone nor does he consult with anyone a good writer in known not only in by good writing but also in his ability to throw away without mercy to erase and to leave a pure text at the end of the process – approximately three years from the beginning of a book it will be typed he does not show his unfinished handwriting not even to his editor here is the place where stubbornness and the joy of creating join to become one determined decision with the last word left to michael at all times he mostly discards the whole novel and begins writing again he wrote the novel water kissing water over  years and the version that was finally published was the eighth version during this time he had other novels published including unbounded ideas he declares that he writes from the gut without planning out the novel he likes to surprise himself although he adds at the heart of literature is the plot when there is no plot in my opinion it is not literature but rather another academic exercise his books are bestsellers and his readers are from diverse social strata his style has been nurtured by both the treasures of the hebrew language and the wealth of the arab language many would say that michael generated the revolution of pluralism in israeli literature in that his protagonists are always “the other” mainly focusing on arabs women refugees and immigrants michael says life experience has given me a whole gallery of characters michael my childhood was soaked in the wisdom of women i was amazed by the richness of their imagination i remember with wonder how a woman at the age of  toothless would become pretty when playing a princess waiting for her prince his novels explore a wide range of interlocking relationships – social ethnic and political – between jews and arabs moslems and christians nationalists and communists and iraq and israel at times comparable to the multiple political identities within michael himself it is as if sometimes i feel i am two persons one is an arab iraqi the other an israeli jew michaels writing is characterized by its humor painful irony empathy and tolerance his style is clean direct and bare of symbols yet with an outstanding expressiveness each story exudes authenticity and personal involvementhis writing rich in imagery with a scathing realism he exposes the weaknesses and virtue of the human being but always with a jealous regard for his honor freedom and compassion in his books he describes the jewisharab conflict of its deep national psychological and social aspects the longing for social justice equality between peoples communities and gender are a central motif in michaels writing that smashes stereotypes and prejudices michael was the first hebrew author to make the arab the protagonist in his stories and his referring to him neither with arrogance nor idealization his style of writing milks both the treasures of the hebrew language and the wealth of the arab language in all his writing the sanctity of life is uppermost michaels books have been translated into many languages and used as text books at universities and schools in israel and abroad awards and citationsedit  and  – zeev

proverbial wandering jew and the refugee will find safe and secure habitat this would be evil if we were to expel the caves inhabitants if only because they dont have any defense or savior the expulsion of these wretched people undermine our moral right to sit as free men and women in our secure homes in tel aviv jerusalem and haifa there is abominable personal terror but the use of militaristic power to banish citizens from their shacks and from their caves is no less abominable event at tzavta tel aviv  in  michael together with david sasson created the forum of the peace initiative with syria the forum included intellectuals academics and business people such as yaakov peri amnon lipikin shahak and alon liel an extract of the declaration composed by michael we gave up sinai and in return we gained peace with egypt we call upon the government of israel upon those amongst us who are responsible for designing policy to listen to the voices that are making themselves heard from damascus peace with syria means peace with the region in which we live the price of peace is much cheaper than the bitter and destructive price of war he has written extensively on social and political matters for arabic and hebrew newspapers and occasionally for foreign newspapers his stance against stereotyping prejudices and racism is also reflected in his novels even in his first novel all men are equal – but some are more  he writes of these prejudices within jewish society in israel the novel was influential for the second generation of the immigrants who saw michael as a spiritual leader the name of the book became a wellknown saying on the everwidening social and economic gap in israel sami michael has said this is dangerous shortsightedness poverty is a hothouse for the collapse of democracy and culture poverty is not a natural disaster the rich need to understand that widespread poverty threatens in essence the existence of socialorder the most secured mansion with all its inhabitants will not endure if the mansion is built in the center of a shantytown  when the annual report of acri came out on international human rights day december   it noted author sami michael the associations president said upon the release of the report that racism was so rife it was damaging civil liberty in israel israeli society is reaching new heights of racism that damages freedom of expression and privacy a hundred years of conflict has given us a majority poisoned by ideological education –a racist majority even more extreme than its leadership  at the hebrew book fair in tel aviv when michael made a solitary demonstration against racism in emanuel a settlement town lets call a spade a spade the lords of emanuel are racists who imperil the values of judaism and democracy this separation fence of defilement which shady rabbis plot to plant in our souls must be uprooted… i will definitely demonstrate during the celebration of hebrew book week for a school is called the house of the book in hebrew… every man woman and teenager will be welcome to join me to extirpate the racist crime in immanuel today – and should we remain silent in all of israel tomorrow about the immigrant and foreigner the fact that we are talking about christians and buddhists and those without religion does not negate from them the possibility to be helped as the poor of my city how could we as jews that groaned under the evils of fascistic regimes adopt the same fascistic measures towards those who are prepared to come here israel to look after our sick and elderly and to strengthen our factories and what about the children of these foreign workers that were born here and whose only language is hebrew they no longer have another homeland and in whose name exactly are we entitled to trample on these people and their rights we that claimed the right and the duty to take care of the migrant the orphan and the widow  for years michael was a volunteer in the eran organization – an emotionalmental crisis hotline – israels only emotional first aid service provides a confidential hour hotline seven days a week  days a year michael also lectures voluntarily in prisons to prisoners both jews and arabs in  the israeli high court of justice appointed michael as arbitrator to decide on a matter of education and multiculturalism the subject was widely covered in the press and his decision was a precedent in israel which still stands michael is chairman of the council of ahi the council of iraqi born artists for encouragement of research literature and art in israel ramatgan in the early s he was on the editorial staff of the jewish quarterly published in london in  he was elected president of the society for solidarity between the people of israel and the people of iraq a nonprofit society founded by key public figures from cultural academic and intellectual circles in israeli society the group attracting much attention in israel the arab world and elsewhere stresses that a clear distinction ought to be made between the iraqi oppressive regime and the iraqi people who have unjustifiably borne the horrifying consequences of the ongoing conflict in the region the request of the group however to be registered as an official nonprofit organization was denied by the interior ministry’s registrar claiming that israeli law forbids “contact with enemy states” in april  the founders reestablished the society michael was reelected as its president in the same year after the fall of saddam husseins regime michael was invited to join the group of composers of the new iraqi constitution as he did not reside in iraq nor had he for many years he felt that it would not be right he did however have one request which was to insert one important clause the defense of minorities michael has close relations with many iraqis both in iraq and throughout the world his novel aida  is set in iraq in the days of saddam hussein friends from iraq sent him uptodate pictures of the country so that michael could see the iraq of today he wrote thereon in the acknowledgements of the novel i will not forget the good people who extended me their help which was priceless but i am not able to mention their names as it may put them in danger amongst them university professors businessmen and women and journalists who risked their freedom to help and where one of whom was actually arrested for this literary mission on religion secularism and judaismedit sami michael defines himself first of all as a jew and only secondly as an israeli he comes from a secular jewish family in baghdad in the jewish community in iraq we lived in harmony almost absolute between the religious and the secular in israel i demand the religious to respect my secularity i have a personal permit to talk with my own personal god for this i do not need the rabbinate –unbounded ideas michael an atheist wrote on judaism the jewish religion is somewhat like a covenant between the people and godly justice and at the same time constitutes a treaty of brotherhood and solidarity between people judaism has taken a dangerous route with the last generation in israel from within it an unbending nationalistic leadership has arisen that strives tirelessly to recruit the faith for clearly political goals this leadership schemes to destroy the humane spiritual side of the religion and use it as a weapon of war regrettably this tendency is intensifying in these times judaism as a religion is in desperate need of redemption i had always thought that judaism is a religion of compassion and grace benevolence and of progress and freedom judaism is a religion where at its very center stands above all else the human being as a holy and superior entity life all life is supreme even above good deeds and religious obligations if freedom has meaning then mere attempts to free judaism from its chains will be likened to a miracle the marriage between politics and religion is the most destructive marriage that could be both to the state and to the religion this marriage has brought corruption of the jewish religion in israel you can see for example a rabbi who goes round with a pistol or an uzi and in his opinion he has the right to murder and kill without any judgment or judge like rabbi moshe levinger judaism originally is a religion of life but here in israel an elite of black suited men has been formed the jewish religion of every generation was never involved in the government and its intrigues joining the coalition since the beginning of the founding of the state and until today has ruined the religious establishment more if you define secularism according to the level of your struggle against the symbols of the religion you become religious i do not define my secularism by anti religious dimensions i am not anti religious like the orthodox secular in israel who does not ask questions and who is just left with a shallow puddle of anti religiosity and in which he wallows the highest degree of secularism is when a person becomes skeptic the true secular has a daily dialogue between him and himself with questions about the creation his relationship with his surroundings and his relationship between him and other people in general –unbounded ideas worksedit fictionedit all men are equal – but some are

as a significant step that indicates the possibility of making peace and coexistence between the arab world and israel michael met with mahfouz many times who never hid his high estimation and gratitude for the translation of the cairo trilogy into hebrew and which was reflected in the way mahfouz welcomed michael into his home and presented him to his close friends during a visit to the home of mahfouz prof sasson somekh noticed the hebrew translation of the trilogy on a bookstand next to his writingdesk mahfouz told him the symbolism of this translation bestows it special value the
