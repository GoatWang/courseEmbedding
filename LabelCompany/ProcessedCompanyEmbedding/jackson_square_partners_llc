possible with the exception of the allcap growth fund the funds are nondiversified meaning they may concentrate its assets in fewer individual holdings than a diversified fund therefore it is more

adverse economic or regulatory developments when the fund buys or sells securities on a foreign stock exchange the transaction is undertaken in the local currency rather than in us dollars the value of the foreign currency may increase or decrease against the value of the us dollar which may impact the value of the funds portfolio holdings and your investment other countries may adopt economic
