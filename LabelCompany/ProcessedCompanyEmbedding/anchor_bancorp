bancorp for  million jan    comments share by paul gores of the journal sentinel jan    madisonbased anchor bancorp wisconsin inc revived over the past few years after being on the brink of failure following the great recession is being acquired by indianas largest bank for an estimated  millionthe acquisition set to close in the second quarter will eliminate another wisconsin corporate headquarters and introduce old national bank of evansville ind — and its parent company old national bancorp — to the states businesses and consumerstodays transaction is a culmination of the tremendous turnaround at anchor and a winwin for our communities customers employees and shareholders chris bauer anchors president and chief executive said in a statement announcing the deal tuesdayold national ceo bob jones said in a conference call with wall street analysts that his bank was drawn to anchor bancorps anchorbank because of its presence in some of wisconsins strongest markets and the opportunity to sell its products and services such as wealth management to anchorbank customers he called madison one of the most attractive markets in the midwestthe deal which involves  stock and  cash gives old national  branches in the state including offices in the metro madison and milwaukee areas and the fox valleywhat anchor really is is a great turnaround story chris bauer has done a wonderful job of turning around this franchise with almost a year history and they represent just a great opportunity for us particularly the markets theyre in jones saidthe future of anchorbank looked bleak during and shortly after the recession as the bank lost millions of dollars quarterly on real estate loans that soured bauer a former firstar bank executive in milwaukee was brought in during  to try to save the bank in  anchor completed a  million recapitalization that gave it a fresh start anchor filed a chapter  bankruptcy reorganization which allowed it to cancel  million owed to other banks in exchange for  million in cashthe reorganization let anchor wipe out  million owed to the us treasury under its troubled asset relief program or tarp in a deal in which the treasury received and immediately sold  million in anchor stockhowever about  shareholders who were still invested in anchor ended up with nothing in the reorganization anchor bancorp wisconsin went public again in  the bank was profitable for eight consecutive quarters after the recapitalizationits hardly a surprise that the institutional investors who backed the recapitalization of anchorbank a couple of years ago would be interested in liquidity reasonably quickly following the improvements in operating performance that have been achieved there said milwaukeebased investment banker robert edelman of edelman  co ltd whats more interesting is that old national won the prize some other players may have had concerns relating to the competitive situation in anchors home market around madisonin any case edelman said its a positive for the state and industry that old national which has been an active acquirer has chosen to expand into wisconsin theres every reason to believe they will be looking to invest more capital here in an interview tuesday bauer said potential acquirers noticed the turnaroundwe got to a point where we had really stabilized as a company growing having profitability again bauer said it grabbed the attention of a number of other institutions and investment bankers at the end we kind of had to make a decision do we start doing mergers which we were capable of doing and grow the company ourselves or do we find a partner since the reorganization anchorbank has sold off branches in some communities it also has offered employee buyouts anchorbank had about  employees through sept  compared with about  at the end of  regulatory data showswe believe this is a very good strategic fit but probably more importantly as i mentioned chris and his team have done an excellent job this is a company that is extremely wellpositioned for growth jones said theyve done all the hard liftingjones said old national had identified over  in cost savings from the acquisitionwith assets of about  billion anchorbank is the fourthlargest bank based in wisconsin green bays associated bank racines johnson bank and brown deers bank mutual are larger anchorbank will be converted to the old national name and bauer will stay on for a while to help with the transition jones saidits sort of that last step for me bauer said on the other hand there is a great future for anchorbank — the legacy organization — simply under the name of old national our customers our communities our associates they are all going to be very welloff in this transaction so i feel like what im doing here is handing everything off to a great shepherd of the future with their products and services and capabilities i think youre going to see a real dynamic player in the marketplaceold national has assets of almost  billion in addition to indiana old national has branches in michigan and kentucky it has a few branches in illinois but not in the metro chicago marketunder terms of the agreement anchor shareholders may elect to receive either  shares of old national common stock or  in cash —  more than mondays closing price of  — for each share of anchor
