history the eric d hovde and steven d hovde foundation “the hovde foundation” was founded in  to support two central missions – clinical research to find a cure for multiple sclerosis and charitable relief for those in desperate need  the hovde foundation builds and finances the “hovde houses” which are homes that provide shelter supportive services education and love to vulnerable street children  the hovde foundation has established hovde houses in mexico city huanuco peru winneba ghana kigali rwanda and mombasa kenya  the hovde foundation has also funded a homeless shelter for children and their parents complete with case work managers and job training in madison wisconsin eric hovde’s extensive travels in developing countries alerted him to a population indeed the most vulnerable in desperate need of assistance homeless children while in romania after the fall of communism eric witnessed firsthand the deplorable living conditions that thousands of young children were forced to face as their staterun orphanages were shuttered  this experience led eric to conceive of the ‘hovde house’ concept and to connect initially with world vision as a potential partner with world vision eric and steve visited its programs in several countries and along with teams of hovde employees contributed many hours of volunteer labor for example on the rebuilding efforts in kosovo in  after considerable research and with the guidance of world vision in  eric selected mexico city as the site of the first hovde house a home that would go on to provide housing supportive services and love to more than  homeless children currently the hovde foundation supports six hovde houses one in madison wi two in latin america and three in africa our goal is to have twenty hovde houses over the next twenty years adhering to the following criteria and philosophies sitepartner selection for our international hovde houses we carefully select countries that are open to foreign involvement not hostile toward americans and where rule of law children’s rights and property rights are respected and enforceable critically important in project selection is identifying an appropriate local operating partner organization with ample experience working with vulnerable children and a businessminded focus on longterm sustainability sustainability our preferred project model similar to the ronald mcdonald house concept is to finance the construction or acquisition of a suitable home and retain title to the land and building we team up with an established local partner who is responsible for operations of each hovde house we cover all operational costs of the home through its first  years and then decrease funding as the local organization becomes more selfsustainable often through other fundraising and development of revenue generating businesses at such time as the local partner becomes selfsufficient and assuming dutiful fulfillment of its role and responsibilities we will transfer ownership of the land and building to the partner organization at no cost social impact investing we consider ourselves social impact investors — not just donors taking a seat on the board of each partner organization we often assume a leadership role and assist with fundraising networking and operational support depending on the partner’s strengths and experience we help with project design development and implementation through construction additionally we will allocate resources to the development of local forprofit businesses geared to fund the longterm operations of each hovde house we strongly believe in the intersection of philanthropy and business and that true sustainability for nonprofits comes through forprofit enterprises recent

fridays i walk from my office over to the the palm restaurant a few blocks away where i reward myself with a nice lunch its something i started  years ago to help me get through the week people usually oohh and aahh when i tell them i am a regular at the palm but i will share a little secret you can lunch at the bar for less than  and hear a great joke from host tommy jacomo anyway i take the same route to the palm each week which takes me by the offices of eric hovde who works across the street in a townhouse where his various financial businesses are located eric heads up hovde capital hovde financial and hovde acquisitions and has offices across the country including palm beach los angeles and dallas theres a bunch of technical terms i could ascribe to what he does but simply put eric runs a hedge fund that invests in bank stocks and financial services companies at  he also runs a foundation and started a home for street children in mexico city i called him last week to interview him about the recent travails in the financial services market after we got talking i asked him if he wouldnt mind if i asked him some questions for value added eric hovde q have bank shares have bottomed out or will there be more write offs where are we in the cycle a unfortunately it is my opinion that bank shares will continue to declineand potentially meaningfullyover the next six to nine months it typically takes  months before you reach the bottom of a credit cycle and given that it started in the third quarter of  i do not foresee credit trends flat lining until late  there will be more writeoffs tied to housing now that housing prices are collapsing and we are at the beginning of credit deterioration in many other areas such as consumer corporate and commercial real estate loans how is federal reserve chairman ben bernanke doing fortunately better than greenspan who laid the groundwork for two enormous bubbles and did not exercise his regulatory oversight responsibilities bernanke has shown the ability to be creative by using other tools than just the fed funds rate however he needs to take a far more aggressive approach with wall street and the large investment banks in shoring up their balance sheets and reducing their risk to the economy how does this downturn compare to the bankingreal estate downturn in the early s some striking similarities yet some great differences the similarities of both downturns are causing significant devastation to banks balance sheets and their capital levels and will ultimately cost the taxpayers a lot of money the differences are that in the late searly s it was commercial real estate that collapsed causing repercussions to housing and other industries this time around it is the residential market which is much more important and a bigger asset class than commercial real estate another difference is that the fed is being much more aggressive early on in the process was it rightfair for the fed to bail out bear stearns i understand the feds concern in not allowing bear stearns to collapse however i have a fundamental problem with how they handled the bailout to have allowed shareholders to have received any money when the taxpayers are going to absorb several billion dollars in losses and further to allow jp morgan to renegotiate the price to  per share that in turn allowed bears chairman jimmy cayne to sell  million in stock was fundamentally wrong when  banks and thrifts failed in the late searly s shareholders received nothing and management teams were immediately terminated and in many cases prosecuted they are allowing the wrong riskreward parameters to continue on wall street tell us some of your favorite investments where is hovde hedge fund money invested these days we have been long gold because in the feds attempt to save the economy they are destroying the dollar there are insurance companies and banks that are in certain product types andor in geographic market areas which face substantially less risks however most of our returns have been generated by being short a variety of different financial stocks particularly those that are substantially levered to housing where was your last vacation last book read last vacation half moon bay in jamaica my familys favorite resort in the caribbean last book read next a michael

report offensive comments this is a great blog especially the most recent piece on eric hovde his surprisingly candid comments on greenspan are a breath of fresh air  too many people ignore the problems that guy caused while at the fed problems that bernanke is trying to clean up after posted by walter jc mitty  april    pm pithy comments from eric hovde  especially with regard to alan greenspan and on the bear stearns buyout fed must be careful how it midwifes these shotgun buyouts hows that for mixing up the metaphors  but hovde ignores one huge difference  in the sl crisis stockholders got nothing because the firms current worth went negative in all the cases i know about while bear stearns stock never got even close to the  per share figure dont know if share is fair but jamie dimon evidently thought so and he is the one accountable to jpm stockholders and their board the above in no way excuses jimmy cayne were i a bear stockholder i would be busy organizing a demand that cayne be sued to recover damages for misleading employees regulators and the public with statements he knew  or should have known  were false but that is an issue separate from the question of whether stockholders of a troubled financial institution should lose their entire investment in a buyout  what they get should depend upon the residual value of the firm to the buyer hovde is right about  months being the historic downslope and may be right about  months this time but dont bet on it took japan a decade to dig out from under their real estate bubble debris and i suspect the only thing that will shorten the current downslope is the upslope of another bubble so what i am looking for is the next bubble posted by charles  warrenville il  april    pm kudos to the post for this new feature the company town nature of washington leads to an obsessive focus on politics this blog sheds light on the many other people working productively in the nations capital who are not involved in politics its refreshing to hear candid assessments about government decision making from someone who has neither an ax to grind nor a vested interest keep it up posted by pete webster
