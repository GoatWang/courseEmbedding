natural gas plants in california and maine for us billion seneca capital dynegys largest shareholder fought the purchase in a proxy fight dynegy investor carl icahn also promised a proxy battle arguing that blackstone groups offer was too low icahn raised his stake in dynegy to  percent in preparation for the shareholder fight seneca capital nominated former railroad executive e hunter harrison and former energy company executive jeff d hunter for the dynegy board of directors challenging bruce williamson and david biegler a williamson ally a series of maneuvers followed dynegy executives said the offer was a good one as the deal would give dynegy access to lines of credit which would enable it to refinance and restructure its debt with energy prices at cyclical lows the company said it lacked the resources to do so and that its debt burden was destabilizing blackstone group initially said it would not offer more than us per share but then revised its offer later that day to us a share worried that it did not have enough shareholder support to accept the blackstone group offer dynegy proposed postponing its shareholder meeting a few days to november  but postponement did not occur legal counsel advised that delaware law under which dynegy was incorporated considered a postponement a new meeting and that would require notifying shareholders again and giving at least  days notice furthermore dynegys proxy rules did not make it clear that a proxy remained in effect in the event of a postponement which could lead to lawsuits legal counsel also believed that dynegy management would be forced refile resolution with shareholders and resolicit votes which would delay a meeting until early  during the shareholder meeting managements fears proved accurate on november  dynegy was forced to recess its shareholder meeting in an attempt to garner more support for the blackstone bid dynegy was unable to adjourn the meeting because its bylaws did not clearly provide for adjournment to another date and because it was unclear that adjournment could occur without a shareholder vote—a vote the board felt it would lose during the fourday recess dynegy executives said the company would continue to solicit a takeover even if the blackstone group bid failed on november   dynegy management and blackstone agreed to call off the takeover after it became clear there was not enough support for the us a share bid on december   icahn offered a us a share cash bid for dynegy dynegys board asked for other bids but none emerged but icahn too found little support among shareholders he extended his offer by two weeks on january   that same day seneca capital said it would not even entertain a us a share bid dynegys board urged shareholders to accept the icahn bid or risk bankruptcy but by midfebruary even those investors willing to accept the icahn bid had rescinded these offers icahn extended his offer by few days the icahn bid too collapsed on february   bruce williamson resigned as dynegys chairman and announced he would step down as chief executive officer on march  chief financial officer holli c nichols also said she would resign as chief financial officer on march  as well board member thomas w elward was named interim chairman and robert c flexon was appointed interim president and chief executive officer harrison was elected to the board of directors also elected to the board were vincent j intrieri senior managing director of icahn capital and samuel j merksamer an investment analyst for icahn capital  bankruptcyedit the takeover bids all came after one of dynegys largest subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy on november   dynegy holdings the largest of dynegy incs four subsidiaries filed for chapter  bankruptcy protection the bankruptcy was a novel one dynegy had structured itself so that dynegy inc the holding company had little debt nearly all the debt was held by its subsidiary dynegy holdings which also guaranteed debt for the operating divisions dynegy inc created three operating divisions the natural gas group gasco the coal group coalco and a group for all other businesses known as the stub group gasco and coalco were structured so that they would be little affected by any bankruptcy filing by either dynegy inc or dynegy holdings part of the structure meant that few of the natural gascos and coalcos dividends were given to dynegy holdings to separate dynegy holdings from dynegy inc dynegy holdings was transformed from a corporation into a limited liability company llc this legal maneuver took advantage of a delaware supreme court ruling which made it difficult for creditors to sue an llcs board of directors for failing to uphold their fiduciary duty finally gasco and coalco sold themselves to dynegy inc which left dynegy holdings holding us billion in debt but without the ability to seize the assets of gasco and coalco in the event of a default under the structure adopted by dynegy inc the company could meet its debt obligations to dynegy holdings by paying cash or by forgiving debt this provided an incentive for dynegy inc to withhold payment and force dynegy holdings to declare bankruptcy thereby reducing the value of the debt and making it easier to pay off the restructuring plan put dynegys assets which had the worst financial performance into the hands of dynegy holdings the goal was to protect dynegys secured creditors at the expense of its unsecured creditors the plan had already generated one lawsuit in  us bancorp representing bondholders whose investment was secured by leases of two dynegy power plants new newburgh new york the danskammer generating station and the roseton generating station on march   dynegy submitted financial filings with government regulators warning investors that it faced bankruptcy if it could not restructure its debt the company announced a month later that it had hired the restructuring firm lazard and the law firm white  case to advise it on debt restructuring vincent intrieri was named chair of the boards finance and restructuring committee on march   the november  bankruptcy of dynegy holdings ran into difficulty an examiner appointed by the united states bankruptcy court found that the dynegy incs purchase of coalco was fraudulent the examiner found that dynegy holdings was already bankrupt at the time the sale took place and therefore constituted a breach of fiduciary duty by the dynegy holdings board of directors this allowed the dynegy holdings board of directors to sue the dynegy inc board of directors for damages which could run into the billions of dollars this threw the dynegy holdings bankrutpcy filing into doubt and put dynegy inc on the hook for billions in debt the bankruptcy court trustee said she would sue on behalf of dynegy holdings to recover these debts the bankruptcy court examiners finding quickly led to the bankruptcy of dynegy inc itself on april   dynegy inc announced that it had reached an agreement with the us bankruptcy trustee the board of directors of dynegy holdings and its other creditors the agreement which affected us billion in debt gave all creditors  percent of the stock of dynegy inc once it emerged from bankruptcy existing shareholders would get just  percent of the stock in the new company with warrants enabling them to buy up to  of common stock at a set price over the next five years accordingly dynegy inc filed for chapter  bankruptcy protection on july   the bankrutpcy plan filed by dynegy inc also called for a merger with dynegy holdings the bankruptcy filing did not however affect gasco coalco or the stub group and allowed the dynegy holdings bankruptcy to proceed dynegys stock was delisted from the new york stock exchange following the bankruptcy filing us bancorp agreed to drop its lawsuit against the company in exchange for a  million claim against the company in bankruptcy court the bondholders represented by us bancorp would also get a further us million if the danskammer and roseton plants are sold as part of its bankruptcy filing dynegy moved its corporate headquarters in november  the company signed a lease for new principal offices in an office building at  travis street in houston it occupied these quarters early july  dynegy continued to hold leases on several floors of the wells fargo plaza however as part of its bankruptcy filing the bankruptcy court approved a new lease in which dynegy would abandon  square feet  m of space at wells fargo plaza the company asked the court to cancel its lease on the remaining  square feet  m as well dynegy said it hoped to hold a vote on august  at which time its creditors would approve the bankruptcy plan a court hearing on the creditorapproved bankruptcy plan would then be held september  after which the company said it would emerge from bankruptcy protection dynegy inc posted a secondquarter  loss of  billion an increase to  per share from  cents per share a year ago the company blamed among other things markedly lower demand for its electricity much lower prices for its coal and a  million noncash loss caused by the transfer of its coal unit to dynegy holdings the company also said it now hoped to emerge from bankruptcy in september  dynegy agreed to auction off its roseton and danskammer energy plants in new york state in order to emerge from bankruptcy dynegy had signed a saleleaseback agreement in  with public services enterprise group for the roseton and danskammer facilities fifty percent of the proceeds from the auction would be used to pay bondholders up to  million while the remaining  percent would be used to pay unsecured creditors the unsecured creditors would get  million in cash unsecured creditors also would receive  percent of dynegys new stock with the company retaining the rest with warrants to purchase  percent of the stock after five years dynegy also agreed to pay holders of  million in subordinated capital income securities just  million in principal and  million in interest to settle their claims the bankruptcy agreement also settled claims between dynegy holdings and dynegy inc dynegy emerged from bankruptcy on october   and its shares began trading on october  under the dyn symbol postbankruptcyedit on november   the federal energy regulatory commission settled a decadeold lawsuit which alleged that dynegy had manipulated the california energy market while the lawsuit continued dynegy sold its california subsidiary to nrg energy inc nrg

company and agreed to stay on until a successor was named in order to provide an orderly transition on february   dynegys south bay power plant in san diego california was imploded the demolition of the foot  m smokestacks of the outmoded plant was watched by more than  people roseton and danskammer salesedit the sale of the roseton and danskammer plants—a condition of dynegys emergence from bankruptcy—proceeded slowly on november   members of international brotherhood of electrical workers ibew local  struck the roseton and danskammer plants after a contract extension expired and dynegy continued to seek cuts in retirement benefits dynegys bankruptcy also left  million in unpaid property taxes in dutchess county new york this created a budget crisis in the county which threatened to close local schools and create severe cutbacks in county services on december   dynegy announced it would sell the roseton plant to louis dreyfus highbridge energy for  million in cash the sale closed on april   the danskammer plant sale was far more troubled the plant was heavily damaged by hurricane sandy in october  rendering it inoperable on december  dynegy said that ics ny holdings would buy the plant for  million and demolish it but the ics sale stalled under the terms of the auction ics ny had to replace or find a substitute for its credit support agreement and pay its portion of the plants outstanding property taxes but dynegy said the company never did either ics defended itself saying it was making every economically feasible effort to replace the credit agreement on may   dynegy filed suit with the bankruptcy court to force ica to fulfill its obligations the court imposed a july  deadline for ics to close the sale but it did not meet the deadline dynegy subsequently sought another buyer helios power capital a private equity firm agreed to purchase the plant for  million in cash on august  the court approved the sale on september  ameren purchaseedit in midmarch  dynegy purchased three electric generating subsidiaries of ameren an illinois power company the deal worth  million involved amerens ameren energy generating co genco gencos controlling interest in electric energy inc amerenenergy resources generating co and ameren energy marketing co dynegy formed a subsidiary illinois power holdings iph to purchase the ameren subsidiaries no cash changed hands rather iph agreed to assume  million in debt owed by genco and the other subsidiaries ameren also transferred about  million in tax benefits the three subsidiaries would have received in  ameren retained gencos inactive hutsonville and meredosia plants and agreed to buy back from iph for  million three natural gas electrical generating plants dynegy agreed to honor the union collective bargaining agreements in force at all plants under the deal dynegy acquired five coalfired generating plants coffeen in coffeen illinois duck creek in canton illinois ed edwards in bartonville illinois joppa in joppa illinois and newton in newton illinois as the deal worked its way through state and federal regulatory approval dynegy took advantage of low interest rates and refinanced its debt the company obtained  billion in term loan b facilities and  million in revolving credit the company used this income to retire an  million sevenyear line of credit and a  million twoyear line of credit dynegy agreed that the revolving credit line would be paid off and terminate within five years two syndicated loans made up the  billion loan package the  million loan and the  million loan were both due in  this left dynegy with  billion in lines of credit and  million in outstanding bonds the ameren plantsfordebt swap also ran into trouble the federal energy regulatory commission ferc had to approve the deal and ensure that there was no negative impact on consumers from dynegys expanding market share in the midwest but on april  ferc said that the studies submitted by dynegy and ameren were inadequate and it ordered the two firms to rerun the studies and report back to ferc by july  on july  ferc again declined to approve or disapprove the dynegyameren deal the agency said that it dynegys study showed it charging market rates for energy in the midwest but ferc said it worried that transmission bottlenecks in the area would permit dynegy to charge much more furthermore federal regulators were considering an expansion in the market area iph could serve ferc asked dynegy to provide additional information on transmission limitations and market area expansion in august the sierra club formally filed opposition to the dynegyameren deal the environmental group said the transmission bottleneck issue gave dynegy too much market power it also argued that dynegy and ameren had submitted only regional market power data and had not accounted for local impacts which could be very severe another obstacle emerged on june  ameren was required to install pollutionreducing equipment on its five coalfired generating plants in  but because ameren was in financial difficulty it sought and received a waiver from the state of illinois granting it a fiveyear delay ameren sought to transfer this delay to dynegy so that dynegy would not have to immediately install the devices until  either but the illinois pollution control board denied amerens request dynegy filed its own request for a fiveyear waiver in july and warned that the ameren deal would fall apart if it did not receive the waiver but the sierra club the environmental law and policy center and other environmental groups said dynegy had the resources to install the equipment and opposed a waiver acm partners a financial firm hired by the sierra club also argued that dynegy purposefully left iph significantly underfunded and unable to tap into the parent companys resources dynegy disagreed but the firm warned that if iph went bankrupt workers would lose pensions and local communities would have to pay for any environmental remediation the illinois aflcio however supported dynegys request on september  saying that local jobs depended on the waiver the pollution board said it would make a decision by november  foresight energy a major illinois coal mining company said it would install the  million antipollution devices for free if dynegy agreed to sign a longterm contract to accept coal only from foresight energy dynegy declined the offer in part because it already has longterm coal contracts and environmental groups opposed it there was some speculation by financial analysts that the dynegyameren deal was a poor one julien dumoulinsmith executive director of ubs investment research said dynegy is far more likely to shutter all five coalpowered plants rather than add pollution control devices dumoulinsmith pointed out that the united states environmental protection agency epa issued final rules on sulfur dioxide emissions that go into effect in july  because the edwards plant is in an area of low air quality epa is likely to force dynegy to close the plant anyway the remaining four plants are borderline cases with the exception of duck creek station which spent nearly usm on sulfur dioxide removal and may also be forced to close if epa regulations tighten in the future a highly likely possibility he said  acquisitionsedit on august   dynegy announced a deal involving two interdependent transactions to be executed simultaneously dynegy acquired duke’s midwest generation assets and retail business for  billion in cash and the power generating assets

businesses that looked like we had a competitive advantage dynegy sold its telecommunications business in europe in january  restated its income for  and  sold a natural gas terminal in louisiana sold

northeast united states in march  it agreed to settle a  dispute with the environmental protection agency by spending us million to repair and upgrade coalfired generating plants in illinois to reduce

business to targa resources a company owned by private equity firm warburg pincus in september  dynegy and ls power group agreed to a joint venture in a deal worth us billion under the terms of the

power in may  chevrontexaco announced it was selling its  percent stake in dynegy to the public the sale netted chevrontexaco us million by july the joint venture did not last however in august  ls power agreed to buy nine electrical generating plants from dynegy for us billion in cash in order to dissolve the joint venture part of the reason for the joint ventures demise was another collapse in dynegys share price dynegys shares fell  percent in the two years after the deal closed and the company posted a large  million loss in the second quarter of  ls power also agreed to return all its class b shares so that dynegy would only have  million shares of common stock outstanding the dissolution of the joint venture left ls power with a  percent stake in dynegy dynegys move into coalpowered electrical generation was not without controversy in september  new york attorney general andrew cuomo sued dynegy and other utilities arguing that the companies were not properly accounting for the financial risks that pollutants from coalfired generating plants created after a year of negotiations and legal maneuvering dynegy agreed to issue statements to its current and future investors warning that government regulation of carbon emissions and lawsuits over pollution could pose financial risks to the company its move into coalfired electrical generation led the national environmental trust an environmental group to derisively call dynegy the king of coal in  takeover battlesedit on august   the blackstone group announced plans to purchase dynegy for us billion as part of the deal nrg energy would acquire four natural gas plants in california and maine for us billion seneca capital dynegys largest shareholder fought the purchase in a proxy fight dynegy investor carl icahn also promised a proxy battle arguing that blackstone groups offer was too low icahn raised his stake in dynegy to  percent in preparation for the shareholder fight seneca capital nominated former railroad executive e hunter harrison and former energy company executive jeff d hunter for the dynegy board of directors challenging bruce williamson and david biegler a williamson ally a series of maneuvers followed dynegy executives said the offer was a good one as the deal would give dynegy access to lines of credit which would enable it to refinance and restructure its debt with energy prices at cyclical lows the company said it lacked the resources to do so and that its debt burden was destabilizing blackstone group initially said it would not offer more than us per share but then revised its offer later that day to us a share worried that it did not have enough shareholder support to accept the blackstone group offer dynegy proposed postponing its shareholder meeting a few days to november  but postponement did not occur legal counsel advised that delaware law under which dynegy was incorporated considered a postponement a new meeting and that would require notifying shareholders again and giving at least  days notice furthermore dynegys proxy rules did not make it clear that a proxy remained in effect in the event of a postponement which could lead to lawsuits legal counsel also believed that dynegy management would be forced refile resolution with shareholders and resolicit votes which would delay a meeting until early  during the shareholder meeting managements fears proved accurate on november  dynegy was forced to recess its shareholder meeting in an attempt to garner more support for the blackstone bid dynegy was unable to adjourn the meeting because its bylaws did not clearly provide for adjournment to another date and because it was unclear that adjournment could occur without a shareholder vote—a vote the board felt it would lose during the fourday recess dynegy executives said the company would continue to solicit a takeover even if the blackstone group bid failed on november   dynegy management and blackstone agreed to call off the takeover after it became clear there was not enough support for the us a share bid on december   icahn offered a us a share cash bid for dynegy dynegys board asked for other bids but none emerged but icahn too found little support among shareholders he extended his offer by two weeks on january   that same day seneca capital said it would not even entertain a us a share bid dynegys board urged shareholders to accept the icahn bid or risk bankruptcy but by midfebruary even those investors willing to accept the icahn bid had rescinded these offers icahn extended his offer by few days the icahn bid too collapsed on february   bruce williamson resigned as dynegys chairman and announced he would step down as chief executive officer on march  chief financial officer holli c nichols also said she would resign as chief financial officer on march  as well board member thomas w elward was named interim chairman and robert c flexon was appointed interim president and chief executive officer harrison was elected to the board of directors also elected to the board were vincent j intrieri senior managing director of icahn capital and samuel j merksamer an investment analyst for icahn capital  bankruptcyedit the takeover bids all came after one of dynegys largest subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy on november   dynegy holdings the largest of dynegy incs four subsidiaries filed for chapter  bankruptcy protection the bankruptcy was a novel one dynegy had structured itself so that dynegy inc the holding company had little debt nearly all the debt was held by its subsidiary dynegy holdings which also guaranteed debt for the operating divisions dynegy inc created three operating divisions the natural gas group gasco the coal group coalco and a group for all other businesses known as the stub group gasco and coalco were structured so that they would be little affected by any bankruptcy filing by either dynegy inc or dynegy holdings part of the structure meant that few of the natural gascos and coalcos dividends were given to dynegy holdings to separate dynegy holdings from dynegy inc dynegy holdings was transformed from a corporation into a limited liability company llc this legal maneuver took advantage of a delaware supreme court ruling which made it difficult for creditors to sue an llcs board of directors for failing to uphold their fiduciary duty finally gasco and coalco sold themselves to dynegy inc which left dynegy holdings holding us billion in debt but without the ability to seize the assets of gasco and coalco in the event of a default under the structure adopted by dynegy inc the company could meet its debt obligations to dynegy holdings by paying cash or by forgiving debt this provided an incentive for dynegy inc to withhold payment and force dynegy holdings to declare bankruptcy thereby reducing the value of the debt and making it easier to pay off the restructuring plan put dynegys assets which had the worst financial performance into the hands of dynegy holdings the goal was to protect dynegys secured creditors at the expense of its unsecured creditors the plan had already generated one lawsuit in  us bancorp representing bondholders whose investment was secured by leases of two dynegy power plants new newburgh new york the danskammer generating station and the roseton generating station on march   dynegy submitted financial filings with government regulators warning investors that it faced bankruptcy if it could not restructure its debt the company announced a month later that it had hired the restructuring firm lazard and the law firm white  case to advise it on debt restructuring vincent intrieri was named chair of the boards finance and restructuring committee on march   the november  bankruptcy of dynegy holdings ran into difficulty an examiner appointed by the united states bankruptcy court found that the dynegy incs purchase of coalco was fraudulent the examiner found that dynegy holdings was already bankrupt at the time the sale took place and therefore constituted a breach of fiduciary duty by the dynegy holdings board of directors this allowed the dynegy holdings board of directors to sue the dynegy inc board of directors for damages which could run into the billions of dollars this threw the dynegy holdings bankrutpcy filing into doubt and put dynegy inc on the hook for billions in debt the bankruptcy court trustee said she would sue on behalf of dynegy holdings to recover these debts the bankruptcy court examiners finding quickly led to the bankruptcy of dynegy inc itself on april   dynegy inc announced that it had reached an agreement with the us bankruptcy trustee the board of directors of dynegy holdings and its other creditors the agreement which affected us billion in debt gave all creditors  percent of the stock of dynegy inc once it emerged from bankruptcy existing shareholders would get just  percent of the stock in the new company with warrants enabling them to buy up to  of common stock at a set price over the next five years accordingly dynegy inc filed for chapter  bankruptcy protection on july   the bankrutpcy plan filed by dynegy inc also called for a merger with dynegy holdings the bankruptcy filing did not however affect gasco coalco or the stub group and allowed the dynegy holdings bankruptcy to proceed dynegys stock was delisted from the new york stock exchange following the bankruptcy filing us bancorp agreed to drop its lawsuit against the company in exchange for a  million claim against the company in bankruptcy court the bondholders represented by us bancorp would also get a further us million if the danskammer and roseton plants are sold as part of its bankruptcy filing dynegy moved its corporate headquarters in november  the company signed a lease for new principal offices in an office building at  travis street in houston it occupied these quarters early july  dynegy continued to hold leases on several floors of the wells fargo plaza however as part of its bankruptcy filing the bankruptcy court approved a new lease in which dynegy would abandon  square feet  m of space at wells fargo plaza the company asked the court to cancel its lease on the remaining  square feet  m as well dynegy said it hoped to hold a vote on august  at which time its creditors would approve the bankruptcy plan a court hearing on the creditorapproved bankruptcy plan would then be held september  after which the company said it would emerge from bankruptcy protection dynegy inc posted a secondquarter  loss of  billion an increase to  per share from  cents per share a year ago the company blamed among other things markedly lower demand for its

to settle their claims the bankruptcy agreement also settled claims between dynegy holdings and dynegy inc dynegy emerged from bankruptcy on october   and its shares began trading on october  under the dyn symbol postbankruptcyedit on november   the federal energy regulatory commission settled a decadeold lawsuit which alleged that dynegy had manipulated the california energy market while the

fastcharging electric vehicle stations and  plugin stations throughout california twenty percent of the stations were required to be in lowincome neighborhoods on january   dynegys chief operating officer kevin howell resigned howell continued as a consultant to the company and agreed to stay on until a successor was named in order to provide an orderly transition on february   dynegys south bay power plant in san diego california was imploded the demolition of the foot  m smokestacks of the outmoded plant was watched by more than  people roseton and danskammer salesedit the sale of the roseton and danskammer plants—a condition of dynegys emergence from bankruptcy—proceeded slowly on november   members of international brotherhood of electrical workers ibew local  struck the roseton and danskammer plants after a contract extension expired and dynegy continued to seek cuts in retirement benefits dynegys bankruptcy also left  million in unpaid property taxes in dutchess county new york this created a budget crisis in the county which threatened to close local schools and create severe cutbacks in county services on december   dynegy announced it would sell the roseton plant to louis dreyfus highbridge energy for  million in cash the sale closed on april   the danskammer plant sale was far more troubled the plant was heavily damaged by hurricane sandy in october  rendering it inoperable on december  dynegy said that ics ny holdings would buy the plant for  million and demolish it but the ics sale stalled under the terms of the auction ics ny had to replace or find a substitute for its credit support agreement and pay its portion of the plants outstanding property taxes but dynegy said the company never did either ics defended itself saying it was making every economically feasible effort to replace the credit agreement on may   dynegy filed suit with the bankruptcy court to force ica to fulfill its obligations the court imposed a july  deadline for ics to close the sale but it did not meet the deadline dynegy subsequently sought another buyer helios power capital a private equity firm agreed to purchase the plant for  million in cash on august  the court approved the sale on september  ameren purchaseedit in midmarch  dynegy purchased three electric generating subsidiaries of ameren an illinois power company the deal worth  million involved amerens ameren energy generating co genco gencos controlling interest in electric energy inc amerenenergy resources generating co and ameren energy marketing co dynegy formed a subsidiary illinois power holdings iph to purchase the ameren subsidiaries no cash changed hands rather iph agreed to assume  million in debt owed by genco and the other subsidiaries ameren also transferred about  million in tax benefits the three subsidiaries would have received in  ameren retained gencos inactive hutsonville and meredosia plants and agreed to buy back from iph for  million three natural gas electrical generating plants dynegy agreed to honor the union collective bargaining agreements in force at all plants under the deal dynegy acquired five coalfired generating plants coffeen in coffeen illinois duck creek in canton illinois ed edwards in bartonville illinois joppa in joppa illinois and newton in newton illinois as the deal worked its way through state and federal regulatory approval dynegy took advantage of low interest rates and refinanced its debt the company obtained  billion in term loan b facilities and  million in revolving credit the company used this income to retire an  million sevenyear line of credit and a  million twoyear line of credit dynegy agreed that the revolving credit line would be paid off and terminate within five years two syndicated loans made up the  billion loan package the  million loan and the  million loan were both due in  this left dynegy with  billion in lines of credit and  million in outstanding bonds the ameren plantsfordebt swap also ran into trouble the federal energy regulatory commission ferc had to approve the deal and ensure that there was no negative impact on consumers from dynegys expanding market share in the midwest but on april  ferc said that the studies submitted by dynegy and ameren were inadequate and it ordered the two firms to rerun the studies and report back to ferc by july  on july  ferc again declined to approve or disapprove the dynegyameren deal the agency said that it dynegys study showed it charging market rates for energy in the midwest but ferc said it worried that transmission bottlenecks in the area would permit dynegy to charge much more furthermore federal regulators were considering an expansion in the market area iph could serve ferc asked dynegy to provide additional information on transmission limitations and market area expansion in august the sierra club formally filed opposition to the dynegyameren deal the environmental group said the transmission bottleneck issue gave dynegy too much market power it also argued that dynegy and ameren had submitted only regional market power data and had not accounted for local impacts which could be very severe another obstacle emerged on june  ameren was required to install pollutionreducing equipment on its five coalfired generating plants in  but because ameren was in financial difficulty it sought and received a waiver from the state of illinois granting it a fiveyear delay ameren sought to transfer this delay to dynegy so that dynegy would not have to immediately install the devices until  either but the illinois pollution control board denied amerens request dynegy filed its own request for a fiveyear waiver in july and warned that the ameren deal would fall apart if it did not receive the waiver but the sierra club the environmental law and policy center and other environmental groups said dynegy had the resources to install the equipment and opposed a waiver acm partners a financial firm hired by the sierra club also argued that dynegy purposefully left iph significantly underfunded and unable to tap into the parent companys resources dynegy disagreed but the firm warned that if iph went bankrupt workers would lose pensions and local communities would have to pay for any environmental remediation the illinois aflcio however supported dynegys request on september  saying that local jobs depended on the waiver the pollution board said it would make a decision by november  foresight energy a major illinois coal mining company said it would install the  million antipollution devices for free if dynegy agreed to sign a longterm contract to accept coal only from foresight energy dynegy declined the offer in part because it already has longterm coal contracts and environmental groups opposed it there was some speculation by financial analysts that the dynegyameren deal was a poor one julien dumoulinsmith executive director of ubs investment research said dynegy is far more likely to shutter all five coalpowered plants rather than add pollution control devices dumoulinsmith pointed out that the united states environmental protection agency epa issued final rules on sulfur dioxide emissions that go into effect in july  because the edwards plant is in an area of low air quality epa is likely to force dynegy to close the plant anyway the remaining four plants are borderline cases with the exception of duck creek station which spent nearly usm on sulfur dioxide removal and may also be forced to close if epa regulations tighten in the future a highly likely possibility he said  acquisitionsedit on august   dynegy announced a deal involving two interdependent transactions to be executed simultaneously dynegy acquired duke’s midwest

agreemnent dynegy gave ls power a  percent stake in dynegy itself while ls power contributed  of its power plants dynegy also agreed to create a  million new class b shares which it turned over to ls power in may  chevrontexaco announced it was selling its  percent stake in dynegy to the public the sale netted chevrontexaco us million by july the joint venture did not last however in august  ls power agreed to buy nine electrical generating plants from dynegy for us billion in cash in order to dissolve the joint venture part of the reason for the joint ventures demise was another collapse in dynegys share price dynegys shares fell  percent in the two years after the deal closed and the company posted a large  million loss in the second quarter of  ls power also agreed to return all its class b shares so that dynegy would only have  million shares of common stock outstanding the dissolution of the joint venture left ls power with a  percent stake in dynegy dynegys move into coalpowered electrical generation was not without controversy in september  new york attorney general andrew cuomo sued dynegy and other utilities arguing that the companies were not properly accounting for the financial risks that pollutants from coalfired generating plants created after a year of negotiations and legal maneuvering dynegy agreed to issue statements to its current and future investors warning that government regulation of carbon emissions and lawsuits over pollution could pose financial risks to the company its move into coalfired electrical generation led the national environmental trust an environmental group to derisively call dynegy the king of coal in  takeover battlesedit on august   the blackstone group announced plans to purchase dynegy for us billion as part of the deal nrg energy would acquire four natural gas plants in california and maine for us billion seneca capital dynegys largest shareholder fought the purchase in a proxy fight dynegy investor carl icahn also promised a proxy battle arguing that blackstone groups offer was too low icahn raised his stake in dynegy to  percent in preparation for the shareholder fight seneca capital nominated former railroad executive e hunter harrison and former energy company executive jeff d hunter for the dynegy board of directors challenging bruce williamson and david biegler a williamson ally a series of maneuvers followed dynegy executives said the offer was a good one as the deal would give dynegy access to lines of credit which would enable it to refinance and restructure its debt with energy prices at cyclical lows the company said it lacked the resources to do so and that its debt burden was destabilizing blackstone group initially said it would not offer more than us per share but then revised its offer later that day to us a share worried that it did not have enough shareholder support to accept the blackstone group offer dynegy proposed postponing its shareholder meeting a few days to november  but postponement did not occur legal counsel advised that delaware law under which dynegy was incorporated considered a postponement a new meeting and that would require notifying shareholders again and giving at least  days notice furthermore dynegys proxy rules did not make it clear that a proxy remained in effect in the event of a postponement which could lead to lawsuits legal counsel also believed that dynegy management would be forced refile resolution with shareholders and resolicit votes which would delay a meeting until early  during the shareholder meeting managements fears proved accurate on november  dynegy was forced to recess its shareholder meeting in an attempt to garner more support for the blackstone bid dynegy was unable to adjourn the meeting because its bylaws did not clearly provide for adjournment to another date and because it was unclear that adjournment could occur without a shareholder vote—a vote the board felt it would lose during the fourday recess dynegy executives said the company would continue to solicit a takeover even if the blackstone group bid failed on november   dynegy management and blackstone agreed to call off the takeover after it became clear there was not enough support for the us a share bid on december   icahn offered a us a share cash bid for dynegy dynegys board asked for other bids but none emerged but icahn too found little support among shareholders he extended his offer by two weeks on january   that same day seneca capital said it would not even entertain a us a share bid dynegys board urged shareholders to accept the icahn bid or risk bankruptcy but by midfebruary even those investors willing to accept the icahn bid had rescinded these offers icahn extended his offer by few days the icahn bid too collapsed on february   bruce williamson resigned as dynegys chairman and announced he would step down as chief executive officer on march  chief financial officer holli c nichols also said she would resign as chief financial officer on march  as well board member thomas w elward was named interim chairman and robert c flexon was appointed interim president and chief executive officer harrison was elected to the board of directors also elected to the board were vincent j intrieri senior managing director of icahn capital and samuel j merksamer an investment analyst for icahn capital  bankruptcyedit the takeover bids all came after one of dynegys largest subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy on november   dynegy holdings the largest of dynegy incs four subsidiaries filed for chapter  bankruptcy protection the bankruptcy was a novel one dynegy had structured itself so that dynegy inc the holding company had little debt nearly all the debt was held by its subsidiary dynegy holdings which also guaranteed debt for the operating divisions dynegy inc created three operating divisions the natural gas group gasco the coal group coalco and a group for all other businesses known as the stub group gasco and coalco were structured so that they would be little affected by any bankruptcy filing by either dynegy inc or dynegy holdings part of the structure meant that few of the natural gascos and coalcos dividends were given to dynegy holdings to separate dynegy holdings from dynegy inc dynegy holdings was transformed from a corporation into a limited liability company llc this legal maneuver took advantage of a delaware supreme court ruling which made it difficult for creditors to sue an llcs board of directors for failing to uphold their fiduciary duty finally gasco and coalco sold themselves to dynegy inc which left dynegy holdings holding us billion in debt but without the ability to seize the assets of gasco and coalco in the event of a default under the structure adopted by dynegy inc the company could meet its debt obligations to dynegy holdings by paying cash or by forgiving debt this provided an incentive for dynegy inc to withhold payment and force dynegy holdings to declare bankruptcy thereby reducing the value of the debt and making it easier to pay off the restructuring plan put dynegys assets which had the worst financial performance into the hands of dynegy holdings the goal was to protect dynegys secured creditors at the expense of its unsecured creditors the plan had already generated one lawsuit in  us bancorp representing bondholders whose investment was secured by leases of two dynegy power plants new newburgh new york the danskammer generating station and the roseton generating station on march   dynegy submitted financial filings with government regulators warning investors that it faced bankruptcy if it could not restructure its debt the company announced a month later that it had hired the restructuring firm lazard and the law firm white  case to advise it on debt restructuring vincent intrieri was named chair of the boards finance and restructuring committee on march   the november  bankruptcy of dynegy holdings ran into difficulty an examiner appointed by the united states bankruptcy court found that the dynegy incs purchase of coalco was fraudulent the examiner found that dynegy holdings was already bankrupt at the time the sale took place and therefore constituted a breach of fiduciary duty by the dynegy holdings board of directors this allowed the dynegy holdings board of directors to sue the dynegy inc board of directors for damages which could run into the billions of dollars this threw the dynegy holdings bankrutpcy filing into doubt and put dynegy inc on the hook for billions in debt the bankruptcy court trustee said she would sue on behalf of dynegy holdings to recover these debts the bankruptcy court examiners finding quickly led to the bankruptcy of dynegy inc itself on april   dynegy inc announced that it had reached an agreement with the us bankruptcy trustee the board of directors of dynegy holdings and its other creditors the agreement which affected us billion in debt gave all creditors  percent of the stock of dynegy inc once it emerged from bankruptcy existing shareholders would get just  percent of the stock in the new company with warrants enabling them to buy up to  of common stock at a set price over the next five years accordingly dynegy inc filed for chapter  bankruptcy protection on july   the bankrutpcy plan filed by dynegy inc also called for a merger with dynegy holdings the bankruptcy filing did not however affect gasco coalco or the stub group and allowed the dynegy holdings bankruptcy to proceed dynegys stock was delisted from the new york stock exchange following the bankruptcy filing us bancorp agreed to drop its lawsuit against the company in exchange for a  million claim against the company in bankruptcy court the bondholders represented by us bancorp would also get a further us million if the danskammer and roseton plants are sold as part of its bankruptcy filing dynegy moved its corporate headquarters in november  the company signed a lease for new principal offices in an office building at  travis street in houston it occupied these quarters early july  dynegy continued to hold leases on several floors of the wells fargo plaza however as part of its bankruptcy filing the bankruptcy court approved a new lease in which dynegy would abandon  square feet  m of space at wells fargo plaza the company asked the court to cancel its lease on the remaining  square feet  m as well dynegy said it hoped to hold a vote on august  at which time its creditors would approve the bankruptcy plan a court hearing on the creditorapproved bankruptcy plan would then be held september  after which the company said it would emerge from bankruptcy protection dynegy inc posted a secondquarter  loss of  billion an increase to  per share from  cents per share a year ago the company blamed among other things markedly lower demand for its electricity much lower prices for its coal and a  million noncash loss caused by the transfer of its coal unit to dynegy holdings the company also said it now hoped to emerge from bankruptcy in september  dynegy agreed to auction off its roseton and danskammer energy plants in new york state in order to emerge from bankruptcy dynegy had signed a saleleaseback agreement in  with public services enterprise group for the roseton and danskammer facilities fifty percent of the proceeds from the auction would be used to pay bondholders up to  million while the remaining  percent would be used to pay unsecured creditors the unsecured creditors would get  million in cash unsecured creditors also would receive  percent of dynegys new stock with the company retaining the rest with warrants to purchase  percent of the stock after five years dynegy also agreed to pay holders of  million in subordinated capital income securities just  million in principal and  million in interest to settle their claims the bankruptcy agreement also settled claims between dynegy holdings and dynegy inc dynegy emerged from bankruptcy on october   and its shares began trading on october  under the dyn symbol postbankruptcyedit on november   the federal energy regulatory commission settled a decadeold lawsuit which alleged that dynegy had manipulated the california energy market while the lawsuit continued dynegy sold its california subsidiary to nrg energy inc nrg energy subsequently agreed to pay  million in refunds to consumers as well as spend more than  million to install  public fastcharging electric vehicle stations and  plugin stations throughout california twenty percent of the stations were required to be in lowincome neighborhoods on january   dynegys chief operating officer kevin howell resigned howell continued as a consultant to the company and agreed to stay on until a successor was named in order to provide an orderly transition on february   dynegys south bay power plant in san diego california was imploded the demolition of the foot  m smokestacks of the outmoded plant was watched by more than  people roseton and danskammer salesedit the sale of the roseton and danskammer plants—a condition of dynegys emergence from bankruptcy—proceeded slowly on november   members of international brotherhood of electrical workers ibew local  struck the roseton and danskammer plants after a contract extension expired and dynegy continued to seek cuts in retirement benefits dynegys bankruptcy also left  million in unpaid property taxes in dutchess county new york this created a budget crisis in the county which threatened to close local schools and create severe cutbacks in county services on december   dynegy announced it would sell the roseton plant to louis dreyfus highbridge energy for  million in cash the sale closed on april   the danskammer plant sale was far more troubled the plant was heavily damaged by hurricane sandy in october  rendering it inoperable on december  dynegy said that ics ny holdings would buy the plant for  million and demolish it but the ics sale stalled under the terms of the auction ics ny had to replace or find a substitute for its credit support agreement and pay its portion of the plants outstanding property taxes but dynegy said the company never did either ics defended itself saying it was making every economically feasible effort to replace the credit agreement on may   dynegy filed suit with the bankruptcy court to force ica to fulfill its obligations the court imposed a july  deadline for ics to close the sale but it did not meet the deadline dynegy subsequently sought another buyer helios power capital a private equity firm agreed to purchase the plant for  million in cash on august  the court approved the sale on september  ameren purchaseedit in midmarch  dynegy purchased three electric generating subsidiaries of ameren an illinois power company the deal worth  million involved amerens ameren energy generating co genco gencos controlling interest in electric energy inc amerenenergy resources generating co and ameren energy marketing co dynegy formed a subsidiary illinois power holdings iph to purchase the ameren subsidiaries no cash changed hands rather iph agreed to assume  million in debt owed by genco and the other subsidiaries ameren also transferred about  million in tax benefits the three subsidiaries would have received in  ameren retained gencos inactive hutsonville and meredosia plants and agreed to buy back from iph for  million three natural gas electrical generating plants dynegy agreed to honor the union collective bargaining agreements in force at all plants under the deal dynegy acquired five coalfired generating plants coffeen in coffeen illinois duck creek in canton illinois ed edwards in bartonville illinois joppa in joppa illinois and newton in newton illinois as the deal worked its way through state and federal regulatory approval dynegy took advantage of low interest rates and refinanced its debt the company obtained  billion in term loan b facilities and  million in revolving credit the company used this income to retire an  million sevenyear line of credit and a  million twoyear line of credit dynegy agreed that the revolving credit line would be paid off and terminate within five years two syndicated loans made up the  billion loan package the  million loan and the  million loan were both due in  this left dynegy with  billion in lines of credit and  million in outstanding bonds the ameren plantsfordebt swap also ran into trouble the federal energy regulatory commission ferc had to approve the deal and ensure that there was no negative impact on consumers from dynegys expanding market share in the midwest but on april  ferc said that the studies submitted by dynegy and ameren were inadequate and it ordered the two firms to rerun the studies and report back to ferc by july  on july  ferc again declined to approve or disapprove the dynegyameren deal the agency said that it dynegys study showed it charging market rates for energy in the midwest but ferc said it worried that transmission bottlenecks in the area would permit dynegy to charge much more furthermore federal regulators were considering an expansion in the market area iph could serve ferc asked dynegy to provide additional information on transmission limitations and market area expansion in august the sierra club formally filed opposition to the dynegyameren deal the environmental group said the transmission bottleneck issue gave dynegy too much market power it also argued that dynegy and ameren had submitted only regional market power data and had not accounted for local impacts which could be very severe another obstacle emerged on june  ameren was required to install pollutionreducing equipment on its five coalfired generating plants in  but because ameren was in financial difficulty it sought and received a waiver from the state of illinois granting it a fiveyear delay ameren sought to transfer this delay to dynegy so that dynegy would not have to immediately install the devices until  either but the illinois pollution control board denied amerens request dynegy filed its own request for a fiveyear waiver in july and warned that the ameren deal would fall apart if it did not receive the waiver but the sierra club the environmental law and policy center and other environmental groups said dynegy had the resources to install the equipment and opposed a waiver acm partners a financial firm hired by the sierra club also argued that dynegy purposefully left iph significantly underfunded and unable to tap into the parent companys resources dynegy disagreed but the firm warned that if iph went bankrupt workers would lose pensions and local communities would have to pay for any environmental remediation the illinois aflcio however supported dynegys request on september  saying that local jobs depended on the waiver the pollution board said it would make a decision by november  foresight energy a major illinois coal mining company said it would install the  million antipollution devices for free if dynegy agreed to sign a longterm contract to accept coal only from foresight energy dynegy declined the offer in part because it already has longterm coal contracts and environmental groups opposed it there was some speculation by financial analysts that the dynegyameren deal was a poor one julien dumoulinsmith executive director of ubs investment research said dynegy is far more likely to shutter all five coalpowered plants rather than add pollution control devices dumoulinsmith pointed out that the united states environmental protection agency epa issued final rules on sulfur dioxide emissions that go into effect in july  because the edwards plant is in an area of low air quality epa is likely to force dynegy to close the plant anyway the remaining four plants are borderline cases with the exception of duck creek station which spent nearly usm on sulfur dioxide removal and may also be forced to close if epa regulations tighten in the future a highly likely possibility he said  acquisitionsedit on august   dynegy announced a deal involving two interdependent transactions to be executed simultaneously dynegy acquired duke’s midwest generation assets and retail business for  billion in cash and the power generating assets of equipower resources for  billion with  billion in cash and  million in stock this increased the companys

northeast united states in march  it agreed to settle a  dispute with the environmental protection agency by spending us million to repair and upgrade coalfired generating plants in illinois to reduce

business to targa resources a company owned by private equity firm warburg pincus in september  dynegy and ls power group agreed to a joint venture in a deal worth us billion under the terms of the

power in may  chevrontexaco announced it was selling its  percent stake in dynegy to the public the sale netted chevrontexaco us million by july the joint venture did not last however in august  ls power agreed to buy nine electrical generating plants from dynegy for us billion in cash in order to dissolve the joint venture part of the reason for the joint ventures demise was another collapse in dynegys share price dynegys shares fell  percent in the two years after the deal closed and the company posted a large  million loss in the second quarter of  ls power also agreed to return all its class b shares so that dynegy would only have  million shares of common stock outstanding the dissolution of the joint venture left ls power with a  percent stake in dynegy dynegys move into coalpowered electrical generation was not without controversy in september  new york attorney general andrew cuomo sued dynegy and other utilities arguing that the companies were not properly accounting for the financial risks that pollutants from coalfired generating plants created after a year of negotiations and legal maneuvering dynegy agreed to issue statements to its current and future investors warning that government regulation of carbon emissions and lawsuits over pollution could pose financial risks to the company its move into coalfired electrical generation led the national environmental trust an environmental group to derisively call dynegy the king of coal in  takeover battlesedit on august   the blackstone group announced plans to purchase dynegy for us billion as part of the deal nrg energy would acquire four natural gas plants in california and maine for us billion seneca capital dynegys largest shareholder fought the purchase in a proxy fight dynegy investor carl icahn also promised a proxy battle arguing that blackstone groups offer was too low icahn raised his stake in dynegy to  percent in preparation for the shareholder fight seneca capital nominated former railroad executive e hunter harrison and former energy company executive jeff d hunter for the dynegy board of directors challenging bruce williamson and david biegler a williamson ally a series of maneuvers followed dynegy executives said the offer was a good one as the deal would give dynegy access to lines of credit which would enable it to refinance and restructure its debt with energy prices at cyclical lows the company said it lacked the resources to do so and that its debt burden was destabilizing blackstone group initially said it would not offer more than us per share but then revised its offer later that day to us a share worried that it did not have enough shareholder support to accept the blackstone group offer dynegy proposed postponing its shareholder meeting a few days to november  but postponement did not occur legal counsel advised that delaware law under which dynegy was incorporated considered a postponement a new meeting and that would require notifying shareholders again and giving at least  days notice furthermore dynegys proxy rules did not make it clear that a proxy remained in effect in the event of a postponement which could lead to lawsuits legal counsel also believed that dynegy management would be forced refile resolution with shareholders and resolicit votes which would delay a meeting until early  during the shareholder meeting managements fears proved accurate on november  dynegy was forced to recess its shareholder meeting in an attempt to garner more support for the blackstone bid dynegy was unable to adjourn the meeting because its bylaws did not clearly provide for adjournment to another date and because it was unclear that adjournment could occur without a shareholder vote—a vote the board felt it would lose during the fourday recess dynegy executives said the company would continue to solicit a takeover even if the blackstone group bid failed on november   dynegy management and blackstone agreed to call off the takeover after it became clear there was not enough support for the us a share bid on december   icahn offered a us a share cash bid for dynegy dynegys board asked for other bids but none emerged but icahn too found little support among shareholders he extended his offer by two weeks on january   that same day seneca capital said it would not even entertain a us a share bid dynegys board urged shareholders to accept the icahn bid or risk bankruptcy but by midfebruary even those investors willing to accept the icahn bid had rescinded these offers icahn extended his offer by few days the icahn bid too collapsed on february   bruce williamson resigned as dynegys chairman and announced he would step down as chief executive officer on march  chief financial officer holli c nichols also said she would resign as chief financial officer on march  as well board member thomas w elward was named interim chairman and robert c flexon was appointed interim president and chief executive officer harrison was elected to the board of directors also elected to the board were vincent j intrieri senior managing director of icahn capital and samuel j merksamer an investment analyst for icahn capital  bankruptcyedit the takeover bids all came after one of dynegys largest subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy on november   dynegy holdings the largest of dynegy incs four subsidiaries filed for chapter  bankruptcy protection the bankruptcy was a novel one dynegy had structured itself so that dynegy inc the holding company had little debt nearly all the debt was held by its subsidiary dynegy holdings which also guaranteed debt for the operating divisions dynegy inc created three operating divisions the natural gas group gasco the coal group coalco and a group for all other businesses known as the stub group gasco and coalco were structured so that they would be little affected by any bankruptcy filing by either dynegy inc or dynegy holdings part of the structure meant that few of the natural gascos and coalcos dividends were given to dynegy holdings to separate dynegy holdings from dynegy inc dynegy holdings was transformed from a corporation into a limited liability company llc this legal maneuver took advantage of a delaware supreme court ruling which made it difficult for creditors to sue an llcs board of directors for failing to uphold their fiduciary duty finally gasco and coalco sold themselves to dynegy inc which left dynegy holdings holding us billion in debt but without the ability to seize the assets of gasco and coalco in the event of a default under the structure adopted by dynegy inc the company could meet its debt obligations to dynegy holdings by paying cash or by forgiving debt this provided an incentive for dynegy inc to withhold payment and force dynegy holdings to declare bankruptcy thereby reducing the value of the debt and making it easier to pay off the restructuring plan put dynegys assets which had the worst financial performance into the hands of dynegy holdings the goal was to protect dynegys secured creditors at the expense of its unsecured creditors the plan had already generated one lawsuit in  us bancorp representing bondholders whose investment was secured by leases of two dynegy power plants new newburgh new york the danskammer generating station and the roseton generating station on march   dynegy submitted financial filings with government regulators warning investors that it faced bankruptcy if it could not restructure its debt the company announced a month later that it had hired the restructuring firm lazard and the law firm white  case to advise it on debt restructuring vincent intrieri was named chair of the boards finance and restructuring committee on march   the november  bankruptcy of dynegy holdings ran into difficulty an examiner appointed by the united states bankruptcy court found that the dynegy incs purchase of coalco was fraudulent the examiner found that dynegy holdings was already bankrupt at the time the sale took place and therefore constituted a breach of fiduciary duty by the dynegy holdings board of directors this allowed the dynegy holdings board of directors to sue the dynegy inc board of directors for damages which could run into the billions of dollars this threw the dynegy holdings bankrutpcy filing into doubt and put dynegy inc on the hook for billions in debt the bankruptcy court trustee said she would sue on behalf of dynegy holdings to recover these debts the bankruptcy court examiners finding quickly led to the bankruptcy of dynegy inc itself on april   dynegy inc announced that it had reached an agreement with the us bankruptcy trustee the board of directors of dynegy holdings and its other creditors the agreement which affected us billion in debt gave all creditors  percent of the stock of dynegy inc once it emerged from bankruptcy existing shareholders would get just  percent of the stock in the new company with warrants enabling them to buy up to  of common stock at a set price over the next five years accordingly dynegy inc filed for chapter  bankruptcy protection on july   the bankrutpcy plan filed by dynegy inc also called for a merger with dynegy holdings the bankruptcy filing did not however affect gasco coalco or the stub group and allowed the dynegy holdings bankruptcy to proceed dynegys stock was delisted from the new york stock exchange following the bankruptcy filing us bancorp agreed to drop its lawsuit against the company in exchange for a  million claim against the company in bankruptcy court the bondholders represented by us bancorp would also get a further us million if the danskammer and roseton plants are sold as part of its bankruptcy filing dynegy moved its corporate headquarters in november  the company signed a lease for new principal offices in an office building at  travis street in houston it occupied these quarters early july  dynegy continued to hold leases on several floors of the wells fargo plaza however as part of its bankruptcy filing the bankruptcy court approved a new lease in which dynegy would abandon  square feet  m of space at wells fargo plaza the company asked the court to cancel its lease on the remaining  square feet  m as well dynegy said it hoped to hold a vote on august  at which time its creditors would approve the bankruptcy plan a court hearing on the creditorapproved bankruptcy plan would then be held september  after which the company said it would emerge from bankruptcy protection dynegy inc posted a secondquarter  loss of  billion an increase to  per share from  cents per share a year ago the company blamed among other things markedly lower demand for its electricity much lower prices for its coal and a  million noncash loss caused by the transfer of its coal unit to dynegy holdings the company also said it now hoped to emerge from bankruptcy in september  dynegy agreed to auction off its roseton and danskammer energy plants in new york state in order to emerge from bankruptcy dynegy had signed a saleleaseback agreement in  with public services enterprise group for the roseton and danskammer facilities fifty percent of the proceeds from the auction would be used to pay bondholders up to  million while the remaining  percent would be used to pay unsecured creditors the unsecured creditors would get  million in cash unsecured creditors also would receive  percent of dynegys new stock with the company retaining the rest with warrants to purchase  percent of the stock after five years dynegy also agreed to pay holders of  million in subordinated capital income securities just  million in principal and  million in interest to settle their claims the bankruptcy agreement also settled claims between dynegy holdings and dynegy inc dynegy emerged from bankruptcy on october   and its shares began trading on october  under the dyn symbol postbankruptcyedit on november   the federal energy regulatory commission settled a decadeold lawsuit which alleged that dynegy had manipulated the california energy market while the lawsuit continued dynegy sold its california subsidiary to nrg energy inc nrg energy subsequently agreed to pay  million in refunds to consumers as well as spend more than  million to install  public fastcharging electric vehicle stations and  plugin stations throughout california twenty percent of the stations were required to be in lowincome neighborhoods on january   dynegys chief operating officer kevin howell resigned howell continued as a consultant to the company and agreed to stay on until a successor was named in order to provide an orderly transition on february   dynegys south bay power plant in san diego california was imploded the demolition of the foot  m smokestacks of the outmoded plant was watched by more than  people roseton and danskammer salesedit the sale of the roseton and danskammer plants—a condition of dynegys emergence from bankruptcy—proceeded slowly on november   members of international brotherhood of electrical workers ibew local  struck the roseton and danskammer plants after a contract extension expired and dynegy continued to seek cuts in retirement benefits dynegys bankruptcy also left  million in unpaid property taxes in dutchess county new york this created a budget crisis in the county which threatened to close local schools and create severe cutbacks in county services on december   dynegy announced it would sell the roseton plant to louis dreyfus highbridge energy for  million in cash the sale closed on april   the danskammer plant sale was far more troubled the plant was heavily damaged by hurricane sandy in october  rendering it inoperable on december  dynegy said that ics ny holdings would buy the plant for  million and demolish it but the ics sale stalled under the terms of the auction ics ny had to replace or find a substitute for its credit support agreement and pay its portion of the plants outstanding property taxes but dynegy said the company never did either ics defended itself saying it was making every economically feasible effort to replace the credit agreement on may   dynegy filed suit with the bankruptcy court to force ica to fulfill its obligations the court imposed a july  deadline for ics to close the sale but it did not meet the deadline dynegy subsequently sought another buyer helios power capital a private equity firm agreed to purchase the plant for  million in cash on august  the court approved the sale on september  ameren purchaseedit in midmarch  dynegy purchased three electric generating subsidiaries of ameren an illinois power company the deal worth  million involved amerens ameren energy generating co genco gencos controlling interest in electric energy inc amerenenergy resources generating co and ameren energy marketing co dynegy formed a subsidiary illinois power holdings iph to purchase the ameren subsidiaries no cash changed hands rather iph agreed to assume  million in debt owed by genco and the other subsidiaries ameren also transferred about  million in tax benefits the three subsidiaries would have received in  ameren retained gencos inactive hutsonville and meredosia plants and agreed to buy back from iph for  million three natural gas electrical generating plants dynegy agreed to honor the union collective bargaining agreements in force at all plants under the deal dynegy acquired five coalfired generating plants coffeen in coffeen illinois duck creek in canton illinois ed edwards in bartonville illinois joppa in joppa illinois and newton in newton illinois as the deal worked its way through state and federal regulatory approval dynegy took advantage of low interest rates and refinanced its debt the company obtained  billion in term loan b facilities and  million in revolving credit the company used this income to retire an  million sevenyear line of credit and a  million twoyear line of credit dynegy agreed that the revolving credit line would be paid off and terminate within five years two syndicated loans made up the  billion loan package the  million loan and the  million loan were both due in  this left dynegy with  billion in lines of credit and  million in outstanding bonds the ameren plantsfordebt swap also ran into trouble the federal energy regulatory commission ferc had to approve the deal and ensure that there was no negative impact on consumers from dynegys expanding market share in the midwest but on april  ferc said that the studies submitted by dynegy and ameren were inadequate and it ordered the two firms to rerun the studies and report back to ferc by july  on july  ferc again declined to approve or disapprove the dynegyameren deal the agency said that it dynegys study showed it charging market rates for energy in the midwest but ferc said it worried that transmission bottlenecks in the area would permit dynegy to charge much more furthermore federal regulators were considering an expansion in the market area iph could serve ferc asked dynegy to provide additional information on transmission limitations and market area expansion in august the sierra club formally filed opposition to the dynegyameren deal the environmental group said the transmission bottleneck issue gave dynegy too much market power it also argued that dynegy and ameren had submitted only regional market power data and had not accounted for local impacts which could be very severe another obstacle emerged on june  ameren was required to install pollutionreducing equipment on its five coalfired generating plants in  but because ameren was in financial difficulty it sought and received a waiver from the state of illinois granting it a fiveyear delay ameren sought to transfer this delay to dynegy so that dynegy would not have to immediately install the devices until  either but the illinois pollution control board denied amerens request dynegy filed its own request for a fiveyear waiver in july and warned that the ameren deal would fall apart if it did not receive the waiver but the sierra club the environmental law and policy center and other environmental groups said dynegy had the resources to install the equipment and opposed a waiver acm partners a financial firm hired by the sierra club also argued that dynegy purposefully left iph significantly underfunded and unable to tap into the parent companys resources dynegy disagreed but the firm warned that if iph went bankrupt workers would lose pensions and local communities would have to pay for any environmental remediation the illinois aflcio however supported dynegys request on september  saying that local jobs depended on the waiver the pollution board said it would make a decision by november  foresight energy a major illinois coal mining company said it would install the  million antipollution devices for free if dynegy agreed to sign a longterm contract to accept coal only from foresight energy dynegy declined the offer in part because it already has longterm coal contracts and environmental groups opposed it there was some speculation by financial analysts that the dynegyameren deal was a poor one julien dumoulinsmith executive director of ubs investment research said dynegy is far more likely to shutter all five coalpowered plants rather than add pollution control devices dumoulinsmith pointed out that the united states environmental protection agency epa issued final rules on sulfur dioxide emissions that go into effect in july  because the edwards plant is in an area of low air quality epa is likely to force dynegy to close the plant anyway the remaining four plants are borderline cases with the exception of duck creek station which spent nearly usm on sulfur dioxide removal and may also be forced to close if epa regulations tighten in the future a highly likely possibility he said  acquisitionsedit on august   dynegy announced a deal involving two interdependent transactions to be executed simultaneously dynegy acquired duke’s midwest generation assets and retail business for  billion in cash and the power generating assets of equipower resources for  billion with  billion in cash and  million in stock this increased the companys

accounting for the financial risks that pollutants from coalfired generating plants created after a year of negotiations and legal maneuvering dynegy agreed to issue statements to its current and future investors warning that government regulation of carbon emissions and lawsuits over pollution could pose financial risks to the company its move into coalfired electrical generation led the national environmental trust an environmental group to derisively call dynegy the king of coal in  takeover battlesedit on august   the blackstone group announced plans to purchase dynegy for us billion as part of the deal nrg energy would acquire four natural gas plants in california and maine for us billion seneca capital dynegys largest shareholder fought the purchase in a proxy fight dynegy investor carl icahn also promised a proxy battle arguing that blackstone groups offer was too low icahn raised his stake in dynegy to  percent in preparation for the shareholder fight seneca capital nominated former railroad executive e hunter harrison and former energy company executive jeff d hunter for the dynegy board of directors challenging bruce williamson and david biegler a williamson ally a series of maneuvers followed dynegy executives said the offer was a good one as the deal would give dynegy access to lines of credit which would enable it to refinance and restructure its debt with energy prices at cyclical lows the company said it lacked the resources to do so and that its debt burden was destabilizing blackstone group initially said it would not offer more than us per share but then revised its offer later that day to us a share worried that it did not have enough shareholder support to accept the blackstone group offer dynegy proposed postponing its shareholder meeting a few days to november  but postponement did not occur legal counsel advised that delaware law under which dynegy was incorporated considered a postponement a new meeting and that would require notifying shareholders again and giving at least  days notice furthermore dynegys proxy rules did not make it clear that a proxy remained in effect in the event of a postponement which could lead to lawsuits legal counsel also believed that dynegy management would be forced refile resolution with shareholders and resolicit votes which would delay a meeting until early  during the shareholder meeting managements fears proved accurate on november  dynegy was forced to recess its shareholder meeting in an attempt to garner more support for the blackstone bid dynegy was unable to adjourn the meeting because its bylaws did not clearly provide for adjournment to another date and because it was unclear that adjournment could occur without a shareholder vote—a vote the board felt it would lose during the fourday recess dynegy executives said the company would continue to solicit a takeover even if the blackstone group bid failed on november   dynegy management and blackstone agreed to call off the takeover after it became clear there was not enough support for the us a share bid on december   icahn offered a us a share cash bid for dynegy dynegys board asked for other bids but none emerged but icahn too found little support among shareholders he extended his offer by two weeks on january   that same day seneca capital said it would not even entertain a us a share bid dynegys board urged shareholders to accept the icahn bid or risk bankruptcy but by midfebruary even those investors willing to accept the icahn bid had rescinded these offers icahn extended his offer by few days the icahn bid too collapsed on february   bruce williamson resigned as dynegys chairman and announced he would step down as chief executive officer on march  chief financial officer holli c nichols also said she would resign as chief financial officer on march  as well board member thomas w elward was named interim chairman and robert c flexon was appointed interim president and chief executive officer harrison was elected to the board of directors also elected to the board were vincent j intrieri senior managing director of icahn capital and samuel j merksamer an investment analyst for icahn capital  bankruptcyedit the takeover bids all came after one of dynegys largest subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy on november   dynegy holdings the largest of dynegy incs four subsidiaries filed for chapter  bankruptcy protection the bankruptcy was a novel one dynegy had structured itself so that dynegy inc the holding company had little debt nearly all the debt was held by its subsidiary dynegy holdings which also guaranteed debt for the operating divisions dynegy inc created three operating divisions the natural gas group gasco the coal group coalco and a group for all other businesses known as the stub group gasco and coalco were structured so that they would be little affected by any bankruptcy filing by either dynegy inc or dynegy holdings part of the structure meant that few of the natural gascos and coalcos dividends were given to dynegy holdings to separate dynegy holdings from dynegy inc dynegy holdings was transformed from a corporation into a limited liability company llc this legal maneuver took advantage of a delaware supreme court ruling which made it difficult for creditors to sue an llcs board of directors for failing to uphold their fiduciary duty finally gasco and coalco sold themselves to dynegy inc which left dynegy holdings holding us billion in debt but without the ability to seize the assets of gasco and coalco in the event of a default under the structure adopted by dynegy inc the company could meet its debt obligations to dynegy holdings by paying cash or by forgiving debt this provided an incentive for dynegy inc to withhold payment and force dynegy holdings to declare bankruptcy thereby reducing the value of the debt and making it easier to pay off the restructuring plan put dynegys assets which had the worst financial performance into the hands of dynegy holdings the goal was to protect dynegys secured creditors at the expense of its unsecured creditors the plan had already generated one lawsuit in  us bancorp representing bondholders whose investment was secured by leases of two dynegy power plants new newburgh new york the danskammer generating station and the roseton generating station on march   dynegy submitted financial filings with government regulators warning investors that it faced bankruptcy if it could not restructure its debt the company announced a month later that it had hired the restructuring firm lazard and the law firm white  case to advise it on debt restructuring vincent intrieri was named chair of the boards finance and restructuring committee on march   the november  bankruptcy of dynegy holdings ran into difficulty an examiner appointed by the united states bankruptcy court found that the dynegy incs purchase of coalco was fraudulent the examiner found that dynegy holdings was already bankrupt at the time the sale took place and therefore constituted a breach of fiduciary duty by the dynegy holdings board of directors this allowed the dynegy holdings board of directors to sue the dynegy inc board of directors for damages which could run into the billions of dollars this threw the dynegy holdings bankrutpcy filing into doubt and put dynegy inc on the hook for billions in debt the bankruptcy court trustee said she would sue on behalf of dynegy holdings to recover these debts the bankruptcy court examiners finding quickly led to the bankruptcy of dynegy inc itself on april   dynegy inc announced that it had reached an agreement with the us bankruptcy trustee the board of directors of dynegy holdings and its other creditors the agreement which affected us billion in debt gave all creditors  percent of the stock of dynegy inc once it emerged from bankruptcy existing shareholders would get just  percent of the stock in the new company with warrants enabling them to buy up to  of common stock at a set price over the next five years accordingly dynegy inc filed for chapter  bankruptcy protection on july   the bankrutpcy plan filed by dynegy inc also called for a merger with dynegy holdings the bankruptcy filing did not however affect gasco coalco or the stub group and allowed the dynegy holdings bankruptcy to proceed dynegys stock was delisted from the new york stock exchange following the bankruptcy filing us bancorp agreed to drop its lawsuit against the company in exchange for a  million claim against the company in bankruptcy court the bondholders represented by us bancorp would also get a further us million if the danskammer and roseton plants are sold as part of its bankruptcy filing dynegy moved its corporate headquarters in november  the company signed a lease for new principal offices in an office building at  travis street in houston it occupied these quarters early july  dynegy continued to hold leases on several floors of the wells fargo plaza however as part of its bankruptcy filing the bankruptcy court approved a new lease in which dynegy would abandon  square feet  m of space at wells fargo plaza the company asked the court to cancel its lease on the remaining  square feet  m as well dynegy said it hoped to hold a vote on august  at which time its creditors would approve the bankruptcy plan a court hearing on the creditorapproved bankruptcy plan would then be held september  after which the company said it would emerge from bankruptcy protection dynegy inc posted a secondquarter  loss of  billion an increase to  per share from  cents per share a year ago the company blamed among other things markedly lower demand for its electricity much lower prices for its coal and a  million noncash loss caused by the transfer of its coal unit to dynegy holdings the company also said it now hoped to emerge from bankruptcy in september  dynegy agreed to auction off its roseton and danskammer energy plants in new york state in order to emerge from bankruptcy dynegy had signed a saleleaseback agreement in  with public services enterprise group for the roseton and danskammer facilities fifty percent of the proceeds from the auction would be used to pay bondholders up to  million while the remaining  percent would be used to pay unsecured creditors the unsecured creditors would get  million in cash unsecured creditors also would receive  percent of dynegys new stock with the company retaining the rest with warrants to purchase  percent of the stock after five years dynegy also agreed to pay holders of  million in subordinated capital income securities just  million in principal and  million in interest to settle their claims the bankruptcy agreement also settled claims between dynegy holdings and dynegy inc dynegy emerged from bankruptcy on october   and its shares began trading on october  under the dyn symbol postbankruptcyedit on november   the federal energy regulatory commission settled a decadeold lawsuit which alleged that dynegy had manipulated the california energy market while the lawsuit continued dynegy sold its california subsidiary to nrg energy inc nrg energy subsequently agreed to pay  million in refunds to consumers as well as spend more than  million to install  public fastcharging electric vehicle stations and  plugin stations throughout california twenty percent of the stations were required to be in lowincome neighborhoods on january   dynegys chief operating officer kevin howell resigned howell continued as a consultant to the company and agreed to stay on until a successor was named in order to provide an orderly transition on february   dynegys south bay power plant in san diego california was imploded the demolition of the foot  m smokestacks of the outmoded plant was watched by more than  people roseton and danskammer salesedit the sale of the roseton and danskammer plants—a condition of dynegys emergence from bankruptcy—proceeded slowly on november   members of international brotherhood of electrical workers ibew local  struck the roseton and danskammer plants after a contract extension expired and dynegy continued to seek cuts in retirement benefits dynegys bankruptcy also left  million in unpaid property taxes in dutchess county new york this created a budget crisis in the county which threatened to close local schools and create severe cutbacks in county services on december   dynegy announced it would sell the roseton plant to louis dreyfus highbridge energy for  million in cash the sale closed on april   the danskammer plant sale was far more troubled the plant was heavily damaged by hurricane sandy in october  rendering it inoperable on december  dynegy said that ics ny holdings would buy the plant for  million and demolish it but the ics sale stalled under the terms of the auction ics ny had to replace or find a substitute for its credit support agreement and pay its portion of the plants outstanding property taxes but dynegy said the company never did either ics defended itself saying it was making every economically feasible effort to replace the credit agreement on may   dynegy filed suit with the bankruptcy court to force ica to fulfill its obligations the court imposed a july  deadline for ics to close the sale but it did not meet the deadline dynegy subsequently sought another buyer helios power capital a private equity firm agreed to purchase the plant for  million in cash on august  the

power holdings iph to purchase the ameren subsidiaries no cash changed hands rather iph agreed to assume  million in debt owed by genco and the other subsidiaries ameren also transferred about

electrical generating plants dynegy agreed to honor the union collective bargaining agreements in force at all plants under the deal dynegy acquired five coalfired generating plants coffeen in coffeen illinois duck creek in canton illinois ed edwards in bartonville illinois joppa in joppa illinois and newton in newton illinois as the deal worked its way through state and federal regulatory approval dynegy took advantage of low interest rates and refinanced its debt the company obtained  billion in term loan b facilities and  million in revolving credit the company used this income to retire an  million sevenyear line of credit and a  million twoyear line of credit dynegy agreed that the revolving credit line would be paid off and terminate within five years two syndicated loans made up the  billion loan package the  million loan and the  million loan were both due in  this left dynegy with  billion in lines of credit and  million in outstanding bonds the ameren plantsfordebt swap also ran into trouble the federal energy regulatory commission ferc had to approve the deal and ensure that there was no negative impact on consumers from dynegys expanding market share in the midwest but on april  ferc said that the studies submitted by dynegy and ameren were inadequate and it ordered the two firms to rerun the studies and report back to ferc by july  on july  ferc again declined to approve or disapprove the dynegyameren deal the agency said that it dynegys study showed it charging market rates for energy in the midwest but ferc said it worried that transmission bottlenecks in the area would permit dynegy to charge much more furthermore federal regulators were considering an expansion in the market area iph could serve ferc asked dynegy to provide additional information on transmission limitations and market area expansion in august the sierra club formally filed opposition to the dynegyameren deal the environmental group said the transmission bottleneck issue gave dynegy too much market power it also argued that dynegy and ameren had submitted only regional market power data and had not accounted for local impacts which could be very severe another obstacle emerged on june  ameren was required to install pollutionreducing equipment on its five coalfired generating plants in  but because ameren was in financial difficulty it sought and received a waiver from the state of illinois granting it a fiveyear delay ameren sought to transfer this delay to dynegy so that dynegy would not have to immediately install the devices until  either but the illinois pollution control board denied amerens request dynegy filed its own request for a fiveyear waiver in july and warned that the ameren deal would fall apart if it did not receive the waiver but the sierra club the environmental law and policy center and other environmental groups said dynegy had the resources to install the equipment and opposed a waiver acm partners a financial firm hired by the sierra club also argued that dynegy purposefully left iph significantly underfunded and unable to tap into the parent companys resources dynegy disagreed but the firm warned that if iph went bankrupt workers would lose pensions and local communities would have to pay for any environmental remediation the illinois aflcio however supported dynegys request on september  saying that local jobs depended on the waiver the pollution board said it would make a decision by november  foresight energy a major illinois coal mining company said it would install the  million antipollution devices for free if dynegy agreed to sign a longterm contract to accept coal only from foresight energy dynegy declined the offer in part because it already has longterm coal contracts and environmental groups opposed it there was some speculation by financial analysts that the dynegyameren deal was a poor one julien dumoulinsmith executive director of ubs investment research said dynegy is far more likely to shutter all five coalpowered plants rather than add pollution control devices dumoulinsmith pointed out that the united states environmental protection agency epa issued final rules on sulfur dioxide emissions that go into effect in july  because the edwards plant is in an area of low air quality epa is likely to force dynegy to close the plant anyway the remaining four plants are borderline cases with the exception of duck creek station which spent nearly usm on sulfur dioxide removal and may also be forced to close if epa regulations tighten in the future a highly likely possibility he said  acquisitionsedit on august   dynegy announced a deal involving two interdependent transactions to be executed simultaneously dynegy acquired duke’s midwest generation assets and retail business for  billion in cash and the power generating assets of equipower resources for  billion with  billion in cash and  million in stock this increased the companys

chevron corporation also took a  stake illinova the utility holding company of illinois power company had grown to over us million in assets and us billion longterm debt as of the late s the ip utility company had operated almost entirely from coal plants with less than  fueled from oil and gas dynegy along with enron el paso corporation reliant energy and several other energy companies was accused of price fixing and other fraudulent practices during the california electricity crisis in  in  the company made an unsuccessful takeover bid for enron pulling out at the last minute following an unexpected restatement of earnings by enron shortly after the pullout enron filed for chapter  bankruptcy and sued dynegy one aspect of the takeover deal that did survive however was dynegys acquisition of the northern natural gas company pipeline enrons most lucrative pipeline asset unfortunately for dynegys shareholders and employees these events did nothing to prevent dynegy itself from lapsing into a crisis similar to that of enron in late  amid accusations of accounting fraud and other misdoings founder charles watson resigned and the company was forced to sell the northern natural gas pipeline to a consortium of investors led by noted billionaire warren buffett following these incidents the company hired bruce williamson a former duke energy executive who began a program of cost cutting elimination of unprofitable businesses and financial restructuring which was successful in averting a bankruptcy filing the company disposed of all its businesses with the exception of its core merchant power and natural gas liquids businesses refocused on these core businesses and managed with a strong emphasis on efficiency and cost control dynegy was able to

dynegy was one of five energy companies subpoenaed in  by new york attorney general andrew cuomo in an effort to publicize the financial risks of investing in fossil fuels in october  dynegy agreed to disclose information about how global warming may impact its business practices the agreement calls for dynegy to divulge in its annual reports the potential consequences if federal rules are adopted to limit carbon dioxide emissions dynegy also agreed to report its efforts to mitigate co emissions estimates of its financial liability in settling possible lawsuits related to climate change and the potential impact of climate shifts on its ability to generate electricity xcel energy agreed to similar terms in august weakening economy and lessening demand during dynegys third quarter earnings call in november  ceo bruce williamson announced that very little new power plant development is going on in the country and very little can be economically justified in the current environment he suggested that economic conditions would likely slow the demand for power in the short term these statements may have been influenced by the cuomo settlement requiring the company to divulge the financial risks of coal investment however williamson also stated that in the longer term he believes that weather conditions rather than economic conditions will be the prime driver of electricity demand such that global demand will continue to put upward pressure on power prices dynegy to reconsider building new coal plants in december  dynegy ceo bruce williamson announced that the company was reevaluating its role in developing new power plants williamson cited the tightening credit markets and difficulty in permitted new coal plants as reasons for reconsidering its invovlement in siting permitting financing and constructing at least six new projects as an alternative the company will look at adding generation to its existing sites in the northeast midwest and western us the projects to be reassessed include longleaf plant  georgia ls power elk run energy station  iowa midland power plant  michigan plum point energy station  arkansas sandy creek plant  texas west deptford project  new jersey white pine energy station  nevada dynegy dissolves joint venture with ls power on january   dynegy announced it was dissolving its development venture with ls power in part because of the credit crisis under the agreement ls power will maintain the rights to build the coal plant projects under consideration in arkansas georgia iowa michigan and nevada dynegy will also pay ls power about  million without dynegys support ls power will likely face a more difficult time raising funds and securing longterm purchase agreements to enable the new plants to move forward the stock market responded positively to the announcement sending dynegys stock up  on january  and another  percent in the following week in detailing the reasons behind the dissolution dynegy ceo bruce williamson said “the development landscape has changed significantly since we agreed to enter into the development joint venture with ls power in the fall of ” said bruce a williamson chairman president and chief executive officer of dynegy inc “today the development of new generation is increasingly marked by barriers to entry including external credit and regulatory factors that make development much more uncertain in light of these market circumstances dynegy has elected to focus development activities and investments around our own portfolio where we control the option to develop and can manage the costs being incurred more closely” on january   ls power announced it was cancelling plans to build the proposed elk run energy station in waterloo iowa ls power puts nevada plant on indefinite hold on march   ls power notified nevada state regulators that it was withdrawing its application to build the white pine energy station the company cited economic conditions and

williamson wins worst scrooge of  award in december  coop america announced its list of the worst corporate scrooges of  awarded to the ceos who exhibited the worst kinds of unbridled greed and a lack of compassion or concern for others over the last year bruce williamson was on the list for fossil foolishness because in spite of his recent statement very little new power plant development can be justified economically dynegy is forging ahead with plans to build six new coalfired power plants williamson was also a runnerup for s fossil fool of the year award for plans to construct more new power plants than any other energy company coal lobbying dynergy is a member of the american coal ash association acaa an umbrella lobbying group for all coal ash interests that includes major coal burners duke energy southern company and american electric power as well as dozens of other companies the group argues that the socalled beneficialuse industry would be eliminated if a hazardous designation was given for coal ash waste acaa set up a front group called citizens for recycling first which argues that using toxic coal ash as fill in other products is safe despite evidence to the contrary sierra club campaign in february  the sierra club launched a nationwide campaign to pressure dynegy to abandon its plans to build six new coalfired power plants nationwide and instead to shift its focus to cleaner energy solutions the campaign is the first attempt by anticoal forces to single out a single company on a nationwide basis the campaign began with mass callins to dynegy headquarters originating from twenty states  thousands of calls according to the sierra club dynegys ceo bruce williamson complained that his company was being unfairly picked on williamson was also picked as one of five executives to receive  fossil fool of the year awards december  longleaf and plum point ii cancelled on december   the sierra club announced a legal agreement between ls power

illinois in the first quarter of  factors influencing the company’s decision according to a news release from dynegy include the relatively small size of the facility older technologies and coal delivery challenges that lead to high production costs as well as weak electricity demand low prices for power and uncertainties over future regulation vermilion’s coal is transported from western states by rail to danville and then trucked to the vermilion site this is the most significant factor leading to vermilion’s higher production costs according to the news release ls power invests in alternative power perhaps in an acknowledgement of the writing on the wall ls power recently announced the creation of a business unit dedicated to renewable energy according to mike segal chairman and chief executive officer of ls power we have received significant feedback from our loadserving customers and they are interested in renewable electricity solutions while most renewable resources still require state or federal incentives to be competitive with traditional forms of generation as the technologies evolve they are becoming increasingly cost effective these customer and technological dynamics when coupled with the political determination to increase renewable resource utilization is an attractive backdrop for creating a scalable renewable business references ↑
