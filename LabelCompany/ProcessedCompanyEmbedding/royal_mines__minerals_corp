ended april   the increase in our operating expenses primarily relates to the recording of losses from our entry into a joint venture settlement agreement this is partially offset by a decrease in mineral exploration and evaluation expenses and a other than temporary loss of marketable securities in the prior year mineral exploration and evaluation expenses primarily consist of rent consulting fees and labor expenses in our scottsdale facility our general and administrative expenses primarily consist of i monthly consulting fees paid to our chief financial officer mr mitchell ii legal and

relates to the impairment losses recognized for the continued decline in stock price of our gainey capital corp shares loss on marketable securities on joint venture settlement and loss on joint

a working capital deficit of  as at our year ended april   the decrease in our working capital deficit is primarily due to  of convertible loans payablerelated parties reclassified to noncurrent liabilities partially offset by an increase in accounts payablerelated parties and accrued interestrelated parties financing requirements currently we do not have sufficient financial resources to complete our plan of operation for the next twelve months as such our ability to complete our plan of operation is dependent upon our ability to obtain additional financing in the near term we anticipate continuing to rely on equity sales of our common shares in order to continue to fund our business operations issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing shareholders there is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of our equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our planned mining development and exploration

in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders critical accounting policies we have identified certain accounting policies described below that are most important to the portrayal of our current financial condition and results of operations our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note  to our audited financial statements included in this annual report use of estimates  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period by their nature these estimates are subject to measurement uncertainty and the effect on the financial statements of changes in such estimates in future periods could be significant significant areas requiring estimates and assumptions include the valuation of stockbased compensation impairment analysis of longlived assets and realizability of deferred tax assets actual results could differ from those estimates research and development  all research and development expenditures are expensed as incurred property and equipment  property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation depreciation is principally provided on the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets which are generally  to  years the cost of repairs and maintenance is charged to expense as incurred expenditures for property betterments and renewals are capitalized upon sale or other disposition of a depreciable asset cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in operating expenses impairment of longlived assets  we review and evaluate longlived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable the assets are subject to impairment consideration under asc  measurement of an impairment loss if events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amount might not be recoverable stockbased compensation  we account for sharebased payments in accordance with asc  compensation  stock compensation which requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options to be recognized in the financial statements based on the grant date fair value of the award in accordance with asc  measurement objective  fair value at grant date we estimate the fair value of the award using a valuation technique for this purpose we use the blackscholes option pricing model we believe this model provides the best estimate of fair value due to its ability to incorporate inputs that change over time such as volatility and interest rates and to allow for actual exercise behavior of option holders compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period which is generally equal to the vesting period upon exercise shares issued will be newly issued shares from authorized common stock asc  compensationstock compensation establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments to nonemployees for goods or services under this transition method stock compensation expense includes compensation expense for all stockbased compensation awards granted on or after january   based on the grantdate fair value estimated in
