statements in this report speak as of the date hereof although we may from time to time voluntarily update our prior forwardlooking statements we disclaim any commitment to do so except as required by securities laws    organizational structure tellurians current abbreviated corporate structure is as follows   click to enlarge capital resources and structure our current capital resources consist of proceeds from issuances of common and preferred stock including as described below an issuance of preferred stock to ge oil  gas inc ge a delaware corporation and subsidiary of general electric company and an issuance of common stock to total delaware inc total a delaware corporation and subsidiary of total sa on a consolidated basis tellurian had approximately  of cash and cash equivalents as of march   tellurian considers cash equivalents to be short term highly liquid investments that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash and so near to their maturity that they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates we believe that we will have sufficient capital resources to fund our business for at least the next  months tellurian investments issued approximately  million shares of tellurian investments preferred stock to ge in november  for an aggregate purchase price of  million those shares which currently represent  of the outstanding equity securities of tellurian investments are convertible at any time into either shares of a substantially similar class of tellurian inc preferred stock or shares of tellurian inc common stock in each case on a oneforone basis subject to adjustments in certain circumstances in connection with the preferred stock issuance to ge we agreed to enter into a registration rights agreement with respect to the tellurian inc common stock to be issued upon the conversion or exchange of the preferred stock    tellurian investments issued approximately  million shares of its common stock to total in january  for an aggregate purchase price of  million in connection with that investment we agreed that we would enter into i a preemptive rights agreement pursuant to which total will be granted a right to purchase its pro rata portion of any new equity securities that tellurian may issue to a third party on the same terms and conditions as such equity securities are offered and sold to such party subject to certain excepted offerings and ii a registration rights agreement with respect to the common stock purchased by total as of the date of this report neither tellurian nor any of its subsidiaries have entered into definitive registration rights agreements with either ge or total and tellurian has not entered into a definitive preemptive rights agreement with total    risk factors in addition to the other information included in this report the following risk factors should be carefully considered when evaluating an investment in us these risk factors and other uncertainties may cause our actual future results or performance to differ materially from any future results or performance expressed or implied in the forwardlooking statements contained in this report and in other public statements we make in addition because of these risks and uncertainties as well as other variables affecting our operating results our past financial performance is not necessarily indicative of future performance the risk factors in this report are grouped into the following categories        risks relating to our financial matters        risks relating to our common stock        risks relating to our lng business and        risks relating to our business in general risks relating to our financial matters tellurian does not expect to generate sufficient cash to pay dividends until the completion of construction of the driftwood project tellurians directly and indirectly held assets consist primarily of cash held for certain startup and operating expenses applications for permits from regulatory agencies relating to the driftwood project and certain real property interests related to that project tellurians cash flow and consequently its ability to distribute earnings is solely dependent upon the cash flow its subsidiaries receive from the driftwood project and the transfer of funds in the form of distributions or otherwise tellurians ability to complete the driftwood project as discussed further below is dependent upon its subsidiaries ability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals and raise the capital necessary to fund the development of the project tellurians ability to pay dividends in the future is uncertain and will depend on a variety of factors including limitations on the ability of it or its subsidiaries to pay dividends under applicable law andor the terms of debt or other agreements and the judgment of the board of directors or other governing body of the relevant entity tellurian is currently prohibited from paying dividends under the terms of the tellurian investments preferred stock tellurian will be required to seek additional debt and equity financing in the future to complete the driftwood project and may not be able to secure such financing on acceptable terms or at all because tellurian will be unable to generate any revenue from its operations and expects to be in the development stage for multiple years tellurian will need additional financing to provide the capital required to execute its business plan tellurian will need significant funding to develop the driftwood project as well as for working capital requirements and other operating and general corporate purposes see capital resources and structure above there can be no assurance that tellurian will be able to raise sufficient capital on acceptable terms or at all if such financing is not available on satisfactory terms or is not available at all tellurian may be required to delay scale back or eliminate the development of business opportunities and its operations and financial condition may be adversely affected to a significant extent    debt financing if obtained may involve agreements that include liens on tellurians assets and covenants limiting or restricting the ability to take specific actions such as paying dividends or making distributions incurring additional debt acquiring or disposing of assets and increasing expenses debt financing would also be required to be repaid regardless of tellurians operating results in addition the ability to obtain financing for the proposed driftwood project is expected to be contingent upon among other things tellurians ability to enter into sufficient longterm commercial agreements prior to the commencement of construction to date tellurian has not entered into any definitive thirdparty agreements for the proposed driftwood project and it may not be successful in negotiating and entering into such agreements driftwood lng driftwood pipeline and tellurian investments have a limited operating history each of driftwood lng driftwood pipeline and tellurian investments was formed in  and only recently commenced development although tellurians current directors managers and officers have prior professional and industry experience driftwood lng driftwood pipeline and tellurian investments have a limited prior operating history track record and historical financial information upon which you may evaluate prospects tellurian has not yet commenced the construction of the driftwood project accordingly tellurian expects to incur significant additional costs and expenses through completion of development and construction of the driftwood project tellurian expects operating losses will increase substantially in the remainder of  and thereafter and expects to continue to incur operating losses and experience negative operating cash flow through at least  tellurians exposure to the performance and credit risks of counterparties under agreements may adversely affect our operating results liquidity and access to financing our lng and natural gas marketing business will involve our entering into various purchase and sale hedging and other transactions with numerous third parties in such arrangements we will be exposed to the performance and credit risks of our counterparties including the risk that one or more counterparties fails to perform its obligation to make deliveries of commodities andor to make payments these risks may increase during periods of commodity price volatility defaults by suppliers and other counterparties may adversely affect our operating results liquidity and access to financing tellurians ability to generate cash is substantially dependent upon it entering into contracts with third party customers and the performance of those customers under those contracts tellurian has not yet entered into and may never be able to enter into satisfactory commercial arrangements with thirdparty customers for products and services at the driftwood project tellurians business strategy may change regarding how and when the proposed driftwood projects export capacity is marketed also tellurians business strategy may change due to an inability to enter into agreements with customers or based on views regarding future prices supply and demand of lng natural gas liquefaction capacity and worldwide regasification capacity if the efforts to market the proposed driftwood project are not successful tellurians business results of operations financial condition and prospects may be materially and adversely affected    changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and the actual outcomes could have a material impact on our net income or financial condition changes in tax laws or tax rulings could materially impact our effective tax rate for example the trump administration has called for substantial change to fiscal and tax policies inclusive of proposed changes to the us federal tax treatment of foreign operations the current tax depreciation system and the deductibility of interest expense in connection with comprehensive us federal tax reform if enacted any change in law may affect our tax position including the amount of taxes we are required to pay and could have a significant impact on our future results of operations profitability and financial condition including the size of our expected net operating losses however until we know what changes are enacted we will not know fully whether in total we benefit from or are negatively affected by the proposed changes risks relating to our common stock the price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile which may make it difficult for shareholders to sell our common stock when desired or at attractive prices the market price of our common stock is highly volatile and we expect it to continue to be volatile for the foreseeable future adverse events could trigger a significant decline in the trading price of our common stock including among others failure to obtain necessary permits unfavorable changes in commodity prices or commodity price expectations adverse regulatory developments loss of a relationship with a partner litigation and departures of key personnel furthermore general market conditions including the level of and fluctuations in the trading prices of equity securities generally could affect the price of our stock recently the stock markets have experienced price and volume volatility that has affected many companies stock prices stock prices for many companies have experienced wide fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of those companies these fluctuations may affect the market price of our common stock the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected by sales of substantial amounts of our common stock by us or our major shareholders sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the market by us or any of our major shareholders or the perception that these sales may occur could cause the market price of our common stock to decline in addition the sale of these shares in the public market or the possibility of such sales could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities our insider trading policy does not prohibit our officers and directors some of whom own substantial percentages of our outstanding common stock from pledging shares of stock that they own as collateral for loans in some circumstances such pledges could result in large amounts of shares of our stock being sold in the market in a short period of time which would be expected to have a significant adverse effect on the trading price of the common stock in addition in the future we may issue shares of our common stock in connection with acquisitions of assets or businesses if we use our shares for this purpose the issuances could have a dilutive effect on the market value of shares of our common stock depending on market conditions at the time of an acquisition the price we pay the value of the business or assets acquired our success in exploiting the properties or integrating the businesses we acquire and other factors    risks relating to our lng business various economic and political factors could negatively affect the development construction and operation of lng facilities including the driftwood project which could have a material adverse effect on our business contracts financial condition operating results cash flow liquidity and prospects commercial development of an lng facility takes a number of years requires substantial capital investment and may be delayed by factors such as        increased construction costs        economic downturns increases in interest rates or other events that may affect the availability of sufficient financing for lng projects on commercially reasonable terms        decreases in the price of lng which might decrease the expected returns relating to investments in lng projects        the inability of project owners or operators to obtain governmental approvals to construct or operate lng facilities and        political unrest or local community resistance to the siting of lng facilities due to safety environmental or security concerns our failure to execute our business plan in a timely manner could materially adversely effect our business financial condition operating results liquidity and prospects tellurians estimated costs for the driftwood project may not be accurate and are subject to change due to various factors tellurian currently estimates that the construction costs for the driftwood project will be between approximately  and  billion however cost estimates are only an approximation of the actual costs of construction and are before owners costs financing costs and contingencies moreover cost estimates may change due to various factors such as the final terms of any definitive request for services with its engineering procurement and construction epc service provider as well as cost overruns change orders delays in construction legal and regulatory requirements site issues increased component and material costs escalation of labor costs labor disputes changes in commodity prices increased spending to maintain tellurians construction schedule and other factors our failure to achieve our cost estimates could materially adversely effect our business financial condition operating results liquidity and prospects if thirdparty pipelines and other facilities interconnected to our lng facilities become unavailable to transport natural gas this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results liquidity and prospects we will depend upon thirdparty pipelines and other facilities that will provide gas delivery options to our lng facilities if the construction of new or modified pipeline connections is not completed on schedule or any pipeline connection were to become unavailable for current or future volumes of natural gas due to repairs damage to the facility lack of capacity or any other reason our ability to meet our lng sale and purchase agreement obligations and continue shipping natural gas from producing regions or to end markets could be restricted thereby reducing our revenues this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results liquidity and prospects    we may not be able to purchase or receive physical delivery of sufficient natural gas to satisfy our delivery obligations under our lng sale and purchase agreements which could have an adverse effect on us under lng sale and purchase agreements with our customers we will be required to make available to them a specified amount of lng at specified times however we may not be able to purchase or receive physical delivery of sufficient quantities of natural gas to satisfy those obligations which may provide affected customers with the right to terminate their lng sale and purchase agreements our failure to purchase or receive physical delivery of sufficient quantities of natural gas could have an adverse effect on our business contracts financial condition operating results cash flow liquidity and prospects the construction and operation of the driftwood project remains subject to further approvals and some approvals may be subject to further conditions review andor revocation the design construction and operation of lng export terminals is a highly regulated activity the approval of ferc under section  of the natural gas act as well as several other material governmental and regulatory approvals and permits is required in order to construct and operate an lng terminal even if the necessary authorizations initially required to operate our proposed lng facilities are obtained such authorizations are subject to ongoing conditions imposed by regulatory agencies and additional approval and permit requirements may be imposed tellurian will be required to obtain governmental approvals and authorizations to implement its proposed business strategy which includes the construction and operation of the driftwood project in particular authorization from ferc and the doefe is required to construct and operate our proposed lng facilities in addition to seeking approval for export to fta countries tellurian will seek to obtain approval for export to nonfta countries there is no assurance that tellurian will obtain and maintain these governmental permits approvals and authorizations and failure to obtain and maintain any of these permits approvals or authorizations could have a material adverse effect on its business results of operations financial condition and prospects tellurian will be dependent on thirdparty contractors for the successful completion of the driftwood project and these contractors may be unable to complete the driftwood project there is limited recent industry experience in the united states regarding the construction or operation of largescale liquefaction facilities the construction of the driftwood project is expected to take several years will be confined to a limited geographic area and could be subject to delays cost overruns labor disputes and other factors that could adversely affect financial performance or impair tellurians ability to execute its scheduled business plan timely and costeffective completion of the driftwood project in compliance with agreedupon specifications will be highly dependent upon the performance of thirdparty contractors pursuant to their agreements however tellurian has not yet entered into definitive agreements with certain of the contractors advisors and consultants necessary for the development and construction of the driftwood project tellurian may not be able to successfully enter into such construction contracts on terms or at prices that are acceptable to it    further faulty construction that does not conform to tellurians design and quality standards may have an adverse effect on tellurians business results of operations financial condition and prospects for example improper equipment installation may lead to a shortened life of tellurians equipment increased operations and maintenance costs or a reduced availability or production capacity of the affected facility the ability of tellurians thirdparty contractors to perform successfully under any agreements to be entered into is dependent on a number of factors including force majeure events and such contractors ability to        design engineer and receive critical components and equipment necessary for the driftwood project to operate in accordance with specifications and address any startup and operational issues that may arise in connection with the commencement of commercial operations        attract develop and retain skilled personnel and engage and retain thirdparty subcontractors and address any labor issues that may arise        post required construction bonds and comply with the terms thereof and maintain their own financial condition including adequate working capital        adhere to any warranties the contractors provide in their epc contracts and        respond to difficulties such as equipment failure delivery delays schedule changes and failure to perform by subcontractors some of which are beyond their control and manage the construction process generally including engaging and retaining thirdparty contractors coordinating with other contractors and regulatory agencies and dealing with inclement weather conditions furthermore tellurian may have disagreements with its thirdparty contractors about different elements of the construction process which could lead to the assertion of rights and remedies under the related contracts resulting in a contractors unwillingness to perform further work on the relevant project tellurian may also face difficulties in commissioning a newly constructed facility any significant project delays in the development of the driftwood project could materially and adversely affect tellurians business results of operations financial condition and prospects tellurians construction and operations activities are subject to a number of development risks operational hazards regulatory approvals and other risks which could cause cost overruns and delays and could have a material adverse effect on its business results of operations financial condition liquidity and prospects siting development and construction of the driftwood project will be subject to the risks of delay or cost overruns inherent in any construction project resulting from numerous factors including but not limited to the following        difficulties or delays in obtaining or failure to obtain sufficient debt or equity financing on reasonable terms        failure to obtain all necessary government and thirdparty permits approvals and licenses for the construction and operation of any of our proposed lng facilities        failure to obtain sale and purchase agreements that generate sufficient revenue to support the financing and construction of the driftwood project        difficulties in engaging qualified contractors necessary to the construction of the contemplated driftwood project or other lng facilities         shortages of equipment material or skilled labor        natural disasters and catastrophes such as hurricanes explosions fires floods industrial accidents and terrorism        unscheduled delays in the delivery of ordered materials        work stoppages and labor disputes        competition with other domestic and international lng export terminals        unanticipated changes in domestic and international market demand for and supply of natural gas and lng which will depend in part on supplies of and prices for alternative energy sources and the discovery of new sources of natural resources        unexpected or unanticipated need for additional improvements and        adverse general economic conditions delays beyond the estimated development periods as well as cost overruns could increase the cost of completion beyond the amounts that are currently estimated which could require tellurian to obtain additional sources of financing to fund the activities until the proposed driftwood project is constructed and operational which could cause further delays any delay in completion of the driftwood project may also cause a delay in the receipt of revenues projected from the driftwood project or cause a loss of one or more customers as a result any significant construction delay whatever the cause could have a material adverse effect on tellurians business results of operations financial condition liquidity and prospects technological innovation may render tellurians anticipated competitive advantage or its processes obsolete tellurians success will depend on its ability to create and maintain a competitive position in the natural gas liquefaction industry in particular although tellurian plans to construct the driftwood project using proven technologies that it believes provide it with certain advantages tellurian does not have any exclusive rights to any of the technologies that it will be utilizing in addition the technology tellurian anticipates using in the driftwood project may be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by legal or regulatory requirements technological advances more efficient and costeffective processes or entirely different approaches developed by one or more of its competitors or others which could materially and adversely affect tellurians business results of operations financial condition liquidity and prospects cyclical or other changes in the demand for and price of lng and natural gas may adversely affect tellurians lng business and the performance of our customers and could lead to reduced development of lng projects worldwide tellurians plans and expectations regarding its business and the development of domestic lng facilities and projects are generally based on assumptions about the future price of natural gas and lng and the conditions of the global natural gas and lng markets natural gas and lng prices have been and are likely to remain in the future volatile and subject to wide fluctuations that are difficult to predict such fluctuations may be caused by factors including but not limited to one or more of the following        competitive liquefaction capacity in north america         insufficient or oversupply of natural gas liquefaction or receiving capacity worldwide        insufficient or oversupply of lng tanker capacity        weather conditions        reduced demand and lower prices for natural gas        increased natural gas production deliverable by pipelines which could suppress demand for lng        decreased oil and natural gas exploration activities which may decrease the production of natural gas        cost improvements that allow competitors to offer lng regasification services or provide natural gas liquefaction capabilities at reduced prices        changes in supplies of and prices for alternative energy sources such as coal oil nuclear hydroelectric wind and solar energy which may reduce the demand for natural gas        changes in regulatory tax or other governmental policies regarding imported or exported lng natural gas or alternative energy sources which may reduce the demand for imported or exported lng andor natural gas        political conditions in natural gas producing regions and        cyclical trends in general business and economic conditions that cause changes in the demand for natural gas adverse trends or developments affecting any of these factors could result in decreases in the price of lng andor natural gas which could materially and adversely affect the performance of our customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business contracts financial condition operating results cash flows liquidity and prospects failure of exported lng to be a competitive source of energy for international markets could adversely affect our customers and could materially and adversely affect our business contracts financial condition operating results cash flow liquidity and prospects operations of the driftwood project will be dependent upon the ability of our lng sale and purchase agreement customers to deliver lng supplies from the united states which is primarily dependent upon lng being a competitive source of energy internationally the success of our business plan is dependent in part on the extent to which lng can for significant periods and in significant volumes be supplied from north america and delivered to international markets at a lower cost than the cost of alternative energy sources through the use of improved exploration technologies additional sources of natural gas may be discovered outside the united states which could increase the available supply of natural gas outside the united states and could result in natural gas in those markets being available at a lower cost than that of lng exported to those markets    additionally our liquefaction projects will be subject to the risk of lng price competition at times when we need to replace any existing lng sale and purchase contract whether due to natural expiration default or otherwise or enter into new lng sale and purchase contracts factors relating to competition may prevent us from entering into a new or replacement lng sale and purchase contract on economically comparable terms as prior lng sale and purchase contracts or at all factors which may negatively affect potential demand for lng from our liquefaction projects are diverse and include among others        increases in worldwide lng production capacity and availability of lng for market supply        increases in demand for lng but at levels below those required to maintain current price equilibrium with respect to supply        increases in the cost to supply natural gas feedstock to our liquefaction projects        decreases in the cost of competing sources of natural gas or alternate sources of energy such as coal heavy fuel oil diesel nuclear hydroelectric wind and solar energy        decreases in the price of nonus lng including decreases in price as a result of contracts indexed to lower oil prices        increases in capacity and utilization of nuclear power and related facilities        increases in the cost of lng shipping and        displacement of lng by pipeline natural gas or alternate fuels in locations where access to these energy sources is not currently available political instability in foreign countries that import natural gas or strained relations between such countries and the united states may also impede the willingness or ability of lng suppliers purchasers and merchants in such countries to import lng from the united states furthermore some foreign purchasers of lng may have economic or other reasons to obtain their lng from nonus markets or from our competitors liquefaction facilities in the united states as a result of these and other factors lng may not be a competitive source of energy in the united states or internationally the failure of lng to be a competitive supply alternative to local natural gas oil and other alternative energy sources in markets accessible to our customers could adversely affect the ability of our customers to deliver lng from the united states on a commercial basis any significant impediment to the ability to deliver lng from the united states generally or from the driftwood project specifically could have a material adverse effect on our customers and on our business contracts financial condition operating results cash flow liquidity and prospects competition in the liquefied natural gas industry is intense and some of tellurians competitors have greater financial technological and other resources tellurian plans to operate in the highly competitive area of liquefied natural gas production and faces intense competition from independent technologydriven companies as well as from both major and other independent oil and natural gas companies and utilities    many competing companies have secured access to or are pursuing development or acquisition of lng facilities to serve the north american natural gas market including other proposed liquefaction facilities in north america tellurian may face competition from major energy companies and others in pursuing its proposed business strategy to provide liquefaction and export products and services at its proposed driftwood project in addition competitors have and are developing additional lng terminals in other markets which also compete with our proposed lng facilities almost all of these competitors have longer operating histories greater name recognition larger staffs and substantially greater financial technical and marketing resources than tellurian currently possesses the superior resources that these competitors have available for deployment could allow them to compete successfully against tellurian which could have a material adverse effect on tellurians business results of operations financial condition liquidity and prospects there may be shortages of lng vessels worldwide which could have a material adverse effect on tellurians business results of operations financial condition liquidity and prospects the construction and delivery of lng vessels requires significant capital and long construction lead times and the availability of the vessels could be delayed to the detriment of tellurians business and customers due to a variety of factors including but not limited to the following        an inadequate number of shipyards constructing lng vessels and a backlog of orders at these shipyards        political or economic disturbances in the countries where the vessels are being constructed        changes in governmental regulations or maritime selfregulatory organizations        work stoppages or other labor disturbances at the shipyards        bankruptcies or other financial crises of shipbuilders        quality or engineering problems        weather interference or catastrophic events such as a major earthquake tsunami or fire or        shortages of or delays in the receipt of necessary construction materials any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on tellurians business results of operations financial condition liquidity and prospects a terrorist attack including cyberterrorism or military incident involving an lng carrier could result in delays in or cancellation of construction or closure of our proposed lng facilities a terrorist including a cyberterrorist incident or military incident involving an lng carrier or lng facility may result in delays in or cancellation of construction of new lng facilities including our proposed lng facilities which would increase tellurians costs and decrease cash flows a terrorist incident may also result in temporary or permanent closure of tellurians proposed lng facilities including the driftwood project which could increase costs and decrease cash flows depending on the duration of the closure operations at the proposed lng facilities including the driftwood project could also become subject to increased governmental scrutiny that may result in additional security measures at a significant incremental cost in addition the threat of terrorism and the impact of military campaigns may lead to continued volatility in prices for natural gas that could adversely affect tellurians business and customers including the ability of tellurians suppliers or customers to satisfy their respective obligations under tellurians commercial agreements    changes in legislation and regulations relating to the lng industry could have a material adverse impact on tellurians business results of operations financial condition liquidity and prospects future legislation and regulations such as those relating to the transportation and security of lng exported from our proposed lng facilities through the calcasieu ship channel could cause additional expenditures restrictions and delays in connection with the proposed lng facilities and their construction the extent of which cannot be predicted and which may require tellurian to limit substantially delay or cease operations in some circumstances revised reinterpreted or additional laws and regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating costs and restrictions could have a material adverse effect on tellurians business results of operations financial condition liquidity and prospects the operation of the proposed driftwood project may be subject to significant operating hazards and uninsured risks one or more of which may create significant liabilities and losses that could have a material adverse effect on tellurians business results of operations financial condition liquidity and prospects the plan of operations for the proposed driftwood project is subject to the inherent risks associated with lng operations including explosions pollution release of toxic substances fires hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions and other hazards each of which could result in significant delays in commencement or interruptions of operations andor result in damage to or destruction of the proposed driftwood project and assets or damage to persons and property in addition operations at the proposed driftwood project and vessels of third parties on which tellurians operations are dependent face possible risks associated with acts of aggression or terrorism in  and  hurricanes damaged coastal and inland areas located in texas louisiana mississippi and alabama resulting in disruption and damage to certain lng terminals located in those regions future storms and related storm activity and collateral effects or other disasters such as explosions fires floods or accidents could result in damage to or interruption of operations at the driftwood project or related infrastructure as well as delays or cost increases in the construction and the development of the driftwood project or other facilities changes in the global climate may have significant physical effects such as increased frequency and severity of storms floods and rising sea levels if any such effects were to occur they could have an adverse effect on our coastal operations tellurian does not nor does it intend to maintain insurance against all of these risks and losses tellurian may not be able to maintain desired or required insurance in the future at rates that it considers reasonable the occurrence of a significant event not fully insured or indemnified against could have a material adverse effect on tellurians business contracts financial condition operating results cash flow liquidity and prospects we will rely on thirdparty engineers to estimate the future capacity ratings and performance capabilities of the driftwood project and these estimates may prove to be inaccurate we will rely on third parties for the design and engineering services underlying our estimates of the future capacity ratings and performance capabilities of the driftwood project any of our lng facilities when actually constructed may not have the capacity ratings and performance capabilities that we intend or estimate failure of any of our lng facilities to achieve our intended capacity ratings and performance capabilities could prevent us from achieving the commercial start dates under our future lng sale and purchase agreements and could have a material adverse effect on our business contracts financial condition operating results cash flow liquidity and prospects    risks relating to our business in general tellurian will be subject to risks related to doing business in and having counterparties based in foreign countries tellurian may engage in operations or make substantial commitments and investments or enter into agreements with counterparties located outside the united states which would expose tellurian to political governmental and economic instability and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations any disruption caused by these factors could harm tellurians business results of operations financial condition liquidity and prospects risks associated with operations commitments and investments outside of the united states include but are not limited to risks of        currency fluctuations        war or terrorist attack        expropriation or nationalization of assets        renegotiation or nullification of existing contracts        changing political conditions        changing laws and policies affecting trade taxation and investment        multiple taxation due to different tax structures        general hazards associated with the assertion of sovereignty over areas in which operations are conducted and        the unexpected credit rating downgrade of countries in which tellurians lng customers are based because tellurians reporting currency is the united states dollar any of the operations conducted outside the united states or denominated in foreign currencies would face additional risks of fluctuating currency values and exchange rates hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange in addition tellurian would be subject to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and exchange rate changes on its financial reports when translating its assets liabilities revenues and expenses from operations outside of the united states into us dollars at thenapplicable exchange rates these translations could result in changes to the results of operations from period to period    tellurian investments is a defendant in a lawsuit that could result in equitable relief andor monetary damages that could have a material adverse effect on tellurians operating results and financial condition tellurian investments and tellurian services along with tellurian director martin houston and an officer of tellurian and certain entities in which each of them owned membership interests as applicable have been named as defendants in a recently initiated lawsuit although tellurian investments believes the plaintiffs claims are without merit tellurian investments may not ultimately be successful and any potential liability tellurian investments may incur is not reasonably estimable moreover even if tellurian investments is successful in the defense of this litigation tellurian investments could incur costs and suffer both an economic loss and an adverse impact on its reputation which could have a material adverse effect on its business in addition any adverse judgment or settlement of the litigation could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition tellurian will be subject to a number of environmental laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs and existing and future environmental and similar laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs liabilities or additional operating restrictions tellurian will be subject to extensive federal state and local environmental regulations and laws including regulations and restrictions related to discharges and releases to the air land and water and the handling storage generation and disposal of hazardous materials and solid and hazardous wastes in connection with the development construction and operation of its lng facilities these regulations and laws which include the clean air act caa the oil pollution act the clean water act cwa and the resource

released into the environment in connection with the construction and operation of our facilities these laws and regulations including the national environmental protection act nepa will require tellurian to obtain and maintain permits prepare environmental impact assessments provide governmental authorities with access to its facilities for inspection and provide reports related to compliance federal and state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the lawfulness of the original conduct for the release of certain types or quantities of hazardous substances into the environment as the owner and operator of the driftwood project tellurian could be liable for the costs of investigating and cleaning up hazardous substances released into the environment and for damage to natural resources violation of these laws and regulations could lead to substantial liabilities fines and penalties the denial or revocation of permits necessary for our operations governmental orders to shut down our facilities or capital expenditures related to pollution control equipment or remediation measures that could have a material adverse effect on tellurians business results of operations financial condition liquidity and prospects in october  the us environmental protection agency the epa published a final rule to implement the obama administrations clean power plan which is designed to reduce greenhouse gas ghg emissions from power plants in the united states in february  the us supreme court stayed the final rule effectively suspending the duty to comply with the rule until certain legal challenges are resolved other federal and state initiatives exist are being considered or may be considered in the future to address ghg emissions through for example us treaty commitments direct regulation a carbon emissions tax or capandtrade programs such initiatives could affect the demand for or cost of natural gas or could increase compliance costs for our operations the future of the clean power plan and other ghgrelated initiatives of the federal government may change under the trump administration in addition future federal state and local environmental legislation and regulations may impose unforeseen burdens and increased costs on tellurians business that could have a material adverse effect on tellurians financial results such as regulations regarding the transportation of lng a major health and safety incident relating to our business could be costly in terms of potential liabilities and reputational damage tellurian will be subject to extensive federal state and local health and safety regulations and laws health and safety performance is critical to the success of all areas of our business any failure in health and safety performance may result in personal harm or injury penalties for noncompliance with relevant laws and regulations or litigation and a failure that results in a significant health and safety incident is likely to be costly in terms of potential liabilities such a failure could generate public concern and have a corresponding impact on our reputation and our relationships with relevant regulatory agencies and local communities which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business contracts financial condition operating results cash flow liquidity and prospects    failure to retain and attract key executive officers key advisors such as tellurians chairman or other skilled professional and technical employees could have an adverse effect on tellurians business results of operations financial condition liquidity and prospects the success of tellurians business relies heavily on its executive officers and key advisors such as its chairman should tellurians executive officers be unable to perform their duties on behalf of tellurian or should tellurian be unable to retain or attract other members of management tellurians business results of operations financial condition liquidity and prospects could be materially impacted additionally we are dependent upon an available labor pool of skilled employees we will compete with other energy companies and other employers to attract and retain qualified personnel with the technical skills and experience required to construct and operate our facilities and to provide our customers with the highest quality service a shortage in the labor pool of skilled workers or other general inflationary pressures or changes in applicable laws and regulations could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified personnel and could require an increase in the wage and benefits packages that we offer thereby increasing our operating costs any increase in our operating costs could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition operating results liquidity and prospects our lack of diversification could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results cash flow liquidity and prospects due to our lack of asset and geographic diversification an adverse development at the driftwood project or in the lng industry generally would have a significantly greater impact on our financial condition and operating results than if we maintained a more diverse asset and geographic profile market factors tellurian expects global gas demand to increase faster than any other fossil fuel as consumers look for more reliable sources of energy with fewer particulate and carbon emissions the bp energy outlook released in january  predicts natural gas to grow at a rate of  compounded annually between  and  such that the global gas market during this time will add approximately  billion cubic feet per day bcfd of demand growing the market to approximately  bcfd in total wood mackenzie expects that the market could require approximately  of the growth in global natural gas demand to be supplied by lng and forecasts lng imports to grow to  million tonnes per annum mtpa  bcfd by  from a base of  mtpa  bcfd in  with existing and under construction facilities producing  mtpa  bcfd by  as a result the market could require new liquefaction facilities to supply an additional  mtpa of lng to meet incremental demand assuming lng delivered to the market is  of installed liquefaction capacity after taking into account planned and unplanned maintenance operational outages and fuel used during transport we believe approximately  mtpa of additional liquefaction capacity will need to be constructed to meet this call on lng or approximately  mtpa per year from  to  the schedule of operations for driftwood lng from  to  will only enable driftwood lng to provide a portion of the expected need for liquefaction facilities worldwide and we expect driftwood lng will be a competitive supplier to the growing global natural gas market    regulation lng terminal and pipeline facilities are subject to extensive federal state and local statutes rules regulations and laws in the united states that include but are not limited to the nga the energy policy act of  the oil pollution act nepa the caa the cwa the rcra the pipeline safety improvement act of  psia and the coastal zone management act czma these statutes cover areas related to the authorization construction and operation of the facilities including the facilities discharges and releases to the air land and water and the handling generation storage and disposal of hazardous materials and solid and hazardous wastes due to the development construction and operation of the facilities these laws are administered and enforced by governmental agencies including ferc the epa the doefe the us department of transportation dot and the louisiana department of natural resources additionally the facilities construction andor operation are subject to consultations and approvals by the advisory council on historic preservation us army corps of engineers us department of commerce national marine fisheries services us department of the interior us fish and wildlife service and us department of homeland security failure to comply with applicable federal state and local laws rules and regulations could result in substantial administrative civil andor criminal penalties andor failure to secure and retain necessary authorizations federal energy regulatory commission the design construction and operation of our liquefaction facilities the export of lng and the transportation of natural gas are highly regulated activities in order to site construct and operate our lng facilities we are required to obtain authorizations from ferc under section  of the nga as well as several other material governmental and regulatory approvals and permits the energy policy act of  the epact amended section  of the nga to establish or clarify fercs exclusive authority to approve or deny an application for the siting construction expansion or operation of lng terminals although except as specifically provided in the epact nothing in the epact is intended to affect otherwise applicable law related to any other federal agencys authorities or responsibilities related to lng terminals several other material governmental and regulatory approvals and permits will be required throughout the life of our liquefaction project throughout the life of our proposed driftwood project we will be subject to regular reporting requirements to ferc the dot pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration the phmsa and other federal and state regulatory agencies regarding the operation and maintenance of our facilities in  ferc concluded that it would apply lighthanded regulation over the rates terms and conditions agreed to by parties for lng terminalling services such that lng terminal owners would not be required to provide openaccess service at nondiscriminatory rates or maintain a tariff or rate schedule on file with ferc as distinguished from the requirements applied to fercregulated natural gas pipelines the epact codified fercs policy but those provisions expired on january   nonetheless we see no indication that ferc intends to modify its longstanding policy of lighthanded regulation of lng terminals    ferc has authority to approve and if necessary set just and reasonable rates for the transportation or sale of natural gas in interstate commerce in addition under the nga our proposed pipeline will not be permitted to unduly discriminate or grant undue preference as to rates or the terms and conditions of service to any shipper including our own marketing affiliate ferc has the authority to grant certificates allowing construction and operation of facilities used in interstate gas transportation and authorizing the provision of services under the nga fercs jurisdiction generally extends to the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce to the sale in interstate commerce of natural gas for resale for ultimate consumption for domestic commercial industrial or any other use and to natural gas companies engaged in such transportation or sale however fercs jurisdiction does not extend to the production gathering local distribution or export of natural gas in general fercs authority to regulate interstate natural gas pipelines and the services that they provide includes        rates and charges for natural gas transportation and related services        the certification and construction of new facilities        the extension and abandonment of services and facilities        the maintenance of accounts and records        the acquisition and disposition of facilities        the initiation and discontinuation of services and        various other matters us department of energy office of fossil energy export license exports of natural gas to fta countries are deemed to be consistent with the public interest and authorization to export lng to fta countries shall be granted by the doefe without modification or delay fta countries which import lng now or will do so by the end of  include canada chile colombia jordan mexico singapore south korea and the dominican republic exports of natural gas to nonfta countries are considered by the doefe in the context of a comment period whereby interveners are provided the opportunity to assert that such authorization would not be consistent with the public interest pipelines the psia which is administered by the phmsa office of pipeline safety governs the areas of testing education training and communication the psia requires pipeline companies to perform extensive integrity tests on natural gas transportation pipelines that exist in high population density areas designated as high consequence areas pipeline companies are required to perform the integrity tests on a sevenyear cycle the risk ratings are based on numerous factors including the population density in the geographic regions served by a particular pipeline as well as the age and condition of the pipeline and its protective coating testing consists of hydrostatic testing internal electronic testing or direct assessment of the piping in addition to the pipeline integrity tests pipeline companies must implement a qualification program to make certain that employees are properly trained pipeline operators also must develop integrity management programs for gas transportation pipelines which requires pipeline operators to perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity identify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact a high consequence area improve data collection integration and analysis repair and remediate the pipeline as necessary and implement preventive and mitigation actions    in  the phmsa issued a final rule known as control room managementhuman factors rule that became effective in  requiring pipeline operators to write and institute certain control room procedures that address human factors and fatigue management in march  the phmsa issued a final rule amending the pipeline safety regulations to update and clarify certain regulatory requirements including who can perform postconstruction inspections on transmission pipelines in september  the phmsa issued a rule indefinitely delaying the effective date for the amendment to the regulation regarding postconstruction inspections in may  the phmsa issued a notice of proposed rulemaking proposing to amend gas pipeline safety regulations regarding plastic piping systems used in gas services including the installation of plastic pipe used for gas transmission lines in july  the phmsa issued a notice of proposed rulemaking proposing to add a specific timeframe for operators notification of accidents or incidents as well as amending the safety regulations regarding operator qualification requirements by expanding the requirements to include new construction and certain previously excluded operation and maintenance tasks requiring a program effectiveness review and adding new recordkeeping requirements in january  the phmsa issued a final rule adding a specific time frame for operators notification of accidents or incidents but delayed final action on the proposed operator qualification requirements until a later date the final rule will be effective march   in april  the phmsa issued a notice of proposed rulemaking addressing changes to the regulations governing the safety of gas transmission pipelines specifically the phmsa is considering certain integrity management requirements for moderate consequence areas requiring an integrity verification process for specific categories of pipelines and mandating more explicit requirements for the integration of data from integrity assessments to an operators compliance procedures the phmsa is also considering whether to revise requirements for corrosion control issues and to expand the definition of regulated gathering lines these notices of proposed rulemaking are still pending at the phmsa natural gas pipeline safety act of  ngpsa louisiana administers federal pipeline safety standards under the ngpsa which requires certain pipelines to comply with safety standards in constructing and operating the pipelines and subjects the pipelines to regular inspections failure to comply with the ngpsa may result in the imposition of administrative civil and criminal sanctions other governmental permits approvals and authorizations the construction and operation of the driftwood project will be subject to additional federal permits orders approvals and consultations required by other federal agencies including the dot advisory council on historic preservation us army corps of engineers usace us department of commerce national marine fisheries services us department of the interior us fish and wildlife service the epa and us department of homeland security three significant permits that may apply to our driftwood project are the usace section  of the clean water actsection  of the rivers and harbors act permit the clean air act title v operating permit and the prevention of significant deterioration permit of which the latter two permits are issued by the louisiana department of environmental quality ldeq our driftwood project will also have to comply with the requirements of nepa including preparation of an environmental impact assessment    environmental regulation our proposed driftwood project will be subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and natural resources and the handling generation storage and disposal of hazardous materials and solid and hazardous wastes these environmental laws and regulations which can restrict or prohibit impacts to the environment or the types quantities and concentration of substances that can be released into the environment will require significant expenditures for compliance can affect the cost and output of operations may impose substantial administrative civil andor criminal penalties for noncompliance and can result in substantial liabilities clean air act and greenhouse gas requirements the caa and comparable state laws and regulations regulate and restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements among other requirements our proposed driftwood project will be subject to the federal caa and comparable state and local laws we may be required to incur capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment in connection with maintaining or obtaining permits and approvals pursuant to the caa and comparable state laws and regulations in  the epa promulgated and finalized the mandatory greenhouse gas reporting rule for multiple sections of the economy this rule requires mandatory reporting of ghg emissions from stationary sources including fuel combustion sources in  the epa expanded the rule to include reporting obligations for lng terminals in addition the epa has defined ghg emissions thresholds that would subject ghg emissions from new and modified industrial sources to regulation if the source is subject to prevention of significant development psd permit requirements due to its emissions of nonghg criteria pollutants in june  the obama administration issued its climate action plan which announced a wideranging set of executive actions to be implemented to cut carbon emissions in the united states the obama administration also issued regulations limiting ghg emissions from new and existing fossilfuel fired electrical generating stations the latter is known as the clean power plan these rules are currently stayed subject to a pending court challenge and the timing extent and impact of these initiatives remain uncertain in addition from time to time congress has considered proposed legislation directed at reducing ghg emissions and many states have already taken regulatory action to monitor andor reduce emissions of ghgs primarily through the development of ghg emission inventories or regional ghg cap and trade programs it is not possible at this time to predict how future regulations or legislation may address ghg emissions and impact our business however future regulations and laws could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position operating results and cash flows coastal zone management act the siting and construction of our driftwood project within the coastal zone may be subject to the requirements of the czma the czma is administered by the states in louisiana by the department of natural resources this program is implemented to ensure that impacts to coastal areas are consistent with the intent of the czma to manage the coastal areas    clean water act our proposed driftwood project will be subject to the federal cwa and analogous state and local laws the cwa and analogous state and local laws regulate discharges of pollutants to water of the united states or waters of the state including discharges of wastewater and storm water runoff and discharges of dredged or fill material into waters of the united states as well as spill prevention control and countermeasure requirements permits must be obtained prior to discharging pollutants into state and federal waters the cwa is administered by the epa the usace and by the states in louisiana by the ldeq additionally the siting and construction of our driftwood project may potentially impact jurisdictional wetlands which would require appropriate federal state andor local permits and approval prior to impacting such wetlands the authorizing agency may impose significant direct or indirect mitigation costs to compensate for regulated impacts to wetlands the approval timeframe may also be extended and could potentially affect project schedules in june  the epa issued a final rule that attempts to clarify the cwas jurisdictional reach over waters of the united states the rule was subsequently stayed nationwide by the us court of appeals for the sixth circuit during the pendency of several lawsuits challenging the rule in the sixth circuit and several federal district courts in january  the us supreme court accepted review of the rule to determine whether jurisdiction over challenges to the rule rests with the federal district or appellate courts on february   president trump issued an executive order directing the epa and usace to review the rule and publish for notice and comment a proposed rule rescinding or revising the rule as appropriate and consistent with law the epa and usace have stated that they intend to implement the executive order and publish a notice of proposed rulemaking to rescind or revise the rule in the near future the executive order directs the epa and usace to consider a new rule that reflects justice antonin scalias plurality opinion in the  supreme court decision rapanos v united states  that cwa jurisdiction attaches only to navigable waters and other waters with a relatively permanent flow such as rivers or lakes if and when a final rule as issued or revised goes into effect it could expand the scope of the cwas jurisdiction which could result in increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for discharges or pollutants or dredge and fill activities in waters of the united states including wetland areas resource conservation and recovery act the federal rcra and comparable state requirements govern the generation handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and require corrective action for releases into the environment in the event such wastes are generated or used in connection with our facilities we will be subject to regulatory requirements affecting the handling transportation treatment storage and disposal of such wastes and could be required to perform corrective action measures to clean up releases of such wastes endangered species act esa our

tellurian inc and its subsidiaries    tellurian investments inc and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements  continued   note   summary of significant accounting policies basis of presentation our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of tellurian investments and its majority owned subsidiaries and entities in which it holds a controlling interest all intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes management regularly evaluates its estimates and related assumptions including those related to the value of property plant and equipment goodwill the collectability of financial assets income taxes including valuation allowances for net deferred tax assets embedded features in our preferred stock and sharebased compensation changes in facts and circumstances or additional information may result in revised estimates and are accounted for prospectively and actual results may differ from these estimates fair value fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants the company determines fair value based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability in the principal or most advantageous market when considering market participant assumptions measurements of fair value are classified according to the following fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value and distinguishes between observable and unobservable inputs        level  inputs unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities accessible to the company at the measurement date        level  inputs other than quoted prices included in level  level  inputs are directly or indirectly observable for similar assets or liabilities for substantially the full term of the asset or liability        level  inputs unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available thereby allowing for situations in which there is little if any market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date in determining fair value we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize our use of unobservable inputs in arriving at fair value estimates the companys assessment of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and the consideration of factors specific to the asset or liability in addition to market information we incorporate transactionspecific details that in managements judgment market participants would take into account in measuring fair value the companys policy is to recognize transfers in or out of a fair value hierarchy as of the end of the reporting period for which the event or change in circumstances caused the transfer the company has consistently applied the valuation techniques discussed above for the year ended december   and there have been no transfers in or out of level  level  or level  the carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable and accounts payable reported on the consolidated balance sheet approximates fair value nonrecurring fairvalue measurements are those that require measurement at the transaction date without the need at inception to remeasure over subsequent periods nonrecurring fairvalue measurements have been performed for sharebased compensation as disclosed in note  sharebased compensation nonfinancial assets initially measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include certain assets acquired in a business combination and goodwill see note  acquisition recurring fairvalue measurements have been performed for an embedded exchange feature in the tellurian investments series a convertible preferred stock tellurian investments preferred shares that required recognition for accounting purposes see note  stockholders equity  segments due primarily to the fact that we are a development company with no operations during the year ended december   management allocated resources and assessed financial performance on a consolidated basis as such for the purposes of financial reporting under us gaap during  the company has operated as a single operating segment whose activities are to develop lng facilities along with related storage facilities and loading terminals    tellurian investments inc and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements 

of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and accounts and a note receivables due from related parties tellurian investments maintains cash balances at financial institutions which may at times be in excess of federally insured levels tellurian investments has not incurred losses related to these balances to date accounting for lng development activities generally we will begin capitalizing the costs of our lng terminals and related pipelines once the individual project meets the following criteria  regulatory approval has been received  financing for the project is available and  management has committed to commence construction prior to meeting these criteria and until the affirmative final investment decision fid by tellurian incs board of directors to move forward with the project most of the costs associated with a project are expensed as incurred these costs primarily include professional fees associated with frontend engineering and design work costs of securing necessary regulatory approvals and other preliminary investigation and development activities related to our lng terminals and related pipelines tellurian investments will begin capitalizing the costs of its lng terminals and related pipelines once the driftwood lng projects fid criteria have been met prior to meeting these criteria most of the costs associated with this project have been expensed as incurred and are classified in the consolidated statement of operations as development expenses generally costs that are capitalized prior to a project meeting the criteria otherwise necessary for capitalization include land costs that are capitalized as property plant and equipment and lease and purchase option payments that have been capitalized in other noncurrent assets costs of the lease and purchase options will be amortized over the life of the lease once obtained or capitalized into the land if purchased if no lease or land is obtained option costs will be expensed should our projects be funded with debt we will capitalize interest and other related debt costs during the construction period of our lng terminals and related pipelines upon commencement of operations capitalized interest as a component of the total cost will be amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset property plant and equipment property plant and equipment are recorded at cost expenditures for construction activities major renewals and betterments that extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized while expenditures for maintenance and repairs and general and administrative activities are expensed as incurred tellurian investments depreciates property plant and equipment using the straightline depreciation method upon retirement or other disposition of property plant and equipment the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the account and the resulting gains or losses are recorded in operating expenses management tests property plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances have indicated that the carrying amount of property plant and equipment might not be recoverable assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets for purposes of assessing recoverability recoverability generally is determined by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the expected undiscounted future cash flows to be generated from the asset if the carrying value of the asset is not recoverable the amount of impairment loss is measured as the excess if any of the carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value    tellurian investments inc and subsidiaries notes to

property plant and equipment  income taxes tellurian investments accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and net operating loss and credit carryforwards using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to impact taxable income the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date the company recognizes deferred tax assets to the extent that it believes that these assets are more likely than not to be realized in making such determination the company considers all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent financial operations a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying value of our deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will expire before the realization of the benefit or future deductibility is not probable a valuation allowance equal to our federal and state net deferred tax assets has been established due to the uncertainty of realizing such tax benefits tellurian investments recognizes the financial statement benefit of an uncertain tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position upon examination for further details of matters affecting amounts related to income taxes see note  income taxes  goodwill goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of the assets of the business acquired at december   tellurian investments had  million of goodwill associated with the acquisition of parallax services see note  acquisition  tellurian investments determines its reporting units by identifying each unit that engaged in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses had operating results regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker for purposes of resource allocation and performance assessment and had discrete financial information goodwill is assessed at least annually for impairment and whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment of the carrying value of goodwill is likely during the fourth quarter of  we performed a qualitative assessment of goodwill as of october  to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test if we fail a qualitative test then we must first compare our estimate of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value including goodwill step  if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recorded as necessary step  step  compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill to the carrying value if any of that goodwill we determine the implied fair value of the goodwill in the same manner as determining the amount of goodwill to be recognized in a business combination we completed our annual goodwill assessment noted above and the tests indicated no impairment as discussed above regarding tellurian investments use of estimates the companys judgments and assumptions are inherent in its estimate of future cash flows used to determine the estimate of the reporting units fair value the use of alternate judgments or assumptions could result in the recognition of impairment charges in the financial statements a lower fair value estimate in the future could result in an impairment of goodwill factors that could indicate and cause a lower fair value estimate include significant negative industry or economic trends cost increases disruptions to our business the regulatory or political environment or other unanticipated events sharebased compensation tellurian investments has awarded sharebased compensation in the form of stock and restricted stock that are more fully described in note  sharebased compensation for equityclassified sharebased compensation awards tellurian investments measures sharebased compensation based on the grantdate fair value of tellurian investments common stock and not subsequently remeasured we had no liabilityclassified awards as of and for the period ended december   for awards containing only service conditions or performance conditions deemed probable of occurring the fair value is recognized as expense over the requisite service period using the straightline method tellurian investments recognizes compensation cost for awards with performance conditions if and when the company concludes that it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved net of an estimate of prevesting forfeitures over the requisite service period for awards where the performance or market condition is not considered probable compensation cost is deferred until the performance or market condition becomes probable we reassess the probability of vesting at each reporting period for awards with performance conditions and adjust compensation cost based on our probability assessment    tellurian investments inc and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements  continued   loss contingencies a loss contingency is recorded if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated we record probable loss contingencies based on the best estimate of the loss if a range of loss can be reasonably estimated but no single amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other amount within the range the minimum amount in the range is accrued these estimates are initially developed earlier than when the ultimate loss is known and the estimates are adjusted if additional information becomes known net loss per share basic net loss per share eps excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period diluted eps reflects potential dilution and is computed by dividing net income loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period increased by the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and were dilutive basic and diluted eps for the year ended december   are the same since the potential effect of

evaluating the potential impact this new standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in january  the fasb issued asu  business combinations topic  clarifying the definition of a business  the amendments in this update clarify the definition of a business to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses by providing a screen to determine when an integrated set of assets or activities is not a business the screen requires that when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired or disposed of is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets the set is not a business this screen reduces the number of transactions that need to be further evaluated if the screen is not met then the amendments  require that to be considered a business a set must include at a minimum an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create output and  remove the evaluation of whether a market participant could replace missing elements the amendments also provide a framework to assist entities in evaluating whether both an input and a substantive process are present these amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after december   including interim periods within those periods with early application permitted for transactions that have not been previously reported these amendments will be evaluated in conjunction with future acquisitions or disposals in january  fasb issued asu  intangiblesgoodwill and other topic  simplifying the test for goodwill impairment  which eliminates step  from the goodwill impairment test step  required entities to compute the implied fair value of goodwill if it was determined that the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded its fair value under the amendments in this update an entity should perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting units fair value the goodwill impairment recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit additionally an entity should consider income tax effects from any taxdeductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss if applicable an entity still has the option to perform the qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary these amendments are effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after december   early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after january   we expect to apply these amendments for our annual goodwill impairment test as of october   or earlier if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an interim goodwill impairment test is necessary note   acquisition on april   tellurian
