managed care  december qajonathan t lord md placing faith in technology to improve members choicesnot many companies organizational charts list a chief innovation officer at humana it brings visibility to a hightech strategy for reducing care fragmentation jonathan t jack lord md joined humana in  as chief medical officer today as senior vice president and chief clinical strategy and innovation officer his job has expanded along with his title it is his job to make humana a leader in ehealth by using the internet and more to build consumercentered benefit plans and to improve clinical management humana is one of the nations largest publicly traded health benefit companies with  million medical members mainly in  states and puerto rico the louisville kybased company last year reported net income of  million on revenue of  billion immediately before joining humana lord was president of health dialog which provided health information to consumers over the internet previously he was chief operating officer of the american hospital association in washington executive vice president of anne arundel medical center in annapolis md and executive vice president for clinical affairs at sunhealth alliance in charlotte nc he spent  years in the navy ultimately as director of the naval medical commands quality assurance division in the office of the surgeon general lord a boardcertified pathologist received his medical degree from the university of miami in  and is an adjunct professor of family and community medicine at dartmouth medical school he spoke recently with senior contributing editor patrick mullen managed care how does humana deal with a lingering problem of the american health care system that patients have little awareness of the true cost of their care and little incentive to seek value for their money jonathan t lord md given that health care costs are again rising humanas view is that people need to be engaged and active participants in how they choose and use health care services they need to be engaged in choosing benefit designs and benefit levels that fit them and their families and they need to use the health care system wisely we add value by providing people with the tools that give them guidance about making those decisions engaging people in ways they have not been engaged in the past is a huge process because different people react differently we try to meet people where they are at with technologies or choices that are useful to them mc so for example people who are not comfortable using the internet can use a telephonebased system lord yes as a company were aggressive in our use of voiceapplication technologies that essentially turn telephones into internet terminals we found high levels of satisfaction with people talking to a computer interacting with it and giving it data thats quite different from keyboarding on the internet we dont want to just throw technology at people and end up creating paralysis we provide guidance for people who want to become more engaged and tools for people who want to be very engaged as well as prepackaged programs and products for people who dont want to be involved at all when it comes to choosing and using the health care system there are many segments of consumers engaging people will change how they use the health care system make them more prudent consumers of services and lead to better clinical outcomes when people are engaged in clinical decisions their outcomes are substantially better than when theyre not we spend a lot of time making sure that we meet people where they are in terms of their comfort with technology and not getting out in front them mc humana introduced smartsuite its consumerbased benefit plan with the companys own  employees and now youre marketing it to corporations around the country how representative are humanas employees wouldnt they have a greater awareness of and sensitivity to health care costs and quality issues than employees of other companies lord actually humana looks very much like an awful lot of service companies in terms of age income and job categories the people working in a humana call center could be working in a call center for a number of companies thats not to say they may not have more encounters with some of the language of health care but by and large the issues are very much the same starting with our own employees has given humana some wonderful experience in terms of learning and engaging people in an organization by allowing people to use new tools to make choices and use the health care system then watching what works and what doesnt weve been able to systematically learn about the kinds of products we need to deliver to customers its also helpful having employees who have lived the experience when they talk to a customer there arent many industries where its possible for every one of your employees to use and be part of the creation of new products mc youve compared selecting health benefits using smartsuite to the way someone can customize a computer at dells web site lord exactly as frequent web users know the shopping cart metaphor is applied across many sites on the internet mc while its great to be able to go to dells web site and customize a computer system the process takes some time how willing are people to take the time in the evening or at work required to make informed useful choices about their healthbenefit options lord in the old modelt world of health benefits the only choice of benefit was black in that world people were able to do their open enrollments fairly quickly year after year they answered the same stupid set of demographic questions which was frustrating but they didnt have any engagement in the process or sense of the cost consequences were highlighting some differences between health insurance and health benefits health insurance is an inherent part of virtually everything we sell our policies include a maximum outofpocket beyond which we provide insurance against catastrophic illness the benefit part involves giving people tools to help them decide how to pay for routine andor some moderate but unexpected events people need to ask themselves some questions what are my risk tolerances what kind of plans can i use do i know what i actually spent last year on prescriptions and doctor visits do i want to selffund with something like a flexible spending account fsas have been in place for a long time under irs rule  but have not been widely adopted in part because people lacked the information they needed to plan for the year ahead and in part because its a useorlose program which scares some people an fsa allows an employee to set aside  a year for health care and  a year for child or parent care taxfree using an fsa involves additional complexity that the new tools weve been talking about can handle weve instituted something that we call the benny card which looks like a mastercard but functions as a debit card when someone with an fsa or a healthreimbursement account goes to a pharmacy — or beginning in january to a doctor or hospital — he swipes the benny card and debits money from that account this helps him anticipate how much hes likely to spend out of pocket based on the plan he has selected or created giving easier access to those dollars changes the dynamic in terms of how people start to think about accounts like fsas or hras it makes it much easier for them to keep track of how much theyve got left for the year and to plan accordingly and to deal with less paperwork and less hassle along the way mc would it be fair to say that youre less focused on exploiting cuttingedge technology than in using existing tools like the web to achieve your business goals lord thats correct we have leveraged technology but there are very few things that weve created here from a technology viewpoint what i think differentiates us is the work weve done with our employees and through a lot of primary consumer research to understand how people make decisions and what is important to people we have to work on two things making applications that are easy to use and comfortable for people and prioritizing which applications are useful for people a lot of tools that have been created on the internet are absolutely useless mc lets talk about some of the criticisms that have been leveled at consumeroriented benefit plans one is that they are a way to shift costs from employers to individuals and leave people with less coverage than they had before another is that they move away from the notion of shared risk lord first we believe in only fullreplacement product for the employees and retirees of a given client maybe at a geographic location or maybe companywide were looking at an entire risk pool and not just pulling the healthiest segment into a particular plan type we dont believe in breaking up the risk pool the concern behind the criticism is that insurers target people who dont use much health care and are attracted to plans that fit their needs the result might be to the shortterm advantage of the insurer and employer but over the long term lead to deterioration of other elements of the risk pool we maintain a posture that preserves the integrity of the full risk pool second we looked at real data showing how humanas employees used health care in the first year of smartsuite to see if there was a significant cost shift to them we found that in a period when our healthbenefit costs increased about  percent versus an increase of  percent a year earlier the contribution by our employees yearoveryear hardly budged their contribution to the cost of their benefits moved from  percent to  percent this is not a costshift play but it is a play that involves lots of moving parts mc once people have chosen their benefits how involved does humana get in helping them with clinical decision making lord part of my background is with an organization called health dialog which is associated with the foundation for informed medical decision making where we did a lot of primary research on shared decision making from a clinical perspective at humana weve tried to use ehelp tools to do the same sorts of things we have a telephonebased personal nurse program for people who have significant illness chronic illness or the propensity for chronic illness second on the web we provide people with the opportunity to have personal home pages that include conditionspecific health content personal health records updates from all the claims and other transactions we have access to plus the ability for patients to update their page roughly  people have built personal home pages mc so these are people who are confident that their information is safe lord thats correct to get to those data you have to go through a variety of secured logons register with us and get a special number it is a complex process to work on preserving the integrity of the information mc how do physicians need to change to handle patients who are more informed and vocal about what they want lord the evolving perspective of physicians from paternalism to partnership is a huge issue again there is no single profile of physicians generally physicians are comfortable with people and like to be engaged with them some of the things that were building allow us to look at a very different physicianpatient experience for instance if a member gives us permission to share information from her personal home page with her physician we can send to her physicians office an online confirmation of eligibility before the patient shows up along with a complete list of all the prescriptions she is on that enhances patient safety patients no longer have to fill out a stupid clipboard with the same information every time they go to see a doctor we have to work with patients and physicians in ways that arent intrusive and allow people to see that health plans add value health plans have a lot of territory to make up for from the past in terms of how people perceive us and what they think were trying to do im always asking our employees to imagine looking in a hand mirror and to think about how they want the health care system to work for them we have to deliver on that every day mc as an employer humana has saved  million using smartsuite where did the savings come from lord about  percent came from eliminating double coverage in twowageearner families many people essentially overinsure we explain to them that double coverage doesnt mean double benefits another  percent of the savings came from benefit changes the other  percent came from changes in careseeking behavior in other words utilization of services decreased the principal benefit change was to add a perday hospital copayment to the benefit design interestingly it appears that people actually increased their use of preventive services and decreased some of their use of other health care services mc in other words youre trying to get people out of the hospital more quickly lord were trying to get people as they work with their physicians to ask questions about the costs associated with their treatment so they make informed decisions staying in the hospital will cost them more money mc how long before you have data on your employees ongoing health and the outcomes of the care they receive to show that theyre not going to end up needing more intensive care down the road lord obviously those are things that will take quite a while but we are anxious to get that information so we can review it with what we know to date mc thank you latest issue table of contents july
