has launched remember the p’zone the new ‘crazy cheesy crust’ might be the craziest yet—or the most brilliant daniel gross reportsdaniel gross  am etwhen people say the us has lost its capacity to innovate i point them toward the fastfood sector it’s an industry that americans pioneered and continue to dominate homegrown brands are expanding throughout the developing world the uniform customer experiences they provide are triumphs of industrial engineering and efficiency systems management and they are constantly spending money to create and introduce new productsbehold the latest offering from pizza hut announced on wednesday the “crazy cheesy crust” it’s the usual pizza hut mélange of dough tomato sauce and cheese except the crust “the element of a pizza that pizza hut has a rich tradition of revolutionizing all around the world” is now outfitted with  dough pockets each filled with a mixture of five molten cheesesnow “crazy” seems to be something of a theme at yum brands the parent company of pizza hut taco bell and kfc last month we wrote about the triumph of the doritos locos taco for those of you who didn’t take spanish loco means “crazy” in spanish “it wasn’t intentional” notes kurt kane chief marketing officer at pizza hut of his crazy pizza “we picked up a lot of the language consumers used as they were trying it this is really a consumernamed idea” there’s no truth to the rumor kfc is preparing to test the colonel’s meshugganeh kosher chickenof course it’s easy to look askance at the endless iterations of core products—the many flavors of doritos the dozens of varieties of oreos new twists on cocacola but such new wrinkles are vital if established brands are to remain successful keep existing customers happy and attract new ones and in a crowded market pizza hut—the market leader in the vast us pizza category—can’t afford to let its guard downyum brands has enjoyed phenomenal growth outside the us in recent years here’s the most recent quarterly report last year in china pizza hut casual dining samestores sales rose  percent on the year and  percent in the fourth quarter at the end of  there were  pizza huts  in china  in india  elsewhere outside the us and  in the us all in  outlets were added over the course of but in the us pizza hut has struggled a bit in  the average us system unit had sales of  compared with  million for taco bell total combined pizza hut company and franchise sales were  billion in  about what they were in  for all of  samestore sales at us pizza huts rose  percent and in the fourth quarter samestore sales actually fell one percent from the fourth quarter of  that’s bad news in an environment when costs for labor benefits and raw ingredients are risingand so it seems that some reinvention of the menu would be in order yes pizza hut’s menu now includes wings but the company doesn’t go for outofthebox innovations like making a taco shell out of a dorito or adding salads and coffee as mcdonald’s has done if you go to the press room and scroll through the releases you won’t be bombarded with new product releases by and large it offers nottoorevolutionary twists on the holy trinity of dough cheese and sauce that has fueled millions of study sessions postlittle league chowfests and work meetings “it’s always a combination of dough sauce and cheese” said kane the chief marketing officer “but there are a lot of ways you can make it new time and time againindeed crusts stuffed with cheese were introduced many years ago more recently the company introduced the ultimate stuffed crust meaty pizza a greasebomb of epic proportions the crust was stuffed with cheese and pepperoni italian sausage and bacon in  it stuffed a crust with money  so dough in dough there’s the p’zone pizza hut’s take on the calzone and cheesy bites for this year’s super bowl it introduced big pizza sliders—a group of small pizzas side dishes are basically pizzas without the cheese and sauce bread sticks or pizza without the sauce cheese sticks desserts include dough with sugar—chocolate dunkers and cinnamon sticks many years ago at a pizza hut in upstate new york i encountered dessert pizzas which were kind of like big flat strudelsubiquitous brands find it difficult to get much growth unless they continually refresh the experience the challenge for pizza hut is that core users don’t walk in the door and express urgent preference for different products after all pizza in its current form is pretty much a perfect food “consumers are really good at reacting to products that we’ve created but they’re not great at helping us create them” notes kane and while there have been great advances in food chemistry and the science of taste pizza hut isn’t developing new products based on computer algorithms and formulas “we’ve got an entire team filled with dreamers that focus on dreaming up the next great thing”it turns out the thing they’ve been dreaming about is a lot more cheese to a degree this cuts against the zeitgeist this is a world in which officials are trying to ban large soda portions and in which the biggest food companies are committing to remove fat sodium and sugar from their products all while reducing portion size pizza hut is going in the other direction it’s loading more calories and fat into the existing product making a comfort food even more comfortingkane said that pizza hut plans to open “a couple of hundred restaurants” in  which is pretty good for a company with a wellestablished footprint “we’re nowhere near close to the point of saturation for our brand or for our business” as for the crust with  pockets packed with gobs of molten dairy products it’s probably saturatedread this listpizza hut’s evil geniusdaniel gross kurt
