nucleophilic addition of a carbanion or another nucleophile to an αβunsaturated carbonyl compound it belongs to the larger class of conjugate additions this is one of the most useful methods for the mild formation of c–c bonds many asymmetric variants exist in this scheme the r and r substituents on the nucleophile a michael donor are electronwithdrawing groups such as acyl and cyano making the methylene hydrogen acidic forming the carbanion on reaction with base b the substituent on the activated alkene also called a michael acceptor is usually a ketone making it an enone but it can also be a nitro group contents  definition  mechanism  asymmetric michael reaction  mukaiyamamichael addition  history  references  external links definitionedit as originally defined by arthur michael the reaction is the addition of an enolate of a ketone or aldehyde to an αβunsaturated carbonyl compound at the β carbon a newer definition proposed by kohler is the addition of a doubly stabilized carbon nucleophile to an αβunsaturated carbonyl compound some examples of nucleophiles include betaketoesters malonates and betacyanoesters the resulting product contains a highly useful dioxygenated pattern classical examples of the michael reaction are the reaction between diethyl malonate michael donor and diethyl fumarate michael acceptor that of mesityl oxide and diethyl malonate that of diethyl malonate and methyl crotonate that of nitropropane and methyl acrylate that of ethyl phenylcyanoacetate and acrylonitrile and that of nitropropane and methyl vinyl ketone the michael addition is an important atomeconomical method for diastereoselective and enantioselective c–c bond formation a classical tandem sequence of michael and aldol additions is the robinson annulation mechanismedit the reaction mechanism is  with r an alkoxy group as the nucleophile deprotonation of  by base leads to carbanion  stabilized by its electronwithdrawing groups structures a to c are three resonance structures that can be drawn for this species two of which have enolate ions this nucleophile reacts with the electrophilic alkene  to form  in a conjugate addition reaction proton abstraction from protonated base or solvent by the enolate  to  is the final step the course of the reaction is dominated by orbital rather than electrostatic considerations the homo of stabilized enolates has a large coefficient on the central carbon atom while the lumo of many alpha beta unsaturated carbonyl compounds has a large coefficient on the beta carbon thus both reactants can be considered soft these polarized frontier orbitals are of similar energy and react efficiently to form a new carbon–carbon bond like the aldol addition the michael reaction may proceed via an enol silyl enol ether in the mukaiyamamichael addition or more usually enolate nucleophile in the latter case the stabilized carbonyl compound is deprotonated with a strong base hard enolization or with a lewis acid and a weak base soft enolization the resulting enolate attacks the activated olefin with regioselectivity forming a carbon–carbon bond this also transfers the enolate to the electrophile since the electrophile is much less acidic than the nucleophile rapid proton transfer usually transfers the enolate back to the nucleophile if the product is enolizable however one may take advantage of the new locus of nucleophilicity if a suitable electrophile is pendant depending on the relative acidities of the nucleophile and product the reaction may be catalytic in base in most cases the reaction is irreversible at low temperature asymmetric michael reactionedit in recent years researchers have endeavoured to expand the scope of asymmetric michael additions the most common methods involve chiral phase transfer catalysis such as asymmetric quaternary ammonium salts derived from the cinchona alkaloids or organocatalysis which uses enamine or iminium activation with chiral secondary amines usually derived from proline in the reaction between cyclohexanone and βnitrostyrene sketched below the base proline is derivatized and works in conjunction with a protic acid such as ptoluenesulfonic acid syn addition is favored with  ee in the transition state believed to be responsible for this selectivity the enamine formed between the proline nitrogen and the cycloketone and βnitrostyrene are cofacial with the nitro group hydrogen bonded to the protonated amine in the proline side group a wellknown michael reaction is the synthesis of warfarin from hydroxycoumarin and benzylideneacetone first reported by link in  several asymmetric versions of this reaction exist using chiral catalysts mukaiyamamichael additionedit in the mukaiyamamichael addition the nucleophile is a silyl ether and the catalyst usually titanium tetrachloride historyedit the research done by arthur michael in  was prompted by an  publication by conrad  kuthzeit on the reaction of ethyl dibromopropionate with diethyl sodiomalonate forming a cyclopropane derivative now recognized as involving two successive substitution reactions michael was able to obtain the same product by replacing the propionate by bromacrylic acid ethylester and realized that this reaction could only work by assuming an addition reaction to the double bond of the acrylic acid he then confirmed this assumption by reacting diethyl malonate and the ethyl ester of cinnamic acid forming the very first michael adduct in the same year rainer ludwig claisen claimed priority for the invention he and t komnenos had observed addition products to double bonds as sideproducts earlier in  while investigating condensation reactions of malonic acid with aldehydes however according to biographer takashi tokoroyama this claim is

mobile view michael reaction  wikipedia michael reaction from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search the michael reaction or michael addition is the nucleophilic addition of a carbanion or another nucleophile to an αβunsaturated carbonyl compound it belongs to the larger class of conjugate additions this is one of the most useful methods for the mild formation of c–c bonds many asymmetric variants exist in this scheme the r and r substituents on the nucleophile a michael donor are electronwithdrawing groups such as acyl and cyano making the methylene hydrogen acidic forming the carbanion on reaction with base b the substituent on the activated alkene also called a michael acceptor is usually a ketone making it an enone but it can also be a nitro group contents  definition  mechanism  asymmetric michael reaction  mukaiyamamichael addition  history  references  external links definitionedit as originally defined by arthur michael the reaction is the addition of an enolate of a ketone or aldehyde to an αβunsaturated carbonyl compound at the β carbon a newer definition proposed by kohler is the addition of a doubly stabilized carbon nucleophile to an αβunsaturated carbonyl compound some examples of nucleophiles include betaketoesters malonates and betacyanoesters the resulting product contains a highly useful dioxygenated pattern classical examples of the michael reaction are the reaction between diethyl malonate michael donor and diethyl fumarate michael acceptor that of mesityl oxide and diethyl malonate that of diethyl malonate and methyl crotonate that of nitropropane and methyl acrylate that of ethyl phenylcyanoacetate and acrylonitrile and that of nitropropane and methyl vinyl ketone the michael addition is an important atomeconomical method for diastereoselective and enantioselective c–c bond formation a classical tandem sequence of michael and aldol additions is the robinson annulation mechanismedit the reaction mechanism is  with r an alkoxy group as the nucleophile deprotonation of  by base leads to carbanion  stabilized by its electronwithdrawing groups structures a to c are three resonance structures that can be drawn for this species two of which have enolate ions this nucleophile reacts with the electrophilic alkene  to form  in a conjugate addition reaction proton abstraction from protonated base or solvent by the enolate  to  is the final step the course of the reaction is dominated by orbital rather than electrostatic considerations the homo of stabilized enolates has a large coefficient on the central carbon atom while the lumo of many alpha beta unsaturated carbonyl compounds has a large coefficient on the beta carbon thus both reactants can be considered soft these polarized frontier orbitals are of similar energy and react efficiently to form a new carbon–carbon bond like the aldol addition the michael reaction may proceed via an enol silyl enol ether in the mukaiyamamichael addition or more usually enolate nucleophile in the latter case the stabilized carbonyl compound is deprotonated with a strong base hard enolization or with a lewis acid and a weak base soft enolization the resulting enolate attacks the activated olefin with regioselectivity forming a carbon–carbon bond this also transfers the enolate to the electrophile since the electrophile is much less acidic than the nucleophile rapid proton transfer usually transfers the enolate back to the nucleophile if the product is enolizable however one may take advantage of the new locus of nucleophilicity if a suitable electrophile is pendant depending on the relative acidities of the nucleophile and product the reaction may be catalytic in base in most cases the reaction is irreversible at low temperature asymmetric michael reactionedit in recent years researchers have endeavoured to expand the scope of asymmetric michael additions the most common methods involve chiral phase transfer catalysis such as asymmetric quaternary ammonium salts derived from the cinchona alkaloids or organocatalysis which uses enamine or iminium activation with chiral secondary amines usually derived from proline in the reaction between cyclohexanone and βnitrostyrene sketched below the base proline is derivatized and works in conjunction with a protic acid such as ptoluenesulfonic acid syn addition is favored with  ee in the transition state believed to be responsible for this selectivity the enamine formed between the proline nitrogen and the cycloketone and βnitrostyrene are cofacial with the nitro group hydrogen bonded to the protonated amine in the proline side group a wellknown michael reaction is the synthesis of warfarin from hydroxycoumarin and benzylideneacetone first reported by link in  several asymmetric versions of this reaction exist using chiral catalysts mukaiyamamichael additionedit in the mukaiyamamichael addition the nucleophile is a silyl ether and the catalyst usually titanium tetrachloride historyedit the research done by arthur michael in  was prompted by an  publication by conrad  kuthzeit on the reaction of ethyl dibromopropionate with diethyl sodiomalonate forming a cyclopropane derivative now recognized as involving two successive substitution reactions michael was able to obtain the same product by replacing the propionate by bromacrylic acid ethylester and realized that this reaction could only work by assuming an addition reaction to the double bond of the acrylic acid he then confirmed this assumption by reacting diethyl malonate and the ethyl ester of cinnamic acid forming the very first michael adduct in the same year rainer ludwig claisen claimed priority for the invention he and t komnenos had observed addition products to double bonds as sideproducts earlier in  while investigating condensation reactions of malonic acid with aldehydes however according to biographer takashi tokoroyama this claim is

 • growth–share matrix v t e a value chain is a set of activities that a firm operating in a specific industry performs in order to deliver a valuable product or service for the market the concept comes through business management and was first described by michael porter in his  bestseller competitive advantage creating and sustaining superior performance the idea of the value chain is based on the process view of organizations the idea of seeing a manufacturing or service organization as a system made up of subsystems each with inputs transformation processes and outputs inputs transformation processes and outputs involve the acquisition and consumption of resources – money labour materials equipment buildings land administration and management how value chain activities are carried out determines costs and affects profits — ifm cambridge the concept of value chains as decision support tools was added onto the competitive strategies paradigm developed by porter as early as dubious – discuss in porters value chains inbound logistics operations outbound logistics marketing and sales and service are categorized as primary activities secondary activities include procurement human resource management technological development and infrastructure porter  pp – according to the oecd secretarygeneral gurría  the emergence of global value chains gvcs in the late s

development  significance  use with other analysis tools  scor  see also  references  further reading  external links firmleveledit michael porters value chain the appropriate level for constructing a value chain is the business unit not division or corporate level products pass through a chain of activities in order and at each activity the product gains some value the chain of activities gives the products more added value than the sum of added values of all activities the activity of a diamond cutter can illustrate the difference between cost and the value chain the cutting activity may have a low cost but the activity adds much of the value to the end product since a rough diamond is significantly less valuable than a cut diamond typically the described value chain and the documentation of processes assessment and auditing of adherence to the process routines are at the core of the quality certification of the business eg iso citation needed a firms value chain forms a part of a larger stream of activities which porter calls a value systemcitation needed a value system or an industry value chain includes the suppliers that provide the inputs necessary to the firm along with their value chains after the firm creates products these products pass through the value chains of distributors which also have their own value chains all the way to the customers all parts of these chains are included in the value system to achieve and sustain a competitive advantage and to support that advantage with information technologies a firm must understand every component of this value systemcitation needed primary activitiesedit inbound logistics arranging the inbound movement of materials parts andor finished inventory from suppliers to manufacturing or assembly plants warehouses or retail stores operations concerned with managing the process that converts inputs in the forms of raw materials labor and energy into outputs in the form of goods andor services outbound logistics is the process related to the storage and movement of the final product and the related information flows from the end of the production line to the end user marketing and sales selling a product or service and processes for creating communicating delivering and exchanging offerings that have value for customers clients partners and society at large service includes all the activities required to keep the productservice working effectively for the buyer after it is sold and delivered support activitiesedit infrastructure consists of activities such as accounting legal finance control public relations quality assurance and general strategic management technological development pertains to the equipment hardware software procedures and technical knowledge brought to bear in the firms transformation of inputs into outputs human resources management consists of all activities involved in recruiting hiring training developing compensating and if necessary dismissing or laying off personnel procurement the acquisition of goods services or works from an outside external source physical virtual and combined value chainedit competitive advantage cannot be understood by looking at a firm as a whole it stems from the many discrete activities a firm performs in designing producing marketing delivering and supporting its product each of these activities can contribute to a firms relative cost position and create a basis for differentiation michael porter the value chain categorizes the generic valueadding activities of an organization the activities considered under this productservice enhancement process can be broadly categorized under two major activitysets physicaltraditional value chain a physicalworld activity performed in order to enhance a product or a service such activities evolved over time by the experience people gained from their business conduct as the will to earn higher profit drives any businesscitation needed professionals traineduntrained practice these to achieve their goal virtual value chain the advent of computerbased businessaided systems in the modern world has led to a completely new horizon of market space in modern businessjargon – the cybermarket space like any other field of computer application here also we have tried to implement our physical worlds practices to improve this digital world all activities of persistent physical worlds physical valuechain enhancement process which we implement in the cybermarket are in general terms referred toby whom as a virtual value chain in practice as of update no progressive organisation can afford to remain stuck to any one of these value chains in order to cover both market spaces physical world and cyber world organisations need to deploy their very best practices in both of these spaces to churn out the most informative datacitation needed which can further be used to improve the ongoing productsservices or to develop some new productservice hence organisations today try to employ the combined value chain combined value chain  physical value shown in sample below inbound logistics production process outbound logistics

interconnectedness as mnes play an increasingly larger role in the internationalisation of business in response governments have cut corporate income tax cit rates or introduced new incentives for research and development to compete in this changing geopolitical landscapeleblanc et al in an industrial development context the concepts of global value chain analysis were first introduced in the s gereffi et al and have gradually been integrated into development policy by the world bank unctad the oecd and others value chain analysis has also been employed in the development sector as a means of identifying poverty reduction strategies by upgrading along the value chain although commonly associated with exportoriented trade development practitioners have begun to highlight the importance of developing national and intraregional chains in addition to international ones for example the international crops research institute for the semiarid tropics icrisat has investigated strengthening the value chain for sweet sorghum as a biofuel crop in india its aim in doing so was to provide a sustainable means of making ethanol that would increase the incomes of the rural poor without sacrificing food and fodder security while protecting the environment significanceedit the value chain framework quickly made its way to the forefront of management thought as a powerful analysis tool for strategic planning the simpler concept of value streams a crossfunctional process which was developed over the next decade had some success in the early s the valuechain concept has been extended beyond individual firms it can apply to whole supply chains and distribution networks the delivery of a mix of products and services to the end customer will mobilize different economic factors each managing its own value chain the industry wide synchronized interactions of those local value chains create an extended value chain sometimes global in extent porter terms this larger interconnected system of value chains the value system a value system includes the value chains of a firms supplier and their suppliers all the way back the firm itself the firm distribution channels and the firms buyers and presumably extended to the buyers of their products and so on capturing the value generated along the chain is the new approach taken by many management strategists for example a manufacturer might require its parts suppliers to be located nearby its assembly plant to minimize the cost of transportation by exploiting the upstream and downstream information flowing along the value chain the firms may try to bypass the intermediaries creating new business models or in other ways create improvements in its value system value chain analysis has also been successfully used in large petrochemical plant maintenance organizations to show how work selection work planning work scheduling and finally work execution can when considered as elements of chains help drive lean approaches to maintenance the maintenance value chain approach is particularly successful when used as a tool for helping change management as it is seen as more userfriendly than other business process tools a value chain approach could also offer a meaningful alternative to evaluate private or public companies when there is a lack of publicly known data from direct competition where the subject company is compared with for example a known downstream industry to have a good feel of its value by building useful correlations with its downstream companies use with other analysis

to remove this template message once value has been analysed and the contributing parts of the organisation have been identified other models can be used in conjunction with the value chain to assess

opportunities there may be to improve that area or identify the threats to what may be a critical part of the value delivery system equally other models can be used to assess performance risk market

value chain is a set of activities that a firm operating in a specific industry performs in order to deliver a valuable product or service for the market the concept comes through business management and was first described by michael porter in his  bestseller competitive advantage creating and sustaining superior performance the idea of the value chain is based on the process view of organizations the idea of seeing a manufacturing or service organization as a system made up of subsystems each with inputs transformation processes and outputs inputs transformation processes and outputs involve the acquisition and consumption of resources – money labour materials equipment buildings land administration and management how value chain activities are carried out determines costs

business unit not division or corporate level products pass through a chain of activities in order and at each activity the product gains some value the chain of activities gives the products more added value than the sum of added values of all activities the activity of a diamond cutter can illustrate the difference between cost and the value chain the cutting activity may have a low cost but the activity adds much of the value to the end product since a rough diamond is significantly less valuable than a cut diamond typically the described value chain and the documentation of processes assessment and auditing of adherence to the process routines are at the core of the quality certification of the business eg iso citation needed a firms value chain forms a part of a larger stream of activities which porter calls a value systemcitation needed a value system or an industry value chain includes the suppliers that provide the inputs necessary to the firm along with their value chains after the firm creates products these products pass through the value chains of distributors which also have their own value chains all the way to the customers all parts of these chains are included in the value system to achieve and sustain a competitive advantage and to support that advantage with information technologies a firm must understand every component of this value systemcitation

personnel procurement the acquisition of goods services or works from an outside external source physical virtual and combined value chainedit competitive advantage cannot be understood by looking at a firm as a whole it stems from the many discrete activities a firm performs in designing producing marketing delivering and supporting its product each of these activities can contribute to a firms relative cost position and create a basis for differentiation michael porter the value chain categorizes the generic valueadding activities of an organization the activities considered under this productservice enhancement process can be broadly categorized under two major activitysets physicaltraditional value chain a physicalworld activity performed in order to enhance a product or a service such activities evolved over time by the experience people gained from their business conduct as the will to earn higher profit drives any businesscitation needed professionals traineduntrained

progressive organisation can afford to remain stuck to any one of these value chains in order to cover both market spaces physical world and cyber world organisations need to deploy their very best practices in both of these spaces to churn out the most informative datacitation needed which can further be used to improve the ongoing productsservices or to develop some new productservice hence

increasingly larger role in the internationalisation of business in response governments have cut corporate income tax cit rates or introduced new incentives for research and development to compete in this changing geopolitical landscapeleblanc et al in an industrial development context the concepts of global value chain analysis were first introduced in the s gereffi et al and have gradually been integrated into development policy by the world bank unctad the oecd and others value chain analysis has also been employed in the development sector as a means of identifying poverty reduction strategies by upgrading along the value chain although commonly associated with exportoriented trade development practitioners have begun to highlight the importance of developing national and intraregional chains in addition to international ones for example the international crops research institute for the semiarid tropics icrisat has investigated strengthening the value chain for sweet sorghum as a biofuel crop in india its aim in doing so was to provide a sustainable means of making ethanol that would increase the incomes of the rural poor without sacrificing food and fodder security while protecting the environment significanceedit the value chain framework quickly made its way to the forefront of management thought as a powerful analysis tool for strategic planning the simpler concept of value streams a crossfunctional process which was developed over the next decade had some success in the early s the valuechain concept has been extended beyond individual firms it can apply to whole supply chains and distribution networks the delivery of a mix of products and services to the end customer will mobilize different economic factors each managing its own value chain the industry wide synchronized interactions of those local value chains create an extended value chain sometimes global in extent porter terms this larger interconnected system of value chains the value system a value system includes the value chains of a firms supplier and their suppliers all the way back the firm itself the firm distribution channels and the firms buyers and presumably extended to the buyers of their products and so on capturing the value generated along the chain is the new approach taken by many management strategists for example a manufacturer might require its parts suppliers to be located nearby its assembly plant to minimize the cost of transportation by exploiting the upstream and downstream information flowing along the value chain the firms may try to bypass the intermediaries creating new business models or in other ways create improvements in its value system value chain analysis has also been successfully used in large petrochemical plant maintenance organizations to show how work selection work planning work scheduling and finally work execution can when considered as elements of chains help drive lean approaches to maintenance the maintenance value chain approach is particularly successful when used as a tool for helping change management as it is seen as more userfriendly than other business process tools a value chain approach could also offer a meaningful alternative to evaluate private or public companies when there is a lack of publicly known data from direct competition where the subject company is compared

integrated into development policy by the world bank unctad the oecd and others value chain analysis has also been employed in the development sector as a means of identifying poverty reduction strategies by upgrading along the value chain although commonly associated with exportoriented trade development practitioners have begun to highlight the importance of developing national and intraregional chains in addition to international ones for example the international crops research institute for the semiarid tropics icrisat has investigated strengthening the value chain for sweet sorghum as a biofuel crop in india its aim in doing so was to provide a sustainable means of making ethanol that would increase the incomes of the rural poor without sacrificing food and fodder security while protecting the environment significanceedit the value chain framework quickly made its way to the forefront of management thought as a powerful analysis tool for strategic planning the simpler concept of value streams a crossfunctional process which was developed over the next decade had some success in the early s the valuechain concept has been extended beyond individual firms it can apply to whole supply chains and distribution networks the delivery of a mix of products and services to the end customer will mobilize different economic factors each managing its own value chain the industry wide synchronized interactions of those local value chains create an extended value chain sometimes global in extent porter terms this larger interconnected system of value chains the value system a value system includes the value chains of a firms supplier and their suppliers all the way back the firm itself the firm distribution channels and the firms buyers and presumably extended to the buyers of their products and so on capturing the value generated along the chain is the new approach taken by many management strategists for example a manufacturer might require its parts suppliers to be located nearby its assembly plant to minimize the cost of transportation by exploiting the upstream and downstream information flowing along the value chain the firms may try to bypass the intermediaries creating new business models or in other ways create improvements in its value system value chain analysis has also been successfully used in large petrochemical plant maintenance organizations to show how work selection work planning work scheduling and finally work execution can when considered as elements of chains help drive lean approaches to maintenance the maintenance value chain approach is particularly successful when used as a tool for helping change management as it is seen as more userfriendly than other business process tools a value chain approach could also offer a meaningful alternative to evaluate private or public companies when there is a lack of publicly known data from direct competition where the subject company is compared

in a specific industry performs in order to deliver a valuable product or service for the market the concept comes through business management and was first described by michael porter in his  bestseller competitive advantage creating and sustaining superior performance the idea of the value chain is based on the process view of organizations the idea of seeing a manufacturing or service organization as a system made up of subsystems each with inputs transformation processes and outputs inputs transformation processes and outputs involve the acquisition and consumption of resources – money labour materials equipment buildings land administration and management how value chain activities are carried out determines costs and affects profits — ifm cambridge the concept of value chains as decision support tools was added onto the competitive strategies paradigm developed by porter as early as dubious – discuss in porters value chains inbound logistics operations outbound logistics marketing and sales and service are categorized as primary activities secondary activities include procurement human resource management technological development and infrastructure porter

further reading  external links firmleveledit michael porters value chain the appropriate level for constructing a value chain is the business unit not division or corporate level products pass through a chain of activities in order and at each activity the product gains some value the chain of activities gives the products more added value than the sum of added values of all activities the activity of a diamond cutter can illustrate the difference between cost and the value chain the cutting activity may have a low cost but the activity adds much of the value to the end product since a rough diamond is significantly less valuable than a cut diamond typically the described value chain and the documentation of processes assessment and auditing of adherence to the process routines are at the core of the quality certification of the business eg iso citation needed a firms value chain forms a part of a larger stream of activities which porter calls a value systemcitation needed a value system or an industry value chain includes the suppliers that provide the inputs necessary to the firm along with their value chains after the firm creates products these products pass through the value chains of distributors which also have their own value chains all the way to the customers all parts of these chains are included in the value system to achieve and sustain a competitive advantage and to support that advantage with information technologies a firm must understand every component of this value systemcitation needed primary activitiesedit inbound logistics arranging the inbound movement of materials parts andor finished inventory from suppliers to manufacturing or assembly plants warehouses or retail stores operations concerned with managing the process that converts inputs in the forms of raw materials labor and energy into outputs in the form of goods andor services outbound logistics is the process related to the storage and movement of the final product and the related information flows from the end of the production line to the end user marketing and sales selling a product or service and processes for creating communicating delivering and exchanging offerings that have value for customers clients partners and society at large service includes all the activities required to keep the productservice working effectively for the buyer after it is sold and delivered support activitiesedit infrastructure consists of activities such as accounting legal finance control public relations quality assurance and general strategic management technological development pertains to the equipment hardware software procedures and technical knowledge brought to bear in the firms transformation of inputs into outputs human resources management consists of all activities involved in recruiting hiring training developing compensating and if necessary dismissing or laying off personnel procurement the acquisition of goods services or works from an outside external source physical virtual and combined value chainedit competitive advantage cannot be understood by looking at a firm as a whole it stems from the many discrete activities a firm performs in designing producing marketing delivering and supporting its product each of these activities can contribute to a firms relative cost position and create a basis for differentiation michael porter the value chain categorizes the generic valueadding activities of an organization the activities considered under this productservice enhancement process can be broadly categorized under two major activitysets physicaltraditional value chain a physicalworld activity performed in order to enhance a product or a service such activities evolved over time by the experience people gained from their
