medical equipment and devices in istanbul turkey mayar medical will represent ineedmds firstinclass disposable electrocardiogram lead set the ekg glove™ and related products to public and private sector hospitals physicians and emergency medical providers the ekg glove™ is an fdacleared and cemarked disposable medical device that standardizes and simplifies the acquisition of an electrocardiogram ekgecg an ekg assesses the electrical activity of an individuals heart and is one of the most enduring diagnostic tools utilized by cardiologists traditionally the accuracy of the test has been dependent on a skilled technicians ability to correctly affix a complex network of  electrodes and  corresponding lead wires onto a patients chest prior to initiating the ekg test the configuration process for these  individual components can be timeconsuming and fraught with the potential for error due to electrode misplacement or lead reversal the ekg glove™ streamlines this usually cumbersome pretest procedure by integrating prepositioned electrodes and printed circuit technology into a singleuse peelandstick glovelike sheath in approximately  seconds a user can simply remove the backing insert his or her right hand and apply the ekg glove™ to the patients chest the ekg glove™ is versatile  it can be paired with legacy ekg machinery or with a portable bluetooth interface device also offered by ineedmd to facilitate ekg testing in virtually any location thomas a nicolette chief executive officer and president of ineedmd holdings inc commented we are excited
