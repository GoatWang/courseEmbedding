president and ceo j christopher donahue driven by three commitments as he champions cause of money funds by boselovic len read preview article excerpt few in the  trillion money market industry are as protective of the product as federated investors j christopher donahuehes the scion of a family business propagated by his father and controlled by the large perpetually expanding donahue clan which owns all of federateds voting stock because the pittsburgh company and money funds are joined at the hip mr donahue  takes the product very personally championing the cause with particular relish in recent yearsthe  financial crisis prompted federal regulators to impose new restrictions on money funds in  then seek additional regulations last yearin june while the industrys regulatory future was uncertain mr donahue accused regulators of demonizing money funds those government efforts were halted in august in an interview last month mr donahue said he expects regulators will try again contending they have never stopped trying to put his familys baby out of businessthe first time the federal reserve wanted to eliminate money market funds was  its still the same game federateds president and ceo saidits like an endless playoff series you never have a victory you just survive until the next roundsome say mr donahue is too defensive noting tougher regulations have prompted some money fund operators to sell their business to federated increasing the companys share of the market they contend federateds ability to work its way through the regulatory thicket and to tailor money funds to customer needs has made it the thirdlargest money fund operator behind only fidelity investments and jpmorgan chaseindustry observers say the key to that success has been the depth of mr donahues knowledge of why bank trust departments corporate treasurers institutional investors and other clients want money funds  despite todays paltry returnsmoney funds invest in us treasuries and other shortterm securities investors like them because they can park cash safely earn interest and get it when they need it although not government guaranteed like bank deposits money funds in all but a few cases have given investors their money back dollar for dollar  plus interesthe understands this product and how it works and its uses as well as anybody said paul schott stevens president and ceo of the investment company institute the lobbyist for the mutual fund industrybut success with money funds  which account for nearly half of federateds revenue and  percent of the  billion it manages  has come at a pricefederateds shares typically trade at a discount to many of its competitors money funds are a low margin business and federateds stock and bond funds are not big enough to compete with many fund companiessince going public in may  federateds publicly traded stock has generated average annual returns of  percent including dividends lagging such competitors as eaton vance up  percent annually over the same period waddell  reed up  percent and franklin resources up  percentthe three fsmr donahue joined the company in  as a parttime law clerk a year after graduating from
