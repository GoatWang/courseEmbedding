foe dr harold goldmeier growth momentum growth at reasonable pricelinkdensummaryferro corp products complement those in the paint manufacturing industry its relatively small and inexpensive and will benefit from takeover and marketing of its products by legacy paint manufacturersferro is a relatively safe investment but its greatest value is as an acquisition target  more from paint companies than investment houses from which there have been offersit is a chemical company into polymer and material sciences heavy on developing technologies for glass paint and other industriesferro corp nysefoe makes products that complement those in the paint manufacturing industry ferro is relatively small and inexpensive and will benefit from the marketing of its products to firms to which larger paint companies are already selling ferros investment attractiveness is mostly as a merger or acquisition i have written articles over the past year for seeking alpha encouraging investment in the rather uncelebrated paint manufacturing industry its not a glitzy business and is the object of a lot of snickering but the dramatic increases in share prices of most of the companies i highlight are leaving investors laughing all the way to the bank these include sherwinwilliams nyse shw shares rising from the mids topping  ppg industries nyse ppg shares selling for below  then reaching a week high of  valspar corp nyse val shares rose after my article from  to a shw buyout offer of  two of my less pricey favorites rpm international nyse rpm and axalta coating systems nyse axta a stock im recommending today is ferro corp this is not a paint company per se like those above though it was founded nearly a hundred years ago  manufacturing porcelain enamel coatings for appliances and later on boats it is more a chemical company into polymer and material sciences heavy on developing technologies for performance materials selling into the glass ceramic paint and other industries by the mids foes core businesses included customengineered plastics coatings colors chemicals and ceramics the company bought or opened forty factories and a customer sales pipeline from china for its growing middle class to other parts of the world eg egypt india turkey spain and portugal image source company website sde one enhances beauty durability of amsterdams the rock office tower foes technologies in powder auto and industrial coatings might make it of special takeover interest to legacy paint companies that are consolidating the industry according to pci magazine three months ago ferro itself completed the acquisition of belgiumbased cappelle pigments a leader in specialty highperformance inorganic and organic pigments used in coatings inks and plastics foes products of interest to paint companies on the hunt include porcelain enamel products for coating appliances cookware sanitary ware water heaters building panels signage and chemical storage vessels complex inorganic color pigments for the paint plastics and ceramics industries that are highly heat stable lightfast and chemicalweather resistant black enamels and conductive pastes for automotive glass colors inks and coatings for appliance and architectural flat glass functional coatings and pigments and specialty glasses used in dental applications grinding wheels spark plugs and other industrial applications process temperature control rings ptcr materials for laser marking and nanofilm coatings for glass surfaces complex inorganic color pigments for the paint plastics and ceramics industries

produced using resinmatched vehicles that are totally compatible andor reactive with all thermoplastic and thermoset plastics  suitable for a wide variety of processes foe shares are selling above the week low  and below the high  at a tad above  its market cap is  billion in  a schulman nsdaq shlm offered  per share for foe schulman and subsequent offers have been shunted in  ferro received and rebuffed acquisition offers allegedly below  from apollo global management llc and capital partners ltd one shareholder according to reuters believes management ought to pursue buyers with the companys significant operational improvement strong market share positions robust free cash flow generation and deep acquisition pipeline ferro continues to hum along with admirable commentaries from analysts over the past four years on february   the company announced the closing of a new  million seniorsecured term loan to repay outstanding balances and extend debt maturity also a new  million seniorsecured revolving credit facility has been made analysts currently set a target price of  capitalcubes analysis gives ferro corp an investment outlook score of  with a relative valuation of undervalued based on comparing the company with its peers in the paint and chemical industries institutions and mutual funds hold almost  percent of the  million shares outstanding the short ratio is  foe enjoys a  percent gross profit margin and a  percent operating margin on the whole this is a pretty safe investment there is nothing exceptional about ferro corp to warrant significant investment except for its potential to get swept up in the ma winds  but thats been the talk for years perhaps this is the year with the share price creeping above  and insiders growing impatient disclosure iwe
