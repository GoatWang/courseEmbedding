executive officer mogens bay mogens c bay  chairman  chief executive officer thank you jeff and good morning everyone thank you for joining us i trust that youve all read the press release before i get into the quarterly discussion i wanted to remind everyone that we are hosting an investor day in new york city a week from today you will have the opportunity to hear from each of our segment presidents as they discuss their businesses and we look forward to providing a deeper dive into our company we hope you can join us in person or via the webcast there were a lot of moving pieces this quarter as well as some important developments including the portfolio resegmentation before i get into that let me first provide an update on the restructuring effort we announced last april planned initiatives have largely been completed this along with other costreduction actions will total annual savings of about  million approximately  million of the benefit was realized in  and we are looking for the remainder of the cost savings around  million to occur over the course of this year many of the actions taken were focused on footprint rationalization and realignment we enter  with  fewer manufacturing facilities and a reduced global workforce by approximately  while these decisions were not easy to make they were necessary the benefit from our restructuring and our focus on operational improvement should position us well to deliver earnings growth this year during the fourth quarter we modified our reporting structure to improve transparency into our business portfolio especially as it related to the collection of businesses in our engineered infrastructure products segment going forward we will report in five segments the renamed engineered support structures segment will now comprise of our global lighting traffic and wireless communication poles and towers along with our highway safety business this is a large global business with operating income close to  despite operating in a very difficult economic environment the newlycreated energy and mining segment will comprise access systems offshore and grinding media these businesses have mainly been serving the energy and mining industries and are negatively affected by the recent collapse in energy prices and depressed mining activities still we believe theyre good longterm businesses to be in our tubing business will be folded into our irrigation segment reflecting the importance of agriculture to its revenue the utility support structures and coatings segments remain unchanged and finally there will no longer be an other segment we believe this new segment structure will provide you with a better understanding of and visibility into our businesses let me now turn to the fourth quarter results by segment excluding the effects of restructuring impairment and nonrecurring items in the engineered support structures segment sales declined about  currencies translation less intercompany demand from utility and general weak economic conditions contributed to the decline positive sales momentum in north america was more than offset by declines in europe middle east and africa in asiapacific we saw some uptick in our wireless communication market in china but softness in other asian economies in the utility support structures segment the decline in revenue was to a great extent the result of a much lower steel cost a significant weakness in our canadian market and a less favorable project mix still were seeing improvement in the quality of earnings of this segment as a result of their focus on operational excellence as we have communicated before we expect the  basis point improvement in the quality of earnings in this segment going into  this segment delivered  of operating income for the year  and we should return to doubledigit operating income for  let me elaborate on the  million accrual this quarter in the utility segment this accrual is for the anticipated settlement of a commercial dispute with a customer that is a joint venture between two of our biggest customers this joint venture and its owners have placed orders with valmont totaling nearly  billion over the last number of years so they are very very important to our business the dispute is over potential warranty issues and connection with a major transmission project at valmont we have complete confidence that we will not have an issue but to address the concerns of our customer we would be agreeing to a settlement including an extensive testing regime over the next  years as such we have accrued the expense to cover this the coatings segments performance is a combination of two very different markets north america continues to show strength with external volume offsetting weaker internal volumes on the other hand the australian coatings businesses is negative affected by the general economic malaise given depressed mining activity levels and a weakening australian currency in the newlycreated energy and mining segment we are feeling the full blunt of the collapse in energy prices and result in curtailing of capital expenditures by the worlds energy companies this environment has affected all three business units in this segment workforce access systems donhad grinding media and valmont sms offshore energyrelated businesses one positive in this segment is the strong order backlog at valmont sm for offshore wind turbine structures our challenge in this segment will be to find new markets outside energy and mining to leverage our manufacturing and engineering capabilities turning to our irrigation segment low commodity prices and declining net farm income continue to pressure revenue both in north america and globally political challenges and unrest in many parts of the world combined with a declining value of many local currencies have added to the headwind our irrigation business however continues to manage costs and productivity very well and delivered good earnings quality despite a challenging environment i will now turn the call over to mark for more color on our financial performance mark c jaksich  chief financial officer  executive vice president think you mogens and hello everyone the fourth quarter involved a number of nonrecurring events which i will review before covering specifics on ongoing operations first we incurred a total of  million of intangible asset impairment charges this quarter in asiapacific galvanizing business unit you will recall we took a  million goodwill impairment charge in the third quarter as required under gaap we completed the full revaluation of this reporting unit in the fourth quarter because the fair value of the fixed assets in this reporting unit was higher than carrying value this required a writedown of the remaining goodwill of  million in addition the goodwill associated with our access systems reporting unit was written down by  million this business unit has been under significant operating pressure due to market conditions in the mining and energy sectors in the fourth quarter oil prices including the outlook for oil prices going forward continued to fall dramatically and we reassessed our intermediateterm outlook accordingly we determined that the goodwill was partially impaired and resulted in the writedown secondly we incurred an aggregate of  million of pretax nonrecurring charges related to the commercial settlement in utility support structures segment that mogens previously discussed and receivable provision related to a customer in the irrigation segment let me add some color on the bad debt provision on the irrigation receivable this receivable is due from a large customer in china with whom we have done tens of millions of dollars of business over the years and weve always been paid promptly however on the most recent contract with this customer we received a number of progress payments but the receivable is past due and we made a partial bad debt provision a couple years ago in  the customers economic condition deteriorated further and progress payments were stopped accordingly we determined that a  million provision to fully reserve against the receivable was warranted despite provisions we have and will continue to pursue the payment for the amounts owed us lastly  million of restructuring charges were incurred in the fourth quarter largely completing the charges related to the plan announced in april of  of the charges  million was in cash and is related to severance expenses for workforce reduction and the remainder being noncash impairment charges of fixed assets to recap our restructuring charges in april  we announced a plan of up to  million our actual charges totaled  million including  million of restructuring and  million of intangible asset impairments almost all the difference between the planned and actual amounts is the goodwill impairment of the access systems business which was not part of the initial restructuring effort with respect to our international operations we continue to see negative effects on our quarterly comparisons associated with the stronger us dollar the effect on sales and operating income in the fourth quarter was approximately  million and  million respectively the mostsignificant currency movements affecting us in the quarter were the euro the australian dollar and the brazilian real aside from the impairments restructuring and other nonrecurring charges operating income was  million down  from last year and  of sales the decrease in operating income was mainly related to sales decreases gross profit margins from operations were comparable with  due to lower raw material costs that helped offset lower sales pricing operational performance also mitigated the effects of lower volumes on gross profit on income taxes we realized tax expense despite a reported loss before taxes this unusual relationship was caused by two main factors first the goodwill impairments mentioned above are not taxdeductible and two the uk lowered their corporate tax rate from  to  accordingly we revalued our net deferred tax assets using the  rate resulting at about  million of deferred tax expense offsetting these factors were a number of smaller items that favorably affected our tax rate such as rd credits and tax contingency expirations so on a normalized basis our tax rate for the quarter would have approximated  operating cash flows for the quarter were strong at nearly  million and capital spending was approximately  million for the year operating cash flows were  million reflecting our ability to remove working capital from the business as a result of lower revenues capital spending for the year was  million and we expect capital spending to be around  million for  and the  capital spending plan includes a galvanizing facility were in the process of building at our pole manufacturing site in texas regarding other capital deployment activities we acquired american galvanizing this quarter for approximately  million and repurchased  million of our shares under the current reauthorization we have  million remaining under this authorization which does not have an expiration date funding for future purchases of shares will be dependent on available free cash flows despite a difficult year our balance sheet remains strong with appropriate leverage for the cyclical nature of our businesses while providing room to pursue investments and growth of our core businesses through internal investments and new products or market development or acquisitions cash at the end of the quarter was  million the majority of which is outside the united states we have no borrowings under our  million revolving credit agreement at the end of the quarter we remain fully committed to maintaining investmentgrade credit rating our cash priorities remain to first support our current businesses through working capital and capital spending as needed two to acquire companies that strengthen or are closely adjacent to our existing businesses three pay dividends at  of net earnings over time and four repurchase shares i will now turn the call back over to mogens mogens c bay  chairman  chief executive officer thank you mark  was surely a transformational year for valmont as we completed our planned restructuring efforts to strengthen our position amid ongoing endmarket softness as we look ahead we cannot short term count on an improvement in the global economic environment to support our results restructuring benefits and a focus on operational improvement however should position us well to deliver improved performance in  we are issuing annual guidance with an outlook calling for earnings improvement of approximately  to  from s adjusting earnings of  additional expectations in forming our current outlook include stable input costs and foreign exchange rates we expect the first quarter results to be about flat with last year and positive comparisons for the following three quarters and with that id like to turn it over to the operator and take your questions questionandanswer session operator your first question comes from the line of julian mitchell julian mitchell  credit suisse securities usa llc broker hi thank you mogens c bay  chairman  chief executive officer hi julian julian mitchell  credit suisse securities usa llc broker hi hello just my first question is around the operating profit guidance for  so youre guiding overall for eps growth with muted sales could you give any color as to the operating margin expansion thats within your guidance this year and also whether theres any ebit benefit from mix or input costs in  or if the ebit improvement is all driven by the incremental cost savings of  million mogens c bay  chairman  chief executive officer the income improvement is driven by one the  million remaining of the projected benefits of  million where  million was already achieved in  and of improved productivity and result of our focus on operational excellence and as i pointed out a good portion of that improvement we expect to see in utility business were reverting to doubledigit operating income for this year julian mitchell  credit suisse securities usa llc broker thank you very much and then my second question is just around pricing conditions not so much input costs but what are you seeing in terms of customer pressure or competitive pressure on pricing particularly in the irrigation segment and utility support structures mogens c bay  chairman  chief executive officer okay in the irrigation segment as you can see the quality of earnings have been good which means our irrigation business has done a good job of managing productivity and pricing now as ive said before you always have a concern if a market continues to weaken the pricing can become more of an issue i think what weve seen in the marketplace we may have seen some price reduction but they have if you will been funded by lower input costs particularly steel so i would say so far so good but as i pointed out before it is an issue that in the past we have seen more pricing pressure in a down market that we are seeing right now when we go to the utility side you will remember that earlier this year we made a conscious decision to increase our pricing in the bid market as a result of that our hit rate dropped quite a bit but over the next several quarters weve seen our hit rate increase which is a good indication that were getting traction at higher pricing and the market may also be paying attention to that so whereas it was maybe a difficult decision to make up at the time we didnt feel we had any option but to make it and currently i would say we are getting the business were planning to get at better margins than we saw  months ago operator our next question comes from craig bibb craig bibb  cjs securities inc hi in the uss segment what was the steelonly impact on revenue mogens c bay  chairman  chief executive officer could you repeat the question you were not clear when you started asking it craig bibb  cjs securities inc at uss the decline in revenues that was attributable just to steel was approximately mogens c bay  chairman  chief executive officer what i would say in general you would say that steel cost is about  of sales price and over the year steel has dropped about  now obviously theres an average in there somewhere between the zero and  but it has been a significant effect on revenue in utility craig bibb  cjs securities inc okay so about  in that ballpark mogens c bay  chairman  chief executive officer that would probably be high i would say itd be a little less than that operator our next question comes from brian drab brian p drab  william blair  co llc hi good morning i was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about that settlement with the large customer what kind of inspections – or what can you tell us about what kind of inspections will take place and where will they take place and can you talk a little bit more about what prompted the inspections thanks mogens c bay  chairman  chief executive officer well we have an agreement with a customer that we dont provide too much detail on it but inspection is basically inspection of the line making sure that everything is aokay and we have agreed to do that over a year period as i said our engineers and our manufacturing people are positive that there is no issue but when you have a customer that may have a concern and its a customer that is of the size that i mentioned that they have combined the owners of the joint venture and the joint venture have given us business for about  billion over the next number of years you do whats right to retain the customer relationship brian p drab  william blair  co llc understood thanks and could i talk a little bit about the utility market and what are you seeing in terms of pricing capacity utilization since the end of the third quarter and can you give us a little bit more confidence around that  basis point improvement is that going to come mainly from restructuring or is that marketdriven as well mogens c bay  chairman  chief executive officer well i think – lets start with the last part of your question wheres that  basis points coming from theyre coming partly from the restructuring partly from productivity improvement and partly from being able to increase our price in the bid market as i talked about our hit rates are up at higher pricing so in general id say that i would still say that the utility industry that we participate in in north america still has a very aggressive pricing environment but we have seen in some instances lead times moving out which would indicate that capacity utilization is going up operator our next question comes from nathan jones nathan jones  stifel nicolaus  co inc good morning everyone mogens c bay  chairman  chief executive officer good morning nathan nathan jones  stifel nicolaus  co inc mogens if i could start on irrigation segment we have heard recently that valmont may have begun to cut pricing a little bit more you were talking about a minute ago about passing on lower steel costs is this something youre doing just passing on lower steel costs to your customers are you getting a little bit more aggressive on going after some share in this environment or whats going on with valmonts pricing in the irrigation market at the moment mogens c bay  chairman  chief executive officer well since we are the largest player in the market if we start a pricing war the competitors have no option but to follow we dont do that and i think ive also said in the past that we dont believe that market shares in north america move significantly at all you can have a competitor that may short term decide to buy some market share but it reverts to where it was so therefore trying to gain market share because you can is usually – its not a very good use of your financial capabilities and it will hurt your earnings over time so we are not out trying to lower price in the irrigation business now you can have project business somewhere in the world or project business in north america that gets more competitive because of the volume involved but thats no different than we see year in and year out so theres no strategy or initiative on our part to lower price in the irrigation business because it never works nathan jones  stifel nicolaus  co inc thats very helpful if i could just get one in on the guidance im having a little bit of trouble getting to your up  to  on earnings youve got  million –  million from restructuring some of thats in utility so maybe theres another  million coming out of productivity and pricing utility irrigation looks like its got to be down  million to  million i think maybe the big wildcard here is the energy and mining segment you were pretty much breakeven in the fourth quarter but by the looks of the income in the other segment for the remaining quarters in the year profitability in that segment had been declining as the year went on theres no real i think idea that youre going to see a rebound in  in that market so youre maybe down  million there ess flat maybe coatings flat outside of that gets me to maybe youre up midsingle digits on the earnings side what is it thats going into your guidance here that gets you to that  to  earnings growth mogens c bay  chairman  chief executive officer well first of all we probably surely have more insights into what we expect in these business unit than you would have on the outside and i would say that its simply going through business unit by business unit effect of the restructuring effect of the productivity improvements effect on supply chain efficiencies effect of a whole bunch of activities we have taken to lower our costs it is not dependent on a better market position i would say – i would agree with you that energy if anything may be weaker this year than it was last year because it didnt start out as weak as it ended up the irrigation business we expect some downturn in revenue but we expect to hold on to quality of earnings in the utility business it is – as i have said before that is driven by both restructuring and productivity improvements and better pricing in the bid market as it relates to the business that we are taking and in the coatings businesses i think that in australia we have probably bottomed out in what we see there and we will continue – we expect to see some improvement in north america when it comes to the pole businesses it is kind of eking out improvements in a difficult market everywhere as i said in the either press release or in the talker north american commercial lighting sales improved last year and we expect to continue to see some improvement in that part of the business as the year progresses we may see some benefit from the highway bill and so its a combination of a whole bunch of inputs that gives us confidence in giving the guidance of  to  with a proviso that it is – that markets remain not buoyant that currency exchange rates dont change a lot and then were going to see some benefit not a lot from having fewer shares outstanding on average in  compared to  so we are okay with the guidance operator our next question comes from kevin bennett kevin bennett  sterne agee hey there good morning guys mogens c bay  chairman  chief executive officer morning kevin bennett  sterne agee mogens i wanted to follow up on your answer and dig in a little bit more on the commercial lighting market in the us i know theres a lot of fears out there that nonres is kind of rolling over so was wondering if you could comment on that and maybe put some numbers around what you saw last year and what you may expect going forward mogens c bay  chairman  chief executive officer well you know we participate in the commercial side of business and in the more highway funded business and the highway funded business which is federal and state funded has continued pretty depressed maybe some states have managed to do more of the financing of projects by themselves but we have seen an improvement this last year in sales to our commercial customers and going into this year we are not picking up any indication that there will be a pullback in that part of business so these are not big changes but our overall guidance is made up of a whole bunch of small changes but the one bright spot in the whole business in north america has been the commercial side of lighting kevin bennett  sterne agee got it okay and then my one quick followup im wondering if there is – you just did this  million restructuring im wondering if theres potential for more in  or if youve kind of cut most of what you can cut without interrupting the business mogens c bay  chairman  chief executive officer i would say that were not expecting another restructuring plan in  does that mean that were not continuing to find ways to cut costs no examples would be that we are currently going through a major valuation of consolidating backoffice activities among our plants in australia not only within segments but also across segments in other words centralized accounting receivable management payables treasury functions hr functions et cetera et cetera these we would not consider restructuring but it will be part of an ongoing effort to drive our cost to improve profitability operator our next question comes from dave rose david l rose  wedbush securities inc good morning mogens c bay  chairman  chief executive officer hey david david l rose  wedbush securities inc just maybe a followup on the utility support structure business and in the past its been a little bit difficult to forecast small versus large shipments and maybe you can provide us a little bit more color on your visibility in terms of the size of the projects what youre seeing in and the visibility you have in the near term next six months versus the next  months mogens c bay  chairman  chief executive officer i would say in general and i think we mentioned before the market has changed from larger projects to a whole bunch of smaller projects if you go back a few years the large project would be  million and up today a large project is  million and up so we have many many more smaller projects that we are getting thats just a couple or a few million dollars it does put pressure on drafting and engineering and scheduling but we have pretty good visibility i would say over the first two quarters of this year and i would say its no secret that a couple of years ago we were not very good at forecasting what was going to happen in the utility business but i would say that currently over the last number of months utility has delivered what they said they were going to deliver so they have become much much better in forecasting and thats what gives us the confidence that were going to see  basis points improvement in their profitability this year a lot of it really came from making the decision to raise prices in the bid market and walk away from business at levels that we didnt think were sustainable for us and as i mentioned our hit rate dropped quite a bit when we first started that process but it has been improving ever since so were glad we did it and were seeing some of the benefits from it but we dont have the visibility that we had several years ago with very large projects that span several years that doesnt mean they wont be there but currently the way of life of this business is much smaller projects and many more of them david l rose  wedbush securities inc okay thats helpful and then maybe lastly on the irrigation side there are some comments from some of the precision irrigation providers some of the technologies that are being provided in terms of precision ag have you seen an increase in demand for that business such as agsense  mogens c bay  chairman  chief executive officer yes agsense continue to grow technology is becoming a more and more important part of the irrigation business and we will spend more time on that at the investor day in new york a week from today operator our next question comes from jon braatz jon braatz  kansas city capital associates good morning mogens mogens c bay  chairman  chief executive officer hi jon jon braatz  kansas city capital associates youve taken some impairment charges over the last couple of quarters and i guess my question is given the acquisitions that you made and the impairment charges are you refocusing reprioritizing rethinking your acquisition strategy looking at things a little bit differently in different markets that might not be as cyclical any comments on that on your acquisition strategy mogens c bay  chairman  chief executive officer well yeah in general that would be great i mean if we had anticipated the collapse in both mining activities and energy prices we may have made a different decision then the good news though when we look at those business and let me take webforge as an example a lot of their business went into those two industries but the products they made and the capabilities they have are equally useful in general industrial plants and other industries outside mining and energy so we just have to refocus where we go after business the same in valmont sm they are energyrelated business you know in the energy business right now its not like the energy companies around the world dropped their capital spending by  or  they basically put a stop on it for a while and were seeing the impact on that but yet on the large structures for wind turbines we have seen an uptick in northern europe in that business and we have found opportunities outside our traditional markets to look for new opportunities a good example of that is the i think its about  million utility order that valmont sm got in germany for delivery this year that they would not have gotten one if they werent part of valmont and two it was a way for them to leverage manufacturing and project management and engineering capabilities outside their traditional businesses so well just have to continue to double down on our efforts there when it comes to acquisitions in general our focus will continue to not be on creating eps accretion but to beat our cost of capital and we will be disciplined in that sense the closer we are to the core markets that we know very well the closer we are to the geographies we know very well the less risk we see in those acquisitions so as ive said before people often ask me well do you have a goal on how much your international business should be as compared to the north american business and the answer is no the more opportunities we can find in north america in the market we know is the best the more were going to go after it and we may think and we do have very very limited growth in this country but when you travel the world were the envy of the rest of the world so opportunities in this country i think will continue to present themselves jon braatz  kansas city capital associates okay all right thank you mogens operator we have a followup question from craig bibb craig bibb  cjs securities inc hi sorry can you hear me this time mogens c bay  chairman  chief executive officer yeah i hear you loud and clear craig bibb  cjs securities inc all right so just back to uss so if you take out steel it looks like the uss backlog was actually up in tons is that correct mogens c bay  chairman  chief executive officer well we have said that actually the tonnage going through our plants in  compared to  was down only slightly and i cant give you a specific answer as to whether tonnage is up in the backlog but obviously if steel costs have stayed the same you would have seen a different number in the backlog so i would not dispute that it could be that volume in the backlog is actually up but i cant give you a definitive answer craig bibb  cjs securities inc okay and then also on uss looks like theres a large number of the hvdc projects that are getting closer to actually happening do you guys have – do you have visibility into  on some of these really large projects mogens c bay  chairman  chief executive officer well we do have – when we get our business reviews from utility they are talking about projects where they see activities both into  and  but the order flow has mainly been smaller projects operator our next question comes from brent thielman brent edward thielman  d a davidson  co yeah good morning mogens c bay  chairman  chief executive officer hi brent operator brent your line is open brent edward thielman  d a davidson  co yeah hey mark do you have what the overall impact of lower steel prices was on valmont overall for the quarter in terms of revenue mark c jaksich  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah what i would say brent is that really on the whole the impact of lower steel prices if you match that up with effects on sales pricing and mix and things like that was relatively benign i would say on the whole and i think as mogens mentioned in some cases there has been like in irrigation whatever pricing actions have been taken have been to some degree giving back to the market some of the lower prices so i dont think it had a large impact in and of itself on the gross profit brent edward thielman  d a davidson  co got it okay and then on the energy and mining segment obviously the business is going to probably continue to be tough but what sort of margins are you targeting over the next  months and what can we kind of think about for normalized margin for that business mogens c bay  chairman  chief executive officer thats a tough one to answer because the speed with which oil dropped and the speed with which energy companies curtailed their capital spending will translate into more competition im sure and therefore more pressure on driving down cost we expect our energy and mining business profitability in  to be about even with  in a tougher environment operator our next question – we have a followup question from nathan jones nathan jones  stifel nicolaus  co inc hi again guys just thinking again about the uss business i recall in early  the canary in the coal mine for some of the downturn in that business was a real compression in the lead times from book to ship i think you had  days of backlog that compressed down to  days of backlog or something like that can you talk about how that lead time on the backlog is now versus  months ago how thats progressing mogens c bay  chairman  chief executive officer without knowing exact information on our competitors backlog and lead times the impression we get in the marketplace is that lead times have been moving out which would be an indication that the combination of taking out capacity that most of the players have accomplished and the market staying pretty flat has driven up capacity utilization so lead times moving out is a good indicator that the pricing environment should not get tougher nathan jones  stifel nicolaus  co inc yeah agreed that is a nice positive sign and mark are you planning to give us some pro forma information on the quarters under the new segment reporting structure mark c jaksich  chief financial officer  executive vice president yes nathan we will as we get into the qs for  all of the  numbers will be recast for comparability was that your question operator our final question comes from brian drab brian p drab  william blair  co llc hi just wanted to ask a followup on the eps guidance and mogens you made a comment that made it sounds like that gain from share repurchase would be only modest in  given the authorization you have outstanding if i just run some numbers by you quickly if you repurchase or reduce the share count by not even  million shares lets call it  or  million shares that could get you  in  and thatd be a full third of your expectation for eps improvement in  is that kind of in the ballpark of what you might do or can you give us any thoughts mogens c bay  chairman  chief executive officer i dont think we are planning on that kind of a plus from share repurchase i think were more planning on maybe    depending on how the year progresses depending on what kind of opportunities may we have to apply capital elsewhere the share repurchase program can accelerate or decelerate we dont have an end date this is an open repurchase authorization so i think as mark has pointed out several times were not going out to borrow money to buy back stock so a lot has to do with competing uses of our capital and our ability to continue to generate good cash flows and we will shed more light on our goals around cash flow generation a week from today when we see you in new york brian p drab  william blair  co llc okay and then if i could just quickly the irrigation backlog was up nicely yearoveryear i know thats not that meaningful and doesnt extend out even a full quarter but just a curiosity up from  million to  million mogens c bay  chairman  chief executive officer the increase in backlog is totally international increase in backlog and international increase in backlog has to do with projects and it comes with lots of challenges on letter of  credits and so on and so forth so i wouldnt put much weight on the increased backlog as it relates to the kind of revenue we may get if the increased backlog had been all in north america i would look at it differently but thats not the case operator and there are no more questions at this time i hand the call back over to you presenters jeffrey s laudin  manager investor relations thank you kayla this concludes our
