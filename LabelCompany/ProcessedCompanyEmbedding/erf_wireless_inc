frequently asked questions question why is erf wireless still acquiring wireless broadband businesses in addition to building its own wireless networks answer although erf wireless is continuing to construct a portion of its existing footprint in selected regions in many cases it’s more economical and timeefficient to acquire large blocks of wireless broadband coverage than to construct a similar footprint in addition the acquisitions eliminate potential competitors in the geographical areas where they are acquired ​ question where will erf wireless find wireless broadband companies to acquire answer erf wireless continues to compile a database of wireless broadband companies and their demographics that are strategic to the erf wireless strategic plan of providing “critical communications infrastructure communications” services to the enterprise rural broadband vertical market sector of north america this database continues to be refined and is the basis for selecting specific acquisition targets ​ question why would a potential acquisition target have an interest in selling its company to erf wireless answer most wireless broadband networks are privately funded and have a few hundred or at most a few thousand customers most of these companies have not grown to the size where the economies of scale are possible for all of their overhead functions and therefore still require some cash infusion by their investors these investors are locked into their investment and have no nearterm path to liquidity without selling to erf wireless or someone doing a similar rollup by combining a number of these networks and utilizing the network infrastructure to serve a number of vertical market enterprise customers in the same area erf wireless can reach the economies of scale that produce positive cash flow and profitability in this case one plus one can actually equal three ​ question since erf wireless has its corporate headquarters located near

wireless and offer excellent acquisition opportunities as of january  erf wireless has acquired sixteen companies and now has the largest terrestrial broadband wireless network covering oil and gas territories in north america ​ question what wireless broadband technology does erf wireless primarily utilize in its national wireless broadband footprint answer erf wireless utilizes a combination

institutions healthcare facilities educational institutions as well as almost  wireless commercial and residential customers throughout texas new mexico arkansas oklahoma colorado wyoming north dakota and louisiana these recurringrevenue customers provide much of the operating overhead cash flow needed by erf wireless additional operational and growth cash needs are also provided by private investment from various individuals institutional investors and other entities ​ question will erf wireless do an ipo in the future answer erf wireless cannot do an ipo in the future since it is already a fully reporting public company however erf wireless does plan to move from trading on the nasdaq bulletin board exchange to a larger national exchange such as the nasdaq small cap exchange or the american stock exchange as soon as it achieves all of the listing requirements ​ question does erf wireless utilize public or private financing to fund its acquisition and growth campaigns answer erf wireless is utilizing public financing in addition erf wireless is receiving private financing from highnetworth individuals who recognize the potential from an investment in erf wireless
