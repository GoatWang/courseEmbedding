system is in the midst of a significant transition some of the changes to our payment system involving its efficiency the risks inherent in the payment process and the role of the private and public sectors in the payment mechanism are the subject of considerable debate and controversy in recent years the federal reserve bank of richmond has played an active part in the development and implementation of policies to improve the payment process the banks operations staff has represented the federal reserve system in work with the banking industry to help shape and implement programs to increase efficiency and reduce payment risk further our research department has made payment system research an important part of its agenda the mix of practical experience and research has resulted in a unique perspective on payment system issues that led us to organize a symposium on the us payment system held on may   in williamsburg virginia reflecting our belief in the importance of combining both practical experience and theory in addressing payment issues we invited practi tioners scholars and policymakers to share their ideas the symposium provided an opportunity for those

worldcat member libraries worldwide october  the cost of providing payment services is substantial  percent of gdp cost reduction requires the appropriate pricing of those services a modern payment system is essential for promoting domestic and international trade and exchange as well as developing financial markets payment users will be directed toward the most efficient payment methods when the costs of producing those services are reflected in the prices paid resources are being wasted in the united states because consumers see no important difference in transaction prices or bank costs between using a check or using electronic direct debit in paying a bill even though the social costs of these two instruments are different electronic payments cost only a third to half as much as paperbased payments an estimated  billion or  percent of gdp is being lost by the continued use of paperbased checks when payment instruments are not appropriately priced the costs must be covered elsewhere one common solution is to let loan revenues cover part of payment expenses keeping loan rates higher to compensate when prices reflect the full cost of producing the service users demand the services that use the fewest real resources humphrey keppler and montesnegret give examples of payment prices and price schedules and show how underlying cost data are used to build up to a price they outline how payment services may best be structured to  appropriately reflect economies of scale or scope in the production of payment services  adjust cost recovery percentages to accommodate how much demand conditions associated with startup differ from those associated with mature operation during a new systems early years of operation the transaction volume may be low and some form of underrecovery of costs may be required to encourage use of the system but any such underrecovery must be built into future pricing arrangements once the systems are established and traffic volumes are at a level where full cost recovery is practical to ensure fairness the pricing structure must also guarantee that latecomers to the system do not get more favorable treatment than the initial user group  induce efficient use of scarce resources they note the economic principles that recommend certain pricing methods over others and apply equally to payment services provided by the private sector or through a government agency they show why costs should be recovered through user transaction fees this paper product of the financial sector development department part of a larger effort in
