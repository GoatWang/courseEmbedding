and large companies throughout the united states although we can give no assurance that our business will be able to compete against other companies with greater resources we believe we have a competitive advantage with our software application we plan on developing our mobile website technology in north america we believe this will give us the ability to compete with these other companies because we can provide vendors with almost instant mobile advertising campaigns due to our mobile integrated high bandwith technology company description we currently own intellectual property to utilize market further develop and sell in north america a software application called “mima” to entrepreneurs and small businesses whereas any merchant can easily create a webwap ecommerce website or cell phone client and enterprise mobile management information system by themselves merchants will not have to rent network hardware operation system entrust software development and recruit professional management instead we can offer the required network infrastructure and software and hardware platform for the merchant with a low monthly fee mima was created and developed by our director mu chun lin over the course of ten years our licensee zhengzhou xiangtian information technology company limited was established by our director mu chun lin in december  since inception the company has been concentrated on the research and development of software and hardware in the mobile internet industry and has achieved many technology achievements in the application field of big data over the five years the company has built an efficient project team integrated mobile internet technology and selfdeveloped mobile internet application platform developing several products types and conducts users’ test china’s central government is giving supporting policy to “internet plus” industries which will allow zxitc to develop their products to provide mobile internet communication application system to users for the rapid development of mobile internet application in china in  zxitc had the advantage to work with china’s internet network information center cnnic the issuer of internet content provider icp of all the websites hosted in china on mobile url general url and trusted url to integrate with their mobile internet cloud application system  the joint development will expedite the construction of cnnic public supporting service system with  of the original cost subsequently the company began to develop a website which allow their users to create and manage their own mobile application with minimal technical knowledge the website developed exclusively for the chinese market is named “moyun” currently moyun internet mobile application mima cloud platform is the most comprehensive cloud infrastructure in the china’s corporate mobile application systems since the free public test inception at january  mima has been one of the chinese leading crossplatform mobile application developing tools we believe that the market in north america is ripe for such an application notwithstanding that we will have to make definitive changes to utilize and maximize the mobile application system in north america zxitc is the first company to utilize a “drag and drop” design interface for the mobile application development in order to provide a user friendly interface

statements that involve risks uncertainties and assumptions where possible we have tried to identify these forward looking statements by using words such as anticipate believe intends or similar expressions our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by the forwardlooking statements due to important factors and risks including but not limited to those set forth under risk factors as described in in part i item a of this report our cash balance is  as of july   our cash balance is not sufficient to fund our limited levels of operations for any period of time we have been utilizing and may utilize funds from mu chun lin our president chief executive officer and director who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for offering costs filing fees and professional fees mu chun lin however has no formal commitment arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company in order to implement our plan of operations for the next twelvemonth period we require a minimum of  of funding therefore we have filed an s registration on september   being a startup stage company we have a very limited operating history after a twelvemonth period we may need additional financing but currently do not have any arrangements for such financing long term financing beyond the maximum aggregate amount of this offering will be required to fully implement our business plan the exact amount of funding will depend on funding required for full implementation of our business plan our expansion may include expanding our office facilities hiring sales personnel and developing a customer base if we do not receive any proceeds from the offering or the minimum amount of  that we require to operate for the next  months mu chun lin has informally agreed to advance us funds however he has no formal commitment arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company if we need additional cash and cannot raise it we will either have to suspend operations until we do raise the cash we need or cease operations entirely even if we raise  from this offering it will most likely only last one year we may need more

liquidity decreasing industry overview this form k includes market and industry data that we have developed from publicly available information various industry publications and other published industry sources and our internal data and estimates although we believe the publications and reports are reliable we have not independently verified the data our internal data estimates and forecasts are based upon information obtained from trade and business organizations and other contacts in the market in which we operate and our managements understanding of industry conditions as of the date of the preparation of this prospectus these and other independent government and trade publications cited herein are publicly available on the internet without charge upon request the company will also provide copies of such sources cited herein the mobile marketing industry overview management contends that some perceive mobile advertising as closely related to online or internet advertising though we believe its reach is far greater  currently most mobile advertising is targeted at mobile phones that came estimably to a global total of  billion as of  source it is probable in our managements opinion that advertisers and media industry will increasingly take account of a bigger and fastgrowing mobile market though it remains at around  of global advertising spending and is estimated to increase to  by  sourcestatisacom mobile media is evolving rapidly and while we believe mobile phones will continue to be the mainstay it is not clear whether mobile phones based on cellular backhaul or smart phones based on wifi hot spot or wimax hot zone will also strengthen however as an illustration of the emergence of this form of advertising that there is now a dedicated global advertising awards ceremony organized every year by vision gain  a business information portal in information provided by the research firm berg insight as mobile phones out number television sets by over  to  and pc based internet users by over  to  and the total laptop and desktop pc population by nearly  to  advertisers in many markets we contend have recently rushed to this media in spain  of mobile phone owners receive ads in france  and in japan more remarkably as mobile advertising matures like in the most advanced markets the user involvement also matures in japan today already  of mobile phone owners click on ads they receive on their phones mobile advertising was worth  million dollars in japan alone according to the research firm berg insight the global mobile advertising market that was estimated to   billion in  furthermore berg insight forecasts the global mobile advertising market to grow at a compound annual growth rate of  percent to   billion in  in the q  state of mobile advertising report by opera mediaworks it is reported that mobile advertising is growing globally at a rapid rate opera mediaworks reports that rich media ads are now averaging a  percentage click rate among users app large banner ads are still the most popular but they are on the decline in china a study by iresearch finds no indication of a slowdown in mobile growth as mobile devices become more popular and eretailers invest in making mobile sites easier to use chinese consumers spent  billion yuan  billion on shopping from their smartphones and tablets in  up  from  billion yuan  billion in  according to chinese research firm iresearch that is a significant leap in one year for mobile shopping given that online shopping grew only  to  trillion yuan  billion in china in  according to iresearch a beijingbased firm that tracks ecommerce iresearch attributes the uptick in mobile shopping mainly to the growing popularity of mobile devices and leading eretailers investments in better serving mobile shoppers mobile commerce seems likely to keep growing iresearch forecasts mobile shopping will grow more than fourfold to  trillion yuan   billion in sales in  purchases on mobile devices accounted for  of online sales in china in  compared with  in the prior year according to iresearch the chinese research company also predicts that mobile sales will surpass sales on personal computers in  and reach  of online sales in  using a mobile phone to browse the internet in china has considerably taken off towards the end of  with an ever increasing amount of the public deciding to choose their mobile phones to browse the internet rather than traditionally sitting in front of a desktop the mobile internet now is the biggest new growth engine for ecommerce in china online shopping is booming because of its convenience and cost effectiveness and its not only young affluent urban dwellers who are purchasing luxury items online at cheaper prices than shopping malls rather residents in less developed regions are buying products that are not available in their home towns as noted in the wall street journal on august   some interesting statistics according to chinas internet network information center cnnic the issuer of internet content provider icp of all the websites hosted in china on mobile url general url and trusted url to integrate with their mobile internet cloud application system at the end of  there were  million internet users in china which calculates as  of the total population out of  million internet users  million decides to use their mobile to surf the internet which accounts for  of the total internet browsing population the level of mobile browsing in china has become significantly higher than in the west the stats indicate the significance of mobile internet browsing in china therefore in order for a company to have a significant brand image standing in the competitive chinese market a well designed mobile website is what a company should be looking to build about threequarters of chinese in firsttier cities such as beijing shanghai guangzhou and chongqing are already online but in rural areas its  percent according to a survey by mckinsey digital of hong kong which helps companies shape their digital strategies even so rural chinese have an affinity for ecommerce close to twothirds of rural chinese who do use the internet say they have purchased items online that compares with  percent of users in the cities types of mobile ads in some markets this type of advertising is most commonly seen as a mobile web banner top of page or mobile web poster bottom of page banner while in others it is dominated by sms advertising other forms include mms advertising advertising within mobile games and mobile videos during mobile tv receipt fullscreen interstitials which appear while a requested item of mobile content or mobile web page is loading up and audio advertisements that can take the form of a jingle before a voicemail recording or an audio recording played while interacting with a telephonebased service such as movie ticketing or directory assistance the mobile marketing association and the iab interactive advertising bureau has published mobile advertising guidelines but we contend that it is difficult to keep such guidelines current in such a fastdeveloping area the effectiveness of a mobile media ad campaign in our estimation can be measured in a variety of ways the main measurements are impressions views and clickthrough rates they are also sold to advertisers by views cost per impression or by clickthrough cost per click additional measurements include conversion rates such as clicktocall rates and other degrees of interactive measurement mobile media can run on a mobile web page or within a mobile application often referred to as inapp one of the popular models in mobile advertising in our estimation is cost per install cpi where there the pricing model is based on the user installing an app on their mobile phone cpi mobile advertising networks work either as incent or nonincent in the incent model the user is given virtual points or rewards to install the game or app mobile rich media in addition to standard mobile display banners our management has observed a growing trend to include rich media execution within the banner ads this includes banners that would expand to a larger size offering advertisers a larger display to communicate their message games within the banner to make the experience more interactive or a video within the banner space there are limitations to rich media on mobile because all of the coding must be done in html since the ios does not support flash competitive advantage customer website creation website creation is a competitively open market focus on design level the degree of grasping customers requirements and service ability we have significant competitive advantages among other providers whereas our website system mainly includes wapweb and saas future development and plans as part of our development plan to face the ever challenging mobile bc software

estimates and assumptions and apply judgments we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience current trends and other factors that management believes to be important at the time the

assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain and that are of critical importance in the presentation of our financial position results of operations and cash flows on a regular basis we review our accounting policies and how they are applied and disclosed in our financial statements use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements estimates are based on historical experience management expectations for future performance and other assumptions as appropriate key areas affected by estimates include the assessment of the recoverability of longlived assets which is based on such factors as estimated future cash flows we reevaluate estimates on an ongoing basis therefore actual results may vary from those estimates fair values of financial instruments the carrying values of cash accounts receivable accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate the fair values of these instruments due to their shortterm nature the carrying amount for borrowings

financial data   not applicable because the company is a smaller reporting company   item  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations   the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto for the fiscal year ended july   found in this report in addition to historical information the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks uncertainties and assumptions where possible we have tried to identify these forward looking statements by using words such as “anticipate” “believe” “intends” or similar expressions our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by the forwardlooking statements due to important factors and risks including but not limited to those set forth under “risk factors” as described in in part i item a of this report   our cash balance is  as of july   our cash balance is not sufficient to fund our limited levels of operations for any period of time we have been utilizing and may utilize funds from mu chun lin our president chief executive officer and director who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for offering costs filing fees and professional fees mu chun lin however has no formal commitment arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company in order to implement our plan of operations for the next twelvemonth period we require a minimum of  of funding therefore we have filed an s registration on september   being a startup stage company we have a very limited operating history after a twelvemonth period we may need additional financing but currently do not have any arrangements for such financing   long term financing beyond the maximum aggregate amount of this offering will be required to fully implement our business plan the exact amount of funding will depend on funding required for full implementation of our business plan our expansion may include expanding our office facilities hiring sales personnel and developing a customer base   if we do not receive any proceeds from the offering or the minimum amount of  that we require to operate for the next  months mu chun lin has informally agreed to advance us funds however he has no formal commitment arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company   if we need additional cash and cannot raise it we will either have to suspend operations until we do raise the cash we need or cease operations entirely even if we raise  from this offering it will most likely only last one year we may need more funds for business operations in the next year and we will have to revert to obtaining additional money     company overview     corporate history   china soar information technology inc a delaware corporation “the company” fka go public ii inc was incorporated under the laws of the state of

industry overview   this form k includes market and industry data that we have developed from publicly available information various industry publications and other published industry sources and our internal data and estimates although we believe the publications and reports are reliable we have not independently verified the data our internal data estimates and forecasts are based upon information obtained from trade and business organizations and other contacts in the market in which we operate and our management’s understanding of industry conditions   as of the date of the preparation of this prospectus these and other independent government and trade publications cited herein are publicly available on the internet without charge upon request the company will also provide copies of such sources cited herein     the mobile marketing industry     overview management contends that some perceive mobile advertising as closely related to online or internet advertising though we believe its reach is far greater  currently most mobile advertising is targeted at mobile phones that came estimably to a global total of  billion as of  source mobithinkingcom notably computers including desktops and laptops are currently estimated at approximately  billion globally source askcom it is probable in our management’s opinion that advertisers and media industry will increasingly take account of a bigger and fastgrowing mobile market though it remains at around  of global advertising spending and is estimated to increase to  by   source statisacom  mobile media is evolving rapidly and while we believe mobile phones will continue to be the mainstay it is not clear whether mobile phones based on cellular backhaul or smart phones based on wifi hot spot or wimax hot zone will also strengthen however as an illustration of the emergence of this form of advertising that there is now a dedicated global advertising awards ceremony organized every year by vision gain  a business information portal in information provided by the research firm berg insight as mobile phones out number television sets by over  to  and pc based internet users by over  to  and the total laptop and desktop pc population by nearly  to  advertisers in many markets we contend have recently rushed to this media in spain  of mobile phone owners receive ads in france  and in japan more remarkably as mobile advertising matures like in the most advanced markets the user involvement also matures in japan today already  of mobile phone owners click on ads they receive on their phones mobile advertising was worth  million dollars in japan alone according to the research firm berg insight the global mobile advertising market that was estimated to €  billion in  furthermore berg insight forecasts the global mobile advertising market to grow at a compound annual growth rate of  percent to €  billion in  in the q  state of mobile advertising report by opera mediaworks it is reported that mobile advertising is growing globally at a rapid rate opera mediaworks reports that rich media ads are now averaging a  percentage click rate among users app large banner ads are still the most popular but they are on the decline in china a study by iresearch finds no indication of a slowdown in mobile growth as mobile devices become more popular and eretailers invest in making mobile sites easier to use chinese consumers spent  billion yuan  billion on shopping from their smartphones and tablets in  up  from  billion yuan  billion in  according to chinese research firm iresearch that is a significant leap in one year for mobile shopping given that online shopping grew only  to  trillion yuan  billion in china in  according to iresearch a beijingbased firm that tracks ecommerce iresearch attributes the uptick in mobile shopping mainly to the growing popularity of mobile devices and leading eretailers’ investments in better serving mobile shoppers mobile commerce seems likely to keep growing iresearch forecasts mobile shopping will grow more than fourfold to  trillion yuan   billion in sales in  purchases on mobile devices accounted for  of online sales in china in  compared with  in the prior year according to iresearch the chinese research company also predicts that mobile sales will surpass sales on personal computers in  and reach  of online sales in  using a mobile phone to browse the internet in china has considerably taken off towards the end of  with an ever increasing amount of the public deciding to choose their mobile phones to browse the internet rather than traditionally sitting in front of a desktop the mobile internet now is the biggest new growth engine for ecommerce in china online shopping is booming because of its convenience and cost effectiveness and it’s not only young affluent urban dwellers who are purchasing luxury items online at cheaper prices than shopping malls rather residents in less developed regions are buying products that are not available in their home towns as noted in the wall street journal on august   some interesting statistics according to china’s internet network information center “cnnic” the issuer of internet content provider icp of all the websites hosted in china on mobile url general url and trusted url to integrate with their mobile internet cloud application system •at the end of  there were  million internet users in china which calculates as  of the total population •out of  million internet users  million decides to use their mobile to surf the internet which accounts for  of the total internet browsing population •the level of mobile browsing in china has become significantly higher than in the west the stats indicate the significance of mobile internet browsing in china therefore in order for a company to have a significant brand image standing in the competitive chinese market a well designed mobile website is what a company should be looking to build about threequarters of chinese in firsttier cities such as beijing shanghai guangzhou and chongqing are already online but in rural areas it’s  percent according to a survey by mckinsey digital of hong kong which helps companies shape their digital strategies even so rural chinese have an affinity for ecommerce close to twothirds of rural chinese who do use the internet say they have purchased items online that compares with  percent of users in the cities types of mobile ads in some markets this type of advertising is most commonly seen as a mobile web banner top of page or mobile web poster bottom of page banner while in others it is dominated by sms advertising other forms include mms advertising advertising within mobile games and mobile videos during mobile tv receipt fullscreen interstitials which appear while a requested item of mobile content or mobile web page is loading up and audio advertisements that can take the form of a jingle before a voicemail recording or an audio recording played while interacting with a telephonebased service such as movie ticketing or directory assistance the mobile marketing association and the iab interactive advertising bureau has published mobile advertising guidelines but we contend that it is difficult to keep such guidelines current in such a fastdeveloping area the effectiveness of a mobile media ad campaign in our estimation can be measured in a variety of ways the main measurements are impressions views and clickthrough rates they are also sold to advertisers by views cost per impression or by clickthrough cost per click additional measurements include conversion rates such as clicktocall rates and other degrees of interactive measurement mobile media can run on a mobile web page or within a mobile application often referred to as inapp one of the popular models in mobile advertising in our estimation is cost per install cpi where there the pricing model is based on the user installing an app on their mobile phone cpi mobile advertising networks work either as incent or nonincent in the incent model the user is given virtual points or rewards to install the game or app mobile rich media in addition to standard mobile display banners our management has observed a growing trend to include rich media execution within the banner ads this includes banners that would expand to a larger size offering advertisers a larger display to communicate their message games within the banner to make the experience more interactive or a video within the banner space there are limitations to rich media on mobile because all of the coding must be done in html since the ios does not support flash   competitive advantage     customer   website creation   website

financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto for the fiscal year ended july   found in this report in addition to historical information the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks uncertainties and assumptions where possible we have tried to identify these forward looking statements by using words such as “anticipate” “believe” “intends” or similar expressions our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by the forwardlooking statements due to important factors and risks including but not limited to those set forth under “risk factors” as described in in part i item a of this report    our cash balance is  as of july   our cash balance is not sufficient to fund our limited levels of operations for any period of time we have been utilizing and may utilize funds from mu chun lin our president chief executive officer and director who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for offering costs filing fees and professional fees mu chun lin however has no formal commitment arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company in order to implement our plan of operations for the next twelvemonth period we require a minimum of  of funding therefore we have filed an s registration on september   being a start up stage company we have a very limited operating history after a twelvemonth period we may need additional financing but currently do not have any arrangements for such financing   long term financing beyond the maximum aggregate amount of this offering will be required to fully implement our business plan the exact amount of funding will depend on funding required for full implementation of our business plan our expansion may include expanding our office facilities hiring sales personnel and developing a customer base   if we do not receive any proceeds from the offering or the minimum amount of  that we require to operate for the next  months mu chun lin has informally agreed to advance us funds however he has no formal commitment arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company   if we need additional cash and cannot raise it we will either have to suspend operations until we do raise the cash we need or cease operations entirely even if we raise  from this offering it will most likely only last one year we may need more funds for business operations in the next year and we will have to revert to obtaining additional money    company overview    corporate history   china soar information technology inc a delaware corporation “the company” fka go public ii inc was incorporated under the laws of the state of

industry overview   this form k includes market and industry data that we have developed from publicly available information various industry publications and other published industry sources and our internal data and estimates although we believe the publications and reports are reliable we have not independently verified the data our internal data estimates and forecasts are based upon information obtained from trade and business organizations and other contacts in the market in which we operate and our management’s understanding of industry conditions   as of the date of the preparation of this prospectus these and other independent government and trade publications cited herein are publicly available on the internet without charge upon request the company will also provide copies of such sources cited herein     the mobile marketing industry     overview management contends that some perceive mobile advertising as closely related to online or internet advertising though we believe its reach is far greater  currently most mobile advertising is targeted at mobile phones that came estimably to a global total of  billion as of  source mobithinkingcom notably computers including desktops and laptops are currently estimated at approximately  billion globally source askcom it is probable in our management’s opinion that advertisers and media industry will increasingly take account of a bigger and fastgrowing mobile market though it remains at around  of global advertising spending and is estimated to increase to  by   source statisacom  mobile media is evolving rapidly and while we believe mobile phones will continue to be the mainstay it is not clear whether mobile phones based on cellular backhaul or smart phones based on wifi hot spot or wimax hot zone will also strengthen however as an illustration of the emergence of this form of advertising that there is now a dedicated global advertising awards ceremony organized every year by vision gain  a business information portal in information provided by the research firm berg insight as mobile phones out number television sets by over  to  and pc based internet users by over  to  and the total laptop and desktop pc population by nearly  to  advertisers in many markets we contend have recently rushed to this media in spain  of mobile phone owners receive ads in france  and in japan more remarkably as mobile advertising matures like in the most advanced markets the user involvement also matures in japan today already  of mobile phone owners click on ads they receive on their phones mobile advertising was worth  million dollars in japan alone according to the research firm berg insight the global mobile advertising market that was estimated to €  billion in  furthermore berg insight forecasts the global mobile advertising market to grow at a compound annual growth rate of  percent to €  billion in  in the q  state of mobile advertising report by opera mediaworks it is reported that mobile advertising is growing globally at a rapid rate opera mediaworks reports that rich media ads are now averaging a  percentage click rate among users app large banner ads are still the most popular but they are on the decline  in china a study by iresearch finds no indication of a slowdown in mobile growth as mobile devices become more popular and eretailers invest in making mobile sites easier to use chinese consumers spent  billion yuan  billion on shopping from their smartphones and tablets in  up  from  billion yuan  billion in  according to chinese research firm iresearch that is a significant leap in one year for mobile shopping given that online shopping grew only  to  trillion yuan  billion in china in  according to iresearch a beijingbased firm that tracks ecommerce iresearch attributes the uptick in mobile shopping mainly to the growing popularity of mobile devices and leading eretailers’ investments in better serving mobile shoppers mobile commerce seems likely to keep growing iresearch forecasts mobile shopping will grow more than fourfold to  trillion yuan   billion in sales in  purchases on mobile devices accounted for  of online sales in china in  compared with  in the prior year according to iresearch the chinese research company also predicts that mobile sales will surpass sales on personal computers in  and reach  of online sales in  using a mobile phone to browse the internet in china has considerably taken off towards the end of  with an ever increasing amount of the public deciding to choose their mobile phones to browse the internet rather than traditionally sitting in front of a desktop the mobile internet now is the biggest new growth engine for ecommerce in china online shopping is booming because of its convenience and cost effectiveness and it’s not only young affluent urban dwellers who are purchasing luxury items online at cheaper prices than shopping malls rather residents in less developed regions are buying products that are not available in their home towns as noted in the wall street journal on august   some interesting statistics according to china’s internet network information center “cnnic” the issuer of internet content provider icp of all the websites hosted in china on mobile url general url and trusted url to integrate with their mobile internet cloud application system •at the end of  there were  million internet users in china which calculates as  of the total population •out of  million internet users  million decides to use their mobile to surf the internet which accounts for  of the total internet browsing population •the level of mobile browsing in china has become significantly higher than in the west the stats indicate the significance of mobile internet browsing in china therefore in order for a company to have a significant brand image standing in the competitive chinese market a well designed mobile website is what a company should be looking to build about threequarters of chinese in firsttier cities such as beijing shanghai guangzhou and chongqing are already online but in rural areas it’s  percent according to a survey by mckinsey digital of hong kong which helps companies shape their digital strategies even so rural chinese have an affinity for ecommerce close to twothirds of rural chinese who do use the internet say they have purchased items online that compares with  percent of users in the cities types of mobile ads in some markets this type of advertising is most commonly seen as a mobile web banner top of page or mobile web poster bottom of page banner while in others it is dominated by sms advertising other forms include mms advertising advertising within mobile games and mobile videos during mobile tv receipt fullscreen interstitials which appear while a requested item of mobile content or mobile web page is loading up and audio advertisements that can take the form of a jingle before a voicemail recording or an audio recording played while interacting with a telephonebased service such as movie ticketing or directory assistance the mobile marketing association and the iab interactive advertising bureau has published mobile advertising guidelines but we contend that it is difficult to keep such guidelines current in such a fastdeveloping area the effectiveness of a mobile media ad campaign in our estimation can be measured in a variety of ways the main measurements are impressions views and clickthrough rates they are also sold to advertisers by views cost per impression or by clickthrough cost per click additional measurements include conversion rates such as clicktocall rates and other degrees of interactive measurement mobile media can run on a mobile web page or within a mobile application often referred to as inapp one of the popular models in mobile advertising in our estimation is cost per install cpi where there the pricing model is based on the user installing an app on their mobile phone cpi mobile advertising networks work either as incent or nonincent in the incent model the user is given virtual points or rewards to install the game or app mobile rich media in addition to standard mobile display banners our management has observed a growing trend to include rich media execution within the banner ads this includes banners that would expand to a larger size offering advertisers a larger display to communicate their message games within the banner to make the experience more interactive or a video within the banner space there are limitations to rich media on mobile because all of the coding must be done in html since the ios does not support flash   competitive advantage    customer website creation   website

grandfathered standards the fasb accounting standards codification™ “asc” is the sole source of authoritative gaap literature recognized by the fasb and applicable to the company   we have reviewed the fasb issued accounting standards update “asu” accounting pronouncements and interpretations thereof that have effectiveness dates during the periods reported and in future periods the company has carefully considered the new pronouncements that alter previous generally accepted accounting principles and does not believe that any new or modified principles will have a material impact on the corporation’s reported financial position or operations in the near term the applicability of any standard is subject to the formal review of our financial management and certain standards are under consideration   in august  fasb issued asu no  presentation of financial statements – going concern disclosures of uncertainties about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern the amendments in this update provide guidance in gaap about management’s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures in doing so the amendments should reduce diversity in the timing and content of footnote disclosures the guidance is effective for the annual period ending after december   and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter early adoption is permitted but not required at this time we are not early adopting as the objective of this accounting standard is to provide guidance on the disclosure of uncertainties about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern the adoption of this standard is not expected to impact our financial position or results of operations   in june  the fasb issued asu  development stage entities topic  elimination of certain financial reporting requirements including an amendment to variable interest entities guidance in topic  consolidation the amendments in this update remove all incremental financial reporting requirements from us gaap for development stage entities and also eliminate an exception provided to development stage entities in topic  consolidation for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity on the basis of the amount of investment equity that is at risk these amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   and interim periods therein with early application permitted early application of each of the amendments is permitted for any annual reporting period or interim period for which the entity’s financial statements have not yet been issued public business entities or made available for issuance other entities we early adopted this pronouncement in july  as the objective of the amendments in this update is to improve financial reporting by reducing the cost and complexity associated with the incremental reporting requirements for development stage entities our early adoption of this guidance has not impacted our financial position or results of operations   note   going concern the accompanying financial statements are prepared on a basis of accounting assuming that the company is a going concern that contemplates realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business the company has no current revenue sources this condition raises substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern the company’s management plans to engage in very limited activities without incurring any liabilities that must be satisfied in cash until a source of funding is secured the company will offer noncash consideration and seek equity lines as a means of financing its operations if the company is unable to obtain revenue  producing contracts or financing or if the revenue or financing it does obtain is insufficient to cover any operating losses it may incur it may substantially curtail or terminate its operations or seek other business opportunities through strategic alliances acquisitions or other arrangements that may dilute the interests of existing stockholders  note   income taxes    the company has not recognized an income tax benefit for its operating losses generated based on uncertainties concerning its ability to generate taxable income in future periods the tax benefit for the periods presented is offset by a valuation allowance established against deferred tax assets arising from the net operating losses and other temporary differences the realization of which could not be considered more likely than not in future periods tax benefits and related deferred tax assets will be recognized when management considers realization of such amounts to be more likely than not section  of the internal revenue code generally requires us to limit the amount of its income in future years that can be offset by historic losses ie net operating loss nol carryforwards and certain builtin losses after a corporation has undergone an ownership change as of july   the company has incurred net losses of  resulting in a net operating loss for income tax purposes nols begin expiring in  the loss results in a deferred tax asset of approximately  at the effective statutory rate of  the deferred tax asset has been offset by

reappointment as our company’s independent auditor     b rlb’s report on the financial statements for the year ended july   and for the period july   inception through july   contained no adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and was not qualified or modified as to audit scope or accounting except that the report contained an explanatory paragraph stating that there was substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern       c through the period covered by the financial audit for the year ended july   the period july   inception through july   and through the current date there have been no disagreements with rlb on any matter of accounting principles or practices financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure which disagreements if not resolved to the satisfaction of rlb would have caused her to make reference thereto in the report on the financial statements through the interim period august   there have been no disagreements with

the period july   inception through july   and the interim period through august   there have been no reportable events with us as set forth in item aiv of regulation sk     f the company provided a copy of the foregoing disclosures to rlb prior to the date of the filing of this report and requested that rlb furnish it with a letter addressed to the securities  exchange commission stating whether or not the firm agrees with the statements in this report a copy of such letter is filed as exhibit  to this form k    new independent accountants   a     on august   the company engaged malonebailey llp “mb” of houston texas as its new registered independent public accountant during the year ended july   the period july   inception through july   and prior to august   the date of the new engagement we did not consult with mb regarding i the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction ii the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the company’s financial statements by mb in either case where  written or oral advice provided by mb would be an important factor considered by us in reaching a decision as to any accounting auditing or financial reporting issues or iii any other matter that was the subject of a disagreement between us and our former auditor or was a reportable event as described in items aiv or item av of regulation sk respectively     item a controls and procedures   disclosure controls and procedures   the company has adopted and maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed under the exchange act such as this annual report is collected recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules of the sec  the company’s disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure  as required under exchange act rule a the company’s management including the chief executive officer who also serves as our principal financial officer has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report   based on that evaluation the chief executive office who also serves as our principal financial officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are ineffective     the matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the   public company accounting oversight board were domination of management by a single individual without adequate compensating controls lack of a majority of outside directors on board of directors resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives and lack of an audit committee these material weaknesses were identified by our chief executive officer who also serves as our chief financial officer in connection with the above annual evaluation   management believes that the material weaknesses did not have an effect on our financial results however management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and inadequate segregation of duties results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods   management recognizes that its controls and procedures would be substantially improved if we had an audit committee and two individuals serving as officers and as such is actively seeking to remediate this issue    management’s report on internal control over financial reporting   the company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rule af  the company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the company’s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements  management conducted an assessment of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in internal control – integrated framework  based on the assessment management concluded that as of july   the company’s internal control over financial reporting is ineffective based on those criteria   the company’s management including its chief executive officer who also serves as our chief financial officer does not expect that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures and its internal control processes will prevent all error and all fraud  a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met  further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs  because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of error or fraud if any within the company have been detected  these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that the breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake  additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control  the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions  over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate  because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected  however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process  therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk   management’s remediation initiatives   in an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls we have initiated or plan to initiate the following series of measures   we will create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives and will increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function when funds are available to us and we plan to appoint one or more outside directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to an audit committee resulting in a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures such as reviewing and approving estimates and assumptions made by management when funds are available to us   management believes that the appointment of one or more outside directors who shall be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee will remedy the lack of a functioning audit committee and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our board   we will work as quickly as possible to implement these initiatives however the lack of adequate working capital and positive cash flow from operations will likely slow this implementation   changes in internal control   there have been no changes in internal controls over the financial reporting that occurred during the period ending july    that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting   this annual report does not include an attestation report of the company’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting  management’s report was not subject to attestation by the company’s registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the sec that permit the company to provide only management’s report in this annual report     item b other information   none    table of contents part iii     item  directors executive officers and corporate governance     name   age   positions

general application of gaap principles in connection with our accounting for estimates accruals and reserves  analyzing and evaluating our financial statements  understanding internal controls and procedures for financial reporting and  understanding audit committee functions all of which are attributes of an audit committee financial expert however the sole director believes that no audit committee member has obtained these attributes through the experience specified in the secs definition of “audit committee financial expert” further as is the case with many small companies it would be difficult for us to attract and retain board members who qualify as “audit committee financial experts” and competition for such individuals is significant the sole director believes that its current audit committee is able to fulfill its role under sec regulations despite not having a designated “audit committee financial expert”   section a beneficial ownership reporting compliance
