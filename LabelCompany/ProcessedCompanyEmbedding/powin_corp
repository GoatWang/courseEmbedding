get started today lets build the future of energy together product  powin  powin x powin product meet bess battery cells a brain behind every battery battery cells are the smallest components of the bess and contain the actual battery chemicals each bess can have thousands of cells which comprise the building blocks for the entire system battery modules strength in numbers modules protect a group of cells from being strained too heavily each module comes with a controller that balances charges across its particular selection of cells battery packs the core of our bess modules are connected together into packs to scale to a wide range of power capacities these packed units have a dedicated controller ensuring that the modules behind each pack work together just as efficiently as the cells inside battery strings scaling energy once all of the cells are aggregated into modules and packs they form a complete string multiple battery packs make critical decisions in unison as each reports states of charge voltage temperature and other critical data to the bms bess battery energy storage system we then take multiple strings of batteries and compile them under a unified battery management system the powin bess the bess software gauges the information each system element passes up the chain making the most of every computational cycle and working together with broader energy managers with ease balancing lasting durability take comfort in knowing your system is engineered to give the most reliable performance possible with no downtime for manual battery balancing with specialized charging controls the powin bess balances the charge of each battery in realtime ensuring equal voltage levels across the system optimized protecting your investment as the bess tracks temperature voltage and current flowing through the cells powin’s custom algorithms monitor when conditions encroach warranty parameters the system can isolate problem zones send email notifications

personal care products and earths best organic baby formulas go to market in china tualatin  powin corp spent more than  years building a pipeline pumping chinesemade products  from fitness equipment to furniture to gun safes  into the american market now the tualatin company in a unique partnership with some of chinas largest banks is working to reverse the flow of goods by helping american companies introduce upscale brands to a surging class of affluent customers in a country of  billion people as early as this month chinese customers will start buying anne klein watches peter lamas organic hair and skin care products john lennon limitededition art prints and earths best organic baby formulas among other powin clients directly from retail websites operated by chinese banks chinese consumers are ready for this betterquality merchandise said harry hu powins shanghaiborn chief information officer and director of its channel partner program which offers a lowercost alternative for us companies who want to see if their wares can compete in china if your product is good enough you might build up your buzz among this population its a gold rush daniel sanders president of peter lamas a los angelesbased producer of highend products said of one of the worlds fastest growing consumer markets china represents a huge opportunity for us powins program makes it a lot easier to enter the marketplace powins program soon could be a boon for local businesses as well said linda moholt ceo of the tualatin chamber of commerce we need to find places to sell outside of oregon she said noting that china is one of the worlds largest markets powin founder joseph lu built the company which recently relocated to new tualatin headquarters through manufacturing in china and elsewhere for us clients its business interests range from bigrig truck parts to renewable energy after joining powin last year hu suggested using established channels in reverse bringing more american products to chinese buyers china is the worlds secondlargest economy behind the united states and one of the worlds fastestgrowing consumer markets especially for luxury goods according to reports from the us central intelligence agency and boston consulting group though america is chinas biggest market companies in japan south korea and taiwan all export more to china than the united states does according to the uschina business council the exploding chinese market is alluring but notoriously hard to crack hu said going it alone a company would spend  or more before knowing whether it can make its first sale hu said powins program is designed to take advantage of its channels between the two countries to simplify bringing goods to market in china its other big advantage hu said is that powin is the only american company partnered with nine chinese banks after helping many of them set up their own online retail businesses serving  million customers  about threequarters of chinas total credit card holders unlike the united states banks in china own some of the nations busiest retail websites and sell directly to their own wellheeled credit customers the banks also provide demographic and sales data to powin enabling american companies to target and track sales hu said kenn nickell channel partner programs sales manager said shoppers on the banks retail websites have been known to purchase more than half the items they click on because they already know what they want and they trust the seller they are thirsty for this they want this product nickell said thats why the clickthrough sales rate is so high channel partner programs entrylevel package markets an american clients products to bank customers for a threemonth test run powins fee is  plus  worth of the merchandise a participating company wants to sell for a minimum  commitment powin can also help american companies build larger marketing programs in china through the banks and other sales pipelines including television mobile phones and retail websites such as taobao sometimes described as chinas version of ebay its a crazy market hu said you never know what can be
