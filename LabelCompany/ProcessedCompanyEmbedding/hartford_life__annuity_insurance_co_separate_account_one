the separate account may advertise certain performancerelated information concerning the subaccounts performance information about a subaccount is based on the subaccounts past performance only and is no indication of future performance when a subaccount advertises its standardized total return it will usually be calculated since the date of the separate accounts inception for one year five years and ten years or some other relevant periods if the subaccount has not been in existence for at least ten years total return is measured by comparing the value of an investment in the subaccount at the beginning of the relevant period to the value of the investment at the end of the period total return calculations reflect a deduction for total annual fund operating expenses any contingent deferred sales charge separate account annual expenses without any optional charge deductions and the annual maintenance fee the separate account may also advertise nonstandardized total returns that predate the inception of the separate account these nonstandardized total returns are calculated by assuming that the subaccounts have been in existence for the same periods as the underlying funds and by taking deductions hartford life insurance company  for charges equal to those currently assessed against the subaccounts nonstandardized total return calculations reflect a deduction for total annual fund operating expenses and separate account annual expenses without any optional charge deductions and do not include deduction for contingent deferred sales charge or the annual maintenance fee this means the nonstandardized total return for a subaccount is higher than the standardized total return for a subaccount these nonstandardized returns must be accompanied by standardized returns if applicable the subaccounts may advertise yield in addition to total return this yield is based on the day sec yield of the underlying fund less the recurring charges at the separate account level a money market subaccount may advertise yield and effective yield the yield of a subaccount is based upon the income earned by the subaccount over a sevenday period and then annualized ie the income earned in the period is assumed to be earned every seven days over a week period and stated as a percentage of the investment effective yield is calculated similarly but when annualized the income earned by the investment is compounded in the course of a week period yield and effective yield include the recurring charges at the separate account level we may provide information on various topics

decide to cancel your contract how is the value of my contract calculated before the annuity commencement date the contract value is the sum of the value of the fixed accumulation feature and all subaccounts there are two things that affect your subaccount value  the number of accumulation units and  the accumulation unit value the subaccount value is determined by multiplying the number of accumulation units by the accumulation unit value on any valuation day the investment performance of the subaccounts will fluctuate with the performance of the underlying funds when premium payments are credited to your subaccounts they are converted into accumulation units by dividing the amount of your premium payments minus any premium taxes by the accumulation unit value for that day the more premium payments you make to your contract the more accumulation units you will own you decrease the number of accumulation units you have by requesting surrenders transferring money out of a subaccount settling a death benefit claim or by annuitizing your contract to determine the current accumulation unit value we take the prior valuation days accumulation unit value and multiply it by the net investment factor for the current valuation day the net investment factor is used to measure the investment performance of a subaccount from one valuation day to the next the net investment factor for each subaccount equals  the net asset value per share plus applicable distributions per share of each fund at the end of the current valuation day divided by  the net asset value per share of each fund at the end of the prior valuation day multiplied by  contract charges including the daily expense factor for the mortality and expense risk charge and any other periodic expenses including charges for optional benefits adjusted for the number of days in the period we will send you a statement at least annually which tells you how many accumulation units you have their value and your total contract value can i transfer from one subaccount to another you may make transfers between the subaccounts offered in this contract according to our policies and procedures as amended from time to time what is a subaccount transfer a subaccount transfer is a transaction requested by you that involves reallocating part or all of your contract value among the funds available in your contract your transfer request will be processed as of the end of the valuation day that it received is in good order otherwise your request will be processed on the following valuation day we will send you a confirmation when we process your transfer you are responsible for verifying transfer confirmations and promptly advising us of any errors within  days of receiving the confirmation what happens when you request a subaccount transfer many contract owners request subaccount transfers some request transfers into purchases a particular subaccount and others request transfers out of redemptions a particular subaccount in addition some contract owners allocate new premium payments to subaccounts and others request surrenders we combine all the daily requests to transfer out of a subaccount along with all surrenders from that subaccount and determine how many shares of that fund we would need to sell to satisfy all contract owners transferout requests at the same time we also combine all the daily requests to transfer into a particular subaccount or new premium payments allocated to that subaccount and determine how many shares of that fund we would need to buy to satisfy all contract owners transferin requests in addition many of the funds that are available as investment options in our variable annuity products are also available as investment options in variable life insurance policies retirement plans funding agreements and other products offered by us or our affiliates each day investors and participants in these other products engage in similar transfer transactions we take advantage of our size and available technology to combine sales of a particular fund for many of the variable annuities variable life insurance policies retirement plans funding agreements or other products offered by us or our affiliates we also combine many of the purchases of that particular fund for many of the products we offer we then net these trades by offsetting purchases against redemptions this means that we sometimes reallocate shares of a fund rather than buy new shares or sell shares of the fund for example if we combine all transferout redemption requests and surrenders of a stock fund subaccount with all other sales of that fund from all our other products we may have to sell  million dollars of that fund on any particular day however if other contract owners and the owners of other products offered by us want to transferin purchase an amount equal to  of that same fund then we would send a sell order to the fund for  a  million sell hartford life insurance company  order minus the purchase order of  rather than making two or more transactions what restrictions are there on your ability to make a subaccount transfer first you may make only one subaccount transfer request each day we limit each contract owner to one subaccount transfer request each valuation day we count all subaccount transfer activity that occurs on any one valuation day as one subaccount transfer however you cannot transfer the same contract value more than once a valuation day examples transfer request per valuation day permissible  transfer  from a money market subaccount to yes a growth subaccount transfer  from a money market subaccount to yes any number of other subaccounts dividing the  among the other subaccounts however you chose transfer  from any number of different subaccounts yes to any number of other subaccounts transfer  from a money market subaccount to a no growth subaccount and then before the end of that same valuation day transfer the same  from the growth subaccount to an international subaccount second you are allowed to submit a total of  subaccount transfers each contract year the transfer rule by us mail voice response unit internet or telephone once you have reached the maximum number of subaccount transfers you may only submit any additional subaccount transfer requests and any trade cancellation requests in writing through us mail or overnight delivery service in other words voice response unit internet or telephone transfer requests will not be honored we may but are not obligated to notify you when you are in jeopardy of approaching these limits for example we will send you a letter after your th subaccount transfer to remind you about the transfer policy after your th transfer request our computer system will not allow you to do another subaccount transfer by telephone voice response unit or via the internet you will then be instructed to send your subaccount transfer request by us mail or overnight delivery service we reserve the right to aggregate your contracts whether currently existing or those recently surrendered for the purposes of enforcing these restrictions the transfer rule does not apply to subaccount transfers that occur automatically as part of a company sponsored asset allocation or dollar cost averaging program reallocations made based on a fund merger substitution or liquidation also do not count toward this transfer limit restrictions may vary based on state law we make no assurances that the transfer rule is or will be effective in detecting or preventing market timing third policies have been designed to restrict excessive subaccount transfers you should not purchase this contract if you want to make frequent subaccount transfers for any reason in particular dont purchase this contract if you plan to engage in market timing which includes frequent transfer activity into and out of the same fund or frequent subaccount transfers in order to exploit any inefficiencies in the pricing of a fund even if you do not engage in market timing certain restrictions may be imposed on you as discussed below abusive transfer policy effective until july   regardless of the number of subaccount transfers you have done under the transfer rule you still may have your subaccount transfer privileges restricted if you violate the abusive transfer policy we rely on the funds to identify a pattern or frequency of subaccount transfers that the fund wants us to investigate most often the fund will identify a particular day where it experienced a higher percentage of shares bought followed closely by a day where it experienced the almost identical percentage of shares sold once a fund contacts us we run a report that identifies all contract owners who transferred in or out of that funds subaccount on the day or days identified by the fund we may share tax identification numbers and other shareholder identifying information contained in our records with funds we then review the contracts on that list to determine whether transfer activity of each identified contract violates our written abusive transfer policy we dont reveal the precise details of our analysis to help make it more difficult for abusive traders to adjust their behavior to escape detection we consider some or all of the following factors  the dollar amount of the transfer  the total assets of the funds involved in the transfer  hartford life insurance company  the number of transfers completed in the current calendar quarter  whether the transfer is part of a pattern of transfers designed to take advantage of short term market fluctuations or market inefficiencies or  the frequent trading policies and procedures of a potentially affected fund if you violate the abusive trading policy we will terminate your subaccount transfer privileges until your next contract anniversary fund trading policies effective after july   you are subject to fund trading policies if any we are obligated to provide at the funds request tax identification numbers and other shareholder identifying information contained in our records to assist funds in identifying any pattern or frequency of subaccount transfers that may violate their trading policy in certain instances we have agreed to serve as a funds agent to help monitor compliance with that funds trading policy we are obligated to follow each funds instructions regarding enforcement of their trading policy penalties for violating these policies may include among other things temporarily or permanently limiting or banning subaccount transfers into a fund or other funds within that fund complex we are not authorized to grant exceptions to a funds trading policy please refer to each funds prospectus for more information fund trading policies do not apply or may be limited for instance  certain types of financial intermediaries may not be required to provide us with shareholder information  excepted funds such money market funds and any fund that affirmatively permits shortterm trading of its securities may opt not to adopt this type of policy this type of policy may not apply to any financial intermediary that a fund treats as a single investor  a fund can decide to exempt categories of contract holders whose contracts are subject to inconsistent trading restrictions or none at all  nonshareholder initiated purchases or redemptions may not always be monitored these include subaccount transfers that are executed i automatically pursuant to a company sponsored contractual or systematic program such as transfers of assets as a result of dollar cost averaging programs asset allocation programs automatic rebalancing programs annuity payouts loans or systematic withdrawal programs ii as a result of the payment of a death benefit iii as a stepup in contract value pursuant to a contract death benefit or guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit iv as a result of any deduction of charges or fees under a contract or v as a result of payments such as loan repayments scheduled contributions scheduled withdrawals or surrenders retirement plan salary reduction contributions or planned premium payments possibility of undetected abusive trading or market timing we may not be able to detect or prevent all abusive trading or market timing activities for instance  since we net all the purchases and redemptions for a particular fund for this and many of our other products transfers by any specific market timer could be inadvertently overlooked  certain forms of variable annuities and types of funds may be attractive to market timers we can not provide assurances that we will be capable of addressing possible abuses in a timely manner  these policies apply only to individuals and entities that own this contract or have the right to make transfers regardless of whether requests are made by you or anyone else acting on your behalf however the funds that make up the subaccounts of this contract are also available for use with many different variable life insurance policies variable annuity products and funding agreements and are offered directly to certain qualified retirement plans some of these products and plans may have less restrictive transfer rules or no transfer restrictions at all how are you affected by frequent subaccount transfers we are not responsible for losses or lost investment opportunities associated with the effectuation of these policies frequent subaccount transfers may result in the dilution of the value of the outstanding securities issued by a fund as a result of increased transaction costs and lost investment opportunities typically associated with maintaining greater cash positions this can adversely impact fund performance and as a result the performance of your contract this may also lower the death benefit paid to your beneficiary or lower annuity payouts for your payee as well as reduce value of other optional benefits available under your contract separate account investors could be prevented from purchasing fund shares if we reach an impasse on the execution of a funds trading instructions in other words a fund complex could refuse to allow new purchases of shares by all our variable product investors if the fund and we can not reach a mutually acceptable agreement on how to treat an investor who in a funds opinion has violated the funds trading policy in some cases we do not have the tax identification number or other identifying information requested by a fund in our records in those cases we rely on the contract owner to provide the information if the contract owner does not provide the information we may be directed by the fund to restrict the contract owner from further purchases of fund shares in those cases all participants under a plan funded by the contract will also be precluded from further purchases of fund shares fixed accumulation feature transfers  during each contract year you may make transfers out of the fixed accumulation feature to the subaccounts subject to the transfer restrictions discussed below all transfer allocations must be in whole numbers eg  hartford life insurance company  fixed accumulation feature transfer restrictions  each contract year you may transfer the greater of   of the greatest contract value in the

elect your optional benefit when you purchase your contract we count one year as the time between each contract anniversary if you establish your optional benefit any time after you purchase your contract we count the first year as the time between the date we added the optional benefit to your contract and your next contract anniversary which could be less than a year the benefit payment can be divided up and taken on any payment schedule that you request you can continue to take benefit payments until the benefit amount has been depleted benefit payments are treated as partial surrenders and are deducted from your contract value each benefit payment reduces the amount you may surrender under your annual withdrawal amount surrenders in excess of your benefit payment include any applicable contingent deferred sales charge if you surrender more than the benefit payment out of your contract in any one year we will recalculate the benefit amount anytime we recalculate your

benefit amount by comparing the results of two calculations first we deduct the amount of the last surrender from your contract value new contract value and then we deduct the amount of the last surrender from the benefit amount new benefit amount then we compare those results  if the new contract value is more than or equal to the new benefit amount and more than or equal to the premium payments invested in the contract before the surrender the benefit payment is unchanged  if the new contract value is more than or equal to the new benefit amount but less than the premium payments invested in the contract before the surrender we have to recalculate your benefit payment for the hartfords principal first your benefit payment becomes  of the greater of your new contract value and

annual withdrawal amount we will waive any applicable contingent deferred sales charge for withdrawals up to that benefit payment amount if you change the ownership or assign this contract to someone other than your spouse after  months of electing either optional benefit we will recalculate the benefit amount and the benefit payment may be lower in the future the benefit amount will be

death benefit described your annuitant are  years old or older above  your maximum anniversary value or  the earnings protection benefit hartford life insurance company  asset protection death benefit the asset protection death benefit is one of the two standard death benefit choices here is an example of how the asset protection death benefit works assume that  you made an initial premium payment of   in your fourth contract year you made a partial surrender of   your contract value in your fourth contract year immediately before your partial surrender was   on the day we calculate the death benefit your contract value was   your maximum anniversary value was  we determine the asset protection death benefit by finding the based on the assumptions above here is how we would do the greatest of these three values actual calculations  contract value or contract value equals   contract value plus  of the total premium payments           excluding any subsequent premium payments we receive within  months of death or after death premium payments are adjusted for any partial surrenders or  contract value plus  of your maximum anniversary value       excluding any subsequent premium payments we receive within  months of death or after death the asset protection death benefit has a maximum that means the death benefit cannot exceed the asset protection death benefit maximum asset protection death benefit maximum the asset protection death benefit cannot exceed the greatest based on the assumptions above here is the calculation of of the asset protection death benefit maximum  contract value  contract value is   total premium payments you have made to us adjusted for  total premium payments you have made to us minus an any partial surrenders or adjustment for any partial surrenders      or  your maximum anniversary value  your maximum anniversary value is  because the greatest of the three values above is  the maximum death benefit is  the discussion of the death benefit choices above says that we make an adjustment to your total premium payments for partial surrenders when we calculate the death benefit we calculate the adjustment to your total premium payments for partial surrenders by reducing your total premium payments on a dollar for dollar basis for total partial surrenders within a contract year up to  of total premium payments after that we reduce your total premium payments by a factor that we compute by taking into account the amount of your total partial surrenders within a contract year that exceed  of total premium payments and your contract value before and after the surrender we use this calculation to determine the adjustment to total premium payments for partial surrenders for all of the death benefits discussed in this prospectus for examples of how we calculate the death benefit please see appendix ii the discussion of the death benefit choices above also refers to your maximum anniversary value the maximum anniversary value is based on a series of calculations on contract anniversaries of contract values premium payments and partial surrenders we will calculate an anniversary value for each contract anniversary prior to the deceaseds st birthday or date of death whichever is earlier the anniversary value is equal to the contract value as of a contract anniversary with the following adjustments  your anniversary value is increased by the dollar amount of any premium payments made since the contract anniversary and  your anniversary value is reduced by an adjustment for any partial surrenders made since the contract anniversary the maximum anniversary value is equal to the greatest anniversary value attained from this series of calculations we make an adjustment for partial surrenders when we calculate your anniversary value we calculate the adjustment to your anniversary value for partial surrenders by reducing your anniversary value on a dollar for dollar basis for  hartford life insurance company total partial surrenders within a contract year up to  of total premium payments after that we reduce your anniversary value by a factor that we compute by taking into account the amount of your total partial surrenders within a contract year that exceed  of total premium payments and your contract value before and after the surrender for examples of how we calculate the death benefit please see appendix ii we use these calculations to determine your maximum anniversary value for all of the death benefits discussed in this prospectus premium protection death benefit the premium protection death benefit is one of the two standard death benefit choices the premium protection death benefit may not currently be available in your state you cannot choose the premium protection death benefit if either you or your annuitant are  years old or older here is an example of how the premium protection death benefit works assume that  you made an initial premium payment of   in your fourth contract year you made a partial surrender of   your contract value in your fourth contract year immediately before your partial surrender was   on the day we calculate the death benefit your contract value was  we determine the premium protection death based on the assumptions above benefit by finding the greater of these here is how we would do the two values actual calculations  contract value or    total premium payments you have made to       us minus an adjustment for any partial surrenders because your contract value was greater than the adjusted total premium payments your death benefit is  we make an adjustment to your total premium payments for partial surrenders as discussed above under adjustments to total premium payments for partial surrenders if your contract has the premium protection death benefit and you transfer ownership of your contract to someone who was  years old or older at the time you purchased your contract the

ownership of your contract to someone who was  years old or older at the time you purchased your contract the mavepb death benefit will not apply under the contract after the transfer instead for contracts with the asset protection death benefit only the asset protection death benefit will remain in force under the contract for contracts with the premium protection death benefit the death benefit will be the contract value however we will continue to deduct the charge for the mavepb death benefit until we begin to make annuity payouts earnings protection benefit  if you and your annuitant are age  or under when you purchase your contract the earnings protection benefit is  your contract value on the date we receive a death certificate or other legal document acceptable to us plus   of the contract gain since the date that you purchased your contract we determine any contract gain by comparing your contract value on the date you purchase your contract to your contract value on the date we calculate the death benefit we deduct any premium payments and add adjustments for any partial surrenders made during that time we make an adjustment for partial surrenders if the amount of a surrender is greater than the contract gain in the contract immediately prior to the surrender to determine if a partial surrender is greater than contract gain we  add the amount of the partial surrender to the contract value on the date you purchase your contract  then we add any premium payments made after the date you purchase your contract and before you made the partial surrender  next we subtract the contract value on the valuation day immediately before you make the partial surrender and  we subtract the sum of any prior adjustments for all prior partial surrenders made after you purchased your contract if that amount is greater than zero the result becomes the amount of the adjustment for the partial surrender we use the adjustment for partial surrenders when we calculate the contract gain by  subtracting the contract value on the date you purchase your contract and any subsequent premium payments from the contract value on the date we receive due proof of death  then we add any adjustment for partial surrenders to the result to determine the contract gain your contract gain is limited to or capped at a maximum of  of contract value on the date you purchased your contract plus premium payments not previously withdrawn made after you purchased your contract excluding any premium payments made in the  months before the date of death or after death we subtract any adjustments for partial surrenders we take  of either the contract gain or the capped amount and add it back to your contract value to complete the death benefit calculation if you or your annuitant are age  through  we add  of the contract gain or capped amount back to the contract value to complete the death benefit calculation the percentage used for the death benefit calculation is determined by the oldest age of you and your annuitant at the time you purchased your contract here is an example of how the mavepb death benefit works with the standard death benefit choices assume that  you made a single premium payment of   in your fourth contract year you made a partial surrender of   your contract value in your fourth contract year immediately before your partial surrender was   on the day we calculate the death benefit your contract value was   your maximum anniversary value was   hartford life insurance company based on the assumptions above this table shows how we would do the calculations mavepb death benefit with asset protection death benefit mavepb death benefit with premium protection death benefit  asset protection death  premium protection  benefit see example death benefit see above example above the total premium      your maximum  payments you have made anniversary value or to us minus an adjustment for any partial surrenders your maximum  the earnings protection contract value minus contract value on anniversary value or benefit the date you purchased your contract       of contract gain plus contract value  x        the earnings protection contract value minus contract death benefit amount because the maximum anniversary value benefit value on the date you purchased was the greatest of the three values your contract   compared the death benefit is      of contract gain plus contract value  x        death benefit amount because the maximum anniversary value was the greatest of the four values compared the death benefit is  before you purchase the mavepb death benefit you should also consider the following  if your contract has no gain when we calculate the death benefit we will not pay an earnings protection benefit  partial surrenders can reduce or eliminate your contract gain so if you plan to make partial surrenders there may be no earnings protection benefit  if you transfer ownership of your contract or your spouse continues your contract after your death and the new contract owner would have been ineligible for the mavepb death benefit when you purchased your contract the mavepb death benefit charge will continue to be deducted even though no mavepb death benefit will be payable optional death benefit for contracts issued in washington new york or minnesota the optional death benefit is different for contracts issued in washington new york or minnesota we call this optional death benefit the maximum anniversary value death benefit it does not contain the earnings protection benefit the charge for the maximum anniversary value death benefit is the same as the charge for the mavepb death benefit it is an additional charge we deduct on a daily basis that is equal to an annual charge of  of your contract value invested in the subaccounts the maximum anniversary value death benefit is described below if your contract has the asset protection death benefit the death benefit will be the greatest of the asset protection death benefit or the following two values  the total premium payments you have made to us minus an adjustment for any partial surrenders or  your maximum anniversary value if your contract has the premium protection death benefit the death benefit will be the greater of the premium protection death benefit or your maximum anniversary value additional information about the death benefits for more information on how these optional benefits may affect your taxes please see the section entitled federal tax considerations under subsection entitled taxation of annuities  general provisions affecting contracts not held in taxqualified retirement plans your contract states that as part of the death benefit calculation we deduct any premium payments we receive within  months of death or after death as part of the total hartford life insurance company  premium payment calculation if you purchase this contract we will waive that deduction when we calculate the premium protection death benefit or the mavepb death benefit except when we calculate the limitation of contract gain for purposes of the mavepb death benefit we will also waive the deduction for purposes of the asset protection death benefit when we calculate the asset protection death benefit maximum your contract states that we exclude any premium payments that we receive within  months of death when we calculate the asset protection death benefit we waive this exclusion for your initial premium payment if death occurs in the first contract year we impose a limit on total death benefits if  the total death benefits are payable as a result of the death of any one person under one or more deferred variable annuities issued by hartford or its affiliates and  aggregate premium payments total  million or more when the limit applies total death benefits cannot exceed the greater of  the aggregate premium payments reduced by an adjustment for any surrenders or  the aggregate contract value plus  million however if you add premium payments to any of your contracts such that aggregate premium payments total to  million or more the aggregate death benefit will be the greater of the maximum death benefit above or  the aggregate contract value plus  the aggregate death benefits in excess of the aggregate contract values at the time you added the premium payments to your contracts we calculate the adjustment to your aggregate premium payments for any surrenders by reducing your aggregate premium payments on a dollar for dollar basis for any surrenders within a contract year up to  of aggregate premium payments after that we reduce your aggregate premium payments proportionally based on the amount of any surrenders that exceed  of aggregate premium payments divided by your aggregate contract value at the time of surrender any reduction in death benefits to multiple variable annuity contracts will be in proportion to the contract value of each contract at the time of reduction how is the death benefit paid the death benefit may be taken in one lump sum or under any of the annuity payout options then being offered by us unless the contract owner has designated the manner in which the beneficiary will receive the death benefit on the date we receive complete instructions from the beneficiary we will compute the death benefit amount to be paid out or applied to a selected annuity payout option when there is more than one beneficiary we will calculate the death benefit amount for each beneficiarys portion of the proceeds and then pay it out or apply it to a selected annuity payout option according to each beneficiarys instructions if we receive the complete instructions on a nonvaluation day computations will take place on the next valuation day if your beneficiary elects to receive the death benefit amount as a lump sum payment we may transfer that amount to our general account and issue the beneficiary a draftbook the beneficiary can write one draft for total payment of the death benefit or keep the money in the general account and write drafts as needed we will credit interest at a rate determined periodically in our sole discretion for federal income tax purposes the beneficiary will be deemed to have received the lump sum payment on transfer of the death benefit amount to the general account the interest will be taxable to the beneficiary in the tax year that it is credited if the beneficiary resides or the contract was purchased in a state that imposes restrictions on this method of lump sum payment

the contract owner dies before the annuity commencement date the death benefit must be distributed within five years after death or be distributed under a distribution option or annuity payout option that satisfies the alternatives to the required distributions described below if the contract owner dies on or after the annuity commencement date under an annuity payout option that permits the beneficiary to elect to continue annuity payouts or receive the commuted value any remaining value must be distributed at least as rapidly as under the payment method being used as of the contract owners death if the contract owner is not an individual eg a trust then the original annuitant will be treated as the contract owner in the situations described above and any change in the original annuitant will be treated as the death of the contract owner what should the beneficiary consider alternatives to the required distributions  the selection of an annuity payout option and the timing of the selection will have an impact on the tax treatment of the death benefit  hartford life insurance company to receive favorable tax treatment the annuity payout option selected a cannot extend beyond the beneficiarys life or life expectancy and b must begin within one year of the date of death if these conditions are not met the death benefit will be treated as a lump sum payment for tax purposes this sum will be taxable in the year in which it is considered received spousal contract continuation  if the contract owner dies and a beneficiary is the contract owners spouse that portion of the contract for which the spouse is considered the beneficiary will continue with the spouse as contract owner unless the spouse elects to receive the death benefit as a lump sum payment or as an annuity payment option if the contract continues with the spouse as contract owner we will adjust the contract value to the amount that we would have paid as the death benefit payment had the spouse elected to receive the death benefit as a lump sum payment spousal contract continuation will only apply one time for each contract if your spouse continues any portion of the contract as contract owner and elects the mavepb death benefit hartford will use the date the contract is continued with your spouse as contract owner as the effective date the optional death benefit was added to the contract this means we will use the date the contract is continued with your spouse as contract owner as the effective date for calculating the mavepb death benefit the percentage used for the mavepb death benefit will be determined by the oldest age of any remaining joint contract owner or annuitant at the time the contract is continued who will receive the death benefit the distribution of the

payout amount the number of annuity units that determines the annuity payout amount remains fixed unless you transfer units between subaccounts the dollar amount of the first variable annuity payout depends on  the annuity payout option chosen  the annuitants attained age and gender if applicable  the applicable annuity purchase rates based on the a individual annuity mortality table adjusted for

premium payments invested in a particular fund legal matters there continues to be significant federal and state regulatory activity relating to financial services companies particularly mutual funds companies these regulatory inquiries have focused on a number of mutual fund issues including market timing and late trading revenue sharing and directed brokerage fees transfer agents and other fund service providers and other mutualfund related issues the hartford which includes hartford life insurance company hlic and its affiliates has received requests for information and subpoenas from the securities and exchange commission sec subpoenas from the new york attorney generals office a subpoena from the connecticut attorney generals office requests for information from the connecticut securities and investments division of the department of banking and requests for information from the new york department of insurance in each case requesting documentation and other information regarding various mutual fund regulatory issues the hartford  hartford life insurance company continues to cooperate fully with these regulators in these matters the secs division of enforcement and the new york attorney generals office are investigating aspects of the hartfords variable annuity and mutual fund operations related to market timing the hartford continues to cooperate fully with the sec and the new york attorney generals office in these matters the funds are available for purchase by the separate accounts of different variable universal life insurance policies variable annuity products and funding agreements and they are offered directly to certain qualified retirement plans although existing products contain transfer restrictions between subaccounts some products particularly older variable annuity products do not contain restrictions on the frequency of transfers in addition as a result of the settlement of litigation against the hartford with respect to certain owners of older variable annuity contracts the hartfords ability to restrict transfers by these owners has until recently been limited the hartford has executed an agreement with the parties to the previously settled litigation which together with separate agreements between these contract owners and their broker has resulted in the exchange or surrender of substantially all of the variable annuity contracts that were the subject of the previously settled litigation pursuant to an agreement in principle reached in february  with the board of directors of the hls funds the hartford has indemnified the affected funds for material harm deemed to have been caused to the funds by frequent trading by these owners for the period from january   through december   the hartford does not expect to incur additional costs pursuant to this agreement in principle in light of the exchange or surrender of these variable annuity contracts the secs division of enforcement also is investigating aspects of the hartfords variable annuity and mutual fund operations related to directed brokerage and revenue sharing the hartford discontinued the use of directed brokerage in recognition of mutual fund sales in late  the hartford continues to cooperate fully with the sec in these matters the hartford has received subpoenas from the new york attorney generals office and the connecticut attorney generals office requesting information relating to the hartfords group annuity products including single premium group annuities used in maturity or terminal funding programs these subpoenas seek information about how various group annuity products are sold how the hartford selects mutual funds offered as investment options in certain group annuity products and how brokers selling the hartfords group annuity products are compensated the hartford continues to cooperate fully with these regulators in these matters to date none of the secs and new york attorney generals market timing investigation the secs directed brokerage investigation or the new york attorney generals and connecticut attorney generals single premium group annuity investigation has resulted in the initiation of any formal action against the hartford by these regulators however the hartford believes that the sec the new york attorney generals office and the connecticut attorney generals office are likely to take some action against the hartford at the conclusion of the respective investigations the hartford is engaged in active discussions with the sec the new york attorney generals office and the connecticut attorney generals office the potential timing of any resolution of any of these matters or the initiation of any formal action by any of these regulators is difficult to predict hartford life inc hartford life recorded a charge of  million aftertax to establish a reserve for the market timing and directed brokerage matters in the first quarter of  based on recent developments hartford life recorded an additional charge of  million aftertax in the fourth quarter of  of which  million after tax was attributed to hlic to increase the reserve for the market timing directed brokerage and single premium group annuity matters this reserve is an estimate in view of the uncertainties regarding the outcome of these regulatory investigations as well as the taxdeductibility of payments it is possible that the ultimate cost to hartford life of these matters could exceed the reserve by an amount that would have a material adverse effect on hartford lifes consolidated results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarterly or annual period it is reasonably possible that hlic may ultimately be liable for all or a portion of the ultimate cost to hartford life in excess of the  million already attributed to hlic however the ultimate liability of hlic is not reasonably estimable at this time on may   the hartford received a subpoena from the connecticut attorney

considerations a introduction the following summary of tax rules does not provide or constitute any tax advice it provides only a general discussion of certain of the expected federal income tax consequences with respect to amounts contributed to invested in or received from a contract based on our understanding of the existing provisions of the code treasury regulations thereunder and public interpretations thereof by the irs eg revenue rulings revenue procedures or notices or by published court decisions this summary discusses only certain federal income tax consequences to united states persons and does not discuss state local or foreign tax consequences the term united states persons means citizens or residents of the united states domestic corporations domestic partnerships trust or estates that are subject to united states federal income tax regardless of the source of their income see annuity purchases by nonresident aliens and foreign corporations regarding annuity purchases by nonus persons or residents this summary has been prepared by us after consultation with tax counsel but no opinion of tax counsel has been obtained we do not make any guarantee or representation regarding any tax status eg federal state local or foreign of any contract or any transaction involving a contract in addition there is always a possibility that the tax treatment of an annuity contract could change by legislation or other means such as regulations rulings or judicial decisions moreover it is always possible that any such change in tax treatment could be made retroactive that is made effective prior to the date of the change accordingly you should consult a qualified tax adviser for complete information and advice before purchasing a contract in addition this discussion does not address many of the tax consequences if you use the contract in various arrangements including charitable remainder trusts taxqualified retirement arrangements deferred compensation plans splitdollar insurance arrangements or other employee benefit arrangements the tax consequences of any such arrangement may vary depending on the particular facts and circumstances of each individual arrangement and whether the arrangement satisfies certain tax qualification or classification requirements in addition the tax rules affecting such an arrangement may have changed recently eg by legislation or regulations that affect compensatory or employee benefit arrangements therefore if you are contemplating the use of a contract in any arrangement the value of which to you depends in part on its tax consequences you should consult a qualified tax adviser regarding the tax treatment of the proposed arrangement and of any contract used in it the discussion set forth below is included for general purposes only special tax rules may apply with respect to certain situations that are not discussed herein each potential purchaser of a contract is advised to consult with a qualified tax adviser as to the consequences of any amounts invested in a contract under applicable federal state local or foreign tax law b taxation of hartford and the separate account the separate account is taxed as part of hartford which is taxed as a life insurance company under subchapter l of chapter  of the code accordingly the separate account will not be taxed as a regulated investment company under subchapter m of chapter  of the code investment income and any realized capital gains on assets of the separate account are reinvested and taken into account in determining the value of the accumulation and annuity units as a result such investment income and realized capital gains are automatically applied to increase reserves under the contract currently no taxes are due on interest dividends and shortterm or longterm capital gain earned by the separate account with respect to the contracts hartford is entitled to certain tax  hartford life insurance company benefits related to the investment of company assets including assets of the separate account these tax benefits which may include the foreign tax credit and the corporate dividends received deduction are not passed back to you since hartford is the owner of the assets from which the tax benefits are derived c taxation of annuities  general provisions affecting contracts not held in taxqualified retirement plans section  of the code governs the taxation of annuities in general  nonnatural persons as owners pursuant to code section u an annuity contract held by a taxpayer other than a natural person generally is not treated as an annuity contract under the code instead such a nonnatural contract owner generally could be required to include in gross income currently for each taxable year the excess of a the sum of the contract value as of the close of the taxable year and all previous distributions under the contract over b the sum of net premiums paid for the taxable year and any prior taxable year and the amount includable in gross income for any prior taxable year with respect to the contract under section u however section u does not apply to  a contract the nominal owner of which is a nonnatural person but the beneficial owner of which is a natural person eg where the nonnatural owner holds the contract as an agent for the natural person  a contract acquired by the estate of a decedent by reason of such decedents death  certain contracts acquired with respect to taxqualified retirement arrangements  certain contracts held in structured settlement arrangements that may qualify under code section  or  a single premium immediate annuity contract under code section u which provides for substantially equal periodic payments and an annuity starting date that is no later than  year from the date of the contracts purchase a nonnatural contract owner that is a taxexempt entity for federal tax purposes eg a taxqualified retirement trust or a charitable remainder trust generally would not be subject to federal income tax as a result of such current gross income under code section u however such a taxexempt entity or any annuity contract that it holds may need to satisfy certain tax requirements in order to maintain its qualification for such favorable tax treatment see eg irs tech adv memo  for certain charitable remainder trusts pursuant to code section s if the contract owner is a nonnatural person the primary annuitant is treated as the holder in applying the required distribution rules described below these rules require that certain distributions be made upon the death of a holder in addition for a nonnatural owner a change in the primary annuitant is treated as the death of the holder however the provisions of code section s do not apply to certain contracts held in taxqualified retirement arrangements or structured settlement arrangements  other contract owners natural persons a contract owner is not taxed on increases in the value of the contract until an amount is received or deemed received eg in the form of a lump sum payment full or partial value of a contract or as annuity payments under the settlement option elected the provisions of section  of the code concerning distributions are summarized briefly below also summarized are special rules affecting distributions from contracts obtained in a taxfree exchange for other annuity contracts or life insurance contracts which were purchased prior to august   a distributions prior to the annuity commencement date i total premium payments less amounts received which were not includable in gross income equal the investment in the contract under section  of the code ii to the extent that the value of the contract ignoring any surrender charges except on a full surrender exceeds the investment in the contract such excess constitutes the income on the contract it is unclear what value should be used in determining the income on the contract we believe that the current contract value determined without regard to surrender charges is an appropriate measure however the irs could take the position that the value should be the current contract value determined without regard to surrender charges increased by some measure of the value of certain future benefits iii any amount received or deemed received prior to the annuity commencement date eg upon a partial surrender is deemed to come first from any such income on the contract and then from investment in the contract and for these purposes such income on the contract shall be computed by reference to any aggregation rule in subparagraph c below as a result any such amount received or deemed received  shall be includable in gross income to the extent that such amount does not exceed any such income on the contract and  shall not be includable in gross income to the extent that such amount does exceed any such income on the contract if at the time that any amount is received or deemed received there is no income on the contract eg because the gross value of the contract does not exceed the investment in the contract and no aggregation rule applies then such amount received or deemed received will not be includable in gross income and will simply reduce the investment in the contract iv the receipt of any amount as a loan under the contract or the assignment or pledge of any portion of the value of the contract shall be treated as an amount received for hartford life insurance company  purposes of this subparagraph a and the next subparagraph b v in general the transfer of the contract without full and adequate consideration will be treated as an amount received for purposes of this subparagraph a and the next subparagraph b this transfer rule does not apply however to certain transfers of property between spouses or incident to divorce vi in general any amount actually received under the contract as a death benefit including an optional death benefit if any will be treated as an amount received for purposes of this subparagraph a and the next subparagraph b b distributions after annuity commencement date annuity payments made periodically after the annuity commencement date are includable in gross income to the extent the payments exceed the amount determined by the application of the ratio of the investment in the contract to the total amount of the payments to be made after the annuity commencement date the exclusion ratio i when the total of amounts excluded from income by application of the exclusion ratio is equal to the investment in the contract as of the annuity commencement date any additional payments including surrenders will be entirely includable in gross income ii if the annuity payments cease by reason of the death of the annuitant and as of the date of death the amount of annuity payments excluded from gross income by the exclusion ratio does not exceed the investment in the contract as of the annuity commencement date then the remaining portion of unrecovered investment shall be allowed as a deduction for the last taxable year of the annuitant iii generally nonperiodic amounts received or deemed received after the annuity commencement date are not entitled to any exclusion ratio and shall be fully includable in gross income however upon a full surrender after such date only the excess of the amount received after any surrender charge over the remaining investment in the contract shall be includable in gross income except to the extent that the aggregation rule referred to in the next subparagraph c may apply c aggregation of two or more annuity contracts contracts issued after october   by the same insurer or affiliated insurer to the same owner within the same calendar year other than certain contracts held in connection with taxqualified retirement arrangements will be aggregated and treated as one annuity contract for the purpose of determining the taxation of distributions prior to the annuity commencement date an annuity contract received in a taxfree exchange for another annuity contract or life insurance contract may be treated as a new contract for this purpose we believe that for any contracts subject to such aggregation the values under the contracts and the investment in the contracts will be added together to determine the taxation under subparagraph a above of amounts received or deemed received prior to the annuity commencement date withdrawals will first be treated first as withdrawals of income until all of the income from all such contracts is withdrawn in addition the treasury department has specific authority under the aggregation rules in code section e to issue regulations to prevent the avoidance of the incomeoutfirst rules for nonperiodic distributions through the serial purchase of annuity contracts or otherwise as of the date of this prospectus there are no regulations interpreting these aggregation provisions d  penalty tax  applicable to certain withdrawals and annuity payments i if any amount is received or deemed received on the contract before or after the annuity commencement date the code applies a penalty tax equal to ten percent of the portion of the amount includable in gross income unless an exception applies ii the  penalty tax will not apply to the following distributions  distributions made on or after the date the recipient has attained the age of    distributions made on or after the death of the holder or where the holder is not an individual the death of the primary annuitant  distributions attributable to a recipients becoming disabled  a distribution that is part of a scheduled series of substantially equal periodic payments not less frequently than annually for the life or life expectancy of the recipient or the joint lives or life expectancies of the recipient and the recipients designated beneficiary in determining whether a payment stream designed to satisfy this exception qualifies it is possible that the irs could take the position that the entire interest in the contract should include not only the current contract value but also some measure of the value of certain future benefits  distributions made under certain annuities issued in connection with structured settlement agreements  distributions of amounts which are allocable to the investment in the contract prior to august   see next subparagraph e if the taxpayer avoids this  penalty tax by qualifying for the substantially equal periodic payments exception and later such series of payments is modified other than by death or disability the  penalty tax will be applied retroactively to all the prior periodic payments ie penalty tax plus interest thereon unless such modification is made after both a the taxpayer has  hartford life insurance company reached age   and b  years have elapsed since the first of these periodic payments e special provisions affecting contracts obtained through a taxfree exchange of other annuity or life insurance contracts purchased prior to august   if the contract was obtained by a taxfree exchange of a life insurance or annuity contract purchased prior to august   then any amount received or deemed received prior to the annuity commencement date shall be deemed to come  first from the amount of the investment in the contract prior to august   pre investment carried over from the prior contract  then from the portion of the income on the contract carried over to as well as accumulating in the successor contract that is attributable to such pre investment  then from the remaining income on the contract and  last from the remaining investment in the contract as a result to the extent that such amount received or deemed received does not exceed such pre investment such amount is not includable in gross income in addition to the extent that such amount received or deemed received does not exceed the sum of a such pre investment and b the income on the contract attributable thereto such amount is not subject to the  penalty tax in all other respects amounts received or deemed received from such postexchange contracts are generally subject to the rules described in this subparagraph e f required distributions i death of contract owner or primary annuitant subject to the alternative election or spouse beneficiary provisions in ii or iii below  if any contract owner dies on or after the annuity commencement date and before the entire interest in the contract has been distributed the remaining portion of such interest shall be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution being used as of the date of such death  if any contract owner dies before the annuity commencement date the entire interest in the contract shall be distributed within  years after such death and  if the contract owner is not an individual then for purposes of  or  above the primary annuitant under the contract shall be treated as the contract owner and any change in the primary annuitant shall be treated as the death of the contract owner the primary annuitant is the individual the events in the life of whom are of primary importance in affecting the timing or amount of the payout under the contract ii alternative election to satisfy distribution requirements if any portion of the interest of a contract owner described in i above is payable to or for the benefit of a designated beneficiary such beneficiary may elect to have the portion distributed over a period that does not extend beyond the life or life expectancy of the beneficiary such distributions must begin within a year of the contract owners death iii spouse beneficiary if any portion of the interest of a contract owner is payable to or for the benefit of his or her spouse and the annuitant or contingent annuitant is living such spouse shall be treated as the contract owner of such portion for purposes of section i above this spousal contract continuation shall apply only once for this contract g addition of rider or material change the addition of a rider to the contract or a material change in the contracts provisions could cause it to be considered newly issued or entered into for tax purposes and thus could cause the contract to lose certain grandfathered tax status please contact your tax adviser for more information h partial exchanges the irs in rev rul  has confirmed that the owner of an annuity contract can direct its insurer to transfer a portion of the contracts cash value directly to another annuity contract issued by the same insurer or by a different insurer and such a direct transfer can qualify for taxfree exchange treatment under code section  a partial exchange however rev rul  also refers to caveats and additional guidance in the companion notice  which discusses cases in which a partial exchange is followed by a surrender withdrawal or other distribution from either the old contract or the new contract notice  specifically indicates that the irs is considering  under what circumstances it should treat a partial exchange followed by such a distribution within  months as presumptively for tax avoidance purposes eg to avoid the incomeoutfirst rules on amounts received under code section  and  what circumstances it should treat as rebutting such a presumption eg death disability reaching age   divorce or loss of employment accordingly we advise you to consult with a qualified tax adviser as to potential tax consequences before attempting any partial exchange  diversification requirements the code requires that investments supporting your contract be adequately diversified code section h provides that a variable annuity contract will not be treated as an annuity contract for any period during which the investments made by the separate account or underlying fund are not adequately diversified if a contract is not treated as an annuity contract the contract owner will be subject to income tax on annual increases in cash value the treasury departments diversification regulations under code section h require among other things that  no more than  of the value of the total assets of the segregated asset account underlying a variable contract is represented by any one investment hartford life insurance company   no more than  is represented by any two investments  no more than  is represented by any three investments and  no more than  is represented by any four investments in determining whether the diversification standards are met all securities of the same issuer all interests in the same real property project and all interests in the same commodity are each treated as a single investment in the case of government securities each government agency or instrumentality is treated as a separate issuer a separate account must be in compliance with the diversification standards on the last day of each calendar quarter or within  days after the quarter ends if an insurance company inadvertently fails to meet the diversification requirements the company may still comply within a reasonable period and avoid the taxation of contract income on an ongoing basis however either the insurer or the contract owner must agree to pay the tax due for the period during which the diversification requirements were not met  tax ownership of the assets in the separate account in order for a variable annuity contract to qualify for tax income deferral assets in the separate account supporting the contract must be considered to be owned by the insurance company and not by the contract owner for tax purposes the irs has stated in published rulings that a variable contract owner will be considered the owner of separate account assets for income tax purposes if the contract owner possesses sufficient incidents of ownership in those assets such as the ability to exercise investment control over the assets in circumstances where the variable contract owner is treated as the tax owner of certain separate account assets income and gain from such assets would be includable in the variable contract owners gross income the treasury department indicated in  that in regulations or revenue rulings under code section d relating to the definition of a variable contract it would provide guidance on the extent to which contract owners may direct their investments to particular subaccounts without being treated as tax owners of the underlying shares although no such regulations have been issued to date the irs has issued a number of rulings that indicate that this issue remains subject to a facts and circumstances test for both variable annuity and life insurance contracts for instance the irs in rev rul  reiterated its position in prior rulings that where shares in a fund offered in an insurers separate account are not available exclusively through the purchase of a variable insurance contract eg where such shares can be purchased directly by the general public or others without going through such a variable contract such public availability means that such shares should be treated as owned directly by the contract owner and not by the insurer for tax purposes as if such contract owner had chosen instead to purchase such shares directly without going through the variable contract none of the shares or other interests in the fund choices offered in our separate account for your contract are available for purchase except through an insurers variable contracts or by other permitted entities the irs in rev rul  also indicated that an insurer could provide as many as  fund choices for its variable contract owners each with a general investment strategy eg a small company stock fund or a special industry fund under certain circumstances without causing such a contract owner to be treated as the tax owner of any of the underlying fund assets the ruling does not specify the number of fund options if any that might prevent a variable contract owner from receiving favorable tax treatment as a result we believe that any owner of a contract also should receive the same favorable tax treatment however there is necessarily some uncertainty here as long as the irs continues to use a facts and circumstances test for investor control and other tax ownership issues therefore we reserve the right to modify the contract as necessary to prevent you from being treated as the tax owner of any underlying assets d federal income tax withholding the portion of an amount received under a contract that is taxable gross income to the payee is also subject to federal income tax withholding pursuant to code section  which requires the following  nonperiodic distributions the portion of a nonperiodic distribution that is includable in gross income is subject to federal income tax withholding unless an individual elects not to have such tax withheld election out we will provide such an election out form at the time such a distribution is requested if the necessary election out form is not submitted to us in a timely manner generally we are required to withhold  percent of the includable amount of distribution and remit it to the irs  periodic distributions payable over a period greater than one year the portion of a periodic distribution that is includable in gross income is generally subject to federal income tax withholding as if the payee were a married individual claiming  exemptions unless the individual elects otherwise an individual generally may elect out of such withholding or elect to have income tax withheld at a different rate by providing a completed election form we will provide such an election form at the time such a distribution is requested if the necessary election out forms are not submitted to us in a timely manner we are required to withhold tax as if the recipient were married claiming  exemptions and remit this amount to the irs regardless of any election out or any amount of tax actually withheld on an amount received from a contract the payee is generally liable for any failure to pay the full amount of tax due on the includable portion of such amount received a payee  hartford life insurance company also may be required to pay penalties under estimated income tax rules if the withholding and estimated tax payments are insufficient to satisfy the payees total tax liability e general provisions affecting qualified retirement plans the contract may be used for a number of qualified retirement plans if the contract is being purchased with respect to some form of qualified retirement plan please refer to appendix i for information relative to the types of plans for which it may be used and the general explanation of the tax features of such plans f annuity purchases by nonresident aliens and foreign corporations the discussion above provides general information regarding us federal income tax consequences to annuity purchasers that are us citizens or residents purchasers that are not us citizens or residents will generally be subject to us federal income tax and mandatory withholding on us source taxable annuity distributions at a  rate unless a lower treaty rate applies and any required tax forms are submitted to us if withholding applies we are required to withhold tax at the  rate or a lower treaty rate if applicable and remit it to the irs in addition purchasers may be subject to state premium tax other state andor municipal taxes and taxes that may be imposed by the purchasers country of citizenship or residence g estate gift and generationskipping tax and related tax considerations any amount payable upon a contract owners death whether before or after the annuity commencement date is generally includable in the contract owners estate for federal estate tax purposes similarly prior to the contract owners death the payment of any amount from the contract or the transfer of any interest in the contract to a beneficiary or other person for less than adequate consideration may have federal gift tax consequences in addition any transfer to or designation of a nonspouse beneficiary who either is    or more years younger than a contract owner or  a grandchild or more remote further descendent of a contract owner may have federal generationskippingtransfer gst tax consequences under code section  regulations under code section  may require us to deduct any such gst tax from your contract or from any applicable payment and pay it directly to the irs however any federal estate gift or gst tax payment with respect to a contract could produce an offsetting income tax deduction for a beneficiary or transferee under code section c partially offsetting such federal estate or gst tax or a basis increase for a beneficiary or transferee under code section c or section d in addition as indicated above in distributions prior to the annuity commencement date the transfer of a contract for less than adequate consideration during the contract owners lifetime generally is treated as producing an amount received by such contract owner that is subject to both income tax and the  penalty tax to the extent that such an amount deemed received causes an amount to be includable currently in such contract owners gross income this same income amount could produce a corresponding increase in

however an annuity contract that is used as an ira may provide a death benefit that equals the greater of the premiums paid or the contracts cash value the contract offers an enhanced death benefit that may exceed the greater of the contract value or total premium payments the tax rules are unclear as to what extent an ira can provide a death benefit that exceeds the greater of the iras cash value or the sum of the premiums paid and other contributions into the ira please note that the ira rider for the contract has provisions that are designed to maintain the contracts tax qualification as an ira and therefore could limit certain benefits under the contract including endorsement rider or option benefits to maintain the contracts tax qualification sep iras code section k provides for a traditional ira in the form of an employersponsored defined contribution plan known as a simplified employee pension sep or a sep ira a sep ira can have employer employee and salary reduction

entity can establish a deferred compensation plan under code section  for these purposes a governmental employer is a state a political subdivision of a state or an agency or an instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state a deferred compensation plan that meets the requirements of code section b is called an eligible deferred compensation plan or section b plan code section b limits the amount of contributions that can be made to an eligible deferred compensation plan on behalf of a participant in addition under code section d a section b plan may not make amounts available for distribution to participants or beneficiaries before  the calendar year in which the participant attains age    the participant has a severance from employment including death or  the participant is faced with an unforeseeable emergency as determined in accordance with regulations all of the assets and income of an eligible deferred compensation plan for a governmental employer must be held in trust for the exclusive benefit of participants and their beneficiaries this trust requirement does not apply to amounts under an eligible deferred compensation plan of a taxexempt nongovernmental employer in addition this trust requirement does not apply to amounts held under a deferred compensation plan of a governmental employer that is not a section b plan however where the trust requirement does not apply amounts held under a section  plan must remain subject to the claims of the employers general creditors  taxation of amounts received from qualified plans except under certain circumstances in the case of roth iras amounts received from qualified contracts or plans generally are taxed as ordinary income under code section  to the extent that they are not treated as a taxfree recovery of aftertax contributions or other investment in the contract for annuity payments and other amounts received after the annuity commencement date from a qualified contract or plan the tax rules for determining what portion of each amount received hartford life insurance company  represents a taxfree recovery of investment in the contract are generally the same as for nonqualified contracts as described above for nonperiodic amounts from certain qualified contracts or plans code section e provides special rules that generally treat a portion of each amount received as a taxfree recovery of the investment in the contract based on the ratio of the investment in the contract over the contract value at the time of distribution however in determining such a ratio certain aggregation rules may apply and may vary depending on the type of qualified contract or plan for instances all traditional iras owned by the same individual are generally aggregated for these purposes but such an aggregation does not include any ira inherited by such individual or any roth ira owned by such individual in addition penalty taxes mandatory tax withholding or rollover rules may apply to amounts received from a qualified contract or plan as indicated below accordingly you are advised to consult with a qualified tax adviser before taking or receiving any amount including a loan from a qualified contract or plan  penalty taxes for qualified plans unlike nonqualified contracts qualified contracts are subject to federal penalty taxes not just on premature distributions but also on excess contributions and failures to make required minimum distributions rmds penalty taxes on excess contributions can vary by type of qualified plan and which person made the excess contribution eg employer or an employee the penalty taxes on premature distributions and failures to make timely rmds are more uniform and are described in more detail below a penalty taxes on premature distributions code section t imposes a penalty income tax equal to  of the taxable portion of a distribution from certain types of qualified plans that is made before the employee reaches age   however this  penalty tax does not apply to a distribution that is either  made to a beneficiary or to the employees estate on or after the employees death  attributable to the employees becoming disabled under code section m  part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments not less frequently than annually  sepps made for the life or life expectancy of the employee or the joint lives or joint life expectancies of such employee and a designated beneficiary sepp exception and for certain qualified plans other than iras such a series must begin after the employee separates from service  except for iras made to an employee after separation from service after reaching age  or  not greater than the amount allowable as a deduction to the employee for eligible medical expenses during the taxable year in addition the  penalty tax does not apply to a distribution from an ira that is either  made after separation from employment to an unemployed ira owner for health insurance premiums if certain conditions are met  not in excess of the amount of certain qualifying higher education expenses as defined by code section t or  for a qualified firsttime home buyer and meets the requirements of code section t if the taxpayer avoids this  penalty tax by qualifying for the sepp exception and later such series of payments is modified other than by death or disability the  penalty tax will be applied retroactively to all the prior periodic payments ie penalty tax plus interest thereon unless such modification is made after both a the employee has reached age   and b  years have elapsed since the first of these periodic payments for any premature distribution from a simple ira during the first  years that an individual participates in a salary reduction arrangement maintained by that individuals employer under a simple plan the  penalty tax rate is increased to  b rmds and  penalty tax if the amount distributed from a qualified contract or plan is less than the amount of the required minimum distribution rmd for the year the participant is subject to a  penalty tax on the amount that has not been timely distributed an individuals interest in a qualified plan generally must be distributed or begin to be distributed not later than the required beginning date generally the required beginning date is april  of the calendar year following the later of  the calendar year in which the individual attains age   or  except in the case of an ira or a  owner as defined in the code the calendar year in which a participant retires from service with the employer sponsoring a qualified plan that allows such a later required beginning date the entire interest of the individual must be distributed beginning no later than the required beginning date over  a the life of the individual or the lives of the individual and a designated beneficiary as specified in the code or b over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of the individual or the joint life expectancy of the individual and a designated beneficiary if an individual dies before reaching the required beginning date the individuals entire interest generally must be distributed within  years after the individuals death however this rmd rule will be deemed satisfied if distributions begin before the close of the calendar year following the individuals death to a designated beneficiary and distribution is over the life of such designated beneficiary or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of such beneficiary if such beneficiary is the  hartford life insurance company individuals surviving spouse distributions may be delayed until the deceased individual would have attained age   if an individual dies after rmds have begun for such individual any remainder of the individuals interest generally must be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution in effect at the time of the individuals death the rmd rules that apply while the contract owner is alive do not apply with respect to roth iras the rmd rules applicable after the death of the owner apply to all qualified plans including roth iras in addition if the owner of a traditional or roth ira dies and the owners surviving spouse is the sole designated beneficiary this surviving spouse may elect to treat the traditional or roth ira as his or her own the rmd amount for each year is determined generally by dividing the account balance by the applicable life expectancy this account balance is generally based upon the account value as of the close of business on the last day of the previous calendar year rmd incidental benefit rules also may require a larger annual rmd amount rmds also can be made in the form of annuity payments that satisfy the rules set forth in regulations under the code relating to rmds in addition in computing any rmd amount based on a contracts account value such account value must include the actuarial value of certain additional benefits provided by the contract as a result electing an optional benefit under a qualified contract may require the rmd amount for such qualified contract to be increased each year and expose such additional rmd amount to the  penalty tax for rmds if such additional rmd amount is not timely distributed  tax withholding for qualified plans distributions from a qualified contract or qualified plan generally are subject to federal income tax withholding requirements these federal income tax withholding requirements including any elections out and the rate at which withholding applies generally are the same as for periodic and nonperiodic distributions from a nonqualified contract as described above except where the distribution is an eligible rollover distribution described below in rollover distributions in the latter case tax withholding is mandatory at a rate of  of the taxable portion of the eligible rollover distribution to the extent it is not directly rolled over to an ira or other eligible retirement plan described below in rollover distributions payees cannot elect out of this mandatory  withholding in the case of such an eligible rollover distribution also special withholding rules apply with respect to distributions from nongovernmental section b plans and to distributions made to individuals who are neither citizens or resident aliens of the united states regardless of any election out or any actual amount of tax actually withheld on an amount received from a qualified contract or plan the payee is generally liable for any failure to pay the full amount of tax due on the includable portion of such amount received a payee also may be required to pay penalties under estimated income tax rules if the withholding and estimated tax payments are insufficient to satisfy the payees total tax liability  rollover distributions the current tax rules and limits for taxfree rollovers and transfers between qualified plans vary according to  the type of transferor plan and transferee plan  whether the amount involved is transferred directly between plan fiduciaries a direct transfer or a direct rollover or is distributed first to a participant or beneficiary who then transfers that amount back into another eligible plan within  days a day rollover and  whether the distribution is made to a participant spouse or other beneficiary accordingly we advise you to consult with a qualified tax adviser before receiving any amount from a qualified contract or plan or attempting some form of rollover or transfer with a qualified contract or plan for instance generally any amount can be transferred directly from one type of qualified plan eg a tsa to the same type of plan for the benefit of the same individual without limit or federal income tax if the transferee plan is subject to the same kinds of restrictions as the transferor plan eg a tsa that is subject to the same kinds of salary reduction restrictions such a direct transfer between the same kind of plan is generally not treated as any form of distribution out of such a plan for federal income tax purposes by contrast an amount distributed from one type of plan eg a tsa into a different type of plan eg a traditional ira generally is treated as a distribution out of the first plan for federal income tax purposes and therefore to avoid being subject to such tax such a distribution must qualify either as a direct rollover made directly to another plan fiduciary or as a day rollover the tax restrictions and other rules for a direct rollover and a day rollover are similar in many ways but if any eligible rollover distribution made from certain types of qualified plan is not transferred directly to another plan fiduciary by a direct rollover then it is subject to mandatory  withholding even if it is later contributed to that same plan in a day rollover by the recipient under code sections fa and c an eligible rollover distribution which is both eligible for rollover treatment and subject to  mandatory withholding absent a direct rollover is generally any distribution to an employee of any portion or all of the balance to the employees credit in any of the following types of eligible retirement plan  a qualified plan under code section a qualified a plan  a qualified annuity plan under code section a qualified annuity plan  a tsa under code section b or  a governmental section b plan however an eligible rollover distribution does not include any distribution that is either a an rmd amount b one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments not less frequently than annually made either i for the hartford life insurance company  life or life expectancy of the employee or the joint lives or joint life expectancies of the employee and a designated beneficiary or ii for a specified period of  years or more or c any distribution made upon hardship of the employee before making an eligible rollover distribution a plan administrator generally is required under code section f to provide the recipient with advance written notice of the direct rollover and day rollover rules and the distributions exposure to the  mandatory withholding if it is not made by direct rollover generally under code sections c b and e a direct rollover or a day rollover of an eligible rollover distribution can be made to a traditional ira or to another eligible retirement plan that agrees to accept such a rollover however the maximum amount of an eligible rollover distribution that can qualify for a taxfree day rollover is limited to the amount that otherwise would be includable in gross income by contrast a direct rollover of an eligible rollover distribution can include aftertax contributions as well if the direct rollover is made either to a traditional ira or to another form of eligible retirement plan that agrees to account separately for such a rollover including accounting for such aftertax amounts separately from the otherwise taxable portion of this rollover separate accounting also is required for all amounts taxable or not that are rolled into a governmental section b plan from either a qualified section a plan qualified annuity plan tsa or ira these amounts when later distributed from the governmental section b plan are subject to any premature distribution penalty tax applicable to distributions from such a predecessor qualified plan rollover rules for distributions from iras under code sections d and ad also vary according to the type of transferor ira and type of transferee ira or other plan for instance generally no taxfree direct rollover or day rollover can be made between a nonroth ira traditional sep or simple ira and a roth ira and a transfer from nonroth ira to a roth ira or a conversion of a nonroth ira to a roth ira is subject to special rules in addition generally no taxfree direct rollover or day rollover can be made between an inherited ira nonroth or roth for a beneficiary and an ira set up by that same individual as the original owner generally any amount other than an rmd distributed from a traditional or sep ira is eligible for a direct rollover or a day rollover to another traditional ira for the same individual similarly any amount other than an rmd distributed from a roth ira is generally eligible for a direct rollover or a day rollover to another roth ira for the same individual however in either case such a taxfree day rollover is limited to  per year day period whereas no year limit applies to any such direct rollover similar rules apply to a direct rollover or a day rollover of a distribution from a simple ira to another simple ira or a traditional ira except that any distribution of employer contributions from a simple ira during the initial year period in which the individual participates in the employers simple plan is generally disqualified and subject to the  penalty tax on premature distributions if it is not rolled into another simple ira for that individual amounts other than rmds distributed from a traditional or sep ira or simple ira after the initial year period also are eligible for a direct rollover or a day rollover to an eligible retirement plan eg a tsa that accepts such a rollover but any such rollover is limited to the amount of the distribution that otherwise would be includable in gross income ie aftertax contributions are not eligible special rules also apply to transfers or rollovers for the benefit of a spouse or exspouse plan distributions of property and obtaining a waiver of the day limit for a taxfree rollover from the irs  qualified hurricane relief the katrina emergency tax relief act of  ketra signed by the president on september   contains several provisions regarding distributions from qualified plans for participants who were affected by hurricane katrina generally ketra allows eligible persons to take distributions from their retirement plans without being subject to the  penalty on early distributions and permits the income portion of such distribution to be included in taxable income ratably over a threeyear period ketra also allows such distributed amounts to be recontributed to the retirement plan within three years and such recontribution will be treated as a rollover contribution thus avoiding taxation of the distributed amounts the total amount of qualified ketra distributions that an eligible person may receive from all qualified plans is limited to  ketra also provides relief for certain qualified plan withdrawals made in connection with home purchases which were cancelled because of hurricane katrina and modifies the qualified plan loan rules for certain loans taken by

is an affiliate of ours both hsd and hartford are ultimately controlled by the hartford financial services group inc the principal business address of hsd is the same as ours hartford currently pays

commissions paid to hsd in its role as principal underwriter has been     and   performance related information the separate account may advertise certain performancerelated information concerning the subaccounts performance information about a subaccount is based on the subaccounts past performance only and is no indication of future performance total return for all subaccounts when a subaccount advertises its standardized total return it will usually be calculated from the date of the inception of the subaccount for one five and ten year periods or some other relevant periods if the subaccount has not been in existence for at least ten years total return is measured by comparing the value of an investment in the subaccount at the beginning of the relevant period to the value of the investment at the end of the period to calculate standardized total return hartford uses a hypothetical initial premium payment of  and deducts for the mortality and risk expense charge the highest possible contingent deferred charge any applicable administrative charge and the annual maintenance fee the formula hartford uses to calculate standardized total return is pt to the power of n  erv in this calculation p represents a hypothetical initial premium payment of  t represents the average annual total return n represents the number of years and erv represents the redeemable value at the end of the period in addition to the standardized total return the subaccount may advertise a nonstandardized total return these figures will usually be calculated from the date of inception of the underlying fund for one five and ten year periods or other relevant periods nonstandardized total return is measured in the same manner as the standardized total return described above except that the contingent deferred sales charge and the annual maintenance fee are not deducted therefore nonstandardized total return for a subaccount is higher than standardized total return for a subaccount hartford life insurance company  yield for subaccounts if applicable the subaccounts may advertise yield in addition to total return at any time in the future yields may be higher or lower than past yields and past performance is no indication of future performance the standardized yield will be computed for periods beginning with the inception of the subaccount in the following manner the net investment income per accumulation unit earned during a onemonth period is divided by the accumulation unit value on the last day of the period the formula hartford uses to calculate yield is yield  a  bcd  to the power of    in this calculation a represents the net investment income earned during the period by the underlying fund b represents the expenses accrued for the period c represents the average daily number of accumulation units outstanding during the period and d represents the maximum offering price per accumulation unit on the last day of the period money market subaccounts at any time in the future current and effective yields may be higher or lower than past yields and past performance is no indication of future performance current yield of a money market fund subaccount is calculated for a sevenday period or the base period without taking into consideration any realized or unrealized gains or losses on shares of the underlying fund the first step in determining yield is to compute the base period return hartford takes a hypothetical account with a balance of one accumulation unit of the subaccount and calculates the net change in its value from the beginning of the base period to the end of the base period hartford then subtracts an amount equal to the total deductions for the contract and then divides that number by the value of the account at the beginning of the base period the result is the base period return or bpr once the base period return is calculated hartford then multiplies it by  to compute the current yield current yield is calculated to the nearest hundredth of one percent the formula for this calculation is yield  bpr x  where bpr  a  bc a is equal to the net change in value of a hypothetical account with a balance of one accumulation unit of the subaccount from the beginning of the base period to the end of the base period b is equal to the amount that hartford deducts for mortality and expense risk charge any applicable administrative charge and the annual maintenance fee c represents the value of the subaccount at the beginning of the base period effective yield is also calculated using the base period return the effective yield is calculated by adding  to the base period return and raising that result to a power equal to  divided by  and subtracting  from the result the calculation hartford uses is effective
