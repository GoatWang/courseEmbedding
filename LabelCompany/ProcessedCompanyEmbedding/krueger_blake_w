collective brands’ performance  lifestyle group for  billion the deal transforms wolverine into the thirdlargest footwear company in the world behind giants nike and adidas “given that wolverine markets  footwear brands in over  countries and territories around the world taking a global view of the macroeconomic environment is inherent in our dna and mindset “for the next several years we expect the global economic environment to continue to be more volatile and challenging than the historical norm while each region has its own challenges slow or slowing gdp growth low consumer confidence and doubledip recessions appear to be universally frontandcenter concerns fundamentally the world is in the process of deleveraging with many municipalities states and countries overspending and overpromising for the last  years on this scale deleveraging will be politically and socially very difficult as we have already begun to see in europe “however there are always winners in every macroeconomic environment and opportunities to generate growth — it just takes more focus and commitment than it does when times are good for example my team has been able to drive company revenue to record levels in four of the last five years how was this achieved by the relentless execution of our ‘threelegged’ global brandbuilding model which is centered on —  innovative footwear  brand extensions into apparel and accessories and  the expansion of our consumerdirect businesses finally while the footwear industry is not recessionproof there is always a good deal of consumer ‘need’ as well as ‘want’ allowing our industry to do relatively well in more challenging times because the purchase of a new pair of shoes can be an easy way for a person to feel good when

impacted by soft consumer demand in this challenging landscape our business model strong brand  quickly to mitigate headwinds proved to be critically important in generating quality results largely due to our early recognition of the overall retail and global consumer environment while our fullyear financial performance did not live up to our original expectations we continued to invest in our

new year im pleased to report that weve made significant progress against our key strategic initiatives we took important steps to strengthen the company and to position our portfolio of brands for

well as  guidance focusing on our fullyear brand operating group performances starting with the performance group underlying revenue grew at  versus the prior year led by exceptional growth in chaco which posted growth of better than  saucony which grew at a lowteens rate and merrell which added growth in the lowsingle digits underlying revenue for the lifestyle group was down less than  with sperry growing lowsingle digits keds up midsingle digits and stride rite down lowsingle digits driven primarily from planned store closures hush puppies saw an underlying revenue decline in the lowteens due to our decision to exit some domestic distribution encouragingly the brands international thirdparty business remains strong with revenue growth in the lowteens on a constant currency basis underlying revenue for the heritage group was flat with cat and harleydavidson growing lowsingle digits wolverine down lowsingle digits and bates and hytest producing midsingle digit growth ill now use this opportunity to outline the companys strategic direction and our progress on the key priorities for the business in the coming year we take a very active approach in managing our global brand portfolio to ensure that we aggressively fuel growth and take advantage of opportunities in key markets around the world over the last year weve executed on our multiyear demand creation investment strategy and also focused on saucony chaco and ecommerce at the same time we responsibly addressed underperforming businesses including the exit of the cushe brand and took actions to improve the performance of our retail stores weve also recently taken action to accelerate our global apparel and accessories initiatives across the organization all of these moves are designed to drive growth increase profitability and create value for our shareholders over the past few months weve taken a number of important steps first lets start with the actions weve executed in our retail store operations stride rite plays an important role as a childrens expert in our portfolio and has a profitable and healthy wholesale and ecommerce business however its store business has underperformed consequently in  we accelerated store closures and improved the performance of the goforward stores by infusing new leadership and applying a sharp focus to the business during the allimportant backtoschool and holiday season as a result we saw the yearoveryear comparative sales trends improve over  basis points in the fourth quarter relative to the first three quarters of the year encouragingly these better results have continued and accelerated in early  in november to further align and leverage all of our directtoconsumer operations stride rite was moved into a consolidated consumer direct group looking ahead to  we will close more stores as part of our strategic realignment plan improve the profitability of our goforward stores and fuel our rapidly growing ecommerce business performance of our retail stores has improved significantly and were encouraged about the direction of the business today we recognize that our apparel and accessory initiatives have not evolved at an acceptable pace and during q we took the action to accelerate growth in these important categories many of our brands have significant global lifestyle opportunities and continued expansion beyond footwear is a critical strategic initiative for the company to accelerate our progress we centralized all of our brand apparel and accessory teams under a new seasoned leader to coordinate efforts and to take advantage of the opportunities across the portfolio theres much more to come here but these changes put us in a much better position to win and thus far im encouraged by our progress we firmly believe that growth starts with intimately knowing our consumers including who they are what they want and how we can better exceed their expectations in  we will significantly increase our investments in consumer insights more than doubling our people and resources in this area better and more meaningful consumer insights will directly benefit our product design and innovation engine we will amplify trend research and roll out a new innovation and design center focused on the consumer product design and marketing the innovation and design center will act as a powerful catalyst for innovation across the organization and play a critical role in influencing the future of the company directly driving vital growth projects and new technology introductions and fundamentally changing the way we operate through consumer insights product innovation and compelling marketing we remain focused on organically growing our brands around the world turning briefly to external growth initiatives we have a successful year track record of adding brands to our portfolio and well continue our pursuit of potential acquisition opportunities our capital structure and organizational readiness gives us the capability to take on a strategic acquisition and ma has been and continues to be a core competency of the organization since the close of our most recent acquisition weve reduced our net debt by nearly  million this said we have a welldefined set of acquisition criteria against which we evaluate all opportunities and are not operating against any internal timeline to execute the next acquisition today accelerating organic growth is our priority but its also important to monitor potential acquisitions in the event the right strategic fit and valueenhancing opportunity becomes available to the company switching gears id now like to spend a few minutes focusing on merrell sperry saucony the three largest brands in our portfolio merrell is positioned to gotomarket in  with a comprehensive and exciting plan delivering new product amplified marketing and strong execution at retail new product introductions are planned to create big stories enable the brand to build on its winning moab and capra collections through an expanded product line and strategic distribution segmentation the moab franchise is already the industrys bestselling lightweight hiking shoe and capra is expected to pass  million pairs this year merrell also plans to lead our brand in introducing the gamechanging arctic grip antislip technology which improves traction up to three times on wet icy surfaces this is a remarkable innovation to experience in person as some of you did at the outdoor retailer show our global exposure for this breakthrough technology which will originally be incorporated in our merrell saucony sperry wolverine cat and hush puppies brands for this fall delivers a meaningful competitive advantage for clearly differentiated product merrell and our other brands will bring this technology to consumers through aggressive goto market strategies including significant retail partnerships to create an extensive point of sale presence merrell will also be the firstever presenting sponsor of tough mudder the leading outdoor obstacle challenge which has been run by over  million participants around the world our second largest brand sperry is focused on moving beyond its franchise boat shoe category where it remains dominant to develop as a global lifestyle brand although the boat shoe category slowed this past year due to a shift towards more athleticinspired silhouettes the sperry nonboat shoe styles grew nearly  and now account for nearly half of the total business the saltwater duck boot collection was a fantastic success in q and propelled sperry to the number two rank in the rain boot category according to npd the saltwater was the number one boot in the united states for this fall the sperry boot program will be greatly expanded for fall  and theres been an incredible early response from retailers to the broader program the brand will also introduce the new paul sperry collection this year a modern and innovative collection to connect with our younger consumer and capitalize on the athleisure trend and im excited about the great new product in the sperry pipeline and encouraged by what im hearing in the marketplace especially from our consumers saucony our third largest brand remains intensely focused on product innovation the brand has grown over the past several years with a steady introduction of cuttingedge technologies saucony launched the everun cushioning and energy return technology in late  and plans to expand this awardwinning innovation

introduced in late  also continue to build in addition the brand will ramp up its life on the run collection with new product introductions which we believe represents a significant growth opportunity in the athletic casual athleisure category finally the heritageinspired saucony originals business which grew over  in  will continue to move forward with fresh product designs compelling storytelling and strategic distribution expansion finally i want to spend a minute providing you with an update on our omnichannel initiative and the strong growths were seeing as a result of our efforts ecommerce development across our portfolio continues to present a significant growth opportunity as we create a stronger bond with our consumers we strategically invested in  and drove accelerated growth outpacing the industry especially in the last quarter of the year with growth of nearly  we will continue to invest in this fast growing profitable channel in  focusing on a seamless omnichannel brand experience for the consumer especially in mobile which experienced growth of over  in  the consumer and retail marketplace continue to evolve at a rapid pace and were excited and energized about the new opportunities ahead in this area transitioning now to our expectations for the year ahead i feel very good about where the company stands today and im excited about our efforts to take advantage of our many global opportunities and to address the segments of the business that were not meeting our expectations i am however a little cautious about the year ahead as the visibility into  is less clear than normal domestically we expect the hangover from a tepid holiday retail season coupled with high inventory lessons – or levels to have a meaningful impact on the first half of  the shift in consumer behavior is also continuing with consumers migrating to online channel and both consumers and retailers buying closer to need globally some of the uncontrollable challenges currency issues economic slowdown in some key countries and geopolitical volatility are expected to continue and have become the new normal while  will present some challenges we see the year ahead as real opportunity we have a great brand portfolio broad geographic reach an exceptional operating platform and a talented and nimble team focused on the consumer and driving product innovation with respect to our  outlook we expect revenue to be impacted by over  million due to store closures the cushe exit and currency we also expect currency to have around an  per share impact on eps despite these headwinds we expect our revenue and earnings to be about flat with  at the top end of our current  guidance range while visibility into the current year is a little more murky than usual we do expect revenue and earnings to be stronger in the second half as excess retail inventory clears and our largest brands introduce significant new product collections for merrell growth in  will be driven by the expanded product offerings in franchise collections including moab capra and all out which will be released this summer and fall as part of the brands gotomarket partnerships with key retailers the arctic grip program for merrell and five of our other brands will roll out this fall the first merrellsponsored tough mudder event will not happen until late march with over  events across seven countries scheduled for the rest of the year we expect sperry to have a challenging first half given continued softness in boat shoes with growth coming in the second half on the strength of its expanded boot and not boat product offerings in  sperry grew nonboat shoe categories to nearly  of sales and we expect this trend to continue finally saucony should continue to generate growth throughout the year on the strength of its technology athleisure and originals product offering mike stornant will provide more details in a moment and we will of course provide additional insight and update as the year progresses looking ahead we are focused on our consumers and on delivering outstanding product innovation our business model has been a differentiator and earnings generator during times of change and its allowed us to consistently invest in our strategic priorities while returning value to our shareholders on that note i want to sincerely thank our  wolverine team members around the world for their hard work dedication to the company and most importantly their passion for our brands and consumers with that ill now turn the call over to mike stornant our senior vice president and chief financial officer wholl provide additional commentary on our  result as well as provide guidance for  mike michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp thanks blake and thanks to all of you for joining us on the call today during his prepared remarks blake provided meaningful insight regarding our  fourth quarter and full year results i would like to add that im extremely pleased with our performance during a volatile time after a very strong start to the year in midseptember we foreshadowed the current environment and the company responded quickly to the challenge we acted early swiftly and with a strong sense of urgency all consistent with wolverines culture and core values as a result our early actions allowed us to overcome tough conditions and we are now wellpositioned to navigate the uncertain global landscape in front of us let me review the specifics of the companys fourth quarter performance followed by greater detail on full year results the companys earnings performance was strong relative to a challenging retail environment as global economic pressures worsened holiday sales proved tepid and the unseasonably warm weather persisted in certain regions we proactively managed the business to deliver earnings growth and strong cash flow in the quarter adjusted q earnings per share of  were in line with our guidance representing a  increase over the prior years  on a constant currency basis adjusted earnings per share were  representing significant growth of  versus the prior year on a reported basis earnings per share were  compared to  fourth quarter reported revenue of  million was in line with our guidance underlying revenue declined  versus the prior year and reported revenue was down  our diversified brand portfolio helped mitigate risk in the quarter led by exceptional doubledigit growth from our third largest brand saucony this performance included doubledigit constant currency growth in all geographic regions fueled by continued product innovation including everun and new originals offerings chaco continued its positive momentum and contributed strong lowteens growth in the quarter and full year growth of just over  the chaco business continues to generate great momentum the stride rite wholesale business performed well in q growing strong doubledigits and benefiting from the new surprize by stride rite program recently introduced at target the sperry brand exceeded our expectations for the quarter down low singledigits against strong highsingledigit growth last year sperry experienced very healthy tripledigit growth in boots specifically the trendright saltwater duck boot collection offset by projected lower boat shoe sales merrells q constant currency revenue was down lowsingle digit due mostly to softness in the cold weather performance boot category offset by improvements in the active lifestyle category entering q we anticipated a variety of headwinds including troubling macroeconomic factors for some of our key international markets however the pervasive warm weather in certain regions of the us and other international markets presented an additional challenge for a few of our brands with significant cold weather product offerings particularly boots merrell cat and wolverine experienced some softness in the quarter due to weather our work boot brands were also impacted by high unemployment in the oil and construction sectors and soft economic conditions in key international markets especially russia fourth quarter constant currency revenue was down highsingle digits for wolverine brand and down highteens for cat as a result of the challenging macroeconomic conditions mentioned above ecommerce is strategic priority for the company was a bright spot in q and grew almost  including strong doubledigit growth from our three largest brands merrell sperry and saucony mobile grew tripledigits in q as planned we continued to close underperforming stores during the quarter in addition new leadership and operational improvements resulted in a much better yearoveryear comparative store sales trend in q which was up over  basis points relative to the first three quarters of the year fullyear reported revenue of  billion was in line with our guidance and represents underlying growth of  on a reported basis revenue was down  fullyear adjusted gross margin on a constant currency basis was  compared to  in the prior year as a result of proactive strategic price increases early in the year and effective management of product costs reported gross margin was  for  adjusted operating margin on a constant currency basis was  compared to  last year higher pension expense and planned incremental brand investments accounted for approximately  basis points of deleverage discipline over the remaining operating expenses resulted in approximately  basis points of improvement fiscal  adjusted operating margin was  and reported

a strong balance sheet we ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of  million and net debt of  million down  million since yearend  and down nearly  million since the acquisition of plg in  as of yearend our leverage ratio was  times compared to  times at the closing of the plg acquisition adjusted ebitda was  million for the year to return value to our shareholders we repurchased  million in common stock during  leaving  million of our share buyback authorization available as we entered  we also paid out  million in dividends to our shareholders during fiscal  net working capital was  million down  versus the prior year accounts receivable improved by  million while inventories increased  or  million ending inventory was approximately  million higher than expected due to lower q boot sales and the soft retail environment nearly all of that excess is comprised of core boot and other carryover styles the quality of our inventory remains very high with closeout and aged inventory at relatively low levels we will continue to work through our inventory in a rational manner over the coming months and expect to reach normalized levels during the second half of  overall our priorities for cash are as follows drive organic growth primarily through investments in product innovation omnichannel growth and demand creation return value to shareholders through share repurchases and consistent dividends pay down our debt and pursue potential valueenhancing acquisitions before moving to our discussion on  and related guidance i want to provide an update on the companys strategic realignment plan which is primarily focused on addressing stores that are underperforming in todays difficult retail environment this plan was initiated in  and updated most recently during our q  earnings call we have closed  stores through  and plan to close approximately  stores in  including  at normal lease expiration in addition to store closures weve restructured our dtc organization resulting in a more efficient lower cost infrastructure appropriate for the size and complexity of our fleet the strategic realignment plan was focused mainly on addressing our underperforming stride rite stores during the fourth quarter we recognized noncash fixed asset impairment charges of  million related to the projected performance of stores that will close in the future and a trade name impairment of  million for stride rite now i would like to transition to our  revenue and earnings guidance we believe that the soft consumer demand and challenging retail environment experienced in the fourth quarter of  will continue into the new year both domestically and in key international regions limited visibility into the back half of  is contributing to a higher level of uncertainty and conservatism for many of our global customers and distributors as a result we are taking a cautious position regarding our  guidance while our current view may ultimately prove to be somewhat conservative a number of unusual factors are impacting our outlook including higher than normal inventory levels at retail resulting in limited opentobuy until seasonal goods are liquidated currency headwinds from a persistently strong us dollar which have resulted in higher product costs in most international markets financial instability for some of our domestic retailers and global customers ongoing softness in global demand as evidenced by persistent downward pressure on commodity prices and a slowdown in chinas economy and strong trends in ecommerce growth which have put pressure on traditional brickandmortar retailers revenue in  will be negatively impacted by approximately  million due to fx translation store closures and the exit of the cushe business with this in mind we expect  reported revenue in the range of  billion to  billion a decline in the range of approximately  to  and  underlying revenue to be almost flat with  at the highend of our range gross margin is expected to benefit from the price increases implemented midway through  and lower product costs in the second half of  offset by approximately  basis points of negative foreign currency impact as a result gross margin is expected to be flat to slightly down in  we expect flat to slightly lower adjusted operating margin versus the prior year despite strong currency headwinds and slightly lower underlying revenue operating margin will benefit from our ongoing strategic realignment plan and other reorganization activities executed earlier this year along with meaningfully lower pension expense we remain committed to our multiyear investment plan focused on delivering future growth through demand creation our omnichannel ecommerce business consumer insights and product innovation capabilities we expect  net interest and other expenses of approximately  million to  million an effective tax rate of approximately  and diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately  million shares as a result of these inputs fullyear fiscal  adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected in the range of  to  which includes the negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately  per share on a constant currency basis adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of  to  growth of  to  additional store closures and other h nonrecurring restructuring costs of about  million or approximately  per share results in expected reported earnings per share in the range of  to  we are forecasting fullyear depreciation and amortization of approximately  million and adjusted ebitda in the range of  million to  million capital expenditures are expected in the range of  million to  million primarily for investments in omnichannel initiatives information technology and distribution center and other facility enhancements focusing on q  we expect reported revenue to decline in the range of approximately  to  and q underlying revenue to decline in the range of approximately  to  adjusted diluted earnings per share for the first quarter are expected in the range of  to  reflecting lower revenue a negative foreign currency impact of approximately  and the earlier phasing of incremental brand investments compared to last year on a constant currency basis adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of  to  reported earnings per share are expected in the range of  to  during  we will focus on those things that we can control and adjust to the current conditions which we consider to be the new normal in this environment we plan to continue our incremental investment strategy focusing on our product innovation engine consumer insights the critical starting point for all of our initiatives and decisions as a company the organic growth of our brands particularly merrell ecommerce and mobile infrastructure and apparel and accessories opportunities let me simply conclude by saying that despite a cautious outlook for  we will continue to be diligent and deliberate as we manage the business in a proactive manner most importantly we continue to invest behind initiatives and capabilities that will drive future growth thanks for your time this morning we will now turn the call back over to the operator operator questionandanswer session operator thank you our first question comes from erinn murphy of piper jaffray please go ahead erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co broker great thanks good morning i was hoping you could speak a little bit more just about the inventory overhang that you reference in the fourth quarter just how much of that was boots and colder weather product and then how does that affect your visibility as you think about the fall  order book thus far blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer erinn i assume youre talking about retail inventory in general erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co broker yeah exactly in general blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah okay i really recently read some articles and retail inventory at least here domestically is at a month high compared to sales so its one indication of where in general consumer soft goods and hard goods stand and someone else estimated that current inventory is about  higher than last years so weve been fortunate here in the united states to have received some weather finally in january and february and thats helping to clear out some of the seasonal inventory ive heard a few reports about a few retailers packing and holding some carryover stock whether its outerwear or boots but there certainly is an overhang right now and frankly as we view the retail environment its going to take at least two quarters maybe into the third quarter to clear most of these goods and get down to a normal level erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co broker okay i guess blake as you guys are talking to your partners within the retail community how are you seeing that order book shape up for you guys thus far for fall if you were to parse out what youre hearing from some of your majors versus some of your independents blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer well most of the retail community recoiled a bit from the very tough holiday season and so orders have been very stingy very hard to get future orders in general for us we have seen some sharp light in a couple areas the sperry boot program arctic grip and some other initiatives that we have for fall so we do see retailers stepping to the plate when they see some really fresh innovative product but its going to be a while here as we recover from in general high inventory levels erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co broker okay and then mike for you just a clarification on the guidance as you think about the first quarter in context to the balance of the year when you talked about revenue being down  to  on a reported basis how much of that is from foreclosures versus fx as youre starting the year here versus just tepid sales quartertodate just help us think about that revenue decline michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp yeah we talked about the difference between reported and underlying growth its about  it has a  headwind both currency and those store closures combined the cushe business not a big impact in the first quarter but i think the other factor which youre speaking to is the overhang on inventory and so just at retail so what were seeing right now is that kind of trend improving in the last three quarters of the year but for q well probably take the biggest decline in terms of revenue percentage against any of the other quarters in the year so we think that that overhang in inventory were starting to see some spark in atonce activities for some of our boot business for instance once we saw some cold weather but were certainly not planning on that to continue dramatically so right now thats the sort of the headwind ahead of us erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co broker and then i guess just last is related to the eps guidance that you gave for the first quarter can you just balance out how youre thinking about the expense structure thats here i think you guys have a pretty hefty marketing spend behind merrell and i believe thats firsthalf weighted so should that michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp okay erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co broker i mean is that first quarter weighted in particular or should we continue to anticipate some pressure at least relative to the top line on the second quarter as well when you think about that spend michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp yeah i think the spend is certainly firsthalf weighted for the investments there were activating some of the goto market programs in march but a lot of that money obviously spent earlier in the quarter and will continue to be spent in the second quarter so we are seeing some front weighting of that in the way the quarters are phasing out erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co broker got it all right thank you best of luck ill let someone else hop in christopher e hufnagel  vpstrategy communications  investor relations thanks operator our next question comes from jessica schmidt of keybanc capital markets please go ahead jessica l schmidt  keybanc capital markets inc thanks for taking my question so i know that you made some changes organizational changes this quarter to kind of consolidate initiatives in apparel and accessories but just given challenges that youve had there would you consider licensing these businesses out on soft brands or would you ever look to make an acquisition that might build up some competencies in these categories blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer i think frankly we would consider the right strategic tuckin acquisition in that area you have to remember weve licensed these areas maybe predominantly for our hush puppies brands since  in a number of countries different countries around the world especially a number of programs in asiapacific so its something were certainly used to its just a critical strategic initiative for us as we look ahead to developing global headtotoe lifestyle brand so we do have no leadership some years ago these efforts used to be consolidated under a single solid line reporting relationship in the company and frankly weve moved back to that structure to be more effective and efficient jessica l schmidt  keybanc capital markets inc great and then i guess just quickly how much of the  million in the cushe business were you able to recapture under merrell blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer its hard to really estimate at the present time we will get some of that under merrell but i dont know today if its a third if its  it would probably be something in that range jessica l schmidt  keybanc capital markets inc great ill pass it along thank you christopher e hufnagel  vpstrategy communications  investor relations thanks operator our next question comes from jim duffy of stifel please go ahead jim duffy  stifel nicolaus  co inc thanks good morning hope you guys are  blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer good morning jim christopher e hufnagel  vpstrategy communications  investor relations hi jim jim duffy  stifel nicolaus  co inc so my question is around sga and the restructuring specifics just looking through the outlook the guidance seems to imply a reduction in sga that goes beyond the savings from restructuring i know a year ago you talked about the  million investment behind the brands youve mentioned some planned investment in consumer insights and innovation i guess im just wondering where youre finding savings in the ongoing business to show leverage and afford these additional investments even with down volumes michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp yeah i mean jim weve been working really hard on that in the last quarter or so and weve obviously made some great headwind in restructuring our d to c group and getting more leverage on the store operation side of the business so were going to see some benefits in  and beyond for that weve made some other organizational changes too not quite as dramatic but in the first quarter youll see a little bit of additional kind of nonrecurring restructuring costs related to some other changes we made in the organization leaning up the group and just positioning ourselves for the tough road ahead a little bit weve also got some benefit from pension expense this year and thats going to be a tailwind for us for a change so those are some of the main drivers i think from the standpoint of just being able to maintain our operating margin its really important to realize that weve done a lot in the last year really combat the fx headwinds that were dealing with so those product cost improvements the cost engineering there and some of the benefits were seeing from the lower input costs in the latter half of the year price increases that we took tough decisions we made last year to increase prices those are all starting to pay dividends for us as were able to maintain our gross margin in a pretty tough environment so i think just being proactive and working through the organization for efficiency opportunities is pulling us in a position to maintain our operating margin at a flat level jim duffy  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay and then mike can i ask you to provide some more detail around the restructuring expenses how soon do you expect to be able to get out of some of these leases michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp yeah jim duffy  stifel nicolaus  co inc can you break up cash versus noncash components of that michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp yeah jim duffy  stifel nicolaus  co inc and then talk about how that all rolls up to cash flow objectives for the year michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp yeah for sure i mean we talked about another  million or so of expense in the first two quarters most of that is going to be cash related and its primarily going to be related to our store closures most of those will be done by the end of the first quarter theres a little bit of hangover into q but not much though its  million say  million of that maybe a little less than  million of that is cash and really driving the further improvements that were talking about in terms of getting out of some stores and weve already incurred some those costs in q as we talked about related to some of the organizational changes that we made so not a lot of additional sort of restructuring exposure in the back half of the year that will be done certainly by midway through the year and most of it will be behind us by the end of q jim duffy  stifel nicolaus  co inc and then do you have cash flow objective for the year you can share michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp free cash flow probably in the range of  million to  million jim duffy  stifel nicolaus  co inc thank you michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp sure operator our next question comes from taposh bari of goldman sachs please go ahead chad h sutherland  goldman sachs  co good morning its chad on for taposh my first question is on the new brand operating group structure can you just help – tell us how the change in structure better positions your core brands for accelerated growth blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer we dont do this slightly obviously weve done it every several to five or six years historically as weve added or pruned brands from the portfolio but this is something that we gave a lot of thought to and it developed over time theres a number of – basically we wanted to put the right brands with the right leaders so last year we had elevated richie woodworth to group president and it makes sense given the location for example of saucony in boston to report to richie its a brand that he ran for almost nine years the growth there has been pretty spectacular and it just made a lot of sense so we grouped saucony under richie and then with respect to james zwiers who most recently had been running our international group we grouped all of our brands with probably the most international penetration under jim so when you look at merrell hush puppies cat sebago those are all brands that have a substantial portion of their pairs offshore and jim was coming over from directly running our international group as you know jim has been  years at the company and hasnt quite held every job there is at the company but its getting close and then under ted gedra for the heritage group we grouped our four core boot brands that are largely focused on the us market and have a lot in common when it comes to consumers and to our retail customer so thats basically the logic behind the new group structure were going to be providing in a few weeks here to the investment community detailed historical sales data and stuff to help guide you throughout  and beyond chad h sutherland  goldman sachs  co great thats helpful thank you and then one followup just on stride rite can you help us – help to sort of size how big that business is today what this mix is between wholesale and retail how many stores there are versus how many there were at the peak just any parameters youre willing to give us on that business would be really helpful thanks blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah im just kind of quickly looking here so stride rite today would have about  stores to  stores as it stands today the vast majority of the closures in  and  were stride rite stores although there were some other stores in our fleet that were also closed so stride rite today is about  stores very profitable ecommerce business and very profitable wholesale business the wholesale business would be in the  million to  million range just to give you some idea chad h sutherland  goldman sachs  co okay thank you and then how big is the retail business blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer in dollars michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp about the same a little bit bigger its about  retail  wholesale chad h sutherland  goldman sachs  co okay great thank you operator our next question comes from jay sole of morgan stanley please go ahead jay sole  morgan stanley  co llc hey good morning i was just wondering if you can dig into the sales guidance a little bit for next year within the different groups the performance group lifestyle and heritage can you tell us what you see in some of the growth rates for the different brands being sperry merrell saucony could you – anything you can share with us on that regard would be helpful thank you blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah we really dont go down that alley for a bunch of good reasons and probably this year for even better reasons given the probably the lack of clarity on whats going to happen here and a little bit in the first half but especially in the back half of the year so across the board were pulling all levers to drive growth this year orders have been frankly pretty – future orders pretty stingy to this point in time which is completely understandable given the retail situation with respect to inventory so well certainly give you some in a couple of weeks here some historical revenue parameters on the new operating group structure jay sole  morgan stanley  co llc okay maybe a different question maybe about sales it sounds like theres two different themes here on one hand weather obviously impacted the boot business with cat and wolverine but at the same time you are talking about macro you mentioned china and different things that are continuing into  so can you help us to segregate like whats really going on how much is weather how much is macro because its not quite clear what the most important drivers are blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah i mean i – well listen i was – first of all i was proud that i think i got through my script without saying the word weather which drives me crazy but anyways so it was obviously a factor in setting that aside internationally its a little bit of an unusual time the slowdown were seeing my personal view is that low commodity prices generally dont lead countries or regions to greater growth theyre really a reflection of lower consumer demand it can be lower consumer demand for soft goods or hard goods youve got geopolitical risks in some countries and some countries are suffering russia millions of refugees pouring into europe this is all having an impact on business and then youve got the internationally the very strong us dollar i think the pound in just two days this week fell to an eight or a nine year low against the dollar for example so youre seeing these kind of wild swings in currency most of the world virtually all of the world buys its footwear in the us dollars and sells on local currency so you can imagine a little bit of a disruption that can happen when the us dollar strengthens    over a period of only two years so whats interesting right now from my viewpoint is internationally there are number of factors going on some of them are related frankly some of them are not related china for example where our business is relatively small compared to our total continues to grow at meaningful level is china going to have a hard landing or is china going to have a soft landing here as they migrate from a manufacturing export mindset in economy to an internally driven consumer consumption economy those are some big issues certainly above my pay grade were just positioning our business to adjust to all possibilities as we look ahead here domestically here jay sole  morgan stanley  co llc got it blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah domestically in the united states we have this slow burn recovery so its not bad but its not great on the other hand the good news for us in the footwear industry is if youre there with fresh innovative product if youre there with the right product saucony everun merrell capra sperry saltwater duck boots you can win so thats the good news for us that we got a lot chances to win in just about any environment but it is frankly a bit unusual at the present time ive been talking about this internally now for well over a year jay sole  morgan stanley  co llc if i could just ask you one more blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer sure jay sole  morgan stanley  co llc you talked about your omnichannel how are you defining omnichannel right now i mean is it going to be a big store buildout plus ecommerce is going to be for all brands just certain brands what is the vision that you have for the company to make it the omnichannel given the omnichannel capabilities it needs blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer i always go back to the consumer so what does the consumer want the consumer wants their brand to be there on a consistent basis whether theyre on their mobile whether theyre in a store and they see something they wanted delivered to the house whether theyre on their computer wherever the consumer wants to interact with the brand thats frankly how i kind of view omnichannel hence especially over the last year weve spent a lot of money on platform systems talents and other resources to really stay on a parallel course with our consumer we dont really see those – the consumer clearly is voting with their checkbook towards online i think in general in the us in the holiday season online was up about  we were up about double of that for our own brands on the other hand whats also interesting is retailers that started off as pure online brands are now finding a great need for stores everybody realizes today that the consumer will spend more money in a store and they still spend more in a store and frankly the consumer still enjoys that touch feel tryiton experience so omnichannel really involves stores online certainly and then of course your work with your good wholesale customers jay sole  morgan stanley  co llc got it thanks blake blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer thanks operator our next question comes from steve marotta of cl king  associates please go ahead steven l marotta  cl king  associates inc good morning blake and mike i understand your reticence on commenting at specific brand sales expectations for  historically however youve given them for the near term at least could you please speak to merrell and sperry sales expectations in the first quarter blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer well yeah we expect frankly sperry to be down at a pretty good clip in the first half from what we see today boat shoes continued to be soft maybe a little bit more – a little bit softer in mens interestingly than on the womens side of the business but still trending down sperry is introducing some athletic casual athleisure silhouettes certainly for sperry were not seeing any pushback from retailers or the consumers to category extensions i guess the duck boot the saltwater duck boot would be a good example of that so for us its just getting the sperry product innovation engine ramped up quickly enough never fast enough for me to counter the falloff in boat shoes with respect to merrell merrell should have a bit more of a level year probably down a little bit here in the first half but a lot of their initiatives around strategic partnerships with group retailers on capra all out moab and the introduction of arctic grip and really also the tough mudder affiliation which will really get ramped up here late spring into the summer and next fall a lot of those initiatives are really in midyear or beyond for the merrell brand so maybe i would like it to be a little more balance but it is what it is and we certainly like the initiatives going forward steven l marotta  cl king  associates inc thank you thats helpful lastly what is ecommerce in the aggregate as a percent to your consolidated sales michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp  or so steven l marotta  cl king  associates inc okay and then michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp too low steven l marotta  cl king  associates inc right and if you include dtc in that overall what would the percentage be michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp right around    steven l marotta  cl king  associates inc thats really helpful thank you michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp welcome operator our next question comes from corinna van der ghinst of citigroup please go ahead corinna gayle van der ghinst  citigroup global markets inc broker hi thank you for squeezing me in i just wanted to followup quickly on the inventory discussion you gave some good color on caution in the marketplace did you guys actually take back any product from wholesale accounts and are you going to clear that through your own retail stores or offprice throughout the year and just then how are you strategizing your production for the year are you anticipating a higher level of atonce versus initial preorders this year and how are you kind of planning your ability to chase if the season ends up better than expected this fall blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer theres a lot of questions there let me see if i can tackle a few of them and mike can tackle the rest i guess with respect to inventory i dont believe we took back any inventory maybe we took back  pairs or  pairs here and there i dont know but we really did not take back any inventory as the fall season and holiday progressed we work pretty closely with our retailers to make sure they werent stuffed and that they had the right balance of inventory our inventory on their shelves with respect to our mix i know a lot of our peers have reported inventory levels substantially greater than ours and our  probably is  higher than our original expectations going into the fall but for us its virtually all core products certainly core product were not going to dump in the closeout channel for our inventory our closeouts compared to last year are down about a third and our aged inventory is down about  just to give you some frame of that so the first half of what were seeing is a continuing pretty volatile environment when it comes to orders and for atonce orders we can have some weeks with great spikes for some of our brands and then we can be flat for some other weeks i think its just all an end result of retailers trying to deal with the situation they currently find themselves in we see that normalizing here as the year rolls out but its going to be some up and down for the time being michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp the only thing i would emphasize there is the fact that we certainly work closely with all of our retail partners and our distributors so as we were coming out of q and heading into q we wanted to make sure there wasnt a great deal of overhang of our inventory in the marketplace in the first half of this year and theres still more probably with certain retailers than they would like but our ability to partner with them to make sure that were not in a position to have to take a lot of returns back and the fact that our brands or the sellthroughs on many of our brands are kind of better than most even though the overall inventories with some of these retailers is a little bit high those are all pretty good indications another reason why were not fearful of having to take significant markdowns in terms of liquidating the inventory that we have so weve been proactive managing our own inventories down thats why we feel comfortable with where were going to end the year with inventories but also just managing closely with our retail partners as we navigated the last three months or four months corinna gayle van der ghinst  citigroup global markets inc broker okay thats helpful and then if i could followup with one bigpicture question how are you guys think about the longterm algorithm of the portfolio now given the reorganization some of the brands or the exits that you have made and the appetite for acquisitions are you still thinking about the topline growth story as a highsingle digit longterm outlook blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah i would say  is going to be a year from a revenue growth perspective were frankly not entirely happy with we wish it was better but we are realistic and we understand its a pretty dynamic environment especially when you have about  of your pairs sold outside the united states so were realists and were dealing with all those kind of challenges were happy with our portfolio right now a few years ago we would have touted  brands so weve pruned our portfolio and are focused on growth initiatives really for all the existing brands that we still have in the portfolio certainly when you look at a keds or a saucony or a merrell or a sperry some of our bigger brands a lot of growth potential left there both in the lifestyle area as well as footwear corinna gayle van der ghinst  citigroup global markets inc broker okay thank you operator our next question comes from christian buss of credit suisse please go ahead christian roland buss  credit suisse securities usa llc broker yeah i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the accelerated capital expenditures in  and also how youre thinking about share repurchases for the year michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp sure well the capex number that we shared in the prepared remarks reflects a couple big initiatives one is as you know were moving into a new office in the boston area just down the road from our existing location so theres some meaningful investment in that new space i think we plan to move in sometime in june so its around the corner that would be an unusual onetime impact on our normal capex we typically spend between  million and  million a year on capex so the numbers were showing are elevated from that the other initiative which were still working through negotiating but we have it in the guidance is an expansion of our distribution facilities and looking at some strategies around that outside of the current infrastructure that we have we have a couple of leases that are expiring in a couple of older facilities and so in an effort to look for some future cost savings and synergies were reevaluating our distribution footprint so those are the two big drivers that would take us out of the normal capex levels christian roland buss  credit suisse securities usa llc broker thats helpful michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp im sorry  yes were always in the market were looking for opportunistic buyback scenarios and one of the things again as you would be aware of our notes today carry financial covenants that put some restrictions on those share buybacks and we made some meaningful repurchases late in  we were able to do that because we built up the capacity over a period of time in ways the covenants worked to be able to do that and then that got reset and so well have to work through those covenants during the course of the year we have some other options and were looking at other ways to get amendments to those covenants but in the meantime we dont have any meaningful share repurchases embedded in our guidance christian roland buss  credit suisse securities usa llc broker thank you very much and best of luck operator our next question comes from benjamin bray of robert w baird please go ahead benjamin bray  robert w baird  co inc broker thanks for taking our question can you provide some detail on the  ecommerce growth in q specifically what was driving that acceleration blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer well frankly a lot of work weve done over the prior year we spent a lot of effort and time and resources this year putting as many brands as we could on a single platform and that has been very efficient and very useful to help drive growth we added talent throughout the year in the digital social area for our brands i think that was a great contributor to the growth as well and then were simply just paying more attention to it its an important growth opportunity for the company probably should be at least  of our overall sales and thats how were viewing the opportunity obviously a highly profitable opportunity michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp i would also add that we had some real wins in the fourth quarter from a product standpoint and we mentioned earlier that our three biggest brand had over double – very strong doubledigit growth in ecomm in the fourth quarter so that very successful sperry saltwater duck boot was a big driver of success for their ecomm business as well so where we go out with exclusive product opportunities andor early opportunities on our own sites were seeing success with that and well be continuing that strategy going forward benjamin bray  robert w baird  co inc broker thats helpful thanks operator our next question comes from mitch kummetz of b riley please go ahead mitch kummetz  b riley  co llc yeah thanks for taking my questions so two questions one just in terms of the guidance so you expect better performance in the back half than the first half but you have said that visibility is limited and youve also said that you expect retailers to be pretty cautious with the prebooks so does it really boil down to just an easier backhalf comparison and youre expecting more of a normalized winter so better reorders than what you experienced in this past fourth quarter or is it something else does it kind of come back down to just new product launches and i have a followup blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer well mitch its really all those things really its some of the new product launches a lot of which are really aimed at the fall selling season across our brand portfolio it will be some easier compares certainly as we get into the fall next year ive given up trying to predict weather i think one of the reasons frankly the saltwater boot did so well for sperry this year its a transition product is it a cold weather product is it a hot we sold the saltwater boot in august september october november december until we were sold out to the pair so its a great example of a good fashion fit but also a transition product so all of our brands like a lot of our competitors are focused on transition product and then listen retailers have been as you know mitch for the last  years trying to push more and more of the inventory risk back on to brand owners so were seeing that a little bit as we roll forward here theres a lot thats going on thats changing in the retail marketplace and it all relates to changing consumer behavior so we understand that were working with our retailers in that regard but theres been a lot of pushback on the brands to be more important to retailers in maybe the atonce side of the business than future orders mitch kummetz  b riley  co llc okay and then on sperry im just trying to get a better understanding of the historical context on the boat business i was hoping you could give us some color as to i think you said that like a little over half the business now boat is for sperry blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah mitch kummetz  b riley  co llc where is sperry boat relative to peak is it down like   from peak and also where is it from maybe six seven eight years ago prior to the big ramp on the boat shoe trend does it still well up from where it was back then before boat shoes ramped im just trying to understand where it is blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah as you know mitch this country in particular has always had an ebbandflow of boat shoe popularity i would say starting seven eight years ago really sperry almost singlehandedly increased the overall level theres still volatility as we know in our comments reflected but increased the overall floor for the boat shoe business especially in the us market so today the sperry boat shoe business is still significantly bigger than it was seven five four years ago three years ago your other question really goes where is bottom its always hard to judge were seeing some signs that once we get through the first half of this year that we may be approaching bottom for that business our efforts are focused on keeping boat fresh keeping it relevant it always going to be an incredible business and relevant silhouette in the united states market and making sure we maintain our dominant position of whatever that market is today sperry has about  ownership of the boat shoe market and were not giving up any of that high ground to anybody mitch kummetz  b riley  co llc got it right thanks good luck christopher e hufnagel  vpstrategy communications  investor relations thank you mitch blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer thanks operator our next question comes from scott krasik of buckingham research please go ahead scott d krasik  the buckingham research group inc yeah hi everybody thanks blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer hi scott scott d krasik  the buckingham research group inc so i dont think you specifically answered it from way back ago mike so what – how much is fx a headwind just the fx portion to q sales and the fullyear sales please michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp for the first quarter only scott d krasik  the buckingham research group inc for the first quarter and then the full year michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp yeah for the first quarter only its about a  headwind scott d krasik  the buckingham research group inc okay michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp for the first quarter and for the full year its about the same scott d krasik  the buckingham research group inc okay and then im assuming the gross margin is going to be down significantly on q but youre guiding michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp yes scott d krasik  the buckingham research group inc it to flat so can you talk about sort of what youre expecting or the environment to allow you to get back to a flat gross margin for the year given the hole youre going to dig please michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp yeah yeah we talked a little bit about it too so q will be the biggest quarter all of our fx earnings exposure is really in the gross margin line so all these – its the product cost related to new contracts that weve entered into in the last half of  so  headwind in the first quarter is all product cost we dont get the full benefit of some of the product cost reductions until later in the year so where were seeing commodity price benefits and input cost benefits in our fobs those arent going to show up until later in the year we know what they are weve ordered shoes against those prices but we have some carryover there were also being a little conservative on providing some provisions some reserve if you will for any additional liquidation of the inventory that might pose an opportunity for us in the first quarter and second quarter so that puts some pressure on margin and would subside in the second half so its really those factors and the timing of some of the benefits that we expect to see fx will loosen up a little bit later in the year and those product costs will start becoming a bigger tailwind for us as we move through the year scott d krasik  the buckingham research group inc okay perfect and then just last blake you mentioned that you have some product wins right capra and duck boots and some of the saucony product so i mean really it just feels like you dont have enough good product to grow the business at this point so youve been through fannie and or and magic  what are the retailers telling you about the fall products you obviously have some big platforms youre introducing i mean is that when youre going to start to see growth do you have the orders in hand can you talk about visibility blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah i mean we certainly have the orders in hand for – or largely in hand for some of our key initiatives so our big partner retailers that have signed up with merrell for example whether its capra whether its the expanded moab line weve got a lot of those orders in hand for that particular program obviously everybody ran out of sperry boots this past fall so they know they need a good business sperry has shown that its got a great line of transitional products which is great so but other than some of these points of light i would say retailers at this point in time still being pretty conservative as you know it you can never have enough product wins we are focused on our consumer and product innovation thats one of the reasons why were creating a new innovation hub to help supplement the brands creative efforts in that particular area so its something were keenly focused on we know at the end of the day were an industry where if the product is right everything else matters and if the product isnt right sometimes nothing else matters so were focused on it we always wish we had a few more big stories weve done a good job in  of really filling the product pipeline especially for sperry for example in nonboat and in merrell as well and across a number of brands for arctic grip so fundamentally its going to be the focus on the consumer and product innovation thats going to drive organic growth we cant control currency we cant control some of the geopolitical volatility and instability we cant really control commodity prices so as in  were focused on the controllables whether its gross margin enhancing gross margin we havent taken our foot off the pedal behind investing in our brands so were investing in our brand as we had originally planned and were especially investing in product creation and innovation scott d krasik  the buckingham research group inc okay good luck thanks blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer thanks christopher e hufnagel  vpstrategy communications  investor relations thanks scott operator our next question comes from chris svezia of susquehanna financial group please go ahead christopher svezia  susquehanna financial group lllp hey good morning guys thanks for taking my question i just want to circle back to some of the inventory for a moment on your books when its up  could you just maybe just talk about what brands or categories have the heavy inventory and what do you mean by it getting more in line as you go into the back half of the year are you still expecting it to be up and how does that jive with i guess what seems to be highsingle digit reported declines in revenue are you just meaningfully slowing down incoming receipts just how does that math work michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp sure yes i can walk you through it chris i mean first of all its – we talked a little bit in the remarks about boot inventory being a little higher than we would like part of that was a slowdown in the fourth quarter just in general i mean the oil industry and construction sector and some other areas have been hit pretty hard and our work boot business softened up a little bit because of that and obviously the weather impacted boots across any of the brands that have cold weather product but we have core inventory that was purchased midyear last year that came in really across the portfolio and thats something we have to rationally work through over the course of the year the good news is in september when we – late august and september when we saw some of the softness we started to act pretty quickly with our factories on the core – orders of core merchandise that are generally at a pretty regular cadence in the way we buy it and we slowed that way down and so we already have visibility to the inflow side of the equation were going to see the inflow of inventories start to come down dramatically latter part of q and q we couldnt turn that off entirely and didnt really want to put that burden on our manufacturing partners and so we kind of managed through that over a reasonable period of time so weve got visibility to that a meaningful reduction in inbound goods over the next couple of quarters core inventory that we dont see necessarily as seasonal even though like blake said we have about  more at the end of the year than maybe we wanted to based on some of the more seasonal cold weather stuff but other than that its core products thatll sellthrough not necessarily waiting until fall for to liquidate and then at the end of the day were working closely with all of our retail customers on our projections there so when we talk about where we think were going to end up at the end of the year it would be down meaningfully from where we ended this year and were going to just make steady progress every quarter towards that well probably see again q guidance what it is we wont see an improvement in our inventory at the end of the first quarter but after q and certainly a meaningful reduction yearoveryear relatively speaking by q and then even better performance into the latter part of the year so its something we have pretty good visibility to and high level of confidence that we can achieve it christopher svezia  susquehanna financial group lllp okay thank you and then just i have a question on pricing in the past you have talked about the ability to try to push through some pricing michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp yeah christopher svezia  susquehanna financial group lllp as you sit here today given the dynamics in the world were in and i think last call you referenced you had some challenges on pricing in certain categories how do we think about it for this year blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer i would say really how our brands approached this especially internationally as your – as carryover product goes from price that good but it goes to better and your better inventory and styles go from better to best its incumbent upon your brands to come back with appropriate pricing of product in that – at that good category level so a goodbetterbest scenario a lot of our efforts from some of our brands especially those brands with the big international businesses is focused on bringing out great product at the good price point level and obviously over the last several years weve usually been ahead of this game weve been very proactive when it comes to pricing we like to increase our gross margins and our operating margins every year in most years thats our focus you cant do that if you dont price appropriately it doesnt mean that youd take a blanket increase across the whole product line for a particular brand you have to be smart about it and i would say for some of our brands our more traditional boot brands in the work area its a little bit tougher because they have a lot of product that is carryover product and some of those styles have been around for two years three years more than five years so yeah its not an exact science but it just – its something you have to work on every week and youve got to get on in front of it michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp and chris we took that tough action last year early in the year and even with sperry and their domestic business they raised prices and ultimately the consumer and the retailers out there frankly responded well to that so we dont have any meaningful or large scale increases planned for this year therell be some surgical increases where needed but overall the benefit were getting to margin is really a result of just getting the full year benefit from some of the work that we did last year christopher svezia  susquehanna financial group lllp okay understood thank you very much and all the best michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp thank you operator our next question comes from laurent vasilescu of macquarie please go ahead laurent vasilescu  macquarie capital usa inc good morning thanks for taking my questions i wanted to follow up on the capex guide how much of the  capex should we anticipate for the new innovation and design center called out in the prepared remarks or is that something we should consider for  michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp therell be some investment there more in  but luckily weve got some facilities and capacity in our current footprint to take advantage of this year and as we build that hub up and so itll become a more prominent investment beyond  but theres a meaningful investment in  as well laurent vasilescu  macquarie capital usa inc okay great and then in the prepared remarks there was a lot of discussion about potential acquisitions on the flip side would you consider divesting a brand or a segment in order to improve profitability or to reallocate capital in order to fund future growth blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer well i think as you know weve got a great history when it comes to capital generate – or cash generation and increasing ebitda so weve never lack fortunately for funds or resources to organically grow our brand or do acquisitions so that wouldnt really come into our thinking our thinking about our brands over the year and we routinely take a look at our portfolio and as you know years ago when i was coo we got out of three businesses and weve exited a business or a brand from time to time when it didnt make sense or meet our future growth or earnings parameters were pretty happy with the portfolio we have today we have no plans to divest of any of our brands currently in our portfolio today we also have today because of our fantastic performance over the last three years and our current leverage ratio we have the ability to do more acquisitions were primarily focused on organic growth today but mike and i and the team here do spend an appropriate amount of time looking at potential opportunities laurent vasilescu  macquarie capital usa inc okay great thank you very much and best of luck blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer thank you michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp thank you operator our next question comes from sam poser of sterne agee please go ahead sam poser  sterne agee crt good morning thanks for taking my questions the difference between the adjusted number and the reported number is the store closing costs can you break that out by quarter for us michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp for which year sam sam poser  sterne agee crt in your guidance michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp its almost all in the first quarter sam poser  sterne agee crt so your net michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp does that sam poser  sterne agee crt so your net earnings in the first quarter when you exclude that is  is that the correct number or when you include that just trying to get that guidance that you gave for q michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp the guidance we gave of  to  excludes that number sam poser  sterne agee crt okay thanks and then theres a  million benefit you have in the quarter interest income or other income can you tell us what that is michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp in q sam poser  sterne agee crt yeah in q michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp yeah we had a settlement on an outstanding legal issue that came through in q obviously thats something that wont recur next year so its sort of a onetime benefit for us sam poser  sterne agee crt okay so it should – so on a netnet that should be taken out of the books michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp yeah its already reflected yeah when i provided the guidance on our net interest expense and other expenses thats reflected in that number sam poser  sterne agee crt okay and then i mean so it looks like in the guidance since youve done the plg acquisition your sales based on the sort of midpoint of your guidance are going to be up about  since  and the earnings number is going to be almost flat so im just trying to – im trying to – i just want to understand sort of like when is this – when are we going to get cranking here blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer well i dont have those historical numbers in front of me sam but obviously the plg acquisitions added even today with the stride rite stores underperforming has added well over  million on an annual basis of ebitda those brands were not performing at the level of historical wolverine brands when we bought them they were largely focused on the usa market they didnt have really any higher – a great deal of higher margin international business so for us i think its – were seeing some growth in some of the brands the overall success of those brands has been hurt by the stride rite stores weve addressed that over the last  months and into this month when you take a look at the international penetration just as an example the sperry brand in pairs grew  internationally last year the saucony brand grew  the keds brand which has been a bit of pleasant surprise to me grew about over  last year so were finally getting some traction it takes a while as ive said before with some of these brands but were finally getting some meaningful traction on the international front despite some of the macro challenges that we talked about earlier michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp sam its important to remember just between  and  now with the new guidance that weve given you  of currency impact to results so just to put that in perspective sam poser  sterne agee crt okay so that entire – i just want to clear i just want to make sure i get this the adjusted  to  that number takes out the currency but doesnt include that onetime  michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp thats reported results excluding the  million of restructuring that we talked about thats going to be mostly in q and partially into q so thats our normal adjusted earnings per share its not currency neutral or anything else sam poser  sterne agee crt okay all right well thank you very much for taking the questions blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer youre welcome sam michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp thank you sam operator thank you the questionandanswer session has ended i would now like to turn the conference back over to mr chris

which persisted and some of which became more challenging relative to our prior expectationsalthough many of our key global markets have performed well a number of others are exhibiting some stress for a variety of different reasons in many international markets the strong us dollars put pressure on the cost of footwear and the ultimate retail price to consumers as most of the world purchases shoes in us dollars this in turn has and will continue to drive up the retail prices of footwear in many marketsearlier this year we chose the proactive path to protect gross margin by selectively

earnings engine the power of our diversified brand portfolio and the disciplined manner with which we operate our business in spite of the current global retail environment which continues to be choppy our consolidated business and two of our three brand operating groups generated adjusted revenue growth during the quarter excluding the impact of currency the patagonia footwear exit and store closures as applicable mike and i will refer to adjusted revenue in this context in our remarks but well also provide corresponding reported revenue figures in step with our previously announced demand creation investment strategy our quarterly marketing investment increased approximately  to support the longterm health and vitality of our brands we remain committed to investing behind our brands and plan to accelerate revenue growth through product innovation and deeper and more insightful consumer connections all supported by a strong operational platform and our extensive global distribution footprint for todays call ill cover our consolidated and brand operating group results speak to some of the headwinds in the global marketplace and then focus on key brand performances and related strategic updates for the quarter specifically the stride rite sperry and merrell brands beginning with consolidated results adjusted revenue grew  versus the prior year and reported revenue was  million sic  million  a  decrease yearoveryear we delivered adjusted diluted earnings per share of  for the quarter in line with our original guidance and achieved strong gross margins across the portfolio while effectively managing discretionary sga which was only partially offset by the increased marketing investments behind our brand focusing in on the brand operating group performance starting with the performance group adjusted revenue grew  with chaco posting exceptionally strong doubledigit growth merrell generating low singledigit growth and saucony contributing midsingle digit growth in the quarter adjusted revenue for the lifestyle group was down  with sperry down less than  keds down low single digits and stride rite down high single digits hush puppies saw a constant currency lowteens decline due primarily to our decision to realign our domestic distribution strategy the brands international licensee business remains strong with revenue up double digits concluding with the heritage group adjusted revenue grew  with cat delivering midsingle digit growth wolverine producing low single digit growth hytest growing at a solid doubledigit pace bates down less than  and harleydavidson down highsingle digit mike will provide additional detail regarding our financial results in a few minutes so now let me share our perspective on the global macroeconomic environment which impacted our results in the third quarter and is expected to continue into the near future heading into the back half of the year we identified and planned for a variety of global macroeconomic challenges many of which persisted and some of which became more challenging relative to our prior expectations although many of our key global markets have performed well a number of others are exhibiting some stress for a variety of different reasons in many international markets the strong us dollars put pressure on the cost of footwear and the ultimate retail

proactive path to protect gross margin by selectively increasing prices in our own international markets we believe this action was appropriate for the longterm health of our brands and business realizing it to put some pressure on revenue growth in the short term in addition to currency one of the biggest stories over the last several months has been softer global demand across many

holiday shopping season a combination of these factors across numerous markets around the world resulted in a tougher demand environment especially late in the third quarter and we believe that its prudent to expect many of these factors to persist in the fourth quarter and the first half of  this has caused us along with others in and outside of our industry to temper the nearterm outlook while we have a strong brand portfolio and a resilient business model we expect the shortterm environment to remain status quo the obvious question is how we are adjusting to the current global realities over the past year we have strategically and tactically adjusted to this dynamic environment in a number of different ways specifically our inventory is high quality and its as clean as it has been in several years we are narrow and deep in core styles and collections which puts us in a position to satisfy consumers and retail customers who are buying closer to need second we have initiated actions across our brand portfolio to develop products to backfill price points that have been impacted by the stronger us dollar we have also critically reviewed the scope of our brickandmortar store fleet to align the number of stores with the changes in consumer shopping behavior and the impact of digital social and mobile technologies the team has focused on forging stronger relationships with our customers through deep insights compelling marketing and by creating a consistent omnichannel experience and lastly we have invested in our innovation and product creation engines to generate new offerings consistent with current consumer product preferences especially in the athleisure athletic category we know that growth is dependent on offering the consumer a great brand experience and something that is unique beyond price and believe these initiatives will drive future growth and closer connections with our consumers we expect that our business model will continue to generate strong free cash flow and a high quality earnings stream ill now focus on the key brand performances in the quarter and related strategic updates starting with stride rite stride rites exposure to the domestic brickandmortar store channel created the most significant challenge for the company in the third quarter sluggish macro retail traffic trends in an aggressive promotional environment presented some headwinds especially as we saw it to be less promotional although our store conversion improved traffic declines persisted given the current retail environment in the trend in stride rite stores we are taking action to refocus the stride rite business and update our strategic realignment plan which is focused on realigning our consumer direct priorities and resource allocation to fuel ecommerce mobile and omnichannel initiatives this plan which was originally announced over a year ago has proven to be the right direction and we have decided to reevaluate the stride rite brickandmortar fleet with an even more critical eye we plan to ensure optimal rationalization of our stores and to continue our investments in digital initiatives where we are seeing strong growth and great progress this will all better align the brand with how the modern mom is shopping at the same time we intend to continue with our progress in thoughtfully expanding our wholesale distribution in conjunction with a strict product segmentation strategy to make the brand more accessible to consumers we expect the result will be a healthier stride rite childrens group aligned with todays consumer and poised to focus on the brands best opportunities switching gears to sperry the sperry business was essentially flat in the third quarter with adjusted revenue down less than  this top line performance was softer than expected with most of the decline coming from the boat shoe category however the brands product category expansion strategy has started to produce meaningful results to offset the womens fashion trend cycling away from the boat shoes silhouette nonboat product categories contributed nearly half of the brands total revenue in the quarter and delivered very strong doubledigit growth especially in vulcanized sneakers and boots the brand also delivered a strong  basis point gross margin expansion in the quarter a key initiative for us through select product price increases and the benefits from the odysseys await campaign in  we made investments to position sperry for longterm sustainable growth as a global lifestyle brand we launched the odysseys await platform this spring and were now seeing data that this investment is beginning to move the needle with the consumer growing brand awareness solidifying brand affinity and influencing purchasing decisions we also brought the platform to life in a new store design that is currently being rolled out and is producing very strong doubledigit comp revenue growth while nearly doubling the penetration of apparel and accessories although sperry is an established business of significant size today we believe it is still in the early stages of its lifecycle with incredible growth potential for the company and were excited by the early successes to move beyond its dominant position in the boat shoe category moving to merrell the merrell brand was up  on a constant currency basis and remains a leader in the performance outdoor footwear category its new performance collections capra and all out continue to win at retail during the third quarter the smaller active lifestyle category followed a stronger q with a softer q but the new mens telluride and womens ashland collections successfully launched late in the quarter and are performing well this fall increasing brand awareness for merrell is a critical opportunity as consumers who know the brand love it but today the brand ranks relatively low in consumer awareness this is a significant opportunity the new leadership team has developed a new brand platform and product initiatives along with an aggressive gotomarket strategy designed to amplify merrell in the marketplace and increase awareness merrell plans to support a more robust and compelling product assortment with the launch of the new brand platform do whats natural and associated demand creation investment a planned comprehensive gotomarket strategy will focus on driving results at retail with key retail partnerships partners that signed up to present specific product franchises like the expanded moab collection as their big story and have committed to critical space on the sales floor and other supporting investments the strategy is in place and the partners have lined up to support this growth initiative as a company we have a balanced business model that has consistently delivered earnings in a variety of global macroeconomic environments our strategic advantages within the global marketplace remained clear and compelling first our portfolio of authentic heritage brands provides us with an opportunity to service many different consumer groups across the wide range of product categories and countries second we also possessed an exceptionally strong operations platform third our extensive global distribution footprint has been a competitive advantage for us for decades and lastly we have a deep and seasoned global team while we expect the nearterm global retail environment to remain somewhat challenging this landscape creates some great opportunities for our brands to expand internationally in the shortterm we are especially focused on executing against our business model which has consistently produced strong cash flow and a highquality earnings stream to help drive our strategic brand investments im excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for our family of brands with that ill now turn the call over to mike stornant our senior vice president and chief financial officer wholl provide additional commentary on our performance in the third quarter as well as more details regarding our expectations for the balance of the year mike michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp thanks blake and thanks to all of you for joining us on the call today we are pleased with our earnings performance in the third quarter with adjusted earnings per share of  per share in line with our original guidance of  to  per share earnings were bolstered by a strong gross margin performance and discipline around discretionary spending which allowed us to increase our marketing investment by approximately  and overcome a softerthanexpected revenue performance adjusted revenue was up  in the quarter after considering fx store closures and exiting the patagonia footwear business and reported revenue of  million was down  compared to last year third quarter revenue growth was lower than expected due primarily to several factors that impacted our north american business the softness in q revenue can be categorized as follows direct to consumer predominantly stride rite store performance contributed roughly onethird of the net shortfall footwear retail traffic in the us market was softer in the quarter and traffic for our stores was also challenged key tactics expected to drive improvements in comp store performance especially for our stride rite stores were not as productive as expected in addition efforts to be less promotional within our stores and online put pressure on growth wholesale revenue excluding our dtc channels for sperry and merrell contributed roughly onethird of the net shortfall focused mainly in the north american market the remaining softness was experienced in our north american wholesale business across several brands during the quarter retailers became more cautious as the us retail landscape remained promotional and inventory levels continued to increase across channels we believe these factors impacted demand for many of our brands we continue to believe that the fundamental strength of our operating model and the disciplined way we run our business gives us a distinct competitive advantage our healthy earnings performance in q is evidence of this let me provide more insight regarding the key actions that helped to deliver our earnings results in the quarter gross margin in q was  slightly better than we forecasted and flat with the prior year despite  basis points of fx headwinds our brands have been very proactive with strategic price increases across various categories and markets to protect or enhance gross margin many of which were implemented in q in addition product costs were managed very effectively highlighting the operational excellence of what we believe to be our bestinclass product development and supply chain operations these actions helped to offset the impact of the stronger us dollar in our nonus markets a lower contribution from higher margin dtc revenue and other mix shifts across the portfolio the company remains very focused on protecting gross margin performance across the business adjusted operating expenses were  million up  million or  versus the prior year including a  million increase in noncash pension expense this result was meaningfully better than our projections as the business responded quickly to a retail environment that softened during the quarter variable cost declined naturally due to the lower sales volume and discretionary spending was managed effectively the company continued to invest in important demand creation initiatives albeit at a slightly lower level than originally planned as mentioned overall marketing spend was up approximately  in the quarter incentive and stock compensation expenses were lower than planned and approximately  million lower than last year adjusted operating margin was a very strong  up significantly from our expectations entering the quarter net interest expense in the quarter was approximately  million or  million lower than the prior year reflecting the yearoveryear principal reductions including yeartodate voluntary principal payments of  million made in the first quarter and a lower interest rate on our term loan driven by our declining leverage ratio the adjusted quarterly tax rate of  was higher than projected and higher than the prior year due mostly to a shift in the jurisdictional mix and the timing of certain discrete items the reported tax rate in the quarter was  in addition to a solid quarterly earnings performance the companys balance sheet remains very strong we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  million and net debt of  million down  million since q of  and down  million since the acquisition of plg in  our current leverage ratio is  times compared with  time at closing and we project fullyear adjusted ebitda as defined by our credit agreement to be in the range of  million to  million third quarter accounts receivable improved by  million or  benefiting from the financing agreement entered into in q of  and from continued improvements in dso and cash collections inventories were up  due mostly to lowerthananticipated sales in the quarter and incremental investments in cold weather product for sperry in advance of q we believe the quality of our inventory today is very high with a healthy aging relative to last year we continue to use disciplined tactics to manage inventory levels which includes adjusting the supply chain inflow where appropriate maximizing selling opportunities within our own dtc channels working closely with retailers on future demand planning and liquidating noncore items due to the traditional closeout channels inventory levels appear to be relatively high across the retail landscape including traditional closeout channels and therefore we expect that it will take a few quarters to manage inventories down to a normalized level as our current inventory position is clean and largely constitutes core styles we believe our approach is preferable to liquidating otherwise good inventory and overly reduced prices during q we took advantage of our healthy credit standing strong balance sheet and favorable market conditions to amend our senior secured credit facility which among other things extended the term by nearly two years upsized the revolver capacity to  million and resulted in more favorable pricing this amendment is projected to provide us greater capacity as we consider strategic opportunities and more flexibility related to certain restricted payments including future dividends and share repurchases on a yeartodate basis we repurchased approximately  shares of the companys stock we have just over  million remaining under the stock buyback program approved by our board of directors in  and plan to continue to look for favorable buyback opportunities over the balance of the year now let me turn to our  guidance for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year during q macroeconomic challenges in international markets persisted and the us retail market softened we believe these conditions will continue in the shortterm and the expectations for a strong holiday season remain mixed as a result we are updating our q and fullyear revenue and earnings guidance as follows adjusted q revenue is now expected to be flat to down lowsingle digits compared with q  a quarter when we experienced growth of  reported quarterly revenue will be in line – will be in the range of  million to  million or down approximately  to  adjusted fullyear revenue is now expected to be up lowsingle digits and reported fullyear revenue is now expected to be  billion to  billion or down  to  we now expect q gross margin to be up slightly despite a basispoint headwind from fx fullyear gross margin is expected to be flat with the prior year adjusted q operating expenses are now expected to be down lowsingle digits compared to last year despite a  million increase in noncash pension expense for the full year adjusted operating expenses are expected to be up very lowsingle digits despite a  million increase in noncash pension expense net interest and other expenses are expected to improve in q by approximately  million as a result of lower debt position lower pricing under the new credit facility and other benefits the fullyear adjusted effective tax rate is now expected to be in the range of  to  this rate is lower than our previous guidance of approximately  as a result of a shift in jurisdictional mix of taxable income and some discrete benefits expected to be recognized in the fourth quarter based on all of these factors q adjusted earnings per share are now expected to be  to  per share an increase of approximately  to  compared with last year and fullyear adjusted earnings per share is now expected to be  to  per share i also wanted to provide an update on revenue guidance for merrell and sperry given the aforementioned global headwinds and challenging retail environment we now expect merrells constant currency revenue to be flat with last year and sperry to deliver lowsingle digit constant currency growth for the full year with regards to merrell continued strong growth in the performance category is forecasted to be offset by softness in our active lifestyle segment along with some specific regional challenges given the brands expansive international footprint for sperry strong growth in boots vulcanized and active styles coupled with the steady growth in consumer direct and international are forecasted to be partially offset by softness in the boat category i will now provide an update on the goforward strategy for our brickandmortar fleet especially for stride rite stores blake spoke to our stride rite business and our strategic realignment plan in his prepared remarks and now i will provide some additional color on specific steps we are taking to improve the returns in this important but underperforming segment of the business our strategic realignment plan was initiated in july  and updated during our q earnings call in july we shared an updated plan to ultimately close  stores with approximately  stores expected to close by the end of  as a reminder we shuttered  doors in  under this plan based on current store performance and trends and consumer shopping preferences we now anticipate closing an additional  stride rite stores increasing the ultimate closure count from  stores to  stores across the portfolio we are currently reviewing our lease exit strategy and negotiating with our landlords a process that will continue through the balance of the year we still expect to close at least  stores under the plan by the end of  the remaining store closures are planned to happen in  or at a normal lease expiration and this would be determined based on the outcome of our negotiations for stride rite this would leave a goforward fleet of approximately  doors this reconstituted fleet is expected to be much more productive and profitable located in a combination of viable specialty and outlet centers across the us and most importantly in line with the goforward strategy of the brand as a result of incremental cost associated with store closures and further reorganization changes across the portfolio we now expect reported diluted earnings per share in the range of  to  per share for fiscal  we will provide more details on the strategic realignment plan and associated costs and savings as part of our fourth quarter conference call before we open the call up to take questions i want to emphasize just a few points the leadership team at wolverine remains incredibly focused on those initiatives and activities that will reenergize growth and allow us to fully leverage our great global brand portfolio as we have done in the past we will continue to operate in a diligent and disciplined manner both in the execution of our business model and the management of our working capital to deliver consistent profit and cash flow for our shareholders a key priority for cash will be to fuel organic growth by investing in key initiatives related to omnichannel expansion international opportunities product innovation and further talent acquisition as always we planned to continue to carefully evaluate other opportunities including share repurchases and strategic acquisitions thanks for your time this morning we will now turn the call back over to the operator operator questionandanswer session operator the first question comes from jim duffy of stifel please go ahead jim v duffy  stifel nicolaus  co inc thanks good morning blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer good morning jim michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp hi jim jim v duffy  stifel nicolaus  co inc question for you guys on the stride rite brickandmortar business does that business make money and can you help us with a better understanding of the calculus around restructuring what type of comps are you assuming in the economic assessment for the stores looking forward are you assuming that the store base continues to comp negatively in your assessment of which stores need to be closed blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah weve got a complete fleet review under the way jim the brickandmortar stores themselves at the present time are not profitable so we believe that going forward the  stores or so stores that would be part of the goforward fleet will be profitable you have to remember stride rite which has a dominant presence in midtier and better children shoes in the united states has frankly a great and profitable wholesale business and also a growing ecommerce business as well so our assumptions going forward for the  stores are fairly conservative there is no hockeystick positive assumption assumed in our part a realistic bottomsup examination of the fleet michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp thats right and just to add to that i mean were looking at obviously the best real estate in the fleet the stores that remain on the goforward fleet list are those that are – where the four wall is obviously the highest and where they have the most momentum jim so the other part of the profitability of that model obviously has to do with just how we operate underneath that and with many fewer stores we think we can be much more efficient and more productive with the support that goes along with running those stores so our modeling right now as blake said is pretty conservative but our ability to focus on the right stores and the right real estate makes the math work out a little bit easy for us jim v duffy  stifel nicolaus  co inc mike will that be a pro forma benefit to earnings the more aggressive store closure agenda michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp yes it will blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah jim v duffy  stifel nicolaus  co inc and then another question for you guys just looking forward how much do you feel you need to reset volumes to keep the inventory balance at retail at a healthier level mike i know you mentioned this is going to last for a couple quarters are you guys indeed seeing down orders as you look into spring  blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah jim i think weve seen with a kind of a mixed backtoschool season here domestically in the us a very warm september i think weve seen as you know from the reports inventory of retailers in the united states have kind of ticked up all year so we think the channel now is fairly full any number of distribution channels here in the united states i would also say that in this type of an environment its no surprise that retailers are taking a pretty cautious approach to reorders and their own inventory levels so we dont really see that environment changing that much over here over the next several months certainly our inventory is narrow and deep in core styles and were going to be ready to service our retail customers who need it over the next several months jim v duffy  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay thank you michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp thanks jim operator the next question comes from ed yruma of keybanc please go ahead edward j yruma  keybanc capital markets inc hi thanks very much for taking my question this morning i know that you arent going to spend the full allotment of demand creation dollars so i guess could you contextualize if youre still going to spend the  million over three years and i know results have been a little bit difficult so maybe its hard to tell initially but are you seeing positive results and i know much of the spend was targeted towards sperry this year thank you blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah i would say on the incremental investment spend right now our threeyear plan is intact and we would proceed along our original line frankly for this year its come down a few million dollars our spend but  or so of the spend this year occurred in the first half and q with only about  planned in q so this year youre right it was about twothird spend on sperry and frankly next year our focus will be on the merrell brand edward j yruma  keybanc capital markets inc got it and clearly the foreign markets been challenged but i guess are you seeing kind of increased incursions in the merrell space and do you think thats weighing on results thank you very much blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer we havent really seen that i mean as you know competition is always fierce in our industry domestically and on a global basis merrell still remains the category champion in performance outdoor product weve missed the beat over the last couple of years in the lifestyle area but the new team is kind of focused on righting the ship there and getting back to healthy growth in that category edward j yruma  keybanc capital markets inc great thank you very much blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer thanks ed operator the next question comes from jay sole of morgan stanley please go ahead jay sole  morgan stanley  co llc hey good morning blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer good morning jay jay sole  morgan stanley  co llc so want to follow up on the inventory it sounds like the inventory is clean in terms of the quality and the inventory is high but maybe theres a little bit more than youd like and part of the plan among many things is to delay some future receipts now if thats right at what point does the inventory thats high quality now become aged how quickly do you have to move it to avoid having those big markdowns at the end of the season for the inventory michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp yeah exactly its a good question jay i mean this is really obviously very new inventory we talked about it at the end of q we mentioned sperry whos built up a little bit of inventory around their boot program and thats selling through really well right now we dont see there being any issues moving through that inventory some of our other boot brands also built a little bit more inventory in the quarter had a little more – had a little bit of softness in revenue as we mentioned but its core product and theyve already made the adjustments its not something that were doing right now but they scaled back on their inflow of goods a few months ago and theyll have their inventory levels down by the end of the year on the boot stuff so it sort of depends by brand but in general we dont think a twoquarter or threequarter work through of this would be unusual based on the nature – the core nature of the inventory but at the same time were being conservative were trying to be conservative to sort of plan through that way we get opportunities to move the inventory faster we will but were not going to take silly price concessions at this point its not the right thing to do for the business our balance sheet is still super strong so we dont need to take any kind of drastic effort to quickly reduce the inventory faster than what would rationally be done jay sole  morgan stanley  co llc okay thats helpful and then maybe blake you just touched on competition before can you just talk in broad terms about market share for some of the different brands maybe in the us and by the way congratulations on a great michigan state victory last weekend blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah thats exactly how i had planned the last  seconds of the game just to let you know but anyway they pulled it out im sitting here with stornant whos a university of michigan fan so its been a little hefty here over the last couple of days but i would – specifically what was your question jay sole  morgan stanley  co llc just on competition just your thoughts on how the different brands are faring in terms of market share in the us blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah i would say – let me go through our big brands as you know the data is not perfect it comes from a couple of different sources it doesnt cover the whole footwear market and this is domestically the data internationally is even harder to get and make any sense out but as you know the us footwear market grew about maybe  over the last  months more than half of that probably was price increases so a relatively stable overall market in terms of pairs clearly when you look at trends today one of the big trends – continuing big trends has been athleisure and athletic casual weve got a number of brands who can participate in that arena to be a little selfcritical of the company we probably have not been fast enough trying to take market share in that area market share for merrell saucony sperry keds and even the hush puppy body shoe collection so that probably – since this has been a long service trend probably five years or six years a bit of miss for the company merrell retains its number one position in performance outdoor certainly in the lifestyle category its got a lot of room for growth sperry remains absolutely dominant in both but especially on the womens side we know that the boat shoe silhouette has been trending downward from a fashion perspective it had frankly leveled off a couple of the quarters earlier in the years and its trending down a little bit again so sperry merrell kind of still dominant in their core categories wolverine boot remains the number one work boot brand in the premium market across the us market cat more of an international brand really an urban lifestyle brand on an international front its seen some very solid growth and then our other brands also fill some niche areas like as ive said stride rite is clearly dominant in kids jay sole  morgan stanley  co llc got it thanks so much operator the next question comes from taposh bari of goldman sachs please go ahead chad h sutherland  goldman sachs  co good morning its chad sutherland on for taposh blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer yes chad h sutherland  goldman sachs  co can we go through the constant currency sales by geography so emea apac latam et cetera blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah let me see if we can find the exact data michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp i would  blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah in constant currency i would say our international business overall did very well in the quarter the two regions that performed best were latin america so it was nice to see kind of a spring back from some trends wed seen in latin america over the last couple of quarters asia pacific certainly as a percentage growth was our number one region for growth really europe and us were somewhat more challenged markets in the quarter so if youre looking at it from a quarter standpoint international group certainly met or exceeded expectations with the best performance by far in latin america and asia pacific michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp yeah they were both up over  in the quarter kind of as expected and we talked a lot about some of the challenges we had in the emea region going into the quarter in our last call we talked about challenges for russia and italy and some of the markets in the emea region so its fairly flat in the emea but the other two regions were really strong chad h sutherland  goldman sachs  co great thank you and then just to follow up on keds it looks like the performance there slowed down pretty meaningfully in the quarter any color any context on whats going on with that brand and what the outlook is blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah i mean really keds did not anniversary they had a pretty – a significant transaction last year in q with one retailer decided for a variety of reasons not to anniversary that this year when you take away that one – basically that one transaction keds this quarter would have been up double digits again so our expectations for keds future growth is unabated at this point blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer and that was expected too chad that was not a surprise chad h sutherland  goldman sachs  co great thank you operator the next question comes from corinna van der ghinst of citigroup please go ahead corinna gayle van der ghinst  citigroup global markets inc broker hi good morning thank you blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer good morning corinna gayle van der ghinst  citigroup global markets inc broker good morning just thinking of some of the discretionary sga reductions that you guys were able to take in the third quarter how much more flexibility is there in your sga plan for q versus whats embedded in you guidance today and could you kind of just walk us through what specific buckets could be flexed to lower if necessary michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp sure yeah when we look at q there was a variety of things and i tried to highlight the bigger contributors in my prepared comments but obviously with volume theres some variable costs there that would change blake mentioned the fact that we still have committed some of our demand creation investment were not planning to adjust that at this point the typical things that we do from day to day across a brand portfolio in every region of the world we have levers that we can manage in a proactive basis in the third quarter we had to respond to some trends that sort of materialize in the quarter and going into q we have a little more visibility to what some of those would be were being pragmatic about that in q and i would say theres probably a little less flexibility in the q number than in the q number but as always well monitor and continue to challenge our spending in all the discretionary areas during the course of the quarter corinna gayle van der ghinst  citigroup global markets inc broker okay great and then just to follow up on sperry it looks like the setup this winter is for a pretty strong season for cold weather boots and you mentioned shipping in some very cold weather products in the third quarter what is your guidance kind of incorporate for that business do you need to see a strong cold winter season in order to meet the current guidance for sperry and if there is a strong season is there additional capacity to chase that once demand is there blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah i mean we overemphasized our investment in sperry boots for this fall i would say that of all of our brands probably sperry is the least affected by weather at this point it appears in this fall season their boot programs have sold in very well early theyre selling through very well right now we probably wished with hindsight we even had a little more inventory than we have today but sperrys initiative kind of to move beyond both and especially this year into vulcanized sneakers and into the boot category has been very successful so we dont really see any risk at all with sperry on the boot side for this fall corinna gayle van der ghinst  citigroup global markets inc broker all right thank you so much blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer thanks operator the next question comes from jonathan komp of robert w baird please go ahead jonathan r komp  robert w baird  co inc broker hi thanks guys maybe if i can start with just a clarification on sperry blake i know youve talked about the odysseys await campaign leading to some improvements in the customer metrics that you track and im wondering if you can just provide a little more context to that and then maybe some color on when you think that brand can get back to sustainable growth going forward blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah i think theres no doubt we saw with the pretty significant investment in the first half continued behind sperry which continued into q we saw the metrics really move in the right direction for that brand whether its consumer affinity or especially brand awareness we saw very strong triple quadrupledigit increase in awareness for both men and women for sperry in especially that critical yearold to yearold demographic so that was very good news sperry is obviously focused on product creation and innovation its focused especially in moving beyond boat sperry is a wonderful brand no impediment our retail customers want and need a big sperry business the consumer is certainly accepting of sperrys expansion into other footwear categories so were obviously going to focus on that and continue certainly as far as overall growth were just looking to see what happens with the boat shoe trend from a fashion standpoint pretty much more on the womens side than the mens theres been a little leveling off in the mens but thats been more of a steadyon category for sperry its really the fashion trend on the womens side thats been – that were replacing frankly with product beyond boat jonathan r komp  robert w baird  co inc broker got it thats helpful michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp the only thing id add too just on the platform investment and some of the things that are happening there really important to know that our international partners have embraced that platform too looking at opening new stores under the new concept but just a much more accessible global platform in the old sperry topsider story and i think thats really important because we obviously see opportunity for growth for sperry outside of the us jonathan r komp  robert w baird  co inc broker got it thats helpful maybe then just a broader question as you look forward today for the overall business heading into  im sure well hear a lot more about this in a few months but just wondering if you can maybe from a high level talk through some of the major puts and takes that you see and as you sit here today if you think kind of a meaningful earnings growth scenario is possible next year given some of the puts and takes that you see blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah i would say its – weve just entered the fourth quarter we havent even completed this years holiday season so were really not in the position to give you as much as everyone might like at some specifics on  guidance i would say that really kind of my prepared remarks kind of say it all weve taken maybe a conservative view of the world right now and the global consumer at the present time we think this is an opportunity for us to take market share in various markets around the world and you have to remember our business model consistently produces record free cash flow and earnings one of the things we forget about is even if you go back to  the biggest recession year we had we had about a  decrease in sales currency neutral our business model and the teams still delivered a record earnings and profit in that year so i think thats kind of reflective of just whats in our dna and how we can operate the business were pretty efficient operators across our brand portfolio jonathan r komp  robert w baird  co inc broker got it okay thanks for taking my questions blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer thanks michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp thanks jon operator the next question comes from erinn murphy of piper jaffray please go ahead erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co broker great thank you good morning blake i guess for you and then maybe mike if you could weigh in as well i mean given how you guys have framed up the environment could you just speak a little bit more about the underlying sales assumptions for q so maybe particularly delving in on the wholesale side what are you assuming for reorders and then has the initial order pattern shifted back later in the quarter and then maybe if you can finally just parse it out by what youre seeing with some of your better department stores versus the midtier versus the family channel that would be helpful blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah i would – i think erinn you have to remember about half our pairs are sold in international markets but we can certainly focus on the us market i think retailers right now and consumers to a certain extent are buying closer to need theyre taking a conservative approach coming off the backtoschool season weve all seen the numbers from the retail federation as to what they expect the holiday season which is a bit softer than what we experienced last year so i think retailers and consumers are buying closer to need were certainly going to have the inventory and core styles to satisfy that as far as channels are concerned its still a little bit early to get a read on that certainly we know that the more price sensitive lower distribution has done well over the last couple of years with respect to the promotional environment i believe its going to be very promotional this fall i think if this weather pattern continues a little bit were already seeing some increased promotions across the industry we think black friday is going to start substantially earlier than black friday for example so its just the environment we find it in right now clearly though if youre a brand or a retailer that is out there with fresh product youre going to do well at just about any price so its interesting across our business some of our most expensive product wolverine  mile sperry gold cup some of our more premium priced product continues to sell through very well and register with the consumer so its a little early yet i think the mid tier department stores in the us will probably be a little bit more promotional than they were last year in this environment michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp yeah just to add a couple things erinn to that point a good example for merrell is how much success they had in the third quarter with some of that premium distribution thats really for the really strong category form especially in the us that your performance product was up almost  in q so theres some interesting interesting signs there in terms of how the market is working in terms of the way we developed our revenue forecast for the quarter q is typically a quarter where well see about a third of the orders come through as at once or reorders the sort of the nature of our business during that quarter q and q are the quarters where we see more of that activity so were still assuming that we obviously have the benefit now of three full quarters of order intake and everything else to kind of use as a barometer for what were projecting into q and so were being – ill say were being properly realistic about what we expect in q and thats obviously one of the reasons why you see the revenue guidance coming down to the level that it is so weve got brands that are winning weve got several brands that are planning really meaningful growth in the fourth quarter based on the demand theyre seeing in their business saucony is one of those brands that will see doubledigit growth in q and weve got some of our other brands in the mid to high single digit range as well but our order assumptions and our revenue projections are fairly conservative at this point erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co broker okay thank you mike and then just on the stride rite closures whats the impact implied in your fourth quarter guidance michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp and impact relative to erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co broker just to revenue excuse me michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp revenue there arent – theres nothing changed most of the stores – i think all of the stores at this point that are still open will be opened almost all the way to the last day of the year erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co broker okay michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp but from a revenue standpoint there wont be any impact until next year erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co broker okay and then just my last clarification question just going back to jays question on inventory so it does sound like its going to take two quarters to three quarters maybe to work through some of the inventory i guess specifically where are you planning the increase to be by the fourth quarter end thanks michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp were still – weve got – were up about  right now its possible based on some of the trends and again it depends on brand i mentioned our boot brands we expect the boot brands are going to get back to normal by the end of the quarter so were projecting something similar in the high single digits but it could be – very well be slightly better than that if we get the right weather and other conditions help us out erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co broker okay thank you guys and best of luck operator the next question comes from christian buss of credit suisse please go ahead christian roland buss  credit suisse securities usa llc broker yeah i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about where youre finding sga savings to bring that sga dollar amount down in the fourth quarter michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp where were finding savings christian christian roland buss  credit suisse securities usa llc broker yes michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp again similar to q were going to see some of those variable costs flow through weve got benefits in several different areas and some of the benefit that we got in q related to some incentive comp adjustments those will flow through to a much smaller extent in q as well theres not really one focused area our marketing spend in the fourth quarter is going to be flat with the prior year at this point based on our projection so – and as blake said we still have a little more to spend on our demand creation investment so it comes from a variety of different areas that frankly we look at on a quarterbyquarter periodbyperiod basis christian roland buss  credit suisse securities usa llc broker thats helpful thanks and i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the level of visibility that you have right now you mentioned some challenges with the opentobuy in the past youve talked about the fourth quarter being a heavy reorder business could you talk a little bit about whats embedded in the expectations and in your visibility blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah i mean overall i think weve taken a fairly conservative view of our q based on what happened in period nine or happened in mid – the last month of our third quarter so we did see cancellations tick up a little bit we saw retailers getting a little bit more conservative im talking here about the us and not international of course and weve reflected that all in our q guidance christian roland buss  credit suisse securities usa llc broker thats helpful thank you and best of luck blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer thank you christian operator the next question comes from steve marotta of cl king  associates please go ahead steven l marotta  cl king  associates inc good morning everyone most of my questions have been asked and answered but blake i have one question for you and i understand the reticence about speaking about  but can you comment at all on the spring  – springsummer  order book trend youre seeing there whether youre – where you want to be or not just anything directionally there and again i understand the reticence of giving a specific number or even a directional number but anything at all would be helpful thanks blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah i mean i will say that we dont comment on our order book anymore as you know for a variety of good reasons its still early to comment on  well have plenty of details regarding our operating plan for  when we report our q results i would say right now though that some of the overall trends were seeing attitude by retailers primarily here in the us were seeing that also reflected into  they are just playing at a – are pretty conservative at the right time maybe well get some weather maybe a couple of other things will break for their business another way but right now theyre taking a pretty conservative approach on any number of levels steven l marotta  cl king  associates inc thats helpful thank you blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer thanks operator the next question comes from mitch kummetz of b riley please go ahead mitch kummetz  b riley  co llc yeah thanks i just want to follow up on steves question because blake in your prepared remarks you talked about these factors persisting into early  and you answered it there so what are the factors that you expect to persist is it just weak traffic trends is it high promotional levels is it conservative on the part of retailers and again does that manifest itself in just – especially as youre thinking about the early part of  does that manifest itself by retailers maybe revisiting their spring order books and maybe haircutting those or is there just underlying assumption that in q you would still expect to pick up normally some reorders on fall holiday and now you probably think less of that will come through just based on those factors could you just maybe elaborate a little bit more on that blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah mitch i mean frankly its a little hard at this point since were just getting into the holiday or just approaching holiday selling season i would say all of the factors you listed at the present time we believe are going to continue with respect to our domestic business our international business which is about half of our pair we are also anticipating that the dollar is going to remain very strong so in response our brands are working on their product engines to bring in product – a lot of product to price points that have been vacated for international partners so we all read about the geopolitical risks and challenges that are going on everyday around the world we really dont see any calming impact having there we think its going to be more a status quo we do think though at least domestically retailers are buying closer to need and theyre going to be reliant on brands that they trust and companies that can afford to be there with product when they need it and really im not being – im not trying to dodge your question ill have a lot more insight when we get into december but thats kind of the status at the present time mitch kummetz  b riley  co llc got it i can appreciate that and then just as a housekeeping one what is your euro assumption for the fourth quarter and then two mike you talked a little bit about in your prepared remarks i mean theres a gap between your sales and earnings guidance for the fourth quarter and it sounds like some of that was on interest and tax could you just – if you just go over that again or just maybe get maybe a little more specific on what your specific q interest expense other income and tax assumptions are michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp sure yeah i mean i guess on the interest side we talked about that and theres – a big chunk of that benefit is just coming from lower debt position lower cost of interest et cetera and there are just several other things that some of it relates to how we translate our balance sheet remeasure foreigndenominated balance sheets the remeasurement value of that the impact of that flows through to that line item on the pl so theres a little bit of benefit in there and there are a few other things that are flowing through that particular line item the tax rate is really again very much about the dynamic of our global business and we have an opportunity to recognize more income and some lower tax jurisdictions including our hong kong business which is very profitable and at a very low tax rate and then we also have just some discrete adjustments that we have planned to flow through in the fourth quarter that we didnt have last year the rate i quoted i think full year rate between  million and  million that could be anywhere between  million and  million of tax benefit that would impact the rate so its not that meaningful but were calling out in terms of updating the guidance so those are the main drivers there as far as the exchange rate you asked about the euro mitch kummetz  b riley  co llc yeah michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp the spot rate right now or the forecasted rate that we use for q assumption was  mitch kummetz  b riley  co llc all right thanks guys michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp sure thing operator the next question comes from chris svezia of susquehanna please go ahead chris svezia  susquehanna financial group lllp good morning everyone thanks for taking my question blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer hi chris chris svezia  susquehanna financial group lllp so i want to talk about pricing for a second asps and just kind of walk through it seemed like in some brands you are aggressive in pricing and had been maybe theres some pushback on the pricing thought process in some markets but at the same time were also looking to as you said earlier backfill price points where other brands might have vacated just maybe talk about the pricing dynamic and your ability to take price and sacrifice a little bit of unit volume versus where you might have been six months ago on your thoughts on pricing and just how that plays out as we think about it going forward michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp ill answer it first and then im sure blake will want to offer some of his thoughts but this is not a new tactic for us as a company it was a pretty dramatic strengthening of the dollar as we entered into  and probably had a bigger impact on our business this year than it would in a typical year but the approach that we took is very consistent and i dont think its one that we regret at all our brands obviously continue to evaluate what the impact really is out there is the fact that we raised prices is it other consumer sentiment issues in those markets that are having a bigger impact on some of the demand issues we obviously believe not only that we did the right thing we have other competitors that didnt follow suit and are experiencing the same challenges in the market that we are so the good news is we got there early weve been able to price that and well be able to anniversary that into next year so the opportunity to bring in products at those different price points to complement the assortment is something i think is an advantage for us because we acted really from a pricing standpoint were taking a longterm view that the dollar is going to remain strong for a while and so theres really not an option for us to pull back on pricing at this point thats not something that we want to do but were going to be very clear about every style and every opportunity every brand in each market everyone is different and we will be reevaluating that based on the benefit of a full seasons worth of sellthrough and everything else with our own foreign businesses and our partners as well and so the model going forward here is to stay the course but also to look for other opportunities to enhance margin as we go into  blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer i would say chris as well the sourcing environment that were seeing right now is probably the best ive seen in the last five years so certainly labor and overhead continues to go up when it comes to product cost but leather is down significantly from last year lower commodity prices are also contributing to lower quotes from our factories so this will be the first year in many years where on carryover product were probably going to see a pricing decrease chris svezia  susquehanna financial group lllp okay all right thank you and then the second question i had was just on the merrell brand just maybe walk through what youre thinking about for spring of  i think in march theres going to be a pretty significant investment and marketing campaign is anything based on what youve seen in the business so far changed that thought process is that still a goforward strategy and any color about what you might anticipate or what you anticipate seeing from that investment blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah i would think – just to take a step back from merrell i mean obviously the continued focus on product creation and innovation not just in the performance category but especially adding some talent on the lifestyle side for our international businesses in particular backfilling with good product maybe good product internationally that is now priced like better product and then again to refocus on athletic casuals and athleisure so there is a number of levers that the team is pulling on the product creation side we do intend to invest behind the brand platform but a revised more athletic company like gotomarket strategy for key offerings in the merrell line it can be an expanded moab collection with one key strategic retail partner im talking domestically now it can be an expanded capra program for another key strategic it can be an expanded all out program for another one and then some more moderately priced search and enjoy product for another key retailer thats going to be a change for the brand and one that jim gave and the team are implementing this year in my view still a big opportunity for merrell a lot of people dont know about merrell we think everybody does because it has such a dominant position in the outdoor category but a lot of people dont know about merrell and yet the brand consistently sits there with the number two intent to repurchase of all brands in this market so theres a lot of different levers to pull a lot of them are on the product side and some new introductions and were going to invest behind chris svezia  susquehanna financial group lllp one quick followup is – i might have missed this is taylor swift and keds is that still together after this year or is that – just any update on that relationship blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah i havent had a recent update but we think certainly keds is coming out with a new brand platform and campaign the keds brand is frankly – i cant believe im saying this – but its bigger than taylor swift and she is about as big as you can get but were going to put more emphasis on the keds brand this year but we will still – it appears right now we will still have taylor swift on the keds team into  chris svezia  susquehanna financial group lllp okay thank you all the best appreciate it michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp thank you chris operator the next question comes from scott krasik of buckingham research group please go ahead blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer we lose you scott operator mr krasik your line is open scott d krasik  the buckingham research group inc hey sorry about that sorry about that sorry about that i know its late blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer okay scott d krasik  the buckingham research group inc so just a few clarifications thanks for taking my question so the basispoint fx headwinds in q impacting gross margin maybe talk about what the benefits or the offsets to get to an up gross margin in q would be i think theres something with the treatment of your lifo expense michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp no not really not this year sometimes that happens in the fourth quarter but we had some easier comps in q based on some adjustments that were made to last years fourth quarter some allowance and promotional stuff that we had to deal with related to some of our brands getting out of some distribution that were not happy with and so we took some of that pain in the fourth quarter last year which kind of increased our markdown exposure and some of those things that were not going to anniversary thats part of it and we talked about that last quarter but really its the price increases and its the better quality of our business and we were – we talked about cleanliness i guess or the high quality of our inventory but its really been true all year long i mean were selling less closeouts our first quality sales are better weve spent the last year really focused on cleaning up and focusing the inventory and its had a real positive impact on gross margin we talked about price increases for sperry as well as for our international markets and thats helped us to really combat or mitigate the currency costs and weve had some other things go in our favor including the beginnings of some of the product cost benefits that blake alluded to thatll be more meaningful next year but still has a small benefit in the third quarter scott d krasik  the buckingham research group inc thanks mike and then what percentage of your sperry sales at this point are international michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp from a unit standpoint its about  scott d krasik  the buckingham research group inc but thats all traditional distributorbased business now right youre not licensing that at all blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer pretty much yeah we dont have a licensed business for sperry yeah i would say over the last three years the sperry international –  was kind of a getstarted year for many of our brands our bostonbased brands keds saucony and sperry and weve had real growth in  and real growth in  thats accelerating but the sperry international business has increased at over a  clip over that period of time as has saucony and frankly the keds international business is even higher than that so we always knew it was going to take a little time but once we get some traction it continues to grow scott d krasik  the buckingham research group inc and any visibility there is that going to continue at that rate blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah i mean we expect all three of those brands to continue at that rate i mean i would say sperry doesnt have as large as international business as hush puppies or merrell or even saucony but we expect it to certainly continue at that rate into the future scott d krasik  the buckingham research group inc great thanks a lot blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer very early on the growth curve there scott d krasik  the buckingham research group inc thanks blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer thanks scott operator the next question comes from sam poser of sterne agee please go ahead samuel marc poser  crt capital group llc good morning thank you for taking my questions i wanted to know could you give us the ebit dollars by segment number one and to follow up on mitchs question whats the interest expense and the other expenses are expected for the fourth quarter in actual dollars could you just give us an idea of where that is or the range please michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp give me the last part sam i missed that samuel marc poser  crt capital group llc the interest expense and the other expenses in dollars expected in q michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp all right i can give you that so in q on a net basis its about  million this year versus about  million almost  million last year i guess so  million improvement samuel marc poser  crt capital group llc combined or is that the interest expense michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp no thats combined so the interest expense samuel marc poser  crt capital group llc so whats the michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp yep the interest expense is  million versus  million last year the other items are about  million benefit versus about  million expense last year samuel marc poser  crt capital group llc okay thanks and then – and the ebit by segment for the quarter michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp we dont generally give that out in the call sam so – and i dont have it by segment right here in front of me anyway but we typically dont share that samuel marc poser  crt capital group llc no i know i just thought given the way the numbers have been changing over time and really that gives us a good look at the whole profitability picture by segment could you put out something before the q and whenever that comes out to tell us because it will help everybody make a better gauge as to where things are i believe michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp well i think the q is just about to go out but well consider that in the future for sure samuel marc poser  crt capital group llc okay and then you talked about the good sourcing blake with the improvement in the sourcing i know youve taken price increases but i mean what kind of efficiencies are you seeing are you changing the materials are you changing the materials that youre using linings and so on to save money are you doing anything to upset the quality of the product or when youre doing – when youre making these changes blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer no not at all sam these are just what i talked about before including the improving prices are really tied to weather commodities and how all of that impacts the sourcing sheet by pair none of what i talked to earlier really goes to any kind of despecking the shoes or taking any actions in that regard and frankly thats not something we would do as a company all of our bigger brands certainly have a better – a good better best brand offering but we dont anticipate any significant changes there whatsoever samuel marc poser  crt capital group llc just one last question when youre looking at merrell and sperry across the different categories and looking within the quarter and into next year of whatever growth youre planning i mean how much of this growth is going to be within existing distribution lets talk about the us because international well have an opportunity for sperry but with an existing distribution or adding new distribution to the brands blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah most of the growth for next year we anticipate from taking more shelf space at existing distribution so we do not right now anticipate any – for example any significant family channel increase over what we had in  sam michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp as an example for merrell sam i mean all of the partnership alliances that merrell has right now are all with premium retailers pretty much so the growth there and the new gotomarket strategy is really to play up the premium product as much as possible and gain share in that same distribution with the same retailers not just the channel samuel marc poser  crt capital group llc well that just brings another question and then ill let it go you talk a lot about the macro about the way the retailers are at the same time i think blake you mentioned that you have to be right on the money with the product and so on so i guess when youre looking at the world around you how much of the issues out there are basically you guys need to improve the products improve the way you go to market with stuff versus the macro because the macro it seems like an equal opportunity annoyance for absolutely everybody blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah i absolutely agree with you sam i mean the macro environment impacts everybody we all know it begins with products products products we know that in our industry there is quite a bit a need as well as want and if youre out there with great product youve got a chance to win in any environment and when you look at merrell and sperry for sperry its fundamentally how fast can they move beyond boat theyre going to remain dominant in the boat shoe category an extremely important category here domestically and in some international markets but obviously a total acceptance by the sperry consumer and retailers to move beyond boat for sperry and theyre focused on that and on merrell its really a fundamental question of regaining some traction in the lifestyle area for the brand and again the product creation innovation team there is busy on that the new team probably is going to need a little more time to get where we want it to be but thats the fundamental issue the macro environment is going to test some smaller brands and smaller businesses weve been through this before weve seen this movie and its going to be a bit of a challenging environment for some good but maybe smaller brands and smaller businesses samuel marc poser  crt capital group llc thank you for taking my questions thanks michael d stornant  chief financial officer treasurer  senior vp okay thanks sam operator the next question comes from laurent vasilescu of macquarie please go ahead laurent vasilescu  macquarie capital usa inc good morning thank you for taking my questions can you update us on the number of international distributor signups i think the last updated number was around  and can you tell us specifically how they are performing blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah are you talking about kind of our bostonbased brands laurent vasilescu  macquarie capital usa inc correct blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah i think weve got new agreements or reupped agreements for over  countries today for those brands since the beginning of  weve added well over  points of dedicated distribution for those brands saucony keds and sperry are all growing at over a  rate each year and that includes the kind of – that includes the start year which is really  so we continue to see strong doubledigit growth there we – those brands are still all underpenetrated internationally when you compare them to for instance a caterpillar or merrell or hush puppies so again still early there we still continue to make progress laurent vasilescu  macquarie capital usa inc okay great and then last month it was outlined during a conference that you were thinking about an acquisition in the range of  million to  million curious to know your updated line of thinking on this as we start seeing a more challenging macroeconomic environment blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah i would say – thats a good question i would say that as you know we have a very disciplined approach when it comes to acquisitions we have a bit of an unusual macroeconomic environment in front of us right now were focusing a lot of our time energy in growing what we have and in getting more earnings out of our current portfolio that being said if the right strategic opportunity came around the right dovetail fit we are certainly in a financial position now to act on it it could be a lifestyle or performance brand we normally like brands with some authenticity and heritage it could have some lifestyle potential beyond footwear certainly geographic expansion opportunities are always high in our criteria list so as ive said before some of the best acquisitions weve done over the years are the ones weve had the discipline not to do and were pretty – we have a pretty disciplined approach and a pretty successful track record over the last  years laurent vasilescu  macquarie capital usa inc great and then my last question is on favorable input costs i think during the investor day a few years back it was mentioned that you purchased about  million worth of leather for  and to your point that leather prices are dropping significantly over the last six months can you help us think about the gross margin benefit for next year in terms of leather and also potentially on the oilbased inputs blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah i mean its hard for me to parcel it out whether its leather or other commodity pricings but we could anticipate overall this is for carryover products kind of as an example but we could see overall price decreases in the  or  range here over  when youre sourcing  million pairs a year like we are that is not insignificant and its something frankly we havent seen in a long time laurent vasilescu  macquarie capital usa inc great thank you very much best of luck blake w krueger  chairman president  chief executive officer thanks operator thank you the questionandanswer session has now
