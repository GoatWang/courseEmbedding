executive of amc networks which went public on july   on may   dish network announced that it would no longer carry the amc networks family of cable channels upon the expiration of the satellite providers distribution agreement with the company at the end of june  citing that amc networks charged an excessive amount in retransmission consent payments from the service for their carriage and low audience viewership for the channels amc networks responded to dish networks announcement of its pending removal of the channels as being related to a  breach of contract lawsuit against dish network by former company parent rainbow medias voom hd networks which is pending trial in the new york state supreme court in which it is seeking more than  billion in damages against dish network for improperly terminating its carriage contract vooms highdefinition channels were carried on the provider from may   until may   when dish removed ten of vooms fifteen channels from its lineup and the five remaining channels the following day dish network stated that the lawsuit is unrelated to the decision to remove the amc networks channels and that it ended the carriage agreement on its own terms on may   dish network removed sundance channel from its channel lineup two weeks later on june   dish relocated amc wetv and ifc to higher channel positions with amc being split into two separate standard definition and high definition channel feeds amc moved from channel  to channel  for the sd feed and  for the hd feed wetv moved from channel  to channel  and ifc was moved from channel  to channel  the former channel lineup spaces occupied by the three channels were respectively replaced with hdnet style and movieplex multiplex channel indieplex the move is believed to be in response to an ad run during a june  airing of an episode of mad men urging dish network customers to inform the company to keep the three amc networks channels on the satellite provider with dish network stating that the relocated channel positions better reflect the channels’ ratings on july   dish network dropped amc wetv and ifc from the channel lineup altogether on july   amc said in an

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed
