financial planning and budgeting it also provides dashboards or applications that visually represent how a company is performing on a set of measurements such as improving customer response time or

upgrade his companys business applications software the computer coding that automates a wide range of administrative tasksoracle makes most of its money from its marketleading position in database software but growth in that market has been tapering off in recent years  a factor that convinced ellison that oracle needed to seize a bigger piece of the business applications marketgermanybased sap has long been the leader in the business applications field but oracle has been narrowing the gap by snapping up an array of other software makers most notably peoplesoft inc and siebel systems oracle has spent more than  billion on  acquisitions during the past three yearsoracle is determined to drive more consolidationand make things a bit more uncomfortable for their rival sap said mayiz habbal a managing director for celent a consulting firmsap said it remained unconcerned by oracles expansion predicting it will only confuse oracle customers and drive more sales its way the hyperion deal is one more way that oracle attempts to hide the fact that applications is not its core business whereas applications has been and will continue to be saps core business sap said in its statementdespite
