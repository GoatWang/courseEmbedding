navigation search not to be confused with cartography kartenanamorphote not kartogramm of germany with the states and districts resized according to population a cartogram is a map in which some thematic mapping variable – such as travel time population or gross national product – is substituted for land area or distance the geometry or space of the map is distorted in order to convey the

which illustrates the relative sizes of the populations of the countries of the world by scaling the area of each country in proportion to its population the shape and relative location of each

cartograms shown on this page are typically distorting the shape of spatial units to some degree but they are strict at preserving correct neighborhood relationships between them scaleddown cartograms from the ny times example are strictly shapepreserving another branch of cartograms introduced by dorling replaces actual shapes with circles scaled according to the mapped feature circles are distributed to resemble the original topology demers cartogram is a variation of dorling cartogram but it uses rectangles instead of circles and attempts to retain visual cues at the expense of minimum distance schematic maps based on quad trees can be seen as non shapepreserving cartograms with some degree of neighborhood preservation a collection of about  contiguous area cartograms is
