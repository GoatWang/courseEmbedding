a global provider of unified smart gridrelated products and services for the energy and utility industries announced today that its board of directors as approved by their majority shareholder has approved the initiation of the process for the uplist on nasdaq capital market immediately the company believes that given its balance sheet position post spc acquisition it would meet all of the quantitative listing requirements for the nasdaq capital market other than those relating to the minimum bid price for listed shares which is  per share the company cannot assure you that it will be successful in achieving a listing on the nasdaq capital market or any other exchange the process of qualification and listing may require additional due diligence and consultation with appropriate entities and finra we will inform our shareholders of our progress as we initiate and complete the processthe board of directors feels that based on our growth potential present  future partners initial public offerings of our main competitors our worldclass products and services our utility customers and our acquisition of spc southern power  control we believe increases the chance of the company successfully listing the common stock on the nasdaq stock market particularly the nasdaq capital market stated sam talari infrax systems inc cochairman we further believe that listing on the nasdaq capital market would enhance the companys visibility commercial credibility and create a better liquid marketplace for our investors and better financing terms that would allow for certain commercial opportunities not currently available to the company the company believes that a listing on the nasdaq capital market if effectuated may generate greater interest among our present and
