as a component of benefits offered to employees k plans are a very popular way to accumulate taxdeferred income and earnings for retirement  employers offer k plans as a way to help their employees save for retirement you choose how much pretax income you wish to contribute and that amount is automatically deducted from your paycheck and placed into your account within the k plan your retirement savings can continue to grow taxdeferred until you make a withdrawal you do not pay taxes on your salary deferrals or earnings until you take a withdrawal from the plan generally if you take the distribution after age ½ there is no tax penalty   one difference from an ira is that k plans permit higher contribution limits and are only available through your employer      key features because your employer sponsors the k plan there may be other valuable benefits offered in addition to salary deferrals check your plan carefully the following are key features provide a brief overview to assist you optional participation although some plan sponsors automatically enroll employees to promote plan participations k plan participation is still optional check with your employer to determine how you can enroll  contribution rate you can choose the amount you want to contribute each payroll up to established irs limits you will also be permitted to change your contribution rate once you are in the plan your k plan contribution comes out of your paycheck on a pretax basis which lowers your taxable income for that pay period that’s a good thing  available investments you can choose from a variety of investment choices selected by your employer deferred taxes not only do your pretax contributions help lower your taxable income each pay period but all earnings on your contributions grow tax deferred note some plans offer a roth k which permit savings on an after tax basis   you will not be taxed on either the contributions or earnings until you make a withdrawal  optional employer match to provide an extra boost to retirement savings many employers match a percentage of an employee’s contribution which will be given to the employee once she is vested  accessing funds during employment loans—as an optional feature your employer may permit you to borrow against your plan account up to specified irs limits hardship withdrawals—understanding that certain hardships arise the irs permits plans to allow distributions for certain hardship reasons  portability if you leave your job you can remain in the plan or rollover your k funds into an ira or another k support your k plan provider typically offers many free tools and resources to help you establish savings goals measure your progress and to see how financially close you are to meeting your retirement goals the  and b plans are similar to k plans but are typically offered by other types of organizations the  plan is offered to employees of state and local governments the b plan is offered only to the employees of public schools and qualified taxexempt organizations such as highereducation churches taxexempt hospitals and charities roth accounts may also be offered by a plan sponsor under k b or governmental b plans roth contributions are made after you’ve paid taxes on the income but qualified distributions may be taken taxfree in retirement   suitable for the k is a key financial tool for almost anyone trying to save as much as possible for their retirement   eligibility you must be employed by a plan sponsor offering a k plan to participate  if you leave employment you will no longer be able to contribute to the plan  some employers will let you keep your savings in their plan after you leave  you can always combine all of your old plans into one rollover ira or in most cases into the k plan offered by your new employer contributions are deducted from your paycheck up to certain irsdefined annual limits contributions can be designated as a specific dollar amount or percentage of your pay the contributions are taken before taxes lowering your current income tax bill you will owe income taxes when you make a withdrawal from the plan withdrawals prior to

financial announces fixed index annuity product by rachel summit with annuity fyi in annuities annuity fixed indexed annuities indexed annuities voya financial in an expansion of its portfolio of fixed index annuity products voya financial inc nyse voya has just announced the new voya journey index annuity according to a recent insurancenewsnet article the new product provides investors with a simple “two stage interestcrediting approach that offers full growth potential while providing protection from market declines” individuals also have the flexibility to use multiple crediting strategies with the addition of dynamic indices from jp morgan jp morgan meridiansm index  and citigroup citi dynamic asset selector  excess return index “americans are looking for new ways to grow and protect their retirement savings in today’s uncertain world” stated voya’s ceo of annuities and individual life carolyn johnson “the voya journey index annuity gives individuals the ability to plan with confidence they can enjoy the benefits of increasing their future retirement income and rest easy knowing that their hardearned savings are protected from unpredictable market swings”   the new annuity product is a singlepremium deferred fixed index annuity that offers full participation in the growth of one or more dynamic indices over a sevenyear time period individuals can pick between the jp morgan and citigroup indices which both seek to adjust to market conditions to provide steady growth potential but one of the most distinguishing features of the voya journey index annuity is the simple “two stage” approach to growing retirement funds in the first stage the account value can potentially earn an annual “performance” credit when the selected index remains above the initial level during the first six years in the second stage the policyholder has the potential to earn more interest credit at the end of the seventh year  of the selected index gains over the sevenyear period are credited to the original premium “in today’s low interest rate environment the voya journey index annuity is a good alternative to taxable bank certificates or the volatility of bond mutual funds” johnson added “individuals have the opportunity to potentially earn better returns and still have protection from market volatility” the market for fixed index annuities is growing making the voya journey index annuity even more attractive according to limra sales data fixed index annuity sales increased  in the first nine months of  when compared to the same time frame the previous year industry experts believe that this demonstrates an interest by consumers in the benefits of such products to help provide a dependable stream of income in retirement the new fixed index
