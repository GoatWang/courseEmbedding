applies to shell companies may hinder your resale of your shares of the company   going concern our independent auditor has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern given our lack of operating history and the fact that to date we have generated no revenues potential investors should be aware that there are difficulties associated with being a new venture and the high rate of failure associated with this fact   we have an accumulated deficit of  and have not generated any revenues since inception our future is dependent upon our ability to obtain financing and upon future profitable operations from our operations these factors raise substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern   our company and our officers directors any company

during our last fiscal year we qualify as an  “emerging growth company”  as defined in the jumpstart our business startups act or the jobs act enacted in april  an  “emerging growth company”  may take advantage of reduced reporting requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies these provisions include but are not limited to             being permitted to present only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this prospectus        not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section  of the sarbanesoxley act of  as amended        reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports proxy statements and registration statements and        exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved we may use these provisions until the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the closing of our initial public offering however if certain events occur prior to the end of such fiveyear period including if we become a  “large accelerated filer”  our annual gross revenue exceed  billion or we issue more than  billion of nonconvertible debt in any threeyear period we will cease to be an emerging growth company prior to the end of such fiveyear period   the jobs act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards we have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under section b of the jobs act that allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies as a result of this election our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates   summary financial information   because

addition to other information provided in this prospectus you should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating our business before purchasing any of our common stock  all material risks are discussed in this section   risks related to our company   our having generated no revenues from operations makes it difficult for us to evaluate our future business prospects and make decisions based on those estimates of our future performance   as of february   we have generated no revenues and incurred a loss of  as a consequence it is difficult if not impossible to forecast our future results based upon our historical data  because of the related uncertainties we may be hindered in our ability to anticipate and timely adapt to increases or decreases in revenues and expenses  if we make poor budgetary decisions as a result of unreliable data we may never become profitable or incur losses which may result in a decline in our stock price    we may be unable to continue paying the costs of being a reporting public company   the costs of being a public reporting company under the securities exchange act of  may be substantial and the company may not be able to absorb the costs of being a public company which may cause us to cease being public in the future or require additional fundraising in order to remain in business we estimate that in the future costs for legal and accounting will be approximately  per year    we are subject to compliance with securities law which exposes us to potential liabilities including potential rescission rights   we may offer to sell our common stock to investors pursuant to certain exemptions from the registration requirements of the securities act of  as well as those of various state securities laws the basis for relying on such exemptions is factual that is the applicability of such exemptions depends upon our conduct and that of those persons contacting prospective investors and making the offering we may not seek any legal opinion to the effect that any such offering would be exempt from registration under any federal or state law instead we may elect to relay upon the operative facts as the basis for such exemption including information provided by investor themselves   if any such offering did not qualify for such exemption an investor would have the right to rescind its purchase of the securities if it so desired it is possible that if an investor should seek rescission such investor would succeed a similar situation prevails under state law in those states where the securities may be offered without registration in reliance on the partial preemption from the registration or qualification provisions of such state statutes under the national securities markets improvement act of  if investors were successful in seeking rescission we would face severe financial demands that could adversely affect our business and operations additionally if we did not in fact qualify for the exemptions upon which it has relied we may become subject to significant fines and penalties imposed by the sec and state securities agencies     our auditor has indicated in its report that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as a result of our lack of revenues and if we are unable to generate significant revenue or secure financing we may be required to cease or curtail our operations      our auditor has indicated in its report that our lack of revenues raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern  the financial statements do not include adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty if we are unable to generate significant revenue or secure financing we may be required to cease or curtail our operations     our certificate of incorporation and bylaws limit the liability of and provide indemnification for our officers and directors   our certificate of incorporation generally limits our officers’ and directors’ personal liability to the company and its stockholders for breach of fiduciary duty as an officer or director except for breach of the duty of loyalty or acts or omissions not made in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide indemnification for our officers and directors to the fullest extent authorized by the wyoming general corporation law against all expense liability and loss including attorneys fees judgments fines excise taxes or penalties and amounts to be paid in settlement reasonably incurred or suffered by an officer or director in connection with any action suit or proceeding whether civil or criminal administrative or investigative hereinafter a “proceeding to which the officer or director is made a party or is threatened to be made a party or in which the officer or director is involved by reason of the fact that he is or was an officer or director of the company or is or was serving at the request of the company whether the basis of the proceeding is an alleged action in an official capacity as an officer or director or in any other capacity while serving as an officer or director thus the company may be prevented from recovering damages for certain alleged errors or omissions by the officers and directors for liabilities incurred in connection with their good faith acts for the company  such an indemnification payment might deplete the companys assets stockholders who have questions regarding the fiduciary obligations of the officers and directors of the company should consult with independent legal counsel it is the position of the securities and exchange commission that exculpation from and indemnification for liabilities arising under the securities act of  as amended and the rules and regulations thereunder is against public policy and therefore unenforceable   we are dependent on the sale of our securities to fund our operations    we are dependent on the sale of our securities to fund our operations and will remain so until we generate sufficient revenues to pay for our operating costs  our officers and directors have made no written commitments with respect to providing a source of liquidity in the form of cash advances loans andor financial guarantees there can be no guarantee that we will be able to successfully sell our equity or debt securities   the company may not be able to attain profitability without additional funding which may be unavailable   the company has limited capital resources unless the company begins to generate sufficient revenues to finance operations as a going concern the company may experience liquidity and solvency problems such liquidity and solvency problems may force the company to cease operations if additional financing is not available no known alternative resources of funds are available in the event we do not generate sufficient funds from operations   expenses required to operate as a public company will reduce funds available to develop our business and could negatively affect our stock price and adversely affect our results of operations cash flow and financial condition   operating as a public company is more expensive than operating as a private company including additional funds required to obtain outside assistance from legal accounting investor relations or other professionals that could be more costly than planned  we may also be required to hire additional staff to comply with additional sec reporting requirements  we anticipate that the cost of sec reporting will be approximately  annually  our failure to comply with reporting requirements and other provisions of securities laws could negatively affect our stock price and adversely affect our results of operations cash flow and financial condition  if we fail to meet these requirements we will be unable to secure a qualification for quotation of our securities on the otc bulletin board or if we have secured a qualification we may lose the qualification and our securities would no longer trade on the otc bulletin board  further if we fail to meet these obligations and consequently fail to satisfy our sec reporting obligations investors will then own stock in a company that does not provide the disclosure available in quarterly annual reports and other required sec reports that would be otherwise publicly available leading to increased difficulty in selling their stock due to our becoming a nonreporting issuer   our lack of history makes evaluating our business difficult     we have a limited operating history and we may not sustain profitability in the future      to sustain profitability we must      develop mobile applications for which there is significant consumer deamnd      compete with larger more established competitors in the mobile appli      build maintain and enhance our portfolio of individual labels and overall brand recognition and      adapt to meet changes in our markets and competitive developments   we may not be successful in accomplishing these objectives further our lack of operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects our prospects must be considered in light of the risks uncertainties expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of development particularly companies in highly competitive industries the historical information in this report may not be indicative of our future financial condition and future performance   risks related to our business   we operate in highly competitive and rapidly evolving technology markets and our market share and results of operations could be adversely affected if we fail to compete effectively in the future   the mobile application market is highly competitive and evolving rapidly competition is generally based on brand name recognition product quality and purchasing convenience our business will likely face competition from other large corporations and regional investment groups we have no direct competitors that compete within our business model per se however we compete with many companies and investment groups that seek to purchase distressed and undervalued or underfunded mobile applications software programs and other small patentable technologies with the intention of maximizing its monetization potential moreover the market for mobile games in particular is crowded with a large number of established and specialized companies see risks related to our business  “the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and many of our competitors have significantly greater resources than we do”   the business to consumer marketplace is highly competitive if we cannot develop and promote confidence in our company we may not be able to compete with our competitors which would adversely affect our ability to general revenues   we have many potential competitors in the business to consumer marketplace in most instances our competition is competent experienced and has greater financial and marketing resources than we do at the present our ability to compete may be adversely affected by the ability of these competitors to devote greater resources to the development promotion and marketing of their services than are available to us our competitors may also offer a wider range of products and have greater brand recognition they may have greater customer loyalty bases and these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities in addition our competitors may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities and adopt more aggressive advertising campaigns than the company   the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and many of our competitors have significantly greater resources than we do     developing or enhancing development of distributing and selling mobile applications and mobile gaming applications is a highly competitive business marked by continuous introductions of new products as well as rapidly emerging platforms technologies and digital storefronts  for players we compete primarily on the basis of game quality brand and customer reviews  we compete for promotional and storefront placements based on these factors as well as our relationship with the digital storefront owner historical performance perception of sales potential and relationships with licensors of brands properties and other content  for content and brand licensors we compete based on royalty and other economic terms perceptions of development quality porting abilities speed of execution distribution breadth and relationships with storefront owners we also compete for experienced and talented employees and consultants   we compete with a continually increasing number of public companies including activision dena disney electronic arts ea mobile gameloft gree gungho online entertainment king digital entertainment nexon warner brothers and zynga and many wellfunded private companies including kabam machine zone rovio storm team lava and supercell  in addition we face competition from online game developers and distributors who are primarily focused on specific international markets  we could also face increased competition if those companies choose to compete more directly in the united states or the other markets that are significant to us or if large companies with significant online presences such as apple google amazon facebook or yahoo choose to enter or expand into the game space or develop competing games      in addition given the open nature of the development and distribution for smartphones and tablets and the relatively low barriers to entry we also compete or will compete with a vast number of small companies and individuals who are able to create and launch games and other content for these devices using relatively limited resources and with relatively limited startup time or expertise the proliferation of titles in these open developer channels makes it difficult for us to differentiate ourselves from other developers and to compete for players without substantially increasing our marketing expenses and development costs   some of our competitors and our potential competitors have one or more advantages over us either globally or in particular geographic markets which include     • significantly greater financial resources     • greater experience with the freetoplay games and more effective game monetization     • stronger brand and consumer recognition regionally or worldwide     • greater experience and effectiveness integrating community features into their games and increasing the revenues derived from their users through social gamification     • the capacity to leverage their marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of mobile and nonmobile products     • larger installed user bases from their existing mobile games     • larger installed user bases from related platforms such as console gaming or social networking websites to which they can market and sell mobile games     • more substantial intellectual property of their own from which they can develop games without having to pay royalties     • lower labor and development costs and better overall economies of scale     • greater platformspecific focus experience and expertise and     • broader global distribution and presence   if we are unable to compete effectively or we are not as successful as our competitors in our target markets our sales could decline our margins could decline and we could lose market share any of which would materially harm our business operating results and financial condition   sales of and demand for our portfolio products may decrease if we fail to keep pace with evolving consumer preferences and trends   our success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to evolving consumer preferences and trends and to translate these preferences and trends into marketable product offerings if we are unable to successfully anticipate identify or react to changing styles or trends or misjudge the market for our products our sales may be lower than expected and we may be faced with a significant amount of unsold finished goods inventory     in response we may be forced to increase our marketing promotions provide markdown allowances to our customers or liquidate excess merchandise any of which could have a material adverse effect on our net sales and profitability our brand image may also suffer if customers believe that we are no longer able to offer innovative products respond to consumer preferences or maintain the quality of our products   since our freetoplay games can be downloaded and played for free we have to succeed in generating a significant number of game installations and significant userbase growth  however we will rely on a very small portion of our total players for nearly all of our revenues derived from inapp purchases as opposed to advertisements and incentivized offers  to significantly increase our revenues we must increase the number of players who convert into a paying player by making inapp purchases increase the amount that our paying players spend in our games andor increase the length of time our players generally play our games  we may encounter difficulties with game monetization for example developing a sufficient quantity and variety of virtual goods to enable a relatively large scale of inapp purchases by an individual user if we cannot predict consumer preferences and trends   we will likely derive the majority of our revenues from apple’s app store and the google play store and if either of these storefronts were unavailable for any prolonged period of time our business will suffer      our first mobile application is currently available on the apple app store and we intend to make an android version available on the google play store in the future the majority of our smartphone revenues will likely be derived from apple’s ios platform with the significant majority of such revenues derived from inapp purchases  we will try to generate the balance of our iosrelated revenues from offers and advertisements in games distributed on the apple app store and to a far lesser extent sales of premium games   we will need to maintain a good relationship with apple and google which can lead to our applications being featured on their storefronts when they were commercially released  if we do not receive prominent featuring users may find it more difficult to discover our games and we may not generate revenues from them  we may also be required to spend significantly more on marketing campaigns to increase visibility of our products and generate substantial revenues on these platforms  in addition currently neither apple nor google charges a publisher when it features one of their apps  if either apple or google were to charge publishers to feature an app it could cause our marketing expenses to increase considerably  accordingly any change or deterioration in our relationship with apple or google could materially harm our business and likely cause our stock price to decline      we will likely rely on the continued functioning of the apple app store and the google play store  in the past these digital storefronts have been unavailable for short periods of time or experienced issues with their inapp purchasing functionality   if either of these events recurs on a prolonged basis or other similar issues arise that impact our ability to generate revenues from these storefronts it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results  in addition if these storefront operators fail to provide high levels of service our players’ ability to access our games may be interrupted or players may not receive the virtual currency or goods for which they have paid which may adversely affect our brand   we may publish games developed by third parties which may expose us to a number of potential operational and legal risks     our company may plan on entering into relationships with developers of games primarily in asian and eastern european markets where we will localize and globally publish those games   we may be required to provide third party developers with upfront license fees or nonrecoupable minimum guarantees in order to obtain the rights to publish their games and we may incur significant costs marketing these games after they have been commercially launched     the games may not be commercially successful if they do not appeal to a western audience if our limited experience in publishing other developers’ games leads to unexpected results or for any other reason which would negatively impact our operating results   in addition if any of the games created by third party developers with which we work or acquire infringe intellectual property owned by others or otherwise violate any third party’s rights or any applicable laws and regulations such as laws with respect to data collection and privacy we would be exposed to potential legal risks by publishing these games        the operators of digital storefronts on which we publish our freetoplay games and the advertising channels through which we acquire some of our players in many cases have the unilateral ability to change and interpret the terms of our and others’ contracts with them    we will likely distribute our freetoplay games through directtoconsumer digital storefronts for which the distribution terms and conditions are often  “click through” agreements that we are not able to negotiate  for example we are subject to each of apple’s and google’s standard clickthrough terms and conditions for application developers which govern the promotion distribution and operation of apps including games on their storefronts  either apple or google can unilaterally change its standard terms and conditions with no prior notice to us     in addition the agreement terms can be vague and subject to changing interpretations by the storefront operator  further these storefront operators typically have the right to prohibit a developer from distributing its applications on its storefront if the developer violates its standard terms and conditions  for example in the second quarter of  apple began prohibiting certain types of virtual currencyincentivized advertising offers in games sold on the apple app store   most recently apple has implemented certain restrictions related to games that include guns including changing its game rating methodology which has resulted in games that include gun violence receiving a  rating and prohibiting certain depictions of guns in game icons and other storefront art these restrictions could potentially negatively impact the number of people playing popular  “shooter”  games and the revenues we could generate from such assets if we chose to acquire one     in addition during the second quarter of  apple began prohibiting certain types of virtual currencyincentivized video advertising in games sold on the apple app store  these incentivized video advertisements have attempted to take into    account several pitfalls of the older adrevenue models in place for mobile applications however the apple store has prohibited the use of such strategies because of its “unfair” effect on chart rankings and thus deemed it a violation of their terms if apple or google or any other key storefront operator determines that we or one of our key vendors are violating its standard terms and conditions by a new interpretation or otherwise or prohibits us from distributing our games on its storefront it would materially harm our business and likely cause our stock price to significantly decline   apple’s requirement that beginning february   all new applications and beginning june   all updates to existing applications submitted to the apple app store must include bit support and be built with the ios  software development kit could harm our business    if we acquire an asset that is incompatible with apple’s requirement we may have to expend more resources to update and port such an acquisition in the fourth quarter of  apple informed developers that beginning on february   all new applications and beginning june   all updates to existing applications submitted to the apple app store must include bit support and be built with the ios  software development kit    if we fail to implement bit support for any of our existing games or assets or those that will undergo redevelopment that we intend to launch it would negatively impact our revenues in  and potentially beyond  in addition due to the expense involved in supporting bit development we may have difficulty in locating and acquiring compatible assets to add to our portfolio which will adversely affect revenues more quickly than they otherwise would have  furthermore building our games to support bit development will increase the file size of our games which could reduce the number of downloads of these games particularly if we are unable to keep the size of the games below  megabytes which is the maximum file size that can currently be downloaded over any carrier’s wireless network   if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand our business could be materially adversely affected    we believe that broad brand recognition and a favorable consumer perception of our brand identity and website are essential to our future success accordingly we intend to initiate a substantial advertising and marketing campaign to establish our brand   if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand incur significant expenses in promoting our brand and fail to generate a corresponding increase in revenue as a result of our branding efforts or encounter legal obstacles which prevent our continued use of our brand name our business could be materially adversely affected in addition even if brand identity and website recognition increases the number of new customers or the number of sales or average dollars per sale may not increase which could negatively affect our financial performance   we must complete the development of our website and continually improve the responsiveness functionality and features of our products and services in order to maintain our consumer base we may not succeed in developing features functions products or services that endconsumers find attractive this could reduce the number potential buyers using our website and materially adversely affect our business   because we have a limited history of operations we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan   as a development stage company we have less than one year of operational history in our industry accordingly our operations are subject to the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise including access to capital successful implementation of our business plan and no revenue from operations we cannot assure you that our intended activities or plan of operation will be successful or result in revenue or profit to us and any failure to implement our business plan may have a material adverse effect on the business of the company   if we fail to effectively manage our growth our business brand and reputation results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected   we may experience a rapid growth in operations which may place significant demands on our management team and our operational and financial infrastructure as we continue to grow we must effectively identify integrate develop and motivate new employees and maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture to attract top talent we believe we will have to offer attractive compensation packages the risks of overhiring or over compensating and the challenges of integrating a rapidly growing employee base may impact profitability   additionally if we do not effectively manage our growth the quality of our services portfolio offerings could suffer which could adversely affect our business brand and reputation results of operations and financial condition if operational technology and infrastructure improvements are not implemented successfully our ability to manage our growth will be    impaired and we may have to make significant additional expenditures to address these issues to effectively manage our growth we will need to continue to improve our operational financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures   this will require that we refine our information technology systems to maintain effective online services and enhance information and communication systems to ensure that our employees effectively communicate with each other and our growing base of customers these system enhancements and improvements will require significant incremental and ongoing capital expenditures and allocation of valuable management and employee resources if we fail to implement these improvements and maintenance programs effectively our ability to manage our expected growth and comply with the rules and regulations that are applicable to publicly reporting companies will be impaired and we may incur additional expenses   we depend heavily on key personnel and turnover of key senior management could harm our business   our future business and results of operations depend in significant part upon the continued contributions of our chief executive officer if we lose his services or if he fails to perform in his current position or if we are not able to attract and retain skilled employees as needed our business could suffer significant turnover in our senior management could significantly deplete our institutional knowledge held by our existing senior management team we depend on the skills and abilities of these key employees in managing the product acquisition marketing and sales aspects of our business any part of which could be harmed by turnover in the future    our management has not had experience in managing the day to day operations of a public company and as a result we may incur additional expenses associated with the management of our company   our chief executive officer tom mahoney is responsible for the operations and reporting of our company the requirements of operating as a small public company are new to our management this may require us to obtain outside assistance from legal accounting investor relations or other professionals that could be more costly than planned we may also be required to hire additional staff to comply with additional sec reporting requirements we anticipate that the costs associated with sec requirements associated with going and staying public are estimated to be approximately  in connection with this registration statement and thereafter  annually if we lack cash resources to cover these costs in the future our failure to comply with reporting requirements and other provisions of securities laws could negatively affect our stock price and adversely affect our potential results of operations cash flow and financial condition after we commence operations   our future results and reputation may be affected by litigation or other liability claims   we have not procured a general liability insurance policy for our business to the extent that we suffer a loss of a type which would normally be covered by general liability we would incur significant expenses in defending any action against us and in paying any claims that result from a settlement or judgment against us adverse publicity could result in a loss of consumer confidence in our business or our securities   if the use of smartphones and tablet devices as game platforms and the proliferation of mobile devices generally do not increase our business could be adversely affected   while the number of people using mobile internetenabled devices such as smartphones and tablet devices has increased dramatically in the past few years the mobile market particularly the market for mobile games is still emerging and it may not grow as we anticipate  our future success is substantially dependent upon the continued growth of use of mobile devices for games  the proliferation of mobile devices may not continue to develop at historical rates and consumers may not continue to use mobile internetenabled devices as a platform for games  in addition new and emerging technologies could make the mobile devices on which our games are currently released obsolete requiring us to transition our business model to develop games for other nextgeneration platforms    our business is subject to increasing governmental regulation if we do not successfully respond to these regulations our business may suffer   we are subject to a number of domestic and foreign laws and regulations that affect our business  not only are these laws constantly evolving which could result in their being interpreted in ways that could harm our business but legislation is also continually being introduced that may affect both the content of our products and their distribution  in the united states for example numerous federal and state laws have been introduced which attempt to restrict the content or distribution of    games  legislation has been adopted in several states and proposed at the federal level that prohibits the sale of certain games to minors  if such legislation is adopted it could harm our business by limiting the games we are able to offer to our customers or by limiting the size of the potential market for our games     we may also be required to modify certain games or alter our marketing strategies to comply with new and possibly inconsistent regulations which could be costly or delay the release of our games  in particular freetoplay games have been subject to such legislation and public policy concerns already for example the united kingdom’s office of fair trading issued new principles in january  relating to inapp purchases in freetoplay games that are directed towards children  and under which principles became effective in april   in response to a request made by the european commission google has announced that it will no longer label freetoplay games as free in european union countries  similarly in the fourth quarter of  apple changed its label for freetodownload applications from  “free”  to  “get”  in the apple app store     the federal trade commission has also indicated that it intends to review issues related to inapp purchases particularly with respect to games that are marketed primarily to minors the federal trade commission recently reached settlement agreements with apple and google on this subject  if the federal trade commission issues rules significantly restricting or even prohibiting inapp purchases it would significantly impact our business strategy     furthermore the growth and development of freetoplay gaming and the sale of virtual goods may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on companies such as ours  we anticipate that scrutiny and regulation of this industry will increase and that we will be required to devote resources to addressing such regulation  for example existing laws or new laws regarding the regulation of currency and banking institutions may be interpreted to cover virtual currency or goods  if that were to occur we may be required to seek licenses authorizations or approvals from relevant regulators the granting of which may depend on us meeting certain capital and other requirements which could significantly increase our operating costs     finally because our services may be available worldwide certain foreign jurisdictions and others may claim that we are required to comply with their laws including in jurisdictions where we have no local entity employees or infrastructure   we may be subject to regulatory inquiries claims suits prosecutions which may impact our profitability   any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with applicable laws and regulations in general may subject us to regulatory inquiries claims suits and prosecutions we can give no assurance that we will prevail in such regulatory inquiries claims suits and prosecutions on commercially reasonable terms or at all responding to defending andor settling regulatory inquiries claims suits and prosecutions may be timeconsuming and divert management and financial resources or have other adverse effects on our business a negative outcome in any of these proceedings may result in changes to or discontinuance of some of our services potential liabilities or additional costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and future prospects   we are subject to complex federal state local and other laws and regulations that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations   our business is subject to various and sometimes complex laws and regulations in order to conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations we must obtain and maintain numerous permits approvals and certificates from various federal state and local governmental authorities we may incur substantial costs in order to maintain compliance with these existing laws and regulations   in addition our costs of compliance may increase if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations these costs could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations moreover our failure to comply with these laws and regulations as interpreted and enforced could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations   any change to government regulationadministrative practices may have a negative impact on our ability to operate and our profitability   the laws regulations policies or current administrative practices of any government body organization or regulatory agency in the united states or any other jurisdiction may be changed applied or interpreted in a manner which will fundamentally alter the ability of our company to carry on our business the actions policies or regulations or changes thereto of any    government body or regulatory agency or other special interest groups may have a detrimental effect on us any or all of these situations may have a negative impact on our ability to operate andor our profitably   we have not generated any revenues and are dependent upon the proceeds of this offering to fully fund our business if we do not the sell shares in this offering we may have to seek alternative financing to complete our business or abandon them   we have not generated any revenues and have limited capital resources to date the company has funded its operations from limited funding and has not generated any cash from operations our current cash balance is not sufficient to sustain our operations for any period of time unless the company begins to generate sufficient revenues to finance operations as a going concern we may experience liquidity and solvency problems such liquidity and solvency problems may force us to cease operations if additional financing is not available no known alternative sources of funds are available to the company in the event it does not have adequate proceeds from this offering we require a minimum amount of  in net proceeds from this offering to satisfy operating requirements for the next twelve months     if our estimates related to expenditures and cash flow from operations are erroneous or we are unable to sell additional equity securities our business could fall short of expectations and you may lose your entire investment   our financial success is dependent in part upon the accuracy of our managements estimates of expenditures and cash flow from operations if such estimates are erroneous or inaccurate we may not be able to carry out our business plan which could in a worstcase scenario result in the failure of our business and you losing your entire investment   our business may be harmed by future intellectual property right claims or disputes   we may receive in the future communications alleging that certain items listed or sold through our company or within one of our applications or a digital storefront infringe thirdparty copyrights trademarks and trade names or other intellectual property rights these and future claims could result in increased costs of doing business through legal expenses adverse judgment or settlement or require us to change our business practices in expensive ways in addition litigation could result in interpretations of the law that require us to change our business practices or otherwise increase our costs   the laws and regulations concerning data privacy and data security are continually evolving and our actual or perceived failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business   we are subject to federal state and foreign laws regarding privacy and the protection of the information that we collect regarding our users which laws are currently in a state of flux and likely to remain so for the foreseeable future  the us government including the federal trade commission and the department of commerce is continuing to review the need for greater regulation over collecting information concerning consumer behavior on the internet and on mobile devices   various government and consumer agencies have also called for new regulation and changes in industry practices      if we do not follow existing laws and regulations as well as the rules of the smartphone platform operators with respect to privacyrelated matters or if consumers raise any concerns about our privacy practices even if unfounded it could damage our reputation and operating results   all of potential games or software programs we choose to acquire will likely be subject to our privacy policy and a terms of service  if we fail to comply with a posted privacy policy terms of service or privacyrelated laws and regulations including with respect to the information we collect from users of our games it could result in proceedings against us by governmental authorities or others which could harm our business  in addition interpreting and applying data protection laws to the mobile gaming industry is often unclear  these laws may be interpreted and applied in conflicting ways from state to state country to country or region to region and in a manner that is not consistent with our current data protection practices  complying with these varying requirements could cause us to incur additional costs and change our business practices  further if we fail to adequately protect our users’ privacy and data it could result in a loss of player confidence in our services and ultimately in a loss of users which could adversely affect our business   in the area of information security and data protection many states have passed laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data such as the  amendment to california’s information practices act or requiring the adoption of minimum information security standards that are often vaguely defined and difficult to implement  costs to comply with these laws may increase as a result of changes in interpretation  furthermore any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities        security measures that we put in place to protect our data and the personal information of our employees customers and partners could be breached due to cyberattacks initiated by third party hackers employee error or malfeasance or otherwise  because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to disable or degrade service or to sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures  any breach or unauthorized access could materially interfere with our operations or our ability to offer our services or result in significant legal and financial exposure damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in the security of our data which could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results     we may be liable if third parties misappropriate our customers personal information   if third parties are able to penetrate our network security or otherwise misappropriate our customers personal information or credit card information or if we give third parties improper access to our customers personal information or credit card information we could be subject to liability this liability could include claims for unauthorized purchases with credit card information impersonation or other similar fraud claims this liability could also include claims for other misuses of personal information including unauthorized marketing purposes   these claims could result in litigation liability for misappropriation of this information could adversely affect our business in addition the federal trade commission and state agencies have been investigating various internet companies regarding their use of personal information we could incur additional expenses if new regulations regarding the use of personal information are introduced or if government agencies investigate our privacy practices we rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of confidential information such as customer credit card numbers we cannot assure you that advances in computer capabilities new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments will not result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms that we use to protect customer transaction data if any such compromise of our security were to occur it could harm our reputation business prospects financial condition and results of operations a party who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our operations we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against such security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches we cannot assure you that our security measures will prevent security breaches or that failure to prevent such security breaches will not harm our business prospects financial condition and results of operations   if we fail to maintain and enhance our capabilities for porting games to a broad array of mobile devices particularly those running the android operating system our revenues and financial results could suffer    we will derive the majority of our revenues from the sale of virtual goods within our games for smartphones and tablets that run apple’s ios or google’s android operating system  unlike the apple ecosystem in which apple controls both the device iphone ipod touch and ipad and the storefront apple’s app store the android ecosystem is highly fragmented since a large number of oems manufacture and sell androidbased devices that run a variety of versions of the android operating system and there are many androidbased storefronts in addition to the google play store  for us to sell our games to the widest possible audience of android users we must comport our games to a significant portion of the more than  androidbased devices that are commercially available many of which have different technical requirements  since the number of androidbased smartphones and tablets shipped worldwide is growing significantly it is important that we maintain and enhance our porting capabilities which could require us to invest considerable resources in this area  these additional costs could harm our business operating results and financial condition  in addition we must continue to increase the efficiency of our porting processes or it may take us longer to port games to an equivalent number of devices which would negatively impact our margins  if we fail to maintain or enhance our porting capabilities our revenues and financial results could suffer   we depend upon thirdparty servicers to deliver our products to our customers on a timely and consistent basis   we will rely upon multiple third parties for the development and enhancement of our portfolio of products a deterioration in our relationship with any one of these third parties could decrease our ability to track shipments cause shipment delays and increase our shipping costs and the number of damaged products because we may not have a written longterm agreement with any of these third parties we cannot be sure that these relationships will continue on terms favorable to us if at all if our relationships with these third parties are terminated or impaired or if these third parties are unable to deliver products for us whether through labor shortage slow down or stoppage deteriorating financial or business condition or for any other reason we would be required to use alternative servicers we may be unable to engage alternative carriers on a timely basis    or upon terms favorable to us changing servicers would likely have a negative effect on our business operating results and financial condition     real or perceived errors failures or bugs in our software could impact our reputation and as a result adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects because the technology that we acquire or develop for our mobile applications is complex undetected errors failures or bugs may occur especially when new versions or updates of our applications are released any errors failures or bugs that impact the usability of our applications may cause customer dissatisfaction real or perceived errors failures or bugs including installation errors or policies established by our customers could result in negative publicity loss of or delay in market acceptance and loss of competitive position alleviating any of these problems could require significant expenditures of our capital and other resources and could cause interruptions delays or cessation of sales which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers and could adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects     risks related to our common stock   due to the lack of a current public market for our stock investors may have difficulty in selling stock they purchase   prior to this offering no public trading market existed for the company’s securities there can be no assurance that a public trading market for the company’s common stock will develop or that a public trading market if develop will be sustained the common stock sold pursuant to this prospectus will be freely tradable however will not be eligible for quotation on the over the counter bulletin board we intend upon the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part to engage a market maker to apply for quotation on the otc electronic bulletin board   there can be no assurance that a market maker will agree to file the necessary documents with the financial industry regulatory authority finra which operates the otc electronic bulletin board nor can there be any assurance that such an application for quotation will be approved thus it is anticipated that there will be little or no market for the shares until the company is eligible to have its common stock quoted on the otc electronic bulletin board and as a result an investor may find it difficult to dispose of any shares purchased hereunder because there is none and may be no public market for the company’s stock the company may not be able to secure future equity financing which would have a material adverse effect on the company   furthermore when and if the company’s common stock is eligible for quotation on the otc electronic bulletin board there can also be no assurance as to the depth or liquidity of any market for the common stock or the prices at which holders may be able to sell the shares   as a result investors could find it more difficult to trade or to obtain accurate quotations of the market value of the stock as compared to securities that are traded on the nasdaq trading market or on an exchange moreover an investor may find it difficult to dispose of any shares purchased hereunder   investors may have difficulty in reselling their shares due to the lack of market or state blue sky laws   our common stock is currently not quoted on any market no market may ever develop for our common stock or if developed may not be sustained in the future   the holders of our shares of common stock and persons who desire to purchase them in any trading market that might develop in the future should be aware that there may be significant state law restrictions upon the ability of investors to resell our shares accordingly even if we are successful in having the shares available for trading on the otcbb investors should consider any secondary market for the companys securities to be a limited one we intend to seek coverage and publication of information regarding the company in an accepted publication which permits a manual exemption this manual exemption permits a security to be distributed in a particular state without being registered if the company issuing the security has a listing for that security in a securities manual recognized by the state     however it is not enough for the security to be listed in a recognized manual the listing entry must contain  the names of issuers officers and directors  an issuers balance sheet and  a profit and loss statement for either the fiscal year preceding the balance sheet or for the most recent fiscal year of operations  we may not be able to secure a listing containing all of this information  furthermore the manual exemption is a nonissuer exemption restricted to secondary trading    transactions making it unavailable for issuers selling newly issued securities most of the accepted manuals are those published in standard and poors moodys investor service fitchs investment service and bests insurance reports and many states expressly recognize these manuals   a smaller number of states declare that they “recognize securities manuals” but do not specify the recognized manuals the following states do not have any provisions and therefore do not expressly recognize the manual exemption alabama georgia illinois kentucky louisiana montana south dakota tennessee vermont and wisconsin accordingly our shares should be considered totally illiquid which inhibits investors’ ability to resell their shares   we will be subject to penny stock regulations and restrictions and you may have difficulty selling shares of our common stock   the sec has adopted regulations which generally define socalled “penny stocks” to be an equity security that has a market price less than  per share or an exercise price of less than  per share subject to certain exemptions  we anticipate that our common stock will become a “penny stock” and we will become subject to rule g under the exchange act or the “penny stock rule” this rule imposes additional sales practice requirements on brokerdealers that sell such securities to persons other than established customers for transactions covered by rule g a brokerdealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchaser’s written consent to the transaction prior to sale as a result this rule may affect the ability of brokerdealers to sell our securities and may affect the ability of purchasers to sell any of our securities in the secondary market   for any transaction involving a penny stock unless exempt the rules require delivery prior to any transaction in a penny stock of a disclosure schedule prepared by the sec relating to the penny stock market disclosure is also required to be made about sales commissions payable to both the brokerdealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities finally monthly statements are required to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stock   we do not anticipate that our common stock will qualify for exemption from the penny stock rule in any event even if our common stock were exempt from the penny stock rule we would remain subject to section b of the exchange act which gives the sec the authority to restrict any person from participating in a distribution of penny stock if the sec finds that such a restriction would be in the public interest   sales of our common stock under rule  could reduce the price of our stock   there are zero  shares of our common stock held by nonaffiliates and  shares held by affiliates that rule  of the securities act of  defines as restricted securities  newly issued shares may be registered in this offering however all of the remaining shares will still be subject to the resale restrictions of rule   in general persons holding restricted securities including affiliates must hold their shares for a period of at least six months may not sell more than one percent of the total issued and outstanding shares in any day period and must resell the shares in an unsolicited brokerage transaction at the market price  the availability for sale of substantial amounts of common stock under rule  could reduce prevailing market prices for our securities   because we do not have an audit or compensation committee shareholders will have to rely on the entire board of directors none of which are independent to perform these functions   we do not have an audit or compensation committee comprised of independent directors  indeed we do not have any audit or compensation committee  these functions are performed by the board of directors as a whole  no members of the board of directors are independent directors  thus there is a potential conflict in that board members who are also part of management will participate in discussions concerning management compensation and audit issues that may affect management decisions     our chief executive officer and director owns a significant percentage of our outstanding voting securities which could reduce the ability of minority shareholders to effect certain corporate actions    our chief executive officer and director tom mahoney owns all of our outstanding voting securities as a result currently and after the offering he will possess a significant influence and can elect a majority of our board of directors and authorize or prevent proposed significant corporate transactions their ownership and control may also have the effect of    delaying or preventing a future change in control impeding a merger consolidation takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer   there may not be funds available for net income because our chief executive officer and director maintains significant control and can determine his own salary and perquisites   our ceo tom mahoney owns all of our outstanding voting securities as a result there may not be funds available for net income because he maintains significant control and can determine his own salary and perquisites   we may in the future issue additional shares of common stock which would reduce investors’ percent of ownership and may dilute our share value   our articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of  shares of common stock  as of the date of this prospectus the company had  shares of common stock outstanding accordingly we may issue up to an additional  shares of common stock the future issuance of common stock may result in substantial dilution in the percentage of our common stock held by our then existing shareholders we may value any common stock issued in the future on an arbitrary basis the issuance of common stock for future services or acquisitions or other corporate actions may have the effect of diluting the value of the shares held by our investors and might have an adverse effect on any trading market for our common stock   we are subject to compliance with securities law which exposes us to potential liabilities including potential rescission rights   we may offer to sell our common stock to investors pursuant to certain exemptions from the registration requirements of the securities act of  as well as those of various state securities laws the basis for relying on such exemptions is factual that is the applicability of such exemptions depends upon our conduct and that of those persons contacting prospective investors and making the offering we may not seek any legal opinion to the effect that any such offering would be exempt from registration under any federal or state law instead we may elect to relay upon the operative facts as the basis for such exemption including information provided by investor themselves   if any such offering did not qualify for such exemption an investor would have the right to rescind its purchase of the securities if it so desired it is possible that if an investor should seek rescission such investor would succeed a similar situation prevails under state law in those states where the securities may be offered without registration in reliance on the partial preemption from the registration or qualification provisions of such state statutes under the national securities markets improvement act of  if investors were successful in seeking rescission we would face severe financial demands that could adversely affect our business and operations additionally if we did not in fact qualify for the exemptions upon which it has relied we may become subject to significant fines and penalties imposed by the sec and state securities agencies   antitakeover effects of certain provisions of wyoming state law hinder a potential takeover of the company   though not now we may be or in the future we may become subject to wyoming’s control share law a corporation is subject to wyoming’s control share law if it has more than  stockholders at least  of whom are stockholders of record and residents of wyoming and it does business in wyoming or through an affiliated corporation the law focuses on the acquisition of a “controlling interest” which means the ownership of outstanding voting shares sufficient but for the control share law to enable the acquiring person to exercise the following proportions of the voting power of the corporation in the election of directors i onefifth or more but less than onethird ii onethird or more but less than a majority or iii a majority or more the ability to exercise such voting power may be direct or indirect as well as individual or in association with others the effect of the control share law is that the acquiring person and those acting in association with it obtains only such voting rights in the control shares as are conferred by a resolution of the stockholders of the corporation approved at a special or annual meeting of stockholders the control share law contemplates that voting rights will be considered only once by the other stockholders thus there is no authority to strip voting rights from the control shares of an acquiring person once those rights have been approved if the stockholders do not grant voting rights to the control shares acquired by an acquiring person those shares do not become permanent nonvoting shares the acquiring person is free to sell its shares to others if the buyers of those shares themselves do not acquire a controlling interest their shares do not become governed by the control share law if control shares are accorded full voting rights and the acquiring person has acquired control shares with a majority or more of the voting power any stockholder of record other than an acquiring person who has not voted in favor of approval of voting rights is entitled to demand fair value for such stockholder’s shares      wyoming’s control share law may have the effect of discouraging takeovers of the corporation in addition to the control share law wyoming has a business combination law which prohibits certain business combinations between wyoming corporations and “interested stockholders” for three years after the “interested stockholder” first becomes an “interested stockholder” unless the corporation’s board of directors approves the combination in advance for purposes of wyoming law an “interested stockholder” is any person who is i the beneficial owner directly or indirectly of ten percent or more of the voting power of the outstanding voting shares of the corporation or ii an affiliate or associate of the corporation and at any time within the three previous years was the beneficial owner directly or indirectly of ten percent or more of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of the corporation the definition of the term “business combination” is sufficiently broad to cover virtually any kind of transaction that would allow a potential acquiror to use the corporation’s assets to finance the acquisition or otherwise to benefit its own interests rather than the interests of the corporation and its other stockholders the effect of wyoming’s business combination law is to potentially discourage parties interested in taking control of the company from doing so if it cannot obtain the approval of our board of directors   there is no current established trading market for our securities and if a trading market does not develop purchasers of our securities may have difficulty selling their shares   there is currently no established public trading market for our securities and an active trading market in our securities may not develop or if developed may not be sustained  while we intend to seek a quotation on the otc bulletin board there can be no assurance that any such trading market will develop and purchasers of the shares may have difficulty selling their common stock should they desire to do so no market makers have committed to becoming market makers for our common stock and none may do so   because we do not have an escrow account or trust account for our investors subscriptions if we file for bankruptcy protection or are forced into bankruptcy protection investors will lose their entire investment   invested funds for this offering will not be placed in an escrow or trust account accordingly if we file for bankruptcy protection or a petition for involuntary bankruptcy is filed by creditors against us your funds will become part of the bankruptcy estate and administered according to the bankruptcy laws as such you will lose your investment and your funds will be used to pay creditors and will not be used for the sourcing and sale of promotional products     the offering price of  per share is arbitrary the offering price of  per share has been arbitrarily determined by our management and does not bear any relationship to the assets net worth or projected earnings of the company or any other generally accepted criteria of value we have no firm commitments to purchase any shares we have no firm commitment for the purchase of any shares therefore there is no assurance that a trading market will develop or be sustained the company has not engaged a placement agent or broker for the sale of the shares the company may be unable to identify investors to purchase the shares    because we are a “shell company” the holders of our restricted securities will not be able to sell their securities in reliance on rule  and we cannot file registration statements under section  of the securities act using a form s until we cease being a “shell company”   we are a  “shell company”  as that term is defined by the applicable federal securities laws  specifically because of the nature and amount of our assets and our very limited operations pursuant to applicable federal rules we are considered a  “shell company”   applicable provisions of rule  specify that during that time that we are a  “shell company”  and for a period of one year thereafter holders of our restricted securities can not sell those securities in reliance on rule  this restriction may have potential adverse effects on future efforts to form additional capital through unregistered offerings another implication of us being a shell company is that we cannot file registration statements under section  of the securities act using a form s a short form of registration to register securities issued to employees and consultants under an employee benefit plan as result one year after we cease being a shell company assuming we are current in our reporting requirements with the securities and exchange commission and have filed current “form  information”  with the sec reflecting our status as an entity that is no longer a shell company for a period of not less than  months holders of our restricted securities may then sell those securities in reliance on rule  provided however those holders satisfy all of the    applicable requirements of that rule for us to cease being a  “shell company”  we must have more than nominal operations and more that nominal assets or assets which do not consist solely of cash or cash equivalents  shares purchased in this offering which will be immediately resalable and sales of all of our other shares if and when applicable restrictions against resale expire could have a depressive effect on the market price if any of our common stock and the shares we are offering      a low market price would severely limit the potential market for our common stock our common stock is expected to trade at a price substantially below  per share subjecting trading in the stock to certain sec rules requiring additional disclosures by brokerdealers these rules generally apply to any nonnasdaq equity security that has a market price share of less than  per share subject to certain exceptions a “penny stock” such rules require the delivery prior to any penny stock transaction of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks associated therewith and impose various sales practice requirements on brokerdealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and institutional or wealthy investors for these types of transactions the brokerdealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchaser’s written consent to the transaction prior to the sale the broker – dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to the brokerdealer current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock and if the brokerdealer is the sole market maker the brokerdealer must disclose this fact and the brokerdealer’s presumed control over the market such information must be provided to the customer orally or in writing before or with the written confirmation of trade sent to the customer monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks the additional burdens imposed upon brokerdealers by such requirements could discourage broker dealers from effecting transactions in our common stock because we do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell them   we intend to retain any future earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future unless we pay dividends our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell them there is no assurance that stockholders will be able to sell shares when desired   optin right for emerging growth company   we have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under   section b of the jobs act that allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies as a result of this election our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates   implications of being an emerging growth company as a company with less than  billion in revenue during its last fiscal year we qualify as an emerging growth company as defined in the jobs act for as long as a company is deemed to be an emerging growth company it may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other regulatory requirements that are generally unavailable to other public companies  these provisions include      a requirement to have only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related managements discussion and analysis included in an initial public offering registration statement      an exemption to provide less than five years of selected financial data in an initial public offering registration statement      an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of the emerging growth companys internal controls over financial reporting      an exemption from the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards until they would apply to private companies      an exemption from compliance with any new requirements adopted by the public company accounting oversight board requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditors report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer an      reduced disclosure about the emerging growth companys executive compensation arrangements      an emerging growth company is also exempt from section b of sarbanes oxley which requires that the registered accounting firm shall in the same report attest to and report on the assessment on the effectiveness of the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting similarly as a smaller reporting company we are exempt from section b of the sarbanesoxley act and our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until such time as we cease being a smaller reporting company    section  of the jobs act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section ab of the securities act for complying with new or revised accounting standards  in other words an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies  we have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period  our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards   we may use these provisions until the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the closing of our initial public offering however if certain events occur prior to the end of such fiveyear period including if we become a  “large accelerated filer”  our annual gross revenue exceed  billion or we issue more than  billion of nonconvertible debt in any threeyear period we will cease to be anemerging growth company prior to the end of such fiveyear period   you may have limited access to information regarding our business because our obligations to file periodic reports with the sec could be automatically suspended under certain circumstances       as of effectiveness of our registration statement of which this prospectus is a part we will be required to file periodic reports with the sec which will be immediately available to the public for inspection and copying see “where you can find more information” elsewhere in this prospectus     except during the year that our registration statement becomes effective these reporting obligations may in our discretion be automatically suspended under section d of the exchange act if we have less than  shareholders and do not file a registration statement on form a which we have no current plans to file  if this occurs after the year in which our registration statement becomes effective we will no longer be obligated to file periodic reports with the sec and your access to our business information would then be even more restricted  after this registration statement on form s becomes effective we will be required to deliver periodic reports to security holders   however we will not be required to furnish proxy statements to security holders and our directors officers and principal beneficial owners will not be required to report their beneficial ownership of securities to the sec pursuant to section  of the exchange act  previously a company with more than  shareholders of record and  million in assets had to register under the exchange act  however the jobs act raises the minimum shareholder threshold from  to either  persons or  persons who are not accredited investors or  persons in the case of banks and bank holding companies  the jobs act excludes securities received by employees pursuant to employee stock incentive plans for purposes of calculating the shareholder threshold  this means that access to information regarding our business and operations will be limited   upon effectiveness of this registration statement we will be subject to the d reporting requirements under the securities exchange act of  which does not require a company to file all the same reports and information as fully reporting companies   upon effectiveness of this registration statement we will be subject to the d reporting requirements according to the securities exchange act of  as a section d filer we will be required to file quarterly and annual reports during the fiscal year in which our registration statement is declared effective however such duty to file reports shall be suspended as to any fiscal year other than the fiscal year within which such registration statement became effective if at the beginning of such fiscal year the securities of each class are held of record by less than  persons  in addition as a filer subject to section d of the exchange act we are not required to prepare proxy or information statements our common stock will not be subject to the protection of the going private regulations we will be subject to only limited portions of the tender offer rules our officers directors and more than ten  percent shareholders are not required to file beneficial ownership reports about their holdings in our company that these persons will not be subject to the shortswing profit recovery provisions of the exchange act and that more than five percent  holders of classes of our equity securities will not be required to report information about their ownership positions in the securities as such shareholders will not have access to    certain material information which would otherwise be required if it was a fully reporting company pursuant to an exchange act registration   if we are not required to continue filing reports under section d of the securities exchange act of  in the future for example because we have less than three hundred shareholders of record at the end of the first fiscal year in which this registration statement is declared effective and we do not file a registration statement on form a our common shares if listed or quoted would no longer be eligible for quotation which could reduce the value of your investment   as a result of this offering as required under section d of the securities exchange act of  we will file periodic reports with the securities and exchange commission as required under section d however if in the future we are not required to continue filing reports under section d for example because we have less than three hundred shareholders of record at the end of the first fiscal year in which this registration statement is declared effective and we do not file a registration statement on form a upon the occurrence of such an event our common stock can no longer be quoted on the otc markets otc link which could reduce the value of your investment  of course there is no guarantee that we will be able to meet the requirements to be able to cease filing reports under section d in which case we will continue filing those reports in the years after the fiscal year in which this registration statement is declared effective  filing a registration statement on form a will require us to continue to file quarterly and annual reports with the sec and will also subject us to the proxy rules of the sec  in addition our officers directors and  stockholders will be required to submit reports to the sec on their stock ownership and stock trading activity       use of proceeds   our offering is being made on a selfunderwritten basis no minimum number of shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed the offering price per share is  the total offering amount is  we do not intend to employ any material amount of the contemplated offering to discharge any current or future indebtedness of the company moreover we do not intend to use any proceeds of the offering to acquire any significant assets of or acquire any entity the following table sets forth the uses of proceeds assuming the sale of    and  respectively of the securities offered for sale by the company there is no guarantee that we will receive any proceeds from the offering      of offering sold    of offering sold    of offering sold    of offering sold offering proceeds                                   shares sold                 gross proceeds                 total before expenses

    net remaining proceeds                   the above figures represent only estimated costs this expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions the amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors including the status of and results from operations as a result our management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering we may find it necessary or advisable to use the net proceeds from this offering for other purposes and we will have broad discretion in the application of net proceeds from this offering furthermore we anticipate that we will need to secure additional funding for the fully implement our business plan   in the event we are not successful in selling all of the securities we would utilize any available funds raised in the following order of priority    for general administrative expenses including legal and accounting fees and administrative support expenses incurred in connection with our reporting obligations with the sec      for office lease expenses and office equipment      for sales and marketing      for salaries for our chief executive officer and the hiring of additional fulltime employees and      for consultants and developers’ salaries and wages our current corporate offices are located at  little duck circle gulf breeze fl  if we are able to raise sufficient capital through this offering we will seek to lease a larger dedicated space at no more than  per month   determination of the offering price our management has determined the offering price for the common shares being sold in this offering the price of the shares we are offering was arbitrarily determined the offering price bears no relationship whatsoever to our assets earnings book value or other criteria of value the factors considered were    our status as a developmental stage “startup” company      prevailing market conditions including the history and prospects for the industry in which we compete      our forecasted future prospects and      our current capital structure therefore the public offering price of the shares does not necessarily bear any relationship to established valuation criteria and may not be indicative of prices that may prevail at any time or from time to time in the public market for the common stock you cannot be sure that a public market for any of our securities will develop and continue or that the securities will ever trade at a price at or higher than the offering price in this offering such offering price does not have any relationship to any established criteria of value such as book value or earnings per share because we have no significant operating history the price of our common stock is not based on past earnings nor is the price of our common stock indicative of the current market value of the assets owned by us no valuation or appraisal has been prepared for our business and potential business expansion our common stock is presently not traded on any market or securities exchange and we have not applied for listing or quotation on any public market you cannot be sure that a public market for any of our securities will develop and continue or that the securities will ever trade at a price at or higher than the offering price in this offering     dilution if you purchase any of the shares offered by this prospectus your ownership interest will be diluted to the extent of the difference between the initial public offering price per share and the postoffering net tangible book value per share of our common stock immediately after this offering dilution results from the fact that the initial public offering price per share is substantially in excess of the book value per share attributable to the existing stockholder for the presently outstanding stock as of february   our net tangible book value was  or  per share of common stock net tangible book value per share represents the amount of our total tangible assets excluding deferred offering costs less total liabilities divided by  the number of shares of common stock outstanding at february     the following table sets forth as of february   the number of shares of common stock purchased from us and the total consideration paid by our existing stockholder and by new investors in this offering if new investors purchase       or  of the offering after deduction of offering expenses assuming a purchase price in this offering of

of shares  existing shareholder after offering               assuming the issuer sells the entire offering of  shares after giving effect to the sale of common shares in this offering and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us our postoffering net tangible book value as of february   would be  or  per share this amount represents an immediate increase in the postoffering net tangible book value of  per share to our existing stockholder and an immediate dilution in the postoffering net tangible book value of approximately  per share to new investors purchasing common shares in this offering we determine dilution by subtracting the as adjusted net tangible book value per share after the offering from the amount of cash that a new investor paid for a share of common stock   plan of distribution   this prospectus relates to the sale of  common shares   we will sell the common shares ourselves and do not plan to use underwriters or pay any commissions we will be selling our common shares using our best efforts and no one has agreed to buy any of our common shares this prospectus permits our officers and directors to sell the common shares directly to the public with no commission or other remuneration payable to them for any common shares they may sell there is no plan or arrangement to enter into any contracts or agreements to sell the common shares with a broker or dealer our officers and directors will sell the common shares and intend to offer them to friends family members and business acquaintances there is no minimum amount of common shares we must sell so no money raised from the sale of our common shares will go into escrow trust or another similar arrangement   the common shares are being offered by tom mahoney the company’s chief executive officer and director mr tom mahoney will be relying on the safe harbor in rule a of the securities exchange act of  to sell the common shares no sales commission will be paid for common shares sold by tom mahoney mr mahoney is not subject to a statutory disqualification and is not associated persons of a broker or dealer   additionally mr mahoney primarily performs substantial duties on behalf of the registrant otherwise than in connection with transactions in securities mr mahoney has not been a broker or dealer or an associated person of a broker or dealer within the preceding  months and they have not participated in selling an offering of securities for      any issuer more than once every  months other than in reliance on paragraph ai or aiii of rule a of the securities exchange act of    the offering will terminate upon the earlier to occur of i the sale of all  shares being offered or ii  days after this registration statement is declared effective by the securities and exchange commission   there are no finders in this offering   under the rules of the securities and exchange commission our common stock will come within the definition of a “penny stock” because the price of our common stock is below  per share as a result our common stock will be subject to the penny stock rules and regulations brokerdealers who sell penny stocks to certain types of investors are required to comply with the commission’s regulations concerning the transfer of penny stock these regulations require brokerdealers to    make a suitability determination prior to selling penny stock to the purchaser  receive the purchaser’s written consent to the transaction and  provide certain written disclosures to the purchaser   these requirements may restrict the ability of brokerdealers to sell our common stock and may affect the ability to resell our common stock       market information   there is no established public trading market for our securities and a regular trading market may not develop or if developed may not be sustained a shareholder in all likelihood therefore will not be able to resell his or her securities should he or she desire to do so when eligible for public resales furthermore it is unlikely that a lending institution will accept our securities as pledged collateral for loans unless a regular trading market develops   otc electronic bulletin board considerations   to be quoted on the otc electronic bulletin board a market maker must file an application on our behalf in order to make a market for our common stock we anticipate that after this registration statement is declared effective market makers will enter “piggyback” quotes and our securities will thereafter trade on the otc bulletin board   the otc electronic bulletin board is separate and distinct from the nasdaq stock market nasdaq has no business relationship with issuers of securities quoted on the otc electronic bulletin board the sec’s order handling rules which apply to nasdaqlisted securities do not apply to securities quoted on the otc electronic bulletin board   although the nasdaq stock market has rigorous listing standards to ensure the high quality of its issuers and can delist issuers for not meeting those standards the otc electronic bulletin board has no listing standards rather it is the market maker who chooses to quote a security on the system files the application and is obligated to comply with keeping information about the issuer in its files finra cannot deny an application by a market maker to quote the stock of a company the only requirement for inclusion in the bulletin board is that the issuer be current in its reporting requirements with the sec   although we anticipate listing on the otc electronic bulletin board will increase liquidity for our stock investors may have greater difficulty in getting orders filled because it is anticipated that if our stock trades on a public market it initially will trade on the otc bulletin board rather than on nasdaq investors’ orders may be filled at a price much different than expected when an order is placed trading activity in general is not conducted as efficiently and effectively as with nasdaqlisted securities   investors must contact a brokerdealer to trade otc electronic bulletin board securities investors do not have direct access to the bulletin board service for bulletin board securities there only has to be one market maker     bulletin board transactions are conducted almost entirely manually because there are no automated systems for negotiating trades on the bulletin board they are conducted via telephone in times of heavy market volume the limitations of this    process may result in a significant increase in the time it takes to execute investor orders therefore when investors place market orders  an order to buy or sell a specific number of shares at the current market price  it is possible for the price of a stock to go up or down significantly during the lapse of time between placing a market order and getting execution   because bulletin board stocks are usually not followed by analysts there may be lower trading volume than for nasdaqlisted securities there is no guarantee that our stock will ever be quoted on the otc electronic bulletin board   blue sky law considerations   the holders of our shares of common stock and persons who desire to purchase them in any trading market that might develop in the future should be aware that there may be significant state law restrictions upon the ability of investors to resell our shares accordingly even if we are successful in having the shares available for trading on the otcbb investors should consider any secondary market for the companys securities to be a limited one there is no guarantee that our stock will ever be quoted on the otc electronic bulletin board we intend to seek coverage and publication of information regarding the company in an accepted publication which permits a manual exemption” this manual exemption permits a security to be distributed in a particular state without being registered if the company issuing the security has a listing for that security in a securities manual recognized by the state however it is not enough for the security to be listed in a recognized manual   the listing entry must contain  the names of issuers officers and directors  an issuers balance sheet and  a profit and loss statement for either the fiscal year preceding the balance sheet or for the most recent fiscal year of operations we may not be able to secure a listing containing all of this information furthermore the manual exemption is a nonissuer exemption restricted to secondary trading transactions making it unavailable for issuers selling newly issued securities most of the accepted manuals are those published in standard and poors moodys investor service fitchs investment service and bests insurance reports and many states expressly recognize these manuals a smaller number of states declare that they “recognize securities manuals” but do not specify the recognized manuals the following states do not have any provisions and therefore do not expressly recognize the manual exemption al ca il ky la mt nh ny pa tn and va  we currently do not intend to and may not be able to qualify securities for resale in other states which require shares to be qualified before they can be resold by our shareholders    description of securities   the following description as a summary of the material terms of the provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws the articles of incorporation and bylaws have been filed as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part   common stock   we are authorized to issue  shares of common stock with  par value per share as of the date of this registration statement there were  shares of common stock issued and outstanding held by one  shareholder our chief executive officer and director   each share of common stock entitles the holder to one vote either in person or by proxy at meetings of shareholders the holders are not permitted to vote their shares cumulatively accordingly the shareholders of our common stock who hold in the aggregate more than fifty percent of the total voting rights can elect all of our directors and in such event the holders of the remaining minority shares will not be able to elect any of such directors     the vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote thereon is sufficient to authorize affirm ratify or consent to such act or action except as otherwise provided by law   holders of common stock are entitled to receive ratably such dividends if any as may be declared by the board of directors out of funds legally available we have not paid any dividends since our inception and we presently anticipate that all earnings if any will be retained for development of our business any future disposition of dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon among other things our future earnings operating and financial condition capital requirements and other factors   holders of our common stock have no preemptive rights or other subscription rights conversion rights redemption or sinking fund provisions upon our liquidation dissolution or windup the holders of our common stock will be entitled to    share ratably in the net assets legally available for distribution to shareholders after the payment of all of our debts and other liabilities there are not any provisions in our articles of incorporation or our bylaws that would prevent or delay change in our control   upon completion of the offering cathedral stock transfer will act as the registrants transfer agent   preferred stock   by resolution of our majority shareholder we may without any further vote or action by our shareholders amend our articles of incorporation to authorize and issue subject to limitations prescribed by law shares of preferred stock the preferred stock may be issued in one or more classes or class with respect to any classes or class the board may determine the designation and the number of shares preferences limitations and special rights including dividend rights conversion rights voting rights redemption rights and liquidation preferences because of the rights that may be granted the issuance of preferred stock may delay defer or prevent a change of control prior to this offering we had no shares of preferred issued and outstanding   dividend policy   we have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future we intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and expansion of our business any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon a number of factors including our results of operations financial condition future prospects contractual restrictions restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our board of directors deems relevant       share eligible for future sale   prior to this offering there was no public market for our common stock we cannot predict the effect if any that market sales of shares of our common stock or the availability of shares of our common stock for sale will have on the market price of our common stock sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the market prices of our common stock and could impair our future ability to raise capital through the sale of our equity securities    the  shares of common stock outstanding after this offering will be restricted as a result of securities laws restricted securities may be sold in the public market only if they have been registered or if they qualify for an exemption from registration under rule  under the securities act   implication of the applicability of rule      sales under the rule  by our affiliates or persons selling shares on behalf of our affiliates are subject to certain manner of sale provisions and notice requirements and to the availability of current public information about us   there are zero  shares of our common stock held by nonaffiliates and five million  shares held by affiliates that rule  of the securities act of  defines as restricted securities pursuant to rule  of the securities act of  as amended “rule ” a “shell company” is defined as a company that has no or nominal operations and either no or nominal assets assets consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents or assets consisting of any amount of cash and cash equivalents and nominal other assets   as such because we have nominal assets and minimal operations we are still considered a “shell company” pursuant to rule  and as such sales of our securities pursuant to rule  are not able to be made until we have ceased to be a “shell company” and we are subject to section  or d of the securities exchange act of  as amended and have filed all of our required periodic reports for at least the previous one year period prior to any sale pursuant to rule  and a period of at least twelve months has elapsed from the date “form  information” ie information similar to that which would be found in a form  registration statement filing with the sec   has been filed with the commission reflecting the company’s status as a non“shell company”      penny stock considerations   our shares will be penny stocks as that term is generally defined in the securities exchange act of  to mean equity securities with a price of less than  thus our shares will be subject to rules that impose sales practice and disclosure requirements on brokerdealers who engage in certain transactions involving a penny stock under the penny stock regulations a brokerdealer selling a penny stock to anyone other than an established customer must make a special suitability determination regarding the purchaser and must receive the purchasers written consent to the transaction prior to the sale unless the brokerdealer is otherwise exempt   in addition under the penny stock regulations the brokerdealer is required to      deliver prior to any transaction involving a penny stock a disclosure schedule prepared by the securities and exchange commission relating to the penny stock market unless the brokerdealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt      disclose commissions payable to the brokerdealer and our registered representatives and current bid and offer quotations for the securities      send monthly statements disclosing recent price information pertaining to the penny stock held in a customers account the accounts value and information regarding the limited market in penny stocks and      make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchasers written agreement to the transaction prior to conducting any penny stock transaction in the customers account   because of these regulations brokerdealers may encounter difficulties in their attempt to sell shares of our common stock which may affect the ability of selling shareholders or other holders to sell their shares in the secondary market and have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market these additional sales practice and disclosure requirements could impede the sale of our securities if our securities become publicly traded in addition the liquidity for our securities may be decreased with a corresponding decrease in the price of our securities our shares in all probability will be subject to such penny stock rules and our shareholders will in all likelihood find it difficult to sell their securities   interest of named experts   the financial statements

securities compliance group ltd  manchester road suite  wheaton il    mr tracy does not own any shares of the company     description of business operations   overview   the company was incorporated under the laws of the state of wyoming on august   we are a developmental stage company principally involved in the business of locating acquiring and turning around undervalued assets within the mobile gaming and patented small technologies sector to identify potential acquisitions we intend to look for assets that have not been marketed to the general public yet have the ability to generate interest from the public and have the potential to be monetized within a short time horizon since inception we have generated an accumulated deficit in the amount    dessert crush saga   our initial acquisition a mobile application called dessert crush saga has completed development all source codes have been fully developed and the product is ready for release it is currently available on the itunes app store and once we begin marketing the product will be available in other marketplaces as well   industry overview      the growth of the mobile entertainment market is being shaped by an intersection of trends in the wireless communications and entertainment industries since wireless carriers provide the primary marketing and distribution channel for mobile games and branded content owners provide the licensing relationships that facilitate creating a large and diverse portfolio of recognizable games   the mobile game market differs substantially from the traditional console game market mobile games typically have significantly lower development and distribution costs and longer life cycles than console games console game sales depend upon the product cycles of the consoles themselves with large generational shifts between versions of each of the major console platforms every few years in contrast the mobile platform is characterized by a gradual evolution of features and capabilities in the many new handsets introduced each year by a large number of manufacturers and carriers consumers typically use their console games within the confines of their homes while mobile games are available in all the settings where consumers take their mobile handsets furthermore console games are usually developed for a few console platforms at most which means that the development costs are mostly associated with the original creation and development of the game however once developed mobile games may need to be ported to more than  different handset models many with different technological requirements therefore the ability to port mobile games quickly and cost effectively can be a competitive differentiator among mobile game publishers and a barrier to entry for other potential market entrants   the networked nature of mobile games allows publishers the opportunity to improve the profitability of a game through decisions on porting pricing localization and marketing some games especially those tied to films television shows or console games with specific “dayanddate” launch requirements ideally are launched simultaneously on a global basis with a large number of carriers other games may be launched in stages by regions or by carriers these games require initial launch on fewer handsets than games with global “dayanddate” launch requirements games released in stages offer the opportunity to improve profitability by adjusting porting and marketing support costs based upon the initial success of the game growth strategy the company’s growth strategy involves active review of targeted mobile applications that have highvalue elements and low barriers to acquisition for example red fish holdings’ first acquisition was guided by the recent uptrend in production and popularity of matchthree puzzle games within the mobile gaming sector the highvalue component being the quality and style of gameplay vigilant research into ongoing trends both operational and product trends as well as developing trends in marketing and revenue generating strategies will guide future growth   once targets are acquired the company will attempt to market the products into less expensive markets or less saturated markets than us–only markets or socialmedia based platforms and markets like facebook additionally the company will seek to expand market visibility of each application by ensuring compliance with listing and hosting requirements by android digital fronts such as google play     most mobile application offerings will follow a freetoplay model in which users may download the application and play for free with an option to upgrade to a premium version or engage in inapp purchases to extend or enhance game play such a strategy will seek to grow the userbase of each product offering and overall visibility of red fish holdings within the mobile game markets and digital store fronts   market opportunity the  global games market report by market research and predictive analytics firm newzoo estimates the annual revenue in the global games market to be  billion newzoo further estimates that the worldwide games market will reach  billion by  this represents a  to   compound annual growth rate cagr  of  the market for smart phones and tablets will rise from  billion this year to  billion in  ultimately

going to account for  of the global market totaling  billion up from a  share in    target market and marketing strategy  in order to effectively and efficiently market our portfolio of mobile applications and mobile gaming applications in an effort to acquire new users we will utilize a multifaceted approach as follows                   outreach to various technology business and gaming blogs and online publications                 payperclick ppc and cross platform advertising                 trade shows and other industry gatherings   the combination of these three marketing approaches will in theory provide optimal coverage for user acquisition by utilizing three different approaches we aim to keep our user acquisition cost at a lower average price than we would if we utilized only one or two strategies in addition to keeping our user acquisition cost low using multiple different approaches will allow us to better reach our target market of  –  year olds as different segments of the target market are accessible via different technologies and advertising media the three approaches are further outlined below   blog outreach    online blogs offer immense marketing opportunities we will be able to specifically target blogs that write about technology business and gaming by contacting these bloggers to write a review about our portfolio of mobile applications and mobile gaming appliactions we can reach specific groups of people that might become potential customers at a lower price and at a much more effective rate than some other forms of advertising such as radio spots or newspaper advertisements   payperclick ppc and cross platform advertising    payperclick ppc is a model of internet marketing in which advertisers pay a fee each time one of their ads is clicked one of the most popular forms of ppc search engine advertising allows advertisers to bid for ad placement in a search engine’s sponsored links when someone searches on a keyword that is related to their business offering cross platform advertising in this case is extending advertising and marketing efforts to mobile devices for inclusion in ‘inapp’ advertising by utilizing both of these approaches we can once again make an effort to keep customer acquisition cost lower by a only paying for actual ‘clicks’ instead of impressions and b placing our advertising directly in front of people by placing advertising in apps on mobile devices    trade shows and industry gatherings    by attending industry trade shows and industry gatherings we will be able to showcase our portfolio of mobile applications and mobile gaming applications to our peers in the technology and gaming industries as well as raise awareness for future business to business bb partnerships bb partnerships will offer opportunities for both new and existing companies in our industry to develop new products that will integrate seamlessly with our software platform partnerships such as these and others will offer our company even greater visibility to customers     competition   our primary industry competitors include digital chocolate electronic arts ea mobile gameloft handson mobile iplay namco and thq with electronic arts having the largest market share of any company in the mobile games market in the future likely competitors include major media companies traditional video game publishers content aggregators mobile software providers and independent mobile game publishers wireless carriers may also decide to develop internally or through a managed thirdparty developer and distribute their own mobile games if carriers enter the mobile game market as publishers they might refuse to distribute some or all of our games or might deny us access to all or part of their networks      the development distribution and sale of mobile games is a highly competitive business for end users we compete primarily on the basis of brand game quality and price for carriers we compete for deck placement based on these factors as well as historical performance and perception of sales potential and relationships with licensors of brands and other intellectual property for content and brand licensors we compete based on royalty and other economic terms perceptions of development quality porting abilities speed of execution distribution breadth and relationships with carriers we also compete for experienced and talented employees   some of our competitors’ and our potential competitors’ advantages over us either globally or in particular geographic markets include the following   • significantly greater revenues and financial resources   • stronger brand and consumer recognition regionally or worldwide     • the capacity to leverage their marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of mobile and nonmobile products     • more substantial intellectual property of their own from which they can develop games without having to pay royalties     • preexisting relationships with brand owners or carriers that afford them access to intellectual property while blocking the access of competitors to that same intellectual property   • greater resources to make acquisitions   • lower labor and development costs and   • broader global distribution and presence   further our capital resources limit the number of games that we can develop and market and any inability to predict successfully the appropriate level of marketing investment in each game could result in lower earnings than we anticipate     research  development   red fish holdings is not currently engaged in any research development of the apps beyond what is currently available in our portfolio will commence in the coming months   intellectual property   the company itself does not hold any intellectual property besides for the use of its trade name   government regulation   we do not believe we will require any government approval to sell our products however our services are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws within various jurisdictions throughout the world and regulations prohibiting unfair and deceptive trade practices these consumer protection laws could result in substantial compliance costs and could interfere with the conduct of our business   employees   we have one employee our chief executive officer tom mahoney mr mahoney spends at least  hours a month on the affairs of the company we will hire necessary personnel based on an asneeded basis only and on a percontract basis to be compensated directly from revenues    legal proceedings      we know of no existing or pending legal proceedings against us nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any proceeding or pending litigation there are no proceedings in which any of our directors officers or any of their respective affiliates or any beneficial stockholder is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our interest   properties   our

controller or persons performing similar functions   board composition   our bylaws provide that the board of directors shall consist of no more than three  directors each director of the company serves until his successor is elected and qualified subject to removal by the company’s majority shareholders each officer shall hold their offices for such terms and shall exercise such powers and perform such duties as shall be determined by the board of directors and shall hold his office until his successor is elected and qualified or until his earlier resignation or removal   potential conflicts of interest since we do not have an audit or compensation committee comprised of independent directors the functions that would have been performed by such committees are performed by our directors thus there is a potential conflict of interest in that our directors and officers have the authority to determine issues concerning management compensation and audit issues that may affect management decisions we are not aware of any other conflicts of interest with any of our executives or directors director independence our board of directors has undertaken a review of the independence of each director and considered whether any director has a material relationship with us that could compromise his ability to exercise independent judgment in carrying out his    responsibilities as a result of this review our board of directors determined that our directors do not meet the independence requirements according to the applicable rules and regulations of the sec corporate governance there have been no changes in any state law or other procedures by which security holders may recommend nominees to our board of directors in addition to having no nominating committee for that purpose we currently have no specific audit committee and no audit committee financial expert based on the fact that our current business affairs are simple any such committees are excessive and beyond the scope of our business and needs family relationships none involvement in certain legal proceedings   no officer director or persons nominated for such positions promoter or

ownership of certain beneficial owners and management   the following tables set forth the ownership as of the date of this prospectus of our common stock by each person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than  of our outstanding common stock our directors and our executive officers and directors as a group to the best of our knowledge the persons named have sole voting and investment power with respect to such shares except as otherwise noted there are not any pending or anticipated arrangements that may cause a change in control   the information presented below regarding beneficial ownership of our voting securities has been presented in accordance with the rules of the securities and exchange commission and is not necessarily indicative of ownership for any other purpose under these rules a person is deemed to be a beneficial owner of a security if that person has or shares the power to vote or direct the voting of the security or the power to dispose or direct the disposition of the security a person is deemed    to own beneficially any security as to which such person has the right to acquire sole or shared voting or investment power within  days through the conversion or exercise of any convertible security warrant option or other right more than one person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the same securities the percentage of beneficial ownership by any person as of a particular date is calculated by dividing the number of shares beneficially owned by such person which includes the number of shares as to which such person has the right to acquire voting or investment power within  days by the sum of the number of shares outstanding as of such date plus the number of shares as to which such person has the right to acquire voting or investment power within  days consequently the denominator used for calculating such percentage may be different for each beneficial owner except as otherwise indicated below and

our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included in this form s our

the loss of significant customers or suppliers fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results change in business strategy or development plans business disruptions the ability to attract

securities and exchange commission   although the forwardlooking statements in this registration statement reflect the good faith judgment of our management such statements can only be based on facts and factors currently known by them consequently and because forwardlooking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties the actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the forwardlooking statements you are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report and in our other reports as we attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business financial condition and results of operations and prospects   overview   we are a developmental stage company principally involved in the business of marketing and developing mobile gaming applications to the public since inception we have generated no revenue against total expenses of  for a net loss in the amount of  our expenses are primarily attributed to general and administrative expenses as well as those related to the organization of the company and this offering we have generated an accumulated deficit in the amount of  for the period ending february     plan of operations     our plan of operations for the next twelve  months is as follows   execute capital raise months    estimated cost    acquire develop and launch mobile applications mobile gaming applications and website months    acquire mobile applications and mobile gaming applications that are already in existence and undervalue hire contractors to further develop our portfolio of mobile applications and mobile gaming applications as well as launch new mobile applications and mobile gaming applications develop software and purchase appropriate hardware to maintain a network and server   estimated cost    market mobile gaming applications months    marketing the mobile applications and mobile gaming applications that we develop is the key component of our growth strategy this will involve developing and launching a multifaceted online campaign that will incorporate the latest trends in online marketing web content ad targeting and social media engagement   estimated costs    results of operations   our cash balance is  as of the period ending february   with  in liabilities our cash balance is not sufficient to fund our limited levels of operations for any period of time without further revenue or proceeds from this offering we may utilize funds from mr mahoney our chief executive officer and director who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for offering costs filing fees and professional fees mr mahoney however has no formal commitment arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company in order to sustain our operations for the next twelvemonth period we require a minimum of  of funding from this offering after the initial twelvemonth period we may need additional financing we do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing we incurred expenses of  which is mainly comprised of professional fees including legal  and accounting  fees this constitutes an aggregate loss of  the maximum aggregate amount of this offering will be required to fully implement our business plan      if we do not receive any proceeds from the offering we may be compelled to seek a loan from mr mahoney who has informally agreed to advance us funds however he has no formal commitment arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company   to meet our need for cash we are attempting to raise money from this offering if we are unable to successfully find customers we may quickly use up the proceeds from this offering and will need to find alternative sources at the present time we have not made any arrangements to raise additional cash other than through this offering if we need additional cash and cannot raise it we will either have to suspend operations until we do raise the cash or cease operations entirely   purchase and sale of equipment   we presently have no equipment   income  operation taxes   we are subject to income taxes in the us   net loss   we incurred net losses of  for the period from inception to february      development stage and capital resources   since its inception the company has devoted substantially all of its efforts to business planning research and development recruiting management and staff and raising capital accordingly the company is considered to be in the development stage the company has generated no revenues from operations and therefore lacks meaningful capital reserves   we are attempting to raise funds to proceed with our plan of operation in order to sustain our operations for the next twelvemonth period we require a minimum of  of funding from this offering we cannot guarantee that we will be able to sell all the shares required to satisfy our  months financial requirement if we are successful any money raised will be applied to the items set forth in the use of proceeds section of this prospectus we will attempt to raise at least the minimum funds necessary to proceed with our plan of operation   while we have no revenues as of this date no substantial revenues are anticipated until we have completed the financing from this offering and implemented our full plan of operations we must raise cash to implement our strategy to grow and expand per our business plan the minimum amount of the offering will likely allow us to operate for at least one year and have the capital resources required to cover the material costs with becoming a publicly reporting the company anticipates over the next  months the cost of being a reporting public company will be approximately    we are highly dependent upon the success of this offering as described herein therefore the failure thereof would result in the need to seek capital from other resources such as taking loans which would likely not even be possible for the company however if such financing were available because we are a development stage company with no operations to date we would likely have to pay additional costs associated with high risk loans and be subject to an above market interest rate at such time these funds are required management would evaluate the terms of such debt financing if the company cannot raise additional proceeds via a private placement of its equity or debt securities or secure a loan the company would be required to cease business operations as a result investors would lose all of their investment   additionally the company will have to meet all the financial disclosure and reporting requirements associated with being a publicly reporting company the company’s management will have to spend additional time on policies and procedures to make sure it is compliant with various regulatory requirements especially that of section  of the sarbanesoxley act of  this additional corporate governance time required of management could limit the amount of time management has to implement the business plan and may impede the speed of its operations    liquidity   the following table describes our liquidity as of the period ending february          as of february   current ratio  total debtequity ratio  total working capital   current

on indemnification for securities act liabilities   insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the securities act may be permitted to directors officers and controlling persons of the registrant as provided in the foregoing provisions or otherwise the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the sec such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the

presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share “eps” on the face of the income statement basic eps is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to common shareholders of the

average number of common shares outstanding for the effects of all potential dilutive common shares which comprise options granted to employees as at february   the company had no potentially dilutive shares   fair value of financial instruments the company measures assets and liabilities at fair value based on an expected exit price as defined by the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements which represents the amount that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability as the case may be in an orderly transaction between market participants as such

of being a reporting public company   the costs of being a public reporting company under the securities exchange act of  may be substantial and the company may not be able to absorb the costs of being a public company which may cause us to cease being public in the future or require additional fundraising in order to remain in business we estimate that in the future costs for legal and accounting will be approximately  per year    we are subject to compliance with securities law which exposes us to potential liabilities including potential rescission rights   we may offer to sell our common stock to investors pursuant to certain exemptions from the registration requirements of the securities act of  as well as those of various state securities laws the basis for relying on such exemptions is factual that is the applicability of such exemptions depends upon our conduct and that of those persons contacting prospective investors and making the offering we may not seek any legal opinion to the effect that any such offering would be exempt from registration under any federal or state law instead we may elect to relay upon the operative facts as the basis for such exemption including information provided by investor themselves   if any such offering did not qualify for such exemption an investor would have the right to rescind its purchase of the securities if it so desired it is possible that if an investor should seek rescission such investor would succeed a similar situation prevails under state law in those states where the securities may be offered without registration in reliance on the partial preemption from the registration or qualification provisions of such state statutes under the national securities markets improvement act of  if investors were successful in seeking rescission we would face severe financial demands that could adversely affect our business and operations additionally if we did not in fact qualify for the exemptions upon which it has relied we may become subject to significant fines and penalties imposed by the sec and state securities agencies     our auditor has indicated in its report that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as a result of our lack of revenues and if we are unable to generate significant revenue or secure financing we may be required to cease or curtail our operations   our auditor has indicated in its report that our lack of revenues raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern  the financial statements do not include adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty if we are unable to generate significant revenue or secure financing we may be required to cease or curtail our operations      our certificate of incorporation and bylaws limit the liability of and provide indemnification for our officers and directors   our certificate of incorporation generally limits our officers’ and directors’ personal liability to the company and its stockholders for breach of fiduciary duty as an officer or director except for breach of the duty of loyalty or acts or omissions not made in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide indemnification for our officers and directors to the fullest extent authorized by the wyoming general corporation law against all expense liability and loss including attorneys fees judgments fines excise taxes or penalties and amounts to be paid in settlement reasonably incurred or suffered by an officer or director in connection with any action suit or proceeding whether civil or criminal administrative or investigative hereinafter a “proceeding to which the officer or director is made a party or is threatened to be made a party or in which the officer or director is involved by reason of the fact that he is or was an officer or director of the company or is or was serving at the request of the company whether the basis of the proceeding is an alleged action in an official capacity as an officer or director or in any other capacity while serving as an officer or director thus the company may be prevented from recovering damages for certain alleged errors or omissions by the officers and directors for liabilities incurred in connection with their good faith acts for the company  such an indemnification payment might deplete the companys assets stockholders who have questions regarding the fiduciary obligations of the officers and directors of the company should consult with independent legal counsel it is the position of the securities and exchange commission that exculpation from and indemnification for liabilities arising under the securities act of  as amended and the rules and regulations thereunder is against public policy and therefore unenforceable   we are dependent on the sale of our securities to fund our operations    we are dependent on the sale of our securities to fund our operations and will remain so until we generate sufficient revenues to pay for our operating costs  our officers and directors have made no written commitments with respect to providing a source of liquidity in the form of cash advances loans andor financial guarantees there can be no guarantee that we will be able to successfully sell our equity or debt securities   the company may not be able to attain profitability without additional funding which may be unavailable   the company has limited capital resources unless the company begins to generate sufficient revenues to finance operations as a going concern the company may experience liquidity and solvency problems such liquidity and solvency problems may force the company to cease operations if additional financing is not available no known alternative resources of funds are available in the event we do not generate sufficient funds from operations   expenses required to operate as a public company will reduce funds available to develop our business and could negatively affect our stock price and adversely affect our results of operations cash flow and financial condition   operating as a public company is more expensive than operating as a private company including additional funds required to obtain outside assistance from legal accounting investor relations or other professionals that could be more costly than planned  we may also be required to hire additional staff to comply with additional sec reporting requirements  we anticipate that the cost of sec reporting will be approximately  annually  our failure to comply with reporting requirements and other provisions of securities laws could negatively affect our stock price and adversely affect our results of operations cash flow and financial condition  if we fail to meet these requirements we will be unable to secure a qualification for quotation of our securities on the otc bulletin board or if we have secured a qualification we may lose the qualification and our securities would no longer trade on the otc bulletin board  further if we fail to meet these obligations and consequently fail to satisfy our sec reporting obligations investors will then own stock in a company that does not provide the disclosure available in quarterly annual reports and other required sec reports that would be otherwise publicly available leading to increased difficulty in selling their stock due to our becoming a nonreporting issuer   our lack of history makes evaluating our business difficult      we have a limited operating history and we may not sustain profitability in the future   to sustain profitability we must    develop mobile applications for which there is significant consumer deamnd  compete with larger more established competitors in the mobile appli  build maintain and enhance our portfolio of individual labels and overall brand recognition and  adapt to meet changes in our markets and competitive developments   we may not be successful in accomplishing these objectives further our lack of operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects our prospects must be considered in light of the risks uncertainties expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of development particularly companies in highly competitive industries the historical information in this report may not be indicative of our future financial condition and future performance             risks related to our business   we operate in highly competitive and rapidly evolving technology markets and our market share and results of operations could be adversely affected if we fail to compete effectively in the future   the mobile application market is highly competitive and evolving rapidly competition is generally based on brand name recognition product quality and purchasing convenience our business will likely face competition from other large corporations and regional investment groups we have no direct competitors that compete within our business model per se however we compete with many companies and investment groups that seek to purchase distressed and undervalued or underfunded mobile applications software programs and other small patentable technologies with the intention of maximizing its monetization potential moreover the market for mobile games in particular is crowded with a large number of established and specialized companies see risks related to our business  “the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and many of our competitors have significantly greater resources than we do”   the business to consumer marketplace is highly competitive if we cannot develop and promote confidence in  our company  we may not be able to compete with our competitors which would adversely affect our ability to general revenues   we have many potential competitors in the business to consumer marketplace in most instances our competition is competent experienced and has greater financial and marketing resources than we do at the present our ability to compete may be adversely affected by the ability of these competitors to devote greater resources to the development promotion and marketing of their services than are available to us our competitors may also offer a wider range of products and have greater brand recognition they may have greater customer loyalty bases and these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities in addition our competitors may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities and adopt more aggressive advertising campaigns than the company     the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and many of our competitors have significantly greater resources than we do     developing or enhancing development of distributing and selling mobile applications and mobile gaming applications is a highly competitive business marked by continuous introductions of new products as well as rapidly emerging platforms technologies and digital storefronts  for players we compete primarily on the basis of game    quality brand and customer reviews  we compete for promotional and storefront placements based on these factors as well as our relationship with the digital storefront owner historical performance perception of sales potential and relationships with licensors of brands properties and other content  for content and brand licensors we compete based on royalty and other economic terms perceptions of development quality porting abilities speed of execution distribution breadth and relationships with storefront owners we also compete for experienced and talented employees and consultants   we compete with a continually increasing number of public companies including activision dena disney electronic arts ea mobile gameloft gree gungho online entertainment king digital entertainment nexon warner brothers and zynga and many wellfunded private companies including kabam machine zone rovio storm team lava and supercell  in addition we face competition from online game developers and distributors who are primarily focused on specific international markets  we could also face increased competition if those companies choose to compete more directly in the united states or the other markets that are significant to us or if large companies with significant online presences such as apple google amazon facebook or yahoo choose to enter or expand into the game space or develop competing games   in addition given the open nature of the development and distribution for smartphones and tablets and the relatively low barriers to entry we also compete or will compete with a vast number of small companies and individuals who are able to create and launch games and other content for these devices using relatively limited resources and with relatively limited startup time or expertise the proliferation of titles in these open developer channels makes it difficult for us to differentiate ourselves from other developers and to compete for players without substantially increasing our marketing expenses and development costs   some of our competitors and our potential competitors have one or more advantages over us either globally or in particular geographic markets which include   • significantly greater financial resources • greater experience with the freetoplay games and more effective game monetization • stronger brand and consumer recognition regionally or worldwide • greater experience and effectiveness integrating community features into their games and increasing the revenues derived from their users through social gamification • the capacity to leverage their marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of mobile and nonmobile products • larger installed user bases from their existing mobile games • larger installed user bases from related platforms such as console gaming or social networking websites to which they can market and sell mobile games • more substantial intellectual property of their own from which they can develop games without having to pay royalties • lower labor and development costs and better overall economies of scale • greater platformspecific focus experience and expertise and • broader global distribution and presence   if we are unable to compete effectively or we are not as successful as our competitors in our target markets our sales could decline our margins could decline and we could lose market share any of which would materially harm our business operating results and financial condition   sales of and demand for our portfolio products may decrease if we fail to keep pace with evolving consumer preferences and trends   our success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to evolving consumer preferences and trends and to translate these preferences and trends into marketable product offerings if we are unable to successfully anticipate identify or react to changing styles or trends or misjudge the market for our products our sales may be lower than expected and we may be faced with a significant amount of unsold finished goods inventory      in response we may be forced to increase our marketing promotions provide markdown allowances to our customers or liquidate excess merchandise any of which could have a material adverse effect on our net sales and profitability our brand image may also suffer if customers believe that we are no longer able to offer innovative products respond to consumer preferences or maintain the quality of our products   since our freetoplay games can be downloaded and played for free we have to succeed in generating a significant number of game installations and significant userbase growth  however we will rely on a very small portion of our total players for nearly all of our revenues derived from inapp purchases as opposed to advertisements and incentivized offers  to significantly increase our revenues we must increase the number of players who convert into a paying player by making inapp purchases increase the amount that our paying players spend in our games andor increase the length of time our players generally play our games  we may encounter difficulties with game monetization for example developing a sufficient quantity and variety of virtual goods to enable a relatively large scale of inapp purchases by an individual user if we cannot predict consumer preferences and trends   we will likely derive the majority of our revenues from apple’s app store and the google play store and if either of these storefronts were unavailable for any prolonged period of time our business will suffer   the majority of our smartphone revenues will likely be derived from apple’s ios platform with the significant majority of such revenues derived from inapp purchases  we will try to generate the balance of our iosrelated revenues from offers and advertisements in games distributed on the apple app store and to a far lesser extent sales of premium games     we will need to maintain a good relationship with apple and google which can lead to our applications being featured on their storefronts when they were commercially released  if we do not receive prominent featuring users may find it more difficult to discover our games and we may not generate revenues from them  we may also be required to spend significantly more on marketing campaigns to increase visibility of our products and generate substantial revenues on these platforms  in addition currently neither apple nor google charges a publisher when it features one of their apps  if either apple or google were to charge publishers to feature an app it could cause our marketing expenses to increase considerably  accordingly any change or deterioration in our relationship with apple or google could materially harm our business and likely cause our stock price to decline      we will likely rely on the continued functioning of the apple app store and the google play store  in the past these digital storefronts have been unavailable for short periods of time or experienced issues with their inapp purchasing functionality   if either of these events recurs on a prolonged basis or other similar issues arise that impact our ability to generate revenues from these storefronts it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results  in addition if these storefront operators fail to provide high levels of service our players’ ability to access our games may be interrupted or players may not receive the virtual currency or goods for which they have paid which may adversely affect our brand   we may publish games developed by third parties which may expose us to a number of potential operational and legal risks     our company may plan on entering into relationships with developers of games primarily in asian and eastern european markets where we will localize and globally publish those games   we may be required to provide third party developers with upfront license fees or nonrecoupable minimum guarantees in order to obtain the rights to publish their games and we may incur significant costs marketing these games after they have been commercially launched     the games may not be commercially successful if they do not appeal to a western audience if our limited experience in publishing other developers’ games leads to unexpected results or for any other reason which would negatively impact our operating results   in addition if any of the games created by third party developers with which we work or acquire infringe intellectual property owned by others or otherwise violate any third party’s rights or any applicable laws and regulations such as laws with respect to data collection and privacy we would be exposed to potential legal risks by publishing these games         the operators of digital storefronts on which we publish our freetoplay games and the advertising channels through which we acquire some of our players in many cases have the unilateral ability to change and interpret the terms of our and others’  contracts with them    we will likely distribute our freetoplay games through directtoconsumer digital storefronts for which the distribution terms and conditions are often  “click through” agreements that we are not able to negotiate  for example we are subject to each of apple’s and google’s standard clickthrough terms and conditions for application developers which govern the promotion distribution and operation of apps including games on their storefronts  either apple or google can unilaterally change its standard terms and conditions with no prior notice to us     in addition the agreement terms can be vague and subject to changing interpretations by the storefront operator  further these storefront operators typically have the right to prohibit a developer from distributing its applications on its storefront if the developer violates its standard terms and conditions  for example in the second quarter of  apple began prohibiting certain types of virtual currencyincentivized advertising offers in games sold on the apple app store   most recently apple has implemented certain restrictions related to games that include guns including changing its game rating methodology which has resulted in games that include gun violence receiving a  rating and prohibiting certain depictions of guns in game icons and other storefront art these restrictions could potentially negatively impact the number of people playing popular  “shooter”  games and the revenues we could generate from such assets if we chose to acquire one     in addition during the second quarter of  apple began prohibiting certain types of virtual currencyincentivized video advertising in games sold on the apple app store  these incentivized video advertisements have attempted to take into account several pitfalls of the older adrevenue models in place for mobile applications however the apple store has prohibited the use of such strategies because of its “unfair” effect on chart rankings and thus deemed it a violation of their terms if apple or google or any other key storefront operator determines that we or one of our key vendors are violating its standard terms and conditions by a new interpretation or otherwise or prohibits us from distributing our games on its storefront it would materially harm our business and likely cause our stock price to significantly decline   apple’s requirement that beginning  february   all new applications and beginning june   all updates to existing applications submitted to the apple app store must include bit support and be built with the ios  software development kit could harm our business  if we acquire an asset that is incompatible with apple’s requirement we may have to expend more resources to update and port such an acquisition in the fourth quarter of  apple informed developers that beginning on february   all new applications and beginning june   all updates to existing applications submitted to the apple app store must include bit support and be built with the ios  software development kit    if we fail to implement bit support for any of our existing games or assets or those that will undergo redevelopment that we intend to launch it would negatively impact our revenues in  and potentially beyond  in addition due to the expense involved in supporting bit development we may have difficulty in locating and acquiring compatible assets to add to our portfolio which will adversely affect revenues more quickly than they otherwise would have  furthermore building our games to support bit development will increase the file size of our games which could reduce the number of downloads of these games particularly if we are unable to keep the size of the games below  megabytes which is the maximum file size that can currently be downloaded over any carrier’s wireless network   if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand our business could be materially adversely affected    we believe that broad brand recognition and a favorable consumer perception of our brand identity and website are essential to our future success accordingly we intend to initiate a substantial advertising and marketing campaign to establish our brand   if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand incur significant expenses in promoting our brand and fail to generate a corresponding increase in revenue as a result of our branding efforts or encounter legal obstacles which prevent our continued use of our brand name our business could be materially adversely affected in addition even if    brand identity and website recognition increases the number of new customers or the number of sales or average dollars per sale may not increase which could negatively affect our financial performance   we must complete the development of our website and continually improve the responsiveness functionality and features of our products and services in order to maintain our consumer base we may not succeed in developing features functions products or services that endconsumers find attractive this could reduce the number potential buyers using our website and materially adversely affect our business   because we have a limited history of operations we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan   as a development stage company we have less than one year of operational history in our industry accordingly our operations are subject to the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise including access to capital successful implementation of our business plan and no revenue from operations we cannot assure you that our intended activities or plan of operation will be successful or result in revenue or profit to us and any failure to implement our business plan may have a material adverse effect on the business of the company   if we fail to effectively manage our growth our business brand and reputation results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected   we may experience a rapid growth in operations which may place significant demands on our management team and our operational and financial infrastructure as we continue to grow we must effectively identify integrate develop and motivate new employees and maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture to attract top talent we believe we will have to offer attractive compensation packages the risks of overhiring or over compensating and the challenges of integrating a rapidly growing employee base may impact profitability   additionally if we do not effectively manage our growth the quality of our services portfolio offerings could suffer which could adversely affect our business brand and reputation results of operations and financial condition if operational technology and infrastructure improvements are not implemented successfully our ability to manage our growth will be impaired and we may have to make significant additional expenditures to address these issues to effectively manage our growth we will need to continue to improve our operational financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures   this will require that we refine our information technology systems to maintain effective online services and enhance information and communication systems to ensure that our employees effectively communicate with each other and our growing base of customers these system enhancements and improvements will require significant incremental and ongoing capital expenditures and allocation of valuable management and employee resources if we fail to implement these improvements and maintenance programs effectively our ability to manage our expected growth and comply with the rules and regulations that are applicable to publicly reporting companies will be impaired and we may incur additional expenses   we depend heavily on key personnel and turnover of key senior management could harm our business   our future business and results of operations depend in significant part upon the continued contributions of our chief executive officer if we lose his services or if he fails to perform in his current position or if we are not able to attract and retain skilled employees as needed our business could suffer significant turnover in our senior management could significantly deplete our institutional knowledge held by our existing senior management team we depend on the skills and abilities of these key employees in managing the product acquisition marketing and sales aspects of our business any part of which could be harmed by turnover in the future    our management has not had experience in managing the day to day operations of a public company and as a result we may incur additional expenses associated with the management of our company   our chief executive officer tom mahoney is responsible for the operations and reporting of our company the requirements of operating as a small public company are new to our management this may require us to obtain    outside assistance from legal accounting investor relations or other professionals that could be more costly than planned we may also be required to hire additional staff to comply with additional sec reporting requirements we anticipate that the costs associated with sec requirements associated with going and staying public are estimated to be approximately  in connection with this registration statement and thereafter  annually if we lack cash resources to cover these costs in the future our failure to comply with reporting requirements and other provisions of securities laws could negatively affect our stock price and adversely affect our potential results of operations cash flow and financial condition after we commence operations   our future results and reputation may be affected by litigation or other liability claims   we have not procured a general liability insurance policy for our business to the extent that we suffer a loss of a type which would normally be covered by general liability we would incur significant expenses in defending any action against us and in paying any claims that result from a settlement or judgment against us adverse publicity could result in a loss of consumer confidence in our business or our securities   if the use of smartphones and tablet devices as game platforms and the proliferation of mobile devices generally do not increase our business could be adversely affected   while the number of people using mobile internetenabled devices such as smartphones and tablet devices has increased dramatically in the past few years the mobile market particularly the market for mobile games is still emerging and it may not grow as we anticipate  our future success is substantially dependent upon the continued growth of use of mobile devices for games  the proliferation of mobile devices may not continue to develop at historical rates and consumers may not continue to use mobile internetenabled devices as a platform for games  in addition new and emerging technologies could make the mobile devices on which our games are currently released obsolete requiring us to transition our business model to develop games for other nextgeneration platforms    our business is subject to increasing governmental regulation if we do not successfully respond to these regulations our business may suffer   we are subject to a number of domestic and foreign laws and regulations that affect our business  not only are these laws constantly evolving which could result in their being interpreted in ways that could harm our business but legislation is also continually being introduced that may affect both the content of our products and their distribution  in the united states for example numerous federal and state laws have been introduced which attempt to restrict the content or distribution of games  legislation has been adopted in several states and proposed at the federal level that prohibits the sale of certain games to minors  if such legislation is adopted it could harm our business by limiting the games we are able to offer to our customers or by limiting the size of the potential market for our games     we may also be required to modify certain games or alter our marketing strategies to comply with new and possibly inconsistent regulations which could be costly or delay the release of our games  in particular freetoplay games have been subject to such legislation and public policy concerns already for example the united kingdom’s office of fair trading issued new principles in january  relating to inapp purchases in freetoplay games that are directed towards children  and under which principles became effective in april   in response to a request made by the european commission google has announced that it will no longer label freetoplay games as free in european union countries  similarly in the fourth quarter of  apple changed its label for freetodownload applications from  “free”  to  “get”  in the apple app store     the federal trade commission has also indicated that it intends to review issues related to inapp purchases particularly with respect to games that are marketed primarily to minors the federal trade commission recently reached settlement agreements with apple and google on this subject  if the federal trade commission issues rules significantly restricting or even prohibiting inapp purchases it would significantly impact our business strategy     furthermore the growth and development of freetoplay gaming and the sale of virtual goods may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on companies such as ours  we anticipate that scrutiny and regulation of this industry will increase and that we will be required to devote resources to addressing such regulation  for example existing laws or new laws regarding the regulation of currency and    banking institutions may be interpreted to cover virtual currency or goods  if that were to occur we may be required to seek licenses authorizations or approvals from relevant regulators the granting of which may depend on us meeting certain capital and other requirements which could significantly increase our operating costs     finally because our services may be available worldwide certain foreign jurisdictions and others may claim that we are required to comply with their laws including in jurisdictions where we have no local entity employees or infrastructure   we may be subject to regulatory inquiries claims suits prosecutions which may impact our profitability   any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with applicable laws and regulations in general may subject us to regulatory inquiries claims suits and prosecutions we can give no assurance that we will prevail in such regulatory inquiries claims suits and prosecutions on commercially reasonable terms or at all responding to defending andor settling regulatory inquiries claims suits and prosecutions may be timeconsuming and divert management and financial resources or have other adverse effects on our business a negative outcome in any of these proceedings may result in changes to or discontinuance of some of our services potential liabilities or additional costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and future prospects   we are subject to complex federal state local and other laws and regulations that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations   our business is subject to various and sometimes complex laws and regulations in order to conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations we must obtain and maintain numerous permits approvals and certificates from various federal state and local governmental authorities we may incur substantial costs in order to maintain compliance with these existing laws and regulations   in addition our costs of compliance may increase if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations these costs could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations moreover our failure to comply with these laws and regulations as interpreted and enforced could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations   any change to government regulationadministrative practices may have a negative impact on our ability to operate and our profitability   the laws regulations policies or current administrative practices of any government body organization or regulatory agency in the united states or any other jurisdiction may be changed applied or interpreted in a manner which will fundamentally alter the ability of our company to carry on our business the actions policies or regulations or changes thereto of any government body or regulatory agency or other special interest groups may have a detrimental effect on us any or all of these situations may have a negative impact on our ability to operate andor our profitably   we do not yet have substantial assets or revenues and are largely dependent upon the proceeds of this offering to fully fund our business if we do not the sell shares in this offering we may have to seek alternative financing to complete our business or abandon them   we have limited capital resources to date the company has funded its operations from limited funding and has not generated sufficient cash from operations to be profitable unless the company begins to generate sufficient revenues to finance operations as a going concern we may experience liquidity and solvency problems such liquidity and solvency problems may force us to cease operations if additional financing is not available no known alternative sources of funds are available to the company in the event it does not have adequate proceeds from this offering however the company believes that the net proceeds of this offering will be sufficient to satisfy operating requirements for the next twelve months      if our estimates related to expenditures and cash flow from operations are erroneous or we are unable to sell additional equity securities our business could fall short of expectations and you may lose your entire investment   our financial success is dependent in part upon the accuracy of our managements estimates of expenditures and cash flow from operations if such estimates are erroneous or inaccurate we may not be able to carry out our business plan which could in a worstcase scenario result in the failure of our business and you losing your entire investment   our business may be harmed by future intellectual property right claims or disputes   we may receive in the future communications alleging that certain items listed or sold through our company or within one of our applications or a digital storefront infringe thirdparty copyrights trademarks and trade names or other intellectual property rights these and future claims could result in increased costs of doing business through legal expenses adverse judgment or settlement or require us to change our business practices in expensive ways in addition litigation could result in interpretations of the law that require us to change our business practices or otherwise increase our costs   the laws and regulations concerning data privacy and data security are continually evolving and our actual or perceived failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business   we are subject to federal state and foreign laws regarding privacy and the protection of the information that we collect regarding our users which laws are currently in a state of flux and likely to remain so for the foreseeable future  the us government including the federal trade commission and the department of commerce is continuing to review the need for greater regulation over collecting information concerning consumer behavior on the internet and on mobile devices   various government and consumer agencies have also called for new regulation and changes in industry practices      if we do not follow existing laws and regulations as well as the rules of the smartphone platform operators with respect to privacyrelated matters or if consumers raise any concerns about our privacy practices even if unfounded it could damage our reputation and operating results   all of potential games or software programs we choose to acquire will likely be subject to our privacy policy and a terms of service  if we fail to comply with a posted privacy policy terms of service or privacyrelated laws and regulations including with respect to the information we collect from users of our games it could result in proceedings against us by governmental authorities or others which could harm our business  in addition interpreting and applying data protection laws to the mobile gaming industry is often unclear  these laws may be interpreted and applied in conflicting ways from state to state country to country or region to region and in a manner that is not consistent with our current data protection practices  complying with these varying requirements could cause us to incur additional costs and change our business practices  further if we fail to adequately protect our users’ privacy and data it could result in a loss of player confidence in our services and ultimately in a loss of users which could adversely affect our business   in the area of information security and data protection many states have passed laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data such as the  amendment to california’s information practices act or requiring the adoption of minimum information security standards that are often vaguely defined and difficult to implement  costs to comply with these laws may increase as a result of changes in interpretation  furthermore any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities     security measures that we put in place to protect our data and the personal information of our employees customers and partners could be breached due to cyberattacks initiated by third party hackers employee error or malfeasance or otherwise  because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to disable or degrade service or to sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures  any breach or unauthorized access could materially interfere with our operations or our ability to offer our services or result in significant legal and financial exposure damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in the security of our data which could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results      we may be liable if third parties misappropriate our customers personal information   if third parties are able to penetrate our network security or otherwise misappropriate our customers personal information or credit card information or if we give third parties improper access to our customers personal information or credit card information we could be subject to liability this liability could include claims for unauthorized purchases with credit card information impersonation or other similar fraud claims this liability could also include claims for other misuses of personal information including unauthorized marketing purposes   these claims could result in litigation liability for misappropriation of this information could adversely affect our business in addition the federal trade commission and state agencies have been investigating various internet companies regarding their use of personal information we could incur additional expenses if new regulations regarding the use of personal information are introduced or if government agencies investigate our privacy practices we rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of confidential information such as customer credit card numbers we cannot assure you that advances in computer capabilities new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments will not result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms that we use to protect customer transaction data if any such compromise of our security were to occur it could harm our reputation business prospects financial condition and results of operations a party who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our operations we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against such security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches we cannot assure you that our security measures will prevent security breaches or that failure to prevent such security breaches will not harm our business prospects financial condition and results of operations   if we fail to maintain and enhance our capabilities for porting games to a broad array of mobile devices particularly those running the android operating system our revenues and financial results could suffer    we will derive the majority of our revenues from the sale of virtual goods within our games for smartphones and tablets that run apple’s ios or google’s android operating system  unlike the apple ecosystem in which apple controls both the device iphone ipod touch and ipad and the storefront apple’s app store the android ecosystem is highly fragmented since a large number of oems manufacture and sell androidbased devices that run a variety of versions of the android operating system and there are many androidbased storefronts in addition to the google play store  for us to sell our games to the widest possible audience of android users we must comport our games to a significant portion of the more than  androidbased devices that are commercially available many of which have different technical requirements  since the number of androidbased smartphones and tablets shipped worldwide is growing significantly it is important that we maintain and enhance our porting capabilities which could require us to invest considerable resources in this area  these additional costs could harm our business operating results and financial condition  in addition we must continue to increase the efficiency of our porting processes or it may take us longer to port games to an equivalent number of devices which would negatively impact our margins  if we fail to maintain or enhance our porting capabilities our revenues and financial results could suffer   we depend upon thirdparty servicers to deliver our products to our customers on a timely and consistent basis   we will rely upon multiple third parties for the development and enhancement of our portfolio of products a deterioration in our relationship with any one of these third parties could decrease our ability to track shipments cause shipment delays and increase our shipping costs and the number of damaged products because we may not have a written longterm agreement with any of these third parties we cannot be sure that these relationships will continue on terms favorable to us if at all if our relationships with these third parties are terminated or impaired or if these third parties are unable to deliver products for us whether through labor shortage slow down or stoppage deteriorating financial or business condition or for any other reason we would be required to use alternative servicers we may be unable to engage alternative carriers on a timely basis or upon terms favorable to us changing servicers would likely have a negative effect on our business operating results and financial condition      real or perceived errors failures or bugs in our software could impact our reputation and as a result adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects because the technology that we acquire or develop for our mobile applications is complex undetected errors failures or bugs may occur especially when new versions or updates of our applications are released any errors failures or bugs that impact the usability of our applications may cause customer dissatisfaction real or perceived errors failures or bugs including installation errors or policies established by our customers could result in negative publicity loss of or delay in market acceptance and loss of competitive position alleviating any of these problems could require significant expenditures of our capital and other resources and could cause interruptions delays or cessation of sales which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers and could adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects     risks related to our common stock   due to the lack of a current public market for our stock investors may have difficulty in selling stock they purchase   prior to this offering no public trading market existed for the company’s securities there can be no assurance that a public trading market for the company’s common stock will develop or that a public trading market if develop will be sustained the common stock sold pursuant to this prospectus will be freely tradable however will not be eligible for quotation on the over the counter bulletin board we intend upon the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part to engage a market maker to apply for quotation on the otc electronic bulletin board   there can be no assurance that a market maker will agree to file the necessary documents with the financial industry regulatory authority finra which operates the otc electronic bulletin board nor can there be any assurance that such an application for quotation will be approved thus it is anticipated that there will be little or no market for the shares until the company is eligible to have its common stock quoted on the otc electronic bulletin board and as a result an investor may find it difficult to dispose of any shares purchased hereunder because there is none and may be no public market for the company’s stock the company may not be able to secure future equity financing which would have a material adverse effect on the company   furthermore when and if the company’s common stock is eligible for quotation on the otc electronic bulletin board there can also be no assurance as to the depth or liquidity of any market for the common stock or the prices at which holders may be able to sell the shares   as a result investors could find it more difficult to trade or to obtain accurate quotations of the market value of the stock as compared to securities that are traded on the nasdaq trading market or on an exchange moreover an investor may find it difficult to dispose of any shares purchased hereunder   investors may have difficulty in reselling their shares due to the lack of market or state blue sky laws   our common stock is currently not quoted on any market no market may ever develop for our common stock or if developed may not be sustained in the future   the holders of our shares of common stock and persons who desire to purchase them in any trading market that might develop in the future should be aware that there may be significant state law restrictions upon the ability of investors to resell our shares accordingly even if we are successful in having the shares available for trading on the otcbb investors should consider any secondary market for the companys securities to be a limited one we intend to seek coverage and publication of information regarding the company in an accepted publication which permits a manual exemption this manual exemption permits a security to be distributed in a particular state without being registered if the company issuing the security has a listing for that security in a securities manual recognized by the state      however it is not enough for the security to be listed in a recognized manual the listing entry must contain  the names of issuers officers and directors  an issuers balance sheet and  a profit and loss statement for either the fiscal year preceding the balance sheet or for the most recent fiscal year of operations  we may not be able to secure a listing containing all of this information  furthermore the manual exemption is a nonissuer exemption restricted to secondary trading transactions making it unavailable for issuers selling newly issued securities most of the accepted manuals are those published in standard and poors moodys investor service fitchs investment service and bests insurance reports and many states expressly recognize these manuals   a smaller number of states declare that they “recognize securities manuals” but do not specify the recognized manuals the following states do not have any provisions and therefore do not expressly recognize the manual exemption alabama georgia illinois kentucky louisiana montana south dakota tennessee vermont and wisconsin accordingly our shares should be considered totally illiquid which inhibits investors’ ability to resell their shares   we will be subject to penny stock regulations and restrictions and you may have difficulty selling shares of our common stock   the sec has adopted regulations which generally define socalled “penny stocks” to be an equity security that has a market price less than  per share or an exercise price of less than  per share subject to certain exemptions  we anticipate that our common stock will become a “penny stock” and we will become subject to rule g under the exchange act or the “penny stock rule” this rule imposes additional sales practice requirements on brokerdealers that sell such securities to persons other than established customers for transactions covered by rule g a brokerdealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchaser’s written consent to the transaction prior to sale as a result this rule may affect the ability of brokerdealers to sell our securities and may affect the ability of purchasers to sell any of our securities in the secondary market   for any transaction involving a penny stock unless exempt the rules require delivery prior to any transaction in a penny stock of a disclosure schedule prepared by the sec relating to the penny stock market disclosure is also required to be made about sales commissions payable to both the brokerdealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities finally monthly statements are required to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stock   we do not anticipate that our common stock will qualify for exemption from the penny stock rule in any event even if our common stock were exempt from the penny stock rule we would remain subject to section b of the exchange act which gives the sec the authority to restrict any person from participating in a distribution of penny stock if the sec finds that such a restriction would be in the public interest   sales of our common stock under rule  could reduce the price of our stock   there are zero  shares of our common stock held by nonaffiliates and  shares held by affiliates that rule  of the securities act of  defines as restricted securities  newly issued shares may be registered in this offering however all of the remaining shares will still be subject to the resale restrictions of rule   in general persons holding restricted securities including affiliates must hold their shares for a period of at least six months may not sell more than one percent of the total issued and outstanding shares in any day period and must resell the shares in an unsolicited brokerage transaction at the market price  the availability for sale of substantial amounts of common stock under rule  could reduce prevailing market prices for our securities   because we do not have an audit or compensation committee shareholders will have to rely on the entire board of directors none of which are independent to perform these functions   we do not have an audit or compensation committee comprised of independent directors  indeed we do not have any audit or compensation committee  these functions are performed by the board of directors as a whole  no members of the board of directors are independent directors  thus there is a potential conflict in that board members who are also part of management will participate in discussions concerning management compensation and audit issues that may affect management decisions      our chief executive officer and director owns a significant percentage of our outstanding voting securities which could reduce the ability of minority shareholders to effect certain corporate actions    our chief executive officer and director tom mahoney owns all of our outstanding voting securities as a result currently and after the offering he will possess a significant influence and can elect a majority of our board of directors and authorize or prevent proposed significant corporate transactions their ownership and control may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a future change in control impeding a merger consolidation takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer   there may not be funds available for net income because our chief executive officer and director maintains significant control and can determine his own salary and perquisites   our ceo tom mahoney owns all of our outstanding voting securities as a result there may not be funds available for net income because he maintains significant control and can determine his own salary and perquisites   we may in the future issue additional shares of common stock which would reduce investors’ percent of ownership and may dilute our share value   our articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of  shares of common stock  as of the date of this prospectus the company had  shares of common stock outstanding accordingly we may issue up to an additional  shares of common stock the future issuance of common stock may result in substantial dilution in the percentage of our common stock held by our then existing shareholders we may value any common stock issued in the future on an arbitrary basis the issuance of common stock for future services or acquisitions or other corporate actions may have the effect of diluting the value of the shares held by our investors and might have an adverse effect on any trading market for our common stock   we are subject to compliance with securities law which exposes us to potential liabilities including potential rescission rights   we may offer to sell our common stock to investors pursuant to certain exemptions from the registration requirements of the securities act of  as well as those of various state securities laws the basis for relying on such exemptions is factual that is the applicability of such exemptions depends upon our conduct and that of those persons contacting prospective investors and making the offering we may not seek any legal opinion to the effect that any such offering would be exempt from registration under any federal or state law instead we may elect to relay upon the operative facts as the basis for such exemption including information provided by investor themselves   if any such offering did not qualify for such exemption an investor would have the right to rescind its purchase of the securities if it so desired it is possible that if an investor should seek rescission such investor would succeed a similar situation prevails under state law in those states where the securities may be offered without registration in reliance on the partial preemption from the registration or qualification provisions of such state statutes under the national securities markets improvement act of  if investors were successful in seeking rescission we would face severe financial demands that could adversely affect our business and operations additionally if we did not in fact qualify for the exemptions upon which it has relied we may become subject to significant fines and penalties imposed by the sec and state securities agencies   antitakeover effects of certain provisions of wyoming state law hinder a potential takeover of the company   though not now we may be or in the future we may become subject to wyoming’s control share law a corporation is subject to wyoming’s control share law if it has more than  stockholders at least  of whom are stockholders of record and residents of wyoming and it does business in wyoming or through an affiliated corporation the law focuses on the acquisition of a “controlling interest” which means the ownership of outstanding voting shares sufficient but for the control share law to enable the acquiring person to exercise the following proportions of the voting power of the corporation in the election of directors i onefifth or more but less than onethird ii onethird or more but less than a majority or iii a majority or more the ability to exercise such voting power may be direct or indirect as well as individual or in association with others the effect of the control share law is that the acquiring    person and those acting in association with it obtains only such voting rights in the control shares as are conferred by a resolution of the stockholders of the corporation approved at a special or annual meeting of stockholders the control share law contemplates that voting rights will be considered only once by the other stockholders thus there is no authority to strip voting rights from the control shares of an acquiring person once those rights have been approved if the stockholders do not grant voting rights to the control shares acquired by an acquiring person those shares do not become permanent nonvoting shares the acquiring person is free to sell its shares to others if the buyers of those shares themselves do not acquire a controlling interest their shares do not become governed by the control share law if control shares are accorded full voting rights and the acquiring person has acquired control shares with a majority or more of the voting power any stockholder of record other than an acquiring person who has not voted in favor of approval of voting rights is entitled to demand fair value for such stockholder’s shares   wyoming’s control share law may have the effect of discouraging takeovers of the corporation in addition to the control share law wyoming has a business combination law which prohibits certain business combinations between wyoming corporations and “interested stockholders” for three years after the “interested stockholder” first becomes an “interested stockholder” unless the corporation’s board of directors approves the combination in advance for purposes of wyoming law an “interested stockholder” is any person who is i the beneficial owner directly or indirectly of ten percent or more of the voting power of the outstanding voting shares of the corporation or ii an affiliate or associate of the corporation and at any time within the three previous years was the beneficial owner directly or indirectly of ten percent or more of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of the corporation the definition of the term “business combination” is sufficiently broad to cover virtually any kind of transaction that would allow a potential acquiror to use the corporation’s assets to finance the acquisition or otherwise to benefit its own interests rather than the interests of the corporation and its other stockholders the effect of wyoming’s business combination law is to potentially discourage parties interested in taking control of the company from doing so if it cannot obtain the approval of our board of directors   there is no current established trading market for our securities and if a trading market does not develop purchasers of our securities may have difficulty selling their shares   there is currently no established public trading market for our securities and an active trading market in our securities may not develop or if developed may not be sustained  while we intend to seek a quotation on the otc bulletin board there can be no assurance that any such trading market will develop and purchasers of the shares may have difficulty selling their common stock should they desire to do so no market makers have committed to becoming market makers for our common stock and none may do so   because we do not have an escrow account or trust account for our investors subscriptions if we file for bankruptcy protection or are forced into bankruptcy protection investors will lose their entire investment   invested funds for this offering will not be placed in an escrow or trust account accordingly if we file for bankruptcy protection or a petition for involuntary bankruptcy is filed by creditors against us your funds will become part of the bankruptcy estate and administered according to the bankruptcy laws as such you will lose your investment and your funds will be used to pay creditors and will not be used for the sourcing and sale of promotional products     the offering price of  per share is arbitrary the offering price of  per share has been arbitrarily determined by our management and does not bear any relationship to the assets net worth or projected earnings of the company or any other generally accepted criteria of value given this it is possible that investors may suffer dilution in the value of shares purchased herein we have no firm commitments to purchase any shares we have no firm commitment for the purchase of any shares therefore there is no assurance that a trading market will develop or be sustained the company has not engaged a placement agent or broker for the sale of the shares the company may be unable to identify investors to purchase the shares     because we are a “shell company” the holders of our restricted securities will not be able to sell their securities in reliance on rule  and we cannot file registration statements under section  of the securities act using a form s until we cease being a “shell company”   we are a  “shell company”  as that term is defined by the applicable federal securities laws  specifically because of the nature and amount of our assets and our very limited operations pursuant to applicable federal rules we are considered a  “shell company”   applicable provisions of rule  specify that during that time that we are a  “shell company”  and for a period of one year thereafter holders of our restricted securities can not sell those securities in reliance on rule  this restriction may have potential adverse effects on future efforts to form additional capital through unregistered offerings another implication of us being a shell company is that we cannot file registration statements under section  of the securities act using a form s a short form of registration to register securities issued to employees and consultants under an employee benefit plan as result one year after we cease being a shell company assuming we are current in our reporting requirements with the securities and exchange commission and have filed current “form  information”  with the sec reflecting our status as an entity that is no longer a shell company for a period of not less than  months holders of our restricted securities may then sell those securities in reliance on rule  provided however those holders satisfy all of the applicable requirements of that rule for us to cease being a  “shell company”  we must have more than nominal operations and more that nominal assets or assets which do not consist solely of cash or cash equivalents  shares purchased in this offering which will be immediately resalable and sales of all of our other shares if and when applicable restrictions against resale expire could have a depressive effect on the market price if any of our common stock and the shares we are offering    a low market price would severely limit the potential market for our common stock our common stock is expected to trade at a price substantially below  per share subjecting trading in the stock to certain sec rules requiring additional disclosures by brokerdealers these rules generally apply to any nonnasdaq equity security that has a market price share of less than  per share subject to certain exceptions a “penny stock” such rules require the delivery prior to any penny stock transaction of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks associated therewith and impose various sales practice requirements on brokerdealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and institutional or wealthy investors for these types of transactions the brokerdealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchaser’s written consent to the transaction prior to the sale the broker – dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to the brokerdealer current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock and if the brokerdealer is the sole market maker the brokerdealer must disclose this fact and the brokerdealer’s presumed control over the market such information must be provided to the customer orally or in writing before or with the written confirmation of trade sent to the customer monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks the additional burdens imposed upon brokerdealers by such requirements could discourage broker dealers from effecting transactions in our common stock       because we do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell them   we intend to retain any future earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future unless we pay dividends our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell them there is no assurance that stockholders will be able to sell shares when desired   optin right for emerging growth company   we have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under    section b of the jobs act that allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies as a result of this election our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates   implications of being an emerging growth company as a company with less than  billion in revenue during its last fiscal year we qualify as an emerging growth company as defined in the jobs act for as long as a company is deemed to be an emerging growth company it may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other regulatory requirements that are generally unavailable to other public companies  these provisions include    a requirement to have only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related managements discussion and analysis included in an initial public offering registration statement  an exemption to provide less than five years of selected financial data in an initial public offering registration statement  an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of the emerging growth companys internal controls over financial reporting  an exemption from the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards until they would apply to private companies  an exemption from compliance with any new requirements adopted by the public company accounting oversight board requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditors report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer an  reduced disclosure about the emerging growth companys executive compensation arrangements   an emerging growth company is also exempt from section b of sarbanes oxley which requires that the registered accounting firm shall in the same report attest to and report on the assessment on the effectiveness of the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting similarly as a smaller reporting company we are exempt from section b of the sarbanesoxley act and our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until such time as we cease being a smaller reporting company   as an emerging growth company we are exempt from section a a and b of the securities exchange act of  which require the shareholder approval of executive compensation and golden parachutes   section  of the jobs act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section ab of the securities act for complying with new or revised accounting standards  in other words an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies  we have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period  our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards   we would cease to be an emerging growth company upon the earliest of    the first fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of this offering  the first fiscal year after our annual gross revenues are  billion or more  the date on which we have during the previous threeyear period issued more than  billion in nonconvertible debt securities or  as of the end of any fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock held by nonaffiliates exceeded  million as of the end of the second quarter of that fiscal year   you may have limited access to information regarding our business because our obligations to file periodic reports with the sec could be automatically suspended under certain circumstances        as of effectiveness of our registration statement of which this prospectus is a part we will be required to file periodic reports with the sec which will be immediately available to the public for inspection and copying see “where you can find more information” elsewhere in this prospectus     except during the year that our registration statement becomes effective these reporting obligations may in our discretion be automatically suspended under section d of the exchange act if we have less than  shareholders and do not file a registration statement on form a which we have no current plans to file  if this occurs after the year in which our registration statement becomes effective we will no longer be obligated to file periodic reports with the sec and your access to our business information would then be even more restricted  after this registration statement on form s becomes effective we will be required to deliver periodic reports to security holders   however we will not be required to furnish proxy statements to security holders and our directors officers and principal beneficial owners will not be required to report their beneficial ownership of securities to the sec pursuant to section  of the exchange act  previously a company with more than  shareholders of record and  million in assets had to register under the exchange act  however the jobs act raises the minimum shareholder threshold from  to either  persons or  persons who are not accredited investors or  persons in the case of banks and bank holding companies  the jobs act excludes securities received by employees pursuant to employee stock incentive plans for purposes of calculating the shareholder threshold  this means that access to information regarding our business and operations will be limited   upon effectiveness of this registration statement we will be subject to the d reporting requirements under the securities exchange act of  which does not require a company to file all the same reports and information as fully reporting companies   upon effectiveness of this registration statement we will be subject to the d reporting requirements according to the securities exchange act of  as a section d filer we will be required to file quarterly and annual reports during the fiscal year in which our registration statement is declared effective however such duty to file reports shall be suspended as to any fiscal year other than the fiscal year within which such registration statement became effective if at the beginning of such fiscal year the securities of each class are held of record by less than  persons  in addition as a filer subject to section d of the exchange act we are not required to prepare proxy or information statements our common stock will not be subject to the protection of the going private regulations we will be subject to only limited portions of the tender offer rules our officers directors and more than ten  percent shareholders are not required to file beneficial ownership reports about their holdings in our company that these persons will not be subject to the shortswing profit recovery provisions of the exchange act and that more than five percent  holders of classes of our equity securities will not be required to report information about their ownership positions in the securities as such shareholders will not have access to certain material information which would otherwise be required if it was a fully reporting company pursuant to an exchange act registration   if we are not required to continue filing reports under section d of the securities exchange act of  in the future for example because we have less than three hundred shareholders of record at the end of the first fiscal year in which this registration statement is declared effective and we do not file a registration statement on form a our common shares if listed or quoted would no longer be eligible for quotation which could reduce the value of your investment   as a result of this offering as required under section d of the securities exchange act of  we will file periodic reports with the securities and exchange commission as required under section d however if in the future we are not required to continue filing reports under section d for example because we have less than three hundred shareholders of record at the end of the first fiscal year in which this registration statement is declared effective and we do not file a registration statement on form a upon the occurrence of such an event our common stock can no longer be quoted on the otc markets otc link which could reduce the value of your investment  of course there is no guarantee that we will be able to meet the requirements to be able to cease filing reports under section d in which case we will continue filing those reports in the years after the fiscal year in which this registration statement is declared effective  filing a registration statement on form a will require us to continue to file quarterly and annual reports with the sec and will also subject us to the proxy rules of the sec  in addition our officers directors and  stockholders will be required to submit reports to the sec on their stock ownership and stock trading activity        use of proceeds   our offering is being made on a selfunderwritten basis no minimum number of shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed the offering price per share is  the total offering amount is  we do not intend to employ any material amount of the contemplated offering to discharge any current or future indebtedness of the company moreover we do not intend to use any proceeds of the offering to acquire any significant assets of or acquire any entity the following table sets forth the uses of proceeds assuming the sale of    and  respectively of the securities offered for sale by the company there is no guarantee that we will receive any proceeds from the offering      of

            net remaining proceeds                   the above figures represent only estimated costs this expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions the amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors including the status of and results from operations as a result our management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering we may find it necessary or advisable to use the net proceeds from this offering for other purposes and we will have broad discretion in the application of net proceeds from this offering furthermore we anticipate that we will need to secure additional funding for the fully implement our business plan   in the event we are not successful in selling all of the securities we would utilize any available funds raised in the following order of priority  for general administrative expenses including legal and accounting fees and administrative support expenses incurred in connection with our reporting obligations with the sec     for office lease expenses and office equipment  for sales and marketing  for salaries for our chief executive officer and the hiring of additional fulltime employees and  for consultants and developers’ salaries and wages our current corporate offices are located at  little duck circle gulf breeze fl  if we are able to raise sufficient capital through this offering we will seek to lease a larger dedicated space at no more than  per month   determination of the offering price our management has determined the offering price for the common shares being sold in this offering the price of the shares we are offering was arbitrarily determined the offering price bears no relationship whatsoever to our assets earnings book value or other criteria of value the factors considered were  our status as a developmental stage “startup” company  prevailing market conditions including the history and prospects for the industry in which we compete  our forecasted future prospects and  our current capital structure therefore the public offering price of the shares does not necessarily bear any relationship to established valuation criteria and may not be indicative of prices that may prevail at any time or from time to time in the public market for the common stock you cannot be sure that a public market for any of our securities will develop and continue or that the securities will ever trade at a price at or higher than the offering price in this offering such offering price does not have any relationship to any established criteria of value such as book value or earnings per share because we have no significant operating history the price of our common stock is not based on past earnings nor is the price of our common stock indicative of the current market value of the assets owned by us no valuation or appraisal has been prepared for our business and potential business expansion our common stock is presently not traded on any market or securities exchange and we have not applied for listing or quotation on any public market you cannot be sure that a public market for any of our securities will develop and continue or that the securities will ever trade at a price at or higher than the offering price in this offering       dilution if you purchase any of the shares offered by this prospectus your ownership interest will be diluted to the extent of the difference between the initial public offering price per share and the postoffering net tangible book value per share of our common stock immediately after this offering dilution results from the fact that the initial public offering price per share is substantially in excess of the book value per share attributable to the existing stockholder for the presently outstanding stock as of october   our net tangible book value was  or  per share of common stock net tangible book value per share represents the amount of our total tangible assets excluding deferred offering costs less total liabilities divided by  the number of shares of common stock outstanding at october     the following table sets forth as of october   the number of shares of common stock purchased from us and the total consideration paid by our existing stockholder and by new investors in this offering if new investors purchase    or  of the offering after deduction of offering expenses assuming a purchase price in this offering of  per

deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us our postoffering net tangible book value as of october   would be  or  per share this amount represents an immediate increase in the postoffering net tangible book value of  per share to our existing stockholder and an immediate dilution in the postoffering net tangible book value of approximately  per share to new investors purchasing common shares in this offering we determine dilution by subtracting the as adjusted net tangible book value per share after the offering from the amount of cash that a new investor paid for a share of common stock   plan of distribution   this prospectus relates to the sale of  common shares   we will sell the common shares ourselves and do not plan to use underwriters or pay any commissions we will be selling our common shares using our best efforts and no one has agreed to buy any of our common shares this prospectus permits our officers and directors to sell the common shares directly to the public with no commission or other remuneration payable to them for any common shares they may sell there is no plan or arrangement to enter into any contracts or agreements to sell the common shares with a broker or dealer our officers and directors will sell the common shares and intend to offer them to friends family members and business acquaintances there is no minimum amount of common shares we must sell so no money raised from the sale of our common shares will go into escrow trust or another similar arrangement   the common shares are being offered by tom mahoney the company’s chief executive officer and director mr tom mahoney will be relying on the safe harbor in rule a of the securities exchange act of  to sell the common shares no sales commission will be paid for common shares sold by tom mahoney mr mahoney is not subject to a statutory disqualification and is not associated persons of a broker or dealer   additionally mr mahoney primarily performs substantial duties on behalf of the registrant otherwise than in connection with transactions in securities mr mahoney has not been a broker or dealer or an associated person of a broker or dealer within the preceding  months and they have not participated in selling an offering of securities for    any issuer more than once every  months other than in reliance on paragraph ai or aiii of rule a of the securities exchange act of    the offering will terminate upon the earlier to occur of i the sale of all  shares being offered or ii  days after this registration statement is declared effective by the securities and exchange commission   there are no finders in this offering   under the rules of the securities and exchange commission our common stock will come within the definition of a “penny stock” because the price of our common stock is below  per share as a result our common stock will be subject to the penny stock rules and regulations brokerdealers who sell penny stocks to certain types of investors are required to comply with the commission’s regulations concerning the transfer of penny stock these regulations require brokerdealers to    make a suitability determination prior to selling penny stock to the purchaser  receive the purchaser’s written consent to the transaction and  provide certain written disclosures to the purchaser   these requirements may restrict the ability of brokerdealers to sell our common stock and may affect the ability to resell our common stock   market information   there is no established public trading market for our securities and a regular trading market may not develop or if developed may not be sustained a shareholder in all likelihood therefore will not be able to resell his or her securities should he or she desire to do so when eligible for public resales furthermore it is unlikely that a lending institution will accept our securities as pledged collateral for loans unless a regular trading market develops   otc electronic bulletin board considerations   to be quoted on the otc electronic bulletin board a market maker must file an application on our behalf in order to make a market for our common stock we anticipate that after this registration statement is declared effective market makers will enter “piggyback” quotes and our securities will thereafter trade on the otc bulletin board   the otc electronic bulletin board is separate and distinct from the nasdaq stock market nasdaq has no business relationship with issuers of securities quoted on the otc electronic bulletin board the sec’s order handling rules which apply to nasdaqlisted securities do not apply to securities quoted on the otc electronic bulletin board   although the nasdaq stock market has rigorous listing standards to ensure the high quality of its issuers and can delist issuers for not meeting those standards the otc electronic bulletin board has no listing standards rather it is the market maker who chooses to quote a security on the system files the application and is obligated to comply with keeping information about the issuer in its files finra cannot deny an application by a market maker to quote the stock of a company the only requirement for inclusion in the bulletin board is that the issuer be current in its reporting requirements with the sec   although we anticipate listing on the otc electronic bulletin board will increase liquidity for our stock investors may have greater difficulty in getting orders filled because it is anticipated that if our stock trades on a public market it initially will trade on the otc bulletin board rather than on nasdaq investors’ orders may be filled at a price much different than expected when an order is placed trading activity in general is not conducted as efficiently and effectively as with nasdaqlisted securities   investors must contact a brokerdealer to trade otc electronic bulletin board securities investors do not have direct access to the bulletin board service for bulletin board securities there only has to be one market maker      bulletin board transactions are conducted almost entirely manually because there are no automated systems for negotiating trades on the bulletin board they are conducted via telephone in times of heavy market volume the limitations of this process may result in a significant increase in the time it takes to execute investor orders therefore when investors place market orders  an order to buy or sell a specific number of shares at the current market price  it is possible for the price of a stock to go up or down significantly during the lapse of time between placing a market order and getting execution   because bulletin board stocks are usually not followed by analysts there may be lower trading volume than for nasdaqlisted securities there is no guarantee that our stock will ever be quoted on the otc electronic bulletin board   blue sky law considerations   the holders of our shares of common stock and persons who desire to purchase them in any trading market that might develop in the future should be aware that there may be significant state law restrictions upon the ability of investors to resell our shares accordingly even if we are successful in having the shares available for trading on the otcbb investors should consider any secondary market for the companys securities to be a limited one there is no guarantee that our stock will ever be quoted on the otc electronic bulletin board we intend to seek coverage and publication of information regarding the company in an accepted publication which permits a manual exemption” this manual exemption permits a security to be distributed in a particular state without being registered if the company issuing the security has a listing for that security in a securities manual recognized by the state however it is not enough for the security to be listed in a recognized manual   the listing entry must contain  the names of issuers officers and directors  an issuers balance sheet and  a profit and loss statement for either the fiscal year preceding the balance sheet or for the most recent fiscal year of operations we may not be able to secure a listing containing all of this information furthermore the manual exemption is a nonissuer exemption restricted to secondary trading transactions making it unavailable for issuers selling newly issued securities most of the accepted manuals are those published in standard and poors moodys investor service fitchs investment service and bests insurance reports and many states expressly recognize these manuals a smaller number of states declare that they “recognize securities manuals” but do not specify the recognized manuals the following states do not have any provisions and therefore do not expressly recognize the manual exemption al ca il ky la mt nh ny pa tn and va  we currently do not intend to and may not be able to qualify securities for resale in other states which require shares to be qualified before they can be resold by our shareholders    description of securities   the following description as a summary of the material terms of the provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws the articles of incorporation and bylaws have been filed as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part   common stock   we are authorized to issue  shares of common stock with  par value per share as of the date of this registration statement there were  shares of common stock issued and outstanding held by one  shareholder our chief executive officer and director   each share of common stock entitles the holder to one vote either in person or by proxy at meetings of shareholders the holders are not permitted to vote their shares cumulatively accordingly the shareholders of our common stock who hold in the aggregate more than fifty percent of the total voting rights can elect all of our directors and in such event the holders of the remaining minority shares will not be able to elect any of such directors      the vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote thereon is sufficient to authorize affirm ratify or consent to such act or action except as otherwise provided by law   holders of common stock are entitled to receive ratably such dividends if any as may be declared by the board of directors out of funds legally available we have not paid any dividends since our inception and we presently anticipate that all earnings if any will be retained for development of our business any future disposition of dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon among other things our future earnings operating and financial condition capital requirements and other factors   holders of our common stock have no preemptive rights or other subscription rights conversion rights redemption or sinking fund provisions upon our liquidation dissolution or windup the holders of our common stock will be entitled to share ratably in the net assets legally available for distribution to shareholders after the payment of all of our debts and other liabilities there are not any provisions in our articles of incorporation or our bylaws that would prevent or delay change in our control   upon completion of the offering cathedral stock transfer will act as the registrants transfer agent   preferred stock   by resolution of our majority shareholder we may without any further vote or action by our shareholders amend our articles of incorporation to authorize and issue subject to limitations prescribed by law shares of preferred stock the preferred stock may be issued in one or more classes or class with respect to any classes or class the board may determine the designation and the number of shares preferences limitations and special rights including dividend rights conversion rights voting rights redemption rights and liquidation preferences because of the rights that may be granted the issuance of preferred stock may delay defer or prevent a change of control prior to this offering we had no shares of preferred issued and outstanding   dividend policy   we have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future we intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and expansion of our business any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon a number of factors including our results of operations financial condition future prospects contractual restrictions restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our board of directors deems relevant   share eligible for future sale   prior to this offering there was no public market for our common stock we cannot predict the effect if any that market sales of shares of our common stock or the availability of shares of our common stock for sale will have on the market price of our common stock sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the market prices of our common stock and could impair our future ability to raise capital through the sale of our equity securities   we have authorized an aggregate of  shares of our common stock of these shares only the  to be registered in this offering will be freely tradeable without restriction or further registration under the securities act unless those shares are purchased by our affiliates as that term is defined in rule  under the securities act   the remaining  shares of common stock outstanding after this offering will be restricted as a result of securities laws restricted securities may be sold in the public market only if they have been registered or if they qualify for an exemption from registration under rule  under the securities act   implication of the applicability of rule       sales under the rule  by our affiliates or persons selling shares on behalf of our affiliates are subject to certain manner of sale provisions and notice requirements and to the availability of current public information about us   there are zero  shares of our common stock held by nonaffiliates and five million  shares held by affiliates that rule  of the securities act of  defines as restricted securities pursuant to rule  of the securities act of  as amended “rule ” a “shell company” is defined as a company that has no or nominal operations and either no or nominal assets assets consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents or assets consisting of any amount of cash and cash equivalents and nominal other assets   as such because we have nominal assets and minimal operations we are still considered a “shell company” pursuant to rule  and as such sales of our securities pursuant to rule  are not able to be made until we have ceased to be a “shell company” and we are subject to section  or d of the securities exchange act of  as amended and have filed all of our required periodic reports for at least the previous one year period prior to any sale pursuant to rule  and a period of at least twelve months has elapsed from the date “form  information” ie information similar to that which would be found in a form  registration statement filing with the sec   has been filed with the commission reflecting the company’s status as a non“shell company”   penny stock considerations   our shares will be penny stocks as that term is generally defined in the securities exchange act of  to mean equity securities with a price of less than  thus our shares will be subject to rules that impose sales practice and disclosure requirements on brokerdealers who engage in certain transactions involving a penny stock under the penny stock regulations a brokerdealer selling a penny stock to anyone other than an established customer must make a special suitability determination regarding the purchaser and must receive the purchasers written consent to the transaction prior to the sale unless the brokerdealer is otherwise exempt   in addition under the penny stock regulations the brokerdealer is required to    deliver prior to any transaction involving a penny stock a disclosure schedule prepared by the securities and exchange commission relating to the penny stock market unless the brokerdealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt  disclose commissions payable to the brokerdealer and our registered representatives and current bid and offer quotations for the securities  send monthly statements disclosing recent price information pertaining to the penny stock held in a customers account the accounts value and information regarding the limited market in penny stocks and  make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchasers written agreement to the transaction prior to conducting any penny stock transaction in the customers account   because of these regulations brokerdealers may encounter difficulties in their attempt to sell shares of our common stock which may affect the ability of selling shareholders or other holders to sell their shares in the secondary market and have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market these additional sales practice and disclosure requirements could impede the sale of our securities if our securities become publicly traded in addition the liquidity for our securities may be decreased with a corresponding decrease in the price of our securities our shares in all probability will be subject to such penny stock rules and our shareholders will in all likelihood find it difficult to sell their securities     interest of named experts   the financial statements for the period from inception to october   included in this prospectus have been audited by k brice toussaint cpa who is a certified public accounting firm to the extent and for the periods set forth in our report and are incorporated herein in reliance upon such report given upon the authority of said firm as    experts in auditing and accounting there have not been any changes in or disagreements with this firm on accounting and financial disclosure or any other matter   the legality of the shares offered under this registration statement is being passed upon by adam s tracy esq securities compliance group ltd  manchester road suite  wheaton il    mr tracy does not own any shares of the company     description of business operations   the company was incorporated under the laws of the state of wyoming on august   we are a developmental stage company principally involved in the business of locating acquiring and turning around undervalued assets within the mobile gaming and patented small technologies sector since inception we have generated an accumulated deficit in the amount    industry overview   the growth of the mobile entertainment market is being shaped by an intersection of trends in the wireless communications and entertainment industries since wireless carriers provide the primary marketing and distribution channel for mobile games and branded content owners provide the licensing relationships that facilitate creating a large and diverse portfolio of recognizable games   the mobile game market differs substantially from the traditional console game market mobile games typically have significantly lower development and distribution costs and longer life cycles than console games console game sales depend upon the product cycles of the consoles themselves with large generational shifts between versions of each of the major console platforms every few years in contrast the mobile platform is characterized by a gradual evolution of features and capabilities in the many new handsets introduced each year by a large number of manufacturers and carriers consumers typically use their console games within the confines of their homes while mobile games are available in all the settings where consumers take their mobile handsets furthermore console games are usually developed for a few console platforms at most which means that the development costs are mostly associated with the original creation and development of the game however once developed mobile games may need to be ported to more than  different handset models many with different technological requirements therefore the ability to port mobile games quickly and cost effectively can be a competitive differentiator among mobile game publishers and a barrier to entry for other potential market entrants   the networked nature of mobile games allows publishers the opportunity to improve the profitability of a game through decisions on porting pricing localization and marketing some games especially those tied to films television shows or console games with specific “dayanddate” launch requirements ideally are launched simultaneously on a global basis with a large number of carriers other games may be launched in stages by regions or by carriers these games require initial launch on fewer handsets than games with global “dayanddate” launch requirements games released in stages offer the opportunity to improve profitability by adjusting porting and marketing support costs based upon the initial success of the game growth strategy the company’s growth strategy involves active review of targeted mobile applications that have highvalue elements and low barriers to acquisition for example red fish holdings’ first acquisition was guided by the recent uptrend in production and popularity of matchthree puzzle games within the mobile gaming sector the highvalue component being the quality and style of gameplay vigilant research into ongoing trends both operational and product trends as well as developing trends in marketing and revenue generating strategies will guide future growth   once targets are acquired the company will attempt to market the products into less expensive markets or less saturated markets than us–only markets or socialmedia based platforms and markets like facebook additionally the company will seek to expand market visibility of each application by ensuring compliance with listing and hosting requirements by android digital fronts such as google play      most mobile application offerings will follow a freetoplay model in which users may download the application and play for free with an option to upgrade to a premium version or engage in inapp purchases to extend or enhance game play such a strategy will seek to grow the userbase of each product offering and overall visibility of red fish holdings within the mobile game markets and digital store fronts   market opportunity the  global games market report by market research and predictive analytics firm newzoo shows that the worldwide games market will reach  billion by  this represents a  to   compound annual growth rate cagr  of  the market for smart phones and tablets will rise from  billion this year to  billion in  ultimately taking  of the global games market in  china and the us are neck and neck for number one market with china expected to outgrow the us by the smallest of margins  billion versus  billion    the computer screen pcmac with  billion will account for  of the market by  and will remain the most revenue generating screen growing at a robust cagr of  driven primarily by pcmmo games the entertainment screen tvconsole vr with  billion will have  of the market by  down from  in  both the computer screen and the entertainment screen will lose a small portion of their share to the continuously growing personal screen phones smartwatches in  the personal screen with  billion will account for  of the pie leaving  for the floating screen tablets handhelds the decline of the handheld console market cagr of  will be offset by the robust growth of tablet revenues cagr of  resulting in the floating screen maintaining its market share towards  it was estimated that in  digital game revenues were going to account for  of the global market totaling  billion up from a  share in  target market and marketing strategy  in order to effectively and efficiently market our portfolio of mobile applications and mobile gaming applications in an effort to acquire new users we will utilize a multifaceted approach as follows                   outreach to various technology business and gaming blogs and online publications                 payperclick ppc and cross platform advertising                 trade shows and other industry gatherings   the combination of these three marketing approaches will in theory provide optimal coverage for user acquisition by utilizing three different approaches we aim to keep our user acquisition cost at a lower average price than we would if we utilized only one or two strategies in addition to keeping our user acquisition cost low using multiple different approaches will allow us to better reach our target market of  –  year olds as different segments of the target market are accessible via different technologies and advertising media the three approaches are further outlined below   blog outreach  online blogs offer immense marketing opportunities we will be able to specifically target blogs that write about technology business and gaming by contacting these bloggers to write a review about our portfolio of mobile applications and mobile gaming appliactions we can reach specific groups of people that might become potential customers at a lower price and at a much more effective rate than some other forms of advertising such as radio spots or newspaper advertisements   payperclick ppc and cross platform advertising  payperclick ppc is a model of internet marketing in which advertisers pay a fee each time one of their ads is clicked one of the most popular forms of ppc search engine advertising allows advertisers to bid for ad placement in a search engine’s sponsored links when someone searches on a keyword that is related to their business offering cross platform advertising in this case is extending advertising and marketing efforts to mobile devices for inclusion in ‘inapp’ advertising by utilizing both of these approaches we can once again make an effort to keep customer acquisition cost lower by a only paying for actual ‘clicks’ instead of impressions and b placing our advertising    directly in front of people by placing advertising in apps on mobile devices   trade shows and industry gatherings  by attending industry trade shows and industry gatherings we will be able to showcase our portfolio of mobile applications and mobile gaming applications to our peers in the technology and gaming industries as well as raise awareness for future business to business bb partnerships bb partnerships will offer opportunities for both new and existing companies in our industry to develop new products that will integrate seamlessly with our software platform partnerships such as these and others will offer our company even greater visibility to customers     competition   our primary industry competitors include digital chocolate electronic arts ea mobile gameloft handson mobile iplay namco and thq with electronic arts having the largest market share of any company in the mobile games market in the future likely competitors include major media companies traditional video game publishers content aggregators mobile software providers and independent mobile game publishers wireless carriers may also decide to develop internally or through a managed thirdparty developer and distribute their own mobile games if carriers enter the mobile game market as publishers they might refuse to distribute some or all of our games or might deny us access to all or part of their networks   the development distribution and sale of mobile games is a highly competitive business for end users we compete primarily on the basis of brand game quality and price for carriers we compete for deck placement based on these factors as well as historical performance and perception of sales potential and relationships with licensors of brands and other intellectual property for content and brand licensors we compete based on royalty and other economic terms perceptions of development quality porting abilities speed of execution distribution breadth and relationships with carriers we also compete for experienced and talented employees   some of our competitors’ and our potential competitors’ advantages over us either globally or in particular geographic markets include the following   • significantly greater revenues and financial resources   • stronger brand and consumer recognition regionally or worldwide   • the capacity to leverage their marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of mobile and nonmobile products   • more substantial intellectual property of their own from which they can develop games without having to pay royalties   • preexisting relationships with brand owners or carriers that afford them access to intellectual property while blocking the access of competitors to that same intellectual property   • greater resources to make acquisitions   • lower labor and development costs and   • broader global distribution and presence   further our capital resources limit the number of games that we can develop and market and any inability to predict successfully the appropriate level of marketing investment in each game could result in lower earnings than we anticipate      research  development   red fish holdings is not currently engaged in any research development of the apps beyond what is currently available in our portfolio will commence in the coming months   intellectual property   the company itself does not hold any intellectual property besides for the use of its trade name   government regulation   we do not believe we will require any government approval to sell our products however our services are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws within various jurisdictions throughout the world and regulations prohibiting unfair and deceptive trade practices these consumer protection laws could result in substantial compliance costs and could interfere with the conduct of our business   employees   we have one employee our chief executive officer tom mahoney mr mahoney spends at least  hours a month on the affairs of the company we will hire necessary personnel based on an asneeded basis only and on a percontract basis to be compensated directly from revenues    legal proceedings   we know of no existing or pending legal proceedings against us nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any proceeding or pending litigation there are no proceedings in which any of our directors officers or any of their respective affiliates or any beneficial stockholder is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our interest   properties   our

more than three  directors each director of the company serves until his successor is elected and qualified subject to removal by the company’s majority shareholders each officer shall hold their offices for such terms and shall exercise such powers and perform such duties as shall be determined by the board of directors and shall hold his office until his successor is elected and qualified or until his earlier resignation or removal   potential conflicts of interest since we do not have an audit or compensation committee comprised of independent directors the functions that would have been performed by such committees are performed by our directors thus there is a potential conflict of interest in that our directors and officers have the authority to determine issues concerning management compensation and audit issues that may affect management decisions we are not aware of any other conflicts of interest with any of our executives or directors director independence our board of directors has undertaken a review of the independence of each director and considered whether any director has a material relationship with us that could compromise his ability to exercise independent judgment in carrying out his responsibilities as a result of this review our board of directors determined that our directors do not meet the independence requirements according to the applicable rules and regulations of the sec corporate governance there have been no changes in any state law or other procedures by which security holders may recommend nominees to our board of directors in addition to having no nominating committee for that purpose we currently have no specific audit committee and no audit committee financial expert based on the fact that our current business affairs are simple any such committees are excessive and beyond the scope of our business and needs family relationships none involvement in certain legal proceedings   no officer director or

corporate planned objectives   we do not have any standard arrangements by which directors are compensated for any services provided as a director no cash has been paid to the directors in their capacity as such   security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management   the following tables set forth the ownership as of the date of this prospectus of our common stock by each person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than  of our outstanding common stock our directors and our executive officers and directors as a group to the best of our knowledge the persons named have sole voting and investment power with respect to such shares except as otherwise noted there are not any pending or anticipated arrangements that may cause a change in control   the information presented below regarding beneficial ownership of our voting securities has been presented in accordance with the rules of the securities and exchange commission and is not necessarily indicative of ownership for any other purpose under these rules a person is deemed to be a beneficial owner of a security if that person has or shares the power to vote or direct the voting of the security or the

power within  days through the conversion or exercise of any convertible security warrant option or other right more than one person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the same securities the percentage of beneficial ownership by any person as of a particular date is calculated by dividing the number of shares beneficially owned by such person which includes the number of shares as to which such person has the right to acquire voting or investment power within  days by the sum of the number of shares outstanding as of such date plus the number of shares as to which such person has the right to acquire voting or investment power within  days consequently the denominator used for calculating such percentage may be different for each beneficial owner except as otherwise indicated

not completed an assessment nor have our auditors tested our systems of internal controls   because it will take time management involvement and perhaps outside resources to determine what internal control improvements are necessary for us to meet regulatory requirements and market expectations for our operations we may incur significant expense in meeting our public reporting responsibilities particularly in the areas of designing enhancing or remediating internal and disclosure controls doing so effectively may also take longer than we expect thus increasing our exposure to financial fraud or erroneous financing reporting   once our management’s report on internal controls is complete we will retain our independent auditors to audit and render an opinion on such report when required under section  of the sarbanesoxley act the independent auditors may identify additional issues concerning our operations while performing their audit of internal control over financial reporting   development stage and capital resources   since its inception the company has devoted substantially all of its efforts to business planning research and development recruiting management and staff and raising capital accordingly the company is considered to be in the development stage the company has generated no revenues from operations and therefore lacks meaningful capital reserves   we are attempting to raise funds to proceed with our plan of operation to proceed with our operations within  months we need a minimum of  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to sell all the shares required to satisfy our  months financial requirement if we are successful any money raised will be applied to the items set forth in the use of proceeds section of this prospectus we will attempt to raise at least the minimum funds necessary to proceed with our plan of operation   while we have no revenues as of this date no substantial revenues are anticipated until we have completed the financing from this offering and implemented our full plan of operations we must raise cash to implement our strategy to grow and expand per our business plan the minimum amount of the offering will likely allow us to operate for at least one year and have the capital resources required to cover the material costs with becoming a publicly reporting the company anticipates over the next  months the cost of being a reporting public company will be approximately    we are highly dependent upon the success of this offering as described herein therefore the failure thereof would result in the need to seek capital from other resources such as taking loans which would likely not even be possible for the company however if such financing were available because we are a development stage company with no operations to date we would likely have to pay additional costs associated with high risk loans and be subject to an above market interest rate at such time these funds are required management would evaluate the terms of such debt financing if the company cannot raise additional proceeds via a private placement of its equity or debt securities or secure a loan the company would be required to cease business operations as a result investors would lose all of their investment   additionally the company will have to meet all the financial disclosure and reporting requirements associated with being a publicly reporting company the company’s management will have to spend additional time on policies and procedures to make sure it is compliant with various regulatory requirements especially that of section  of the    sarbanesoxley act of  this additional corporate governance time required of management could limit the amount of time management has to implement the business plan and may impede the speed of its operations     liquidity   the following table describes our liquidity as of the period ending october       as of october   current ratio  total

against public policy as expressed in the securities act and is therefore unenforceable   in the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action suit or proceeding is asserted by such director officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered the registrant will unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent submit to a court of

company is not required to have nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its internal control over financial reporting our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting accordingly we express no such opinion an audit includes examining on a test basis evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements an audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion in our opinion the financial statements referred to above present fairly in all material respects the financial position of redfish holdings inc as of october   and

received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability as the case may be in an orderly transaction between market participants as such fair value may be based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis whereby inputs used in valuation techniques are assigned a hierarchical level   the following are the hierarchical levels of inputs to measure fair value  level  quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments  level  other significant observable inputs including quoted prices in active markets for similar instruments  level  significant unobservable inputs including
