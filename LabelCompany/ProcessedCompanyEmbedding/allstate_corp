reviewed my insurance and saved me money their staff are friendly and always return my calls and emails quickly i really like working with this agency horrible incompetent fools twice now they have called me in a case of mistaken identity first time was  years or so ago and second time was this week they called me both times telling me i have a life insurance policy that needs updating and i insist that it not me each time they put me through a bunch of crap and in the end after divulging someone elses personal information to me after my insisting that its not my policy dont trust them with your personal information obviously they are open to giving it out to the wrong people i never had any life insurance policy with them i had a auto and renters insurance policy with them and that was about  years ago i canceled my policy with them because they managed to repeatedly screw up my policy by letting other people on my policy who were not the main policy holder go in and make unauthorized changes norvin and his staff were almost impossible to get a hold of they raised my rates and would not fight for me after a accident that was not my fault i asked them how i could get my rates down lower and they had me make changes that made my policy higher when they told me to take the other driver off my policy the other driver was providing me a good driver discount which i lost after removing her upon their advice i miss the days when norvin vogels allstate brokerage was owned by gary hellman gary and his wife knew what they were doing wouldnt recommend i have found vogel and associates to be disconnected lacking attention to detail and patronizing like most people i dont give my insurance a second thought and have wanted to change but it was never a high priority until now i wont go into details except to say that because of how they handled a paperwork issue i was motivated to change agents and have started to shop around for other quotes i am rating norv extremely poor because he is extremely nonresponsive by the way i have never filed a claim so am an ideal customer a copy of my policy is required to go to an additional interested party my policy says that a certificate of insurance has been sent to said party but none seem to be received i recently received an email from norv requesting that i rate him  on an upcoming survey and to contact them if i am not completely satisfied so they can address any concerns i immediately replied to the email that the interested party says they have not received a certificate of insurance and to send me a copy if you did send it no response a few days later i received an email from norv soliciting term life insurance i immediately replied that he hadnt replied to my email no response then i called

    w el camino realsunnyvale ca    i would like to thank this agency for pointing me in the right direction after a disastrous experience with another agency specifically alicia hamilton who searched and found me an agent who could help me continue my coverage even though her agency couldnt help me its rare to find a company that will help you when there is nothing in it for them she truly understood my needs and went out of her way to help me i would recommend this agency to anyone looking for insurance high rates unresponsive heidi is horrible she is nice to you when shes selling you a policy as i wanted to get umbrella policy coverage shes terrible not at all helpful and insulting when you are asking a lot of questions to understand impact of an accident on your auto policy raymond is no different when i asked to be assigned to a different member of his staff to get a quote did not not get a response i decided to move to a different agent in terms of rate my auto policy went down and even got some refund on my condo after my policy was moved to the different agent theres a lot of allstate agents in the area highly recommend to go work with those agency and avoid raymond and his team finally had enough of the high rates arbitrary changes and minimal contact hours i found them to be minimally responsive and not friendly when making changes to the policy like adding or removing a car but then when they made the change they also made very arbitrary changes to the quote for instance we dropped a car which was the highest car on the policy and found the price was still about the same they just made arbitrary changes to the other cars to make up for the dropped car dropping the expensive sports car entirely didnt lower our bill even in between bills arbitrary changes are made but mysteriously it always ends up at about the same amount we had two bills a few months apart because we added two new cars in between the two bills the amount for one car went down with no explanation by  and the amount for the other car went up with no explanation but  i got fed up and decided to call aaa where we are already a member aaa gave an excellent price allstates price is  higher for less coverage but the thing that annoys me the most is the arbitrary changes so that they always get the same amount no matter what oh and another thing the new aaa agent answered the call at  pm answering machine at barri at  pm and then told me to call him as late as  pm bye bye allstate hello aaa i have been with allstate for a long time i generally call them for payment purpose and have been a good customer to them but when i called them to inform them about removing a car from policy they informed that they will prorate the amount and return me the rest of the policy money for the car they promised they will follow up with an email which never happened its always that case with this agency finally i called again and i was informed that they will pay me some amount of money because my insurance increased to the other vehicles in that policy i had to finally call them to cancel my policy i went to get a quote from another insurance and its way to less than allstate finally i wanted to talk to the management and i did not get any call from them thats it  good bye allstate for the mayhem you had created worst ever raise the rates and deny it even though you have the bill tried to charge me  for two months when i didnt have a car i was late paying my brother died suddenly  i still refused to pay that   they sent me to collections  without that illegal  terrible service never call back lose emails forget to call  blame you every time went to another agency got better coverage and way better rates do yourself a favor and go to a more professional and cheaper company these people be nice as can be for your first checkand worst as can be after that wanted to recommend the allstate barri agency in sunnyvale they are incredibly responsive thank you alicia for going in to office on a rainy saturday to create a new pdf of policy for new car addition documentation is timely and helpful and they are always good about reviewing your policy and discussing options have had aaa state farm and others in the past  this allstate team is really good still with this terrible insurance agency they dont pick up their phone dont quote

money sent to clients who put in a claim mckinsey specializes in redesigning product delivery systems for fortune  companies including controversial clients such as enron to maximize profits mckinsey’s recommendation to allstate according to berardinelli was to lowball claims so that desperate customers in dire straits would be more likely to accept a settlement offer while allstate continued to make a profit and collect interest on the insurance payment allstate would offer its good hands in the way of a lowball claim and if the customer did not accept to get out boxing gloves

in a claim mckinsey specializes in redesigning product delivery systems for fortune  companies including controversial clients such as enron to maximize profits mckinsey’s recommendation to allstate according to berardinelli was to lowball claims so that desperate customers in dire straits would be more likely to accept a settlement offer while allstate continued to make a profit and collect interest on the insurance payment allstate would offer its good hands in the way of a lowball claim and if the customer did not accept to get out boxing gloves  the book was reviewed by business week magazine according to that article allstate responded to berardinellis allegations by claiming that berardinellis allegations were unfounded and unproven rather than trying to cheat customers the company stated that its major goal was to benefit policyholders by identifying exaggerated and fraudulent claims and that its processes are absolutely sound    to investigate evaluate and promptly resolve each claim fairly based on the merits court decisions on the issues debated by berardinelli and allstate have gone both ways according to the business week article as of  courts and regulators

according to berardinelli was to lowball claims so that desperate customers in dire straits would be more likely to accept a settlement offer while allstate continued to make a profit and collect interest on the insurance payment allstate would offer its good hands in the way of a lowball claim and if the customer did not accept to get out boxing gloves  the book was reviewed by business week
