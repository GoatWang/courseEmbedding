sidelights susan whiting serves as chief executive officer and chair of nielsen media research a multifaceted company best known as the influential compiler of television ratings statistics described as televisions chief umpire by usa today media reporter david lieberman whiting has been with the company since she entered the workforce after college i was just extraordinarily fortunate to end up in a company in that first job where there was a nice connection between what i wanted to do and what they needed me to do she said of her longevity at nielsen in an interview with linda moss for multichannel news  whiting was born in chicago in  and grew up in wisconsin where her father owned an air courier business we had an airstrip and two planes in our backyard she told steve mcclellan in broadcasting  cable  which were useful when her father later founded a cropdusting equipment manufacturing company at denison university in granville ohio she studied economics and soon after her  graduation began her career with the ac nielsen company of chicago as a management trainee nielsen was a familyowned company at the time founded in  by arthur c nielsen as a consumerresearch organization it ventured into television ratings in the earliest years of the medium tracking viewers watching habits as a way to gauge the potential market for advertisers over the years the company became the de facto leader in calculating ratings for the television networks and their programming whiting began at nielsen just as the company was venturing into the measurement of cabletelevision audiences in 0 she joined its new business development unit and was heading that department within a few years she advanced to the position of vice president and marketing manager with nielsen home video index in  and then became senior vice president and director of marketing for it in  in  the ac nielsen company spun off its nielsen media research into a standalone entity and a year later whiting was appointed general manager of its national services and emerging markets at nielsen media research she became president and chief operating officer of nielsen media research in 00 and a year later rose to the top job at the company that of chief executive officer by this point both nielsen media research and the nielsen company itself were a subsidiaries of vnu a dutch holding company for various media properties nielsen media research based in new york city is one of the most influential companies in the entertainment business serving as the gatekeeper to an estimated  billion business in advertising revenues for the broadcast and cable networks nielsen tallies television audiences via diaries issued to a sampling of us households and also uses an array of electronicmeasurement devices nielsen ratings—technically known as audience estimates—calculate how many americans are watching a television show and the fortunes of entire networks rise and fall depending on the numbers they are a significant factor in revenue for the networks since ratings numbers dictate how much a network can charge for advertising time originally the nielsen families submitted forms filled out by viewers four times a year and those periods became known as the sweeps weeks in the late 0s the company began installing people meters on television sets of nielsen households which transmitted viewing habits back to headquarters for tallying this was combined with a handheld device a portable people meter which determined what individual household members were watching the overnights or morningafter tallies of viewers for television episodes are often the first documents of the day that television executives examine sometimes as soon as they rise out of bed in  whiting became president and chief executive officer of vnus media measurement and information but a year later a group of private investors bought vnu and the entire property became known as the nielsen company once again whitings title after that was executive vice president of the nielsen company and chair of nielsen media research after january of  her realm includes all divisions that monitor television audiences internet usage featurefilm boxoffice receipts and sales of recorded music and books she described her job to lieberman in usa today as a combination of trying to lead a company in change in an industry in change its much more complicated than people think asked about nielsens future direction she mentioned its project apollo which would track what media were you exposed to and therefore what products you bought in an interview with coco masters in time  this would be gauged when people scan all their product purchases and also have a portable people meter that keeps track of what media theyre exposed to whiting has spent her entire career with the same company making her one of the rare twentyfirst century corporate titans with such an endurance record she credited her rise to the help of some wise mentors over the years one of the pieces of advice i got was to make sure that whomever you are working for actually knows what youve accomplished she said in the interview with usa today s lieberman dont assume that they know or that the people above them know but youve got to do that in a way that youre comfortable with im not a very inyourface kind of person she described her own management style as an individualoriented approach i like to talk to people to get a lot of information process it and come out with a position she told lieberman i like to think you can be smart and nice sources periodicals broadcasting  cable  september  00 p  may   p  multichannel news  january  00 p b new york times  june   time  february   p a usa today
