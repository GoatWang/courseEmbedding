that through this beautiful book the vision we shared can spread further for as whitehead’s gabriel puts it to panthera ‘your son in galilee is magical’ surely he remains so to this day” —james tabor from the introduction   through a series of dramatic monologues spoken by mary the angel gabriel paul of tarsus and the “sidonian archer” tiberius julius abdes pantera the fourteen poems gathered here give life to the jewishapocryphal legend of “jesus son of pantera”—the story that jesus was sired by a roman soldier having learned of a tomb unearthed in germany bearing the soldier’s name whitehead spent the last years of his life researching and writing about this fascinating controversial tradition in his introduction to the collection renowned biblical scholar james tabor recounts the scriptural apocryphal and archaeological evidence upon which the story is based about the contributors michael burns is emeritus professor of english at missouri state university where he taught creative writing and the author of a number of books including the poetry collection it will be all right in the morning   james tabor is chair of the department of religious studies at the university
