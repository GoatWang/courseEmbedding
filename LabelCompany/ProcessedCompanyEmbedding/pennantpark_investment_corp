approach our approach pennantpark is an industry leading credit platform focused on providing creative and flexible capital solutions to the middle market pennantpark seeks to be a longterm trusted partner to its investors and the companies in which it invests pennantpark’s focus on capital preservation reflects its core belief that effective middlemarket lending provides a superior riskreward opportunity the firm has a valueoriented patient bottomsup investment philosophy and takes a partnership approach with proactive ongoing portfolio reviews and conservative riskmanagement throughout the investment process investment strategy our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments portfolios are comprised of investments in senior secured loans subordinated debt and equity in middle market companies we employ a disciplined approach in selecting investments that meet our longstanding consistent and valueoriented investment criteria our valueoriented investment philosophy focuses on preserving capital and ensuring that investments have an appropriate return profile in relation to risk when market conditions make it difficult for us to invest according to these criteria we are highly selective in deploying capital we believe this approach has and will continue to enable us to build attractive investment portfolios that meet our return and value criteria over the longterm we also invest in equity securities such as preferred stock common stock warrants or options  primarily those received in connection with our debt investments we expect that investments in senior secured loans mezzanine debt and other investments will range between  million and  million each although this investment size will vary proportionately with the size of our capital base we believe it is critical to conduct extensive due diligence on investment targets in evaluating new investments we conduct a rigorous due diligence process that draws from our investment adviser’s experience industry expertise and network of contacts among other things our due diligence is designed to ensure that each prospective
