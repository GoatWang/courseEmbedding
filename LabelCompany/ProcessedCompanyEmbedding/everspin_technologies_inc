nvsram  everspin skip to main content toggle navigation home products mram replaces nvsram mram replaces nvsram why replace a nonvolatile sram with mram every write with an mram is instantly nonvolatile for at least  years there is no transfer of data from a volatile to a nonvolatile memory cell no external capacitors or back up batteries the elimination of external components highly reliable data retention and ns sram compatible readwrite access times make the everspin mram a viable candidate for increasing system memory density without major pcb changes while reducing system cost without compromising system performance nvsram nonvolatile sram nvsram is an sram memory that is made up of two functional components paired in the same physical cell one component is a standard sram memory cell and the other component is a nonvolatile cell that acts as a backup to the sram cell data are transferred to and from the nonvolatile cell by store and recall commands data are protected during power loss by using either an external capacitor or an external battery to power a store command magnetoresistive ram mram magnetoresistive ram is inherently nonvolatile with unlimited endurance for stored data even when power is lost immediate ns poweroff with no loss of data always nonvolatile no unreliable capacitordependent backup cycles no vcap or vbatt required no complex software storerecall routines year data retention with no cycling dependence fewer components mean a smaller design footprint and lower total bom cost no wearout concerns in many cases
