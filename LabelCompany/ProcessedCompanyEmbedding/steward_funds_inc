ownership in companies that choose to be in the business of or are predominantly known for the manufacture of pornography abortion products andor services alcoholic beverages tobacco products and the increasingly popular business of gambling as such the funds have engaged steward fund consulting sfc to actively research the products and policies of public companies to protect the funds shareholders from unwittingly owning them through the steward fund group in the course of sfcs research operations sfc focuses entirely on identifying companies that the funds may not invest in a socalled avoidance screening methodology the funds do not engage in the practices of choosing companies to invest in for the purposes of promoting any kind of social policy this practice known as positive screening is often done in order to make a statement the fund believes that its role is one of upholding the beliefs of the funds shareholders while maximizing shareholder return and value and not to set social policy throughout the past year we have witnessed an increasing number of public companies involved in the businesses of gambling and alcohol we have also witnessed a small but concerning pattern of an increasing number of public companies deciding to participate in the destructive business of pornography sfc will remain diligent in the coming months to protect your interests from these companies we thank you for your investment sincerely s scott fehrenbacher scott fehrenbacher president photo of scott fehrenbacher steward fund consulting

performance for the six months ended october   the volatility in energy prices increased during the period as hurricane katrina wreaked havoc on the gulf coast and damaged the oil infrastructure in the area this was followed by hurricane rita which also impacted the gulf region with a second wave of destruction and delayed restoration efforts that were underway the us economy has remained resilient despite oil prices exceeding  a barrel corporate earnings as measured by the sp  is expected to post a substantial  gain for the third quarter of  payrolls have remained strong despite the loss of jobs from the hurricane affected regions with unemployment at a modest  while inflation has been benign the recent spikes in energy prices will eventually filter through and create some pricing pressure in the near term the federal reserve has now increased rates as measured by fed funds to  continuing their goal of achieving a neutral interest rate environment the third quarter gdp report was stronger than expected at  indicating the economy is still growing at a healthy rate performance the steward allcap equity fund returned  for the six months ended october   outperforming its benchmark the sp composite  index which gained  for the same period the individual sp index component returns were  for the sp   for the sp midcap  and  for the sp smallcap  the funds overweighting in the sp midcap  and smallcap  relative to the sp composite  contributed to the higher performance performance is also affected by the valuesbased investment policies of the fund which avoids investing in companies whose primary business is associated with alcohol tobacco products abortion gambling and pornography for the six month period ending october   the overall affect of the restricted securities on the fund were minimal the two largest capitalization restricted securities pfizer inc and altria group inc illustrate the point as their returns for the period offset  vs  outlook the resilience of the us economy from the hurricane destruction and the subsequent spike in energy prices bodes well looking forward reconstruction activity from hurricane katrina should provide additional gdp growth over the coming year the federal reserve appears to be well positioned to combat inflation should pricing pressure begin to increase energy is still a variable however as high prices reduce discretionary consumer spending and places a drag on economic growth as production in the gulf region comes back on line we should see prices stabilize and trend lower from current

reserve bank board policymakers continued to raise their shortterm interest rate target in steady increments over the past six months as a result the federal funds rate has increased from  to  on november st other shortterm interest rates rose in tandem during this period but not as dramatically the surprising effect of federal reserve policy is that it has had a diminished influence over the yield curve as the tenyear and thirtyyear rates have remained practically unchanged since there was little if any price change to these securities since april  total returns were resigned to the interest accruals and coupon reinvestments in intermediate and longer dated issues and little if any additional total returns from the remainder of shorterterm securities the flattening of the yield curve a condition where all us treasury maturities adjust to similar market yields is a difficult market environment for fixed income investors to execute traditional valueadding strategies because the normally present incentive to invest for longer periods has dissipated driving the narrowing of yield relationships is a fundamental quandary for economic policymakers in the current environment market participants are torn as is the federal reserve board as to how many more rate increases will be deemed necessary to successfully control price inflation possibly further flattening the yield curve or if interest rates have already been pushed to the point where economic activity has been thwarted and rates will stabilize possibly even be reduced in the near future performance the steward select bond fund produced a  return during the sixmonth period ended october   the funds performance is in line with the morningstar category average for funds with similar characteristics and sector allocation which produced  for the morningstar category for the same period the funds market benchmark the lehman aggregate earned a  over the same period the reason for the similarity in return between the fund and its benchmark lies in the structure of the portfolio the portfolio characteristics during the period were similar to that of the benchmark outlook we believe that the key to providing longterm high current income with capital appreciation in fixed income portfolios in rising rate environments is to control interest market price risk and simultaneously maximize internal cash flows that can be compounded in turn at higher yields to this end the funds managers have sold traditional semiannual couponpaying bonds and invested in two alternative types of securities market yields have been increased without additional maturity extension through the purchase of callable and stepup securities that will increase their coupons if rates continue to rise in addition the fund has purchased floating rate securities that change stated interest rates and pay monthly based on current rates of price inflation as long as the federal reserve board remains committed to raising interest rates we will continue to search for these types of defensive investments when the federal reserve board signals that their policy will change we will cease this strategy and become more aggressive toward future investments in terms of duration and yield curve selections past performance does not guarantee future results the performance data quoted represents past performance and

lp ark asset management co inc jacobs levy equity management inc lord abbett  company and mfs investment management inc money managers in response to requests from counsel camco and frimco had provided to the directors in advance of the meeting information deemed reasonably necessary to assist the directors in their review of the agreements with camco and frimco and the portfolio management contracts with the money managers the directors had also reviewed a memorandum from counsel discussing their responsibilities in reviewing investment advisory agreements in considering the continuation of the investment advisory agreement with camco the directors noted that steward domestic allcap equity fund and steward select bond fund had been in operation only since october   they noted based on the information provided to them and their experience with these funds since their inception october   that the operation and growth of each fund had been as expected and that camcos services to each fund were fully satisfactory they determined that investment advisory and administration fee rates for the funds were low relative to fees for similar services paid by funds deemed to be comparable peer funds they noted that each funds expense ratio was low relative to that of the peer funds they also noted that the investment advisory fee rate for each fund as well as fees paid to camco for administrative services would decline as each fund reached higher asset levels and that these declines should provide each fund with the benefit of potential economies of scale at higher asset levels they reviewed camcos soft dollar arrangements and other sources of compensation to camco and its affiliates including payments under the funds service and distribution plans which were in line with plans of peer funds they also reviewed camcos financial statements based on their review the directors concluded that the information they had reviewed suggested that in the short period of the funds operations camcos profitability with respect to each fund was reasonable although they would continue to monitor this issue as the funds matured they also concluded that the fees paid by each fund to camco for investment advisory services continued to be fair and reasonable and in the best interests of shareholders of each fund information relevant to the boards deliberations regarding the agreements with frimco and the money managers was presented to the board in advance of and discussed with counsel at its meetings held may   and november   as well as at the march

of operation as a managerofmanagers acting pursuant to exemptive relief from the securities and exchange commission the board had also approved mme funds participation in the filing of a revised exemptive application that would make this relief available for mme fund the relief when obtained would permit frimco to retain and replace money managers that are unaffiliated with frimco and to make
