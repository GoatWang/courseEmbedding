to the terms of use and the privacy policy karaboutis has been in it for most of her  years in work in her current role she is involved in the transition of dell from a pc supplier to a servicesled organisation she says in the past twoandahalf years dell has made over  acquisitions where we have moved from a traditional computer company to an endtoend solutions business in april during its annual analyst event ceo michael dell and the computer firm’s senior executive team presented dell as a “solutions business” this shift has put a huge strain on the companys it and represents a lesson in how it must adapt as the business evolves in fact from a nonit industry perspective the shift in focus at dell could apply to any company moving to expand from a productcentric business to valuebased services how dell it has changed dell once had what was considered the worlds best supply chain system management consultancy mckinsey once pointed to dell’s supply chain management software as a shining example of business transformation  karaboutis says we had a wonderful set of systems that supported our ‘configure to order’ business process we were able to fulfil exactly what our customer wanted when they wanted it and to the specifications they ordered dell has been the top supply chain company in the world but as dell has now evolved to a services business she said we are now challenged to build processes and systems that support solutions selling this has involved changes to dells erp systems when dell only sold hardware the products could be assigned an asset tag or sku stock taking unit  so the it systems could do a very good job of running the order processing build and fulfilment processes for anything with an asset tag  but when you turn into a company that is selling software as a service services subscription billing with digital entitlements and digital fulfilment these are a whole new set of capabilities that dont have a sku or an asset tag karaboutis says to support the changes dell has established a business architecture virtual team across business units to provide a blueprint of the changes that need to occur from an organisational process and technology perspective the companys vice chairman geoff clarke and cfo brian gladden sponsor the project it is an integral part of this team it is no longer the case that the business defines and it executes” karaboutis says in fact her thinking is very much in line with that of analyst firm forrester  which speaks about  “business technology” rather than “businessit alignment” according to karaboutis with consumerisation and the plethora of data many companies are becoming a solutions company listen to podcast internships and reverse mentoring like many businesses dell takes on interns each year in it the interns are assigned a set of objectives they have to deliver during their internship however unlike traditional intern programmes karaboutis says we set up such that the interns are actually mentoring the leadership team this socalled reverse mentoring  as used in the car industry  means that the interns provide insights to the it management team that it would normally not consider for instance she says they may provide insight on things we dont even think about like some small nuances on usability on a device the generation ys have grown up with the technology from an it perspective our interns are a great source of knowledge she says the interns help her it team understand how young people think the value system of young people is very interesting they would rather have a great device and freedom to move around youtube and facebook go out to social media sites and access company systems than extra pay they have been instrumental in helping us define our mobile strategy”  examples of the ideas that the interns have brought to dell have ranged from suggested improvements to the helpdesk to using social media to gather information during the working day “they ask why should i have to do  clicks to submit a helpdesk ticket” use of social media is another area where interns are influencing the normal approach to it at dell the company uses chatter internally as its enterprise social media platform from an it perspective karaboutis says chatter complements system monitoring tools  “chatter gives you pathological data i can get system metrics from system management tools that show my systems are up  of the time while on a chatter site people are saying it is slow” women in it it is no longer the case that the business defines and it executes adriana karaboutis global cio dell prior to her role in dell karaboutis worked at general motors and ford a selfconfessed “essex girl” for a brief period in her career she was even stationed at ford’s dagenham plant given her long career in it starting as an analystprogrammer to global cio computer weekly asked about the challenges of being a woman in it she says “it still is a tougher environment overall for women only  of cios overall are women” the problem stems from the fact that girls and young women are not encouraged to go into technology and often they appear to be intimidated by maths and science she says but she says  of fortune  cios are women “a lot of companies are trying to come to together to encourage girls and young women to enter the technology field and stay in technology we are a company that hugely supports women in technology” cw features enjoy the benefits of cw membership learn more and join ezine airbus helps secure critical

your network dell cio adriana andi karaboutis is channeling steve jobs these days in a manner of speaking as a cio ive stopped asking people what they want karaboutis told an audience of her peers during an mit sloan cio symposium panel discussion in jobs famous quote the rationale for not asking customers what they want was that by the time a company builds the product customers will want something new for dell it anticipating what internal employees want next rather than giving them what they ask for now has led to a new way of working instead of asking business folks for requirements karaboutis insists her staff observe observe observe their job is to actually spend time with internal business people to see how they work where they run into roadblocks and how it can help we stop asking and start thinking  and start futuring karaboutis said defining furturing by quoting another entrepreneur with a golden touch henry ford if i had asked people what they wanted they would have said faster horses in addition to being close observers karaboutis wants her it team to imagine the future  and surprise and delight the business that means surprising both internal customers and external customers and it is happening by working closely with the business it helped develop dells quick resource locator application which turns smartphones into qr code scanners and will also be useful to dells external customers developing a workforce that observes and invents doesnt happen overnight and as she explained to searchcios nicole laskowski in this postmit panel video interview its something karaboutis works on every day i want to go back to the qr code example just briefly how did you make the connection that the external customer would be interested in the same product that youve developed for internal use adriana andi karaboutis we do a lot of day in the life exercises we ask but then we just also observe how our customers are doing work and we think okay that shouldnt take that long or this process  weve got a better way to do it why are they doing it that way we come back with a better solution our customers didnt know that they needed and we do that internally for our dell employees as well as externally for our customers during your panel discussion i think you referred to that as futuring  or wondering what the world would look like if … karaboutis exactly yes benchmarking is looking at what everybody else is doing futuring isnt trying to predict the future futuring is trying to develop a what if you know there was a world where… and you sort of shape that thats what we call futuring was that a difficult thing to institute with it karaboutis were still instituting nicole so the answer to that would be yes it is because again traditional it was a mindset of lets go to the business and find out what they need we asked them to prioritize then we asked them for a requirements document what do you need et cetera we did away with the it steering committee as i said on stage and we built the business architecture team now we talk about how the input is the strategy of the company where we want to go and we talk about how to get there and so were prioritizing and doing tools of engagement as they say in the industry and also the applications needed for the capability of the company but the mindset of dont keep asking we have an opinion we know technology better we stay on top put some ideas out there imagine a world where… do incubations and put them out there those are the things that have turned into surprises and delights for our customers who sits on the business architecture team karaboutis its cochaired by myself and another representative out of the vice chairmans office and we have a representative from each of our four business units our enterprise our clients service and software business units as well as our functional areas  finance hr legal marketing sales et cetera so youve got representation but its the entire company per se through that constituent team coming together and developing the blueprint to drive the strategy and who pushed for that business architecture group

a cio only sees them as a roadblock or hassle then chances are the cio and possibly the steering committee dont understand their role without integration of it and business strategy it will always struggle in adding value and will generally be one step behind where they should be in terms of enabling the business to achieve competitive and strategic objectives add my comment cancel    aryan
