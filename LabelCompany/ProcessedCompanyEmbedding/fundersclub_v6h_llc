are still on paper by eric newcomer ericnewcomer more stories by eric newcomer march    am edt grocery shopping bags belonging to instacart a startup backed by fundersclub photographer patrick t fallonbloomberg via getty images the  jobs act let regular americans invest in startups spawning a glut of crowdfunding sites offering real ownership stakes in return for cash rather than the new smartwatches or electric skateboards available on pioneering platform kickstarterone of these equity crowdfunding firms fundersclub inc says its beating most of the pros in its first three years returns outpaced the median venture capital fund and much of the industrys top quartile of investors according to data provided by the company citing cambridge associates which measures vc performance for pension funds and other institutional investorsfundersclubs net multiple  investor returns after the companys cut  is  from its  investments  from the 0 vintage and  for  the median vc firms net multiple for the same vintages were   and  respectively according to the data from fundersclub and cambridge associates we started in  and at that time a lot of what we were doing was considered novel said alex mittal fundersclubs chief executive officer since then the idea of startup investing on the internet is less novel but what has shockingly remained the case is this pretty high level of disinterest or lack of care for returnsthere are caveats most of fundersclubs returns are tied to the private valuations of the startups that it has backed fundersclub sometimes holds startup investments at lower valuations than their last fundraising round but it has still benefited from frothy paper valuations of the 0 million thats been invested through fundersclub only  million has been realized  and some of that came in the form of more stock when portfolio companies were acquired by larger highflying startups like slack technologies incthey have better paper returns than other folks  if the asset class resets a bit theyd be hurt less youd imagine said anand sanwal ceo of vc data firm cb insights weve been in this period of very frothy valuation increases so we have to see if these companies can exit at these valuations and we havent seen that for a while exclusive insights on technology around the world get fully charged from bloomberg technology sign up fundersclubs investments include the grocery delivery company instacart inc now valued at  billion logistics company flexport inc the bitcoin company coinbase inc and tshirt ecommerce site teespring llc bloomberg beta the vc arm of bloomberg lp is an investor in slack and flexportthe site has a network of technology executives founders and other wealthy individuals who invest at least 0 per company thats less than the standard earlystage startup investment minimum for individuals of about 0 the smaller check size opens up startup investing to more people although fundersclub still requires investors to meet certain income or wealth requirements indeed it dislikes the term equity crowdfunding preferring to call itself an online venture capital firm angellist llc another equity crowdfunding site takes a different approach the firm helps individual angel investors raise money creating what it calls syndicates and it also helps people invest in startups directly angellist says unrealized returns from its 0 syndicates are   million has been invested in 0 startups since its founding equity crowdfunding hasnt become a booming business yet some members of congress have floated passing legislation to let people become accredited investors on the basis of their financial knowhow not just their wealth or income thats something mittal believes could drive more people to startup investing there is still mostly a focus on accredited investors so that hasnt brought in momandpop folks  which might be a good thing sanwal said i dont think this has become this capitalmarkets sensation folks were
