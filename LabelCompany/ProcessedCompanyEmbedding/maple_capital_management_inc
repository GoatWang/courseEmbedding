maple capital management skip navigation maple capital management effectively managing client assets investment philosophy maple capital believes the key to effectively managing client assets is to first gain a thorough understanding of the client’s goals and objectives once this framework has been established we construct a portfolio designed to meet these goals while also minimizing risk core equity philosophy we believe that the key to superior investment returns is to invest in companies with high quality products  services strong cash flows solid balance sheets and sustainable competitive advantages recognizing that great companies are not always great investments we seek to avoid this pitfall by rigorously modeling the prices we pay for securities we believe that our fundamental research and strict valuation discipline can consistently and repeatedly identify attractive investment opportunities the companies we invest in tend to have the following characteristics attractive longterm growth prospects sustainable competitive position or high barriers to entry stable high quality cash flow and earnings consistently high or increasing returns on equity and capital low risk high quality balance sheets fixed income philosophy we utilize a consistent research process to identify fixed income investment opportunities suited to client goals and objectives our process combines our top down views on the economy and the direction of interest rates with fundamental security analysis we believe active bond management can capture additional yield through minor differences in bond maturity priority or ratings active management is also a primary tool for portfolio risk control strategies  maple capital management skip navigation maple capital management
