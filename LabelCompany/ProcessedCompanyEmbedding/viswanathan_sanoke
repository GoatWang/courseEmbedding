preview academic journal article the mckinsey quarterly indias pharma challenge by adarkar ashwin krishnan sankar viswanathan sanoke read preview article excerpt indias drug companies will soon have to compete against global onesby global rules the problems and opportunities facing midsize pharmaceutical companies in the developed world are similar to those that will soon face indias leading drug makers historically these indian companies have concentrated on reverse engineering patented drugs and selling them locally for  to  percent of what they cost elsewhere this strategy is unsustainable for impending regulatory and demographic changes are making the indian market more similar to global markets thus forcing indian companies to compete against global ones according to global rules indian companies must either identify arenas in which they can compete successfully with the large multinationals or develop new models of collaboration significant changes are expected in the indian market over the next five years first in signing the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt the indian government agreed to adopt worldwide patent standards by  despite industry expectations the impact on prices is likely to be limited since only drugs patented in the west after january 99 will receive protection and they are likely to constitute less than 0 percent of the indian

multinationals second rising incomes and a growing number of elderly peoplesustained by advances in hygiene and medicineare driving a shift in the market away from sales of vitamins and antiinfective and gastrointestinal treatments and toward sales of treatments for cardiovascular problems centralnervoussystem disorders and other complex ailments by  cardiovascular and centralnervoussystem treatments which accounted for only  percent of the market in may 999 are expected to account for  percent exhibit this increased convergence of multinational product pipelines and the indian market will inspire multinational pharmaceutical majors most of which have sat on the sidelines to renew their interest in india these market shifts will require indian players to develop new skills and to form new kinds of partnerships since reverse engineering promises little or no growth indian drug makers need their own source of patentable products although taking on the majors may be difficult indian companies could develop their own drugs by focusing on products that would be uneconomical for the multinationals to develop and commercialize any drug with a sales potential of less than  million a year … subscribe today subscribe to questia and enjoy full access to this article and over 0 million more from academic journals magazines and newspapers over  books access to powerful
