each fund or its distributor will contractually require that any other distributor of the funds shares comply with such requirements in connection with the distribution of shares of the new fund  each

section c of the act provides in relevant part that a closedend investment company may not issue or sell any senior security if immediately thereafter the company has outstanding more than one class of senior security applicants state that the creation of multiple classes of shares of the funds may be prohibited by section c as a class may have priority over another class as to payment of dividends because shareholders of different classes would pay different fees and expenses  section i of the act provides that each share of stock issued by a registered management investment company will be a voting stock and have equal voting rights with every other outstanding voting stock applicants state that multiple classes of shares of the funds may violate section i of the act because each class would be entitled to exclusive voting rights with respect to matters solely related to that class  section c of the act provides that the commission may exempt any person security or transaction or any class or classes of persons securities or transactions from any provision of the act or from any rule thereunder if and to the extent such exemption is necessary or appropriate in

sections c and i to permit the funds to issue multiple classes of shares  applicants submit that the proposed allocation of expenses and voting rights among multiple classes is equitable and will not

were an openend investment company deferred sales charge  section c of the act provides in relevant part that no registered closedend investment company will purchase securities of which it is the issuer except a on a securities exchange or other open market b pursuant to tenders after reasonable opportunity to submit tenders given to all holders of securities of the class to be purchased or c under such other circumstances as the commission may permit by rules and regulations or orders for the protection of investors  rule c under the act permits a registered closedend investment company an “interval fund” to make repurchase offers of between five and twentyfive percent of its outstanding shares at net asset value at periodic intervals pursuant to a fundamental policy of the interval fund rule cb under the act provides that an interval fund may deduct from repurchase proceeds only a repurchase fee not to exceed two percent of the proceeds that is paid to the interval fund and is reasonably intended to compensate the fund for expenses directly related to the repurchase  section c provides that the commission may issue an order that would permit a closedend investment company to repurchase its shares in circumstances in which the repurchase is made in a manner or on a basis that does not unfairly discriminate against any holders of the class or classes of securities to be purchased  applicants request relief under sections c discussed above and c from rule c to the extent necessary for the interval funds to impose a deferred sales charge on shares submitted for repurchase that have been held for less than a specified period  applicants state that the deferred sales charge they intend to impose is functionally similar to a cdsc imposed by an openend investment company under rule c under the act rule c permits openend investment companies to impose cdscs subject to certain conditions applicants note that rule c is grounded in policy considerations supporting the employment of cdscs where there are adequate safeguards for the investor and state that the same policy considerations support imposition of deferred sales charges in the interval fund context in addition applicants state that deferred sales charges may be necessary for the distributor to recover distribution costs applicants represent that any deferred sales charge imposed by the interval funds will comply with rule c under the act as if that rule were applicable to closedend investment companies each interval fund will disclose deferred sales charges in accordance with the requirements of form na concerning cdscs applicants further state that each interval fund will apply the deferred sales charge and any waivers or scheduled variations of the deferred start printed

any joint enterprise or joint arrangement in which the investment company participates unless the commission issues an order permitting the transaction in reviewing applications submitted under section d and rule d the commission considers whether the participation of the investment company in a joint enterprise or joint arrangement is consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the act and the extent to which the participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants  rule d under the act provides an exemption from section d and rule d to permit openend investment companies to enter into distribution arrangements pursuant to rule b under the act applicants request an order under section d and rule d under the act to the extent necessary to permit the fund to impose assetbased service andor distribution fees applicants have agreed to comply with rules b and d as if those rules applied to closedend investment companies which they believe will resolve any concerns that might arise in connection with a fund financing the distribution of its shares through assetbased distribution fees  for the reasons stated above applicants submit that the exemptions requested under section c are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and are consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act applicants further submit that the relief requested pursuant to section c is consistent with the protection of investors and insures that applicants do not unfairly discriminate against any holders of the class or classes of securities to be purchased finally applicants submit that the requested relief meets the standards for relief in section d of the act and

privacy accessibility foia no fear act continuity information site feedback little harbor advisors  solutions  composites the little harbor team provides investorfriendly solutions and structures to qualified investors and fund sponsors with a focus on alternative strategies about solutions newsviews contact composites the composite structure used by little harbor has its origin in  the year prior to the financial crisis when institutional investors had begun to feel the potential vulnerabilities of their fundofhedgefund investments which included growing correlations to equity markets layered management fees incentive fee netting risk and lack of holdings transparency the composite structure was developed in response to the flaws little harbor saw in the fundoffunds model that were laid bare in the wake of  seeking to solve for these problems the composite structure offers a clear investment theme the elimination of layered management fees a netted incentive fee based on the return of the aggregate portfolio not on the individual returns of the underlying strategies holdings transparency for little harbor and an additional level of risk oversight composites are organized with an investment and diversification proposition constructed from a limited and carefully selected cohort of complementary managers by building a specific investment thesis with dedicated independent managers little harbor composites avoid overdiversification which may take place in the typical fundofhedgefund structure and maintain the independent discretion of the returndrivers in a particular portfolio unlike most multistrategy complexes we believe both advantages sustain the longterm viability clarity and verification of a composite’s value proposition to its investors also by committing to an investment thesis we believe composites also have a select group of managers whose profiles include a welldefined singlestrategy focus alpha edge natural capacity constraints typically associated with such focus established track records demonstrated risk management and significant principal capital invested in their own strategy little harbor composites are positioned for both institutional and qualified individual highnetworth investors who are seeking portallike access to midsized hedge fund managers in a single investment with a single layer of management fees and performance feenetting across the underlying substrategies little harbor does not interfere with the independent investment programs of the composite’s underlying managers and usually allocates assets in equal percentages between managers in the composite rebalanced on at least a quarterly basis this eliminates the central actor risk arising from market calls by an individual or committee that may adjust asset allocations on an adhoc basis composites bespoke beta management overlay web conferences locations infolittleharboradvisorscom     little harbor advisors llc  all rights reserved
