     total synthetic                rope total sales           steel rope consists of a group of highcarbon steel wire strands helically and symmetrically twisted and “closed” together around a central core steel rope can range from small specialty rope of th of an inch to large mining ropes of up to five inches in diameter we produce both highly engineered specialty products and steel rope suitable for a variety of uses such as drill lines mining ropes cranes mooring lines bridges and logging major applications of these highly engineered products involve mineral mining oil and gas exploration fishing maritime construction and heavy industry eg cranes em cable is a highly engineered customized electrical power and electrical signal transmission cable that is armored with highcarbon steel wire or special metal alloys providing protection for the electrical conductors inside and various mechanical performance properties our em cable product is used in the oil and gas exploration industry and provides a link to the surface from underground instrumentation the cable not only transmits data but also acts as a strength member for the insertion and removal of the geophysical tools used for datalogging and perforating oil and gas wells over the past several years advancements in drilling technology have opened up large shale gas reserves creating a significant shale drilling market for our em cable product synthetic ropes include high tenacity fiber ropes strands braids and strength members made from fibers such as kevlar® dyneema® twaron® technora® all registered trademarks are owned by their respective owners and our own proprietary formulations these products are unique in that they have the strength characteristics of steel rope but weigh significantly less synthetic ropes are primarily used in maritime offshore oil and gas fishing and other industries that require specific operating strength buoyancy when in highmodulus polyethylene corrosion resistance or weight tolerance characteristics beyond wire rope these include mooring lines fishing ropes fishing nets life and winch lines structural and support lines boat rigging power cables and broadcast tower guy cables for certain applications fiber ropes offer attractive physical characteristics compared to steel although fiber has comparative strength features it is known to have greater flexibility and lighter weight which allows submersion to approximately  meters allowing far greater depth reach with virtually no increase in weight synthetic products have become crucial in the offshore oil and gas markets as greater drilling depths have made steel ropes impractical and obsolete due to the weight of the steel rope we have pioneered the development of new products which combine the use of steel wire ropes with highstrength synthetic components that improve the strength to weight ratio in the finished product synthetic yarns products such as tapes yarns and monofilaments are used in a variety of end market applications including flexible intermediate bulk containers horticulture agriculture cables concrete reinforcement synthetic grass geotextiles electrical fencing antiballistics luggage sports products industrialinfrastructure usage and synthetic ropes the company also manufactures synthetic yarns for use in the production of its own
