reciprocity in the marketplace — july  articles  posted by jim clingman july nd  we hear a great deal of discussion about the percentage of money blacks spend with black businesses versus how much we spend with white businesses—and others as well it is said that  of black dollars are spent at nonblack businesses obviously that leaves about  for our businesses what are we getting for that  blacks must drastically change our spending habits andor leverage what we do spend the average annual revenue sales for black owned businesses without employees is  and for those with paid employees it is  both of which are much lower than other socalled “minority groups” a report published by the us small business administration titled “minority business ownership data from the  survey of business owners” by michael mcmanus regulatory economist had this to say about sales disparities “evaluating disparities using perfirm sales average shows the stark difference between minority and nonminority firms it also highlights key variations between minority groups for example blackowned firms average about  in sales per firm while hispanic firms generate two and a half times this amount asianowned firms  times as much and nonminorityowned firms over  times this amount” one can reasonably extrapolate a couple of things from that point black businesses must grow to the point of being able to hire employees and black businesses need a great deal more support—from black consumers as well as other consumers—to reach parity one other point of consideration is the industry in which we choose to start a business the report states “while the number of minorityowned businesses is growing rapidly disproportionate amounts are in the lowest  industries in terms of sales in aggregate almost  of all african americanowned businesses are in the  lowest salesgenerating industries…” finally as i have cited many times of the more than  million black businesses only  have employees do the math and see why we must grow our businesses in order to make them more viable in the marketplace in order to have more of our  trillion flowing through black businesses we must have larger ones in more profitable industries make sense now here’s the rub against us as consumers of black products and services from black entrepreneurs paradoxically while we must have more sustained growth and we must venture into more scalable business ventures many black consumers are buying from other groups and some are even refusing to do business with black firms for one reason or another add that reality to the fact that other groups do not support our businesses to any great degree which could be due in part to the industries we select and black business is stuck on a treadmill expending a lot of energy without moving forward multiplying but never growing top all of this off with the fact that we hold our entrepreneurs to a higher standard than we hold others we want reciprocity from them and we want them to “give back” which is quite reasonable and appropriate however we do not demand the same level of reciprocity from the other businesses that we support virtually every day don’t agree then tell me where is the balance of our  “trillion” annual income when we deduct the  “billion” in annual revenues earned by black businesses not all of which comes from black consumers let’s face it black consumers could never spend all of our  trillion with black owned businesses we do not have enough businesses for that ideal to become a reality we can certainly increase the amount we currently spend but until we establish and grow more businesses which will take at least a generation if we concentrate on it we will continue to spend vast sums of money with businesses other than our own so why are we not seeking reciprocity from them we must use collective leverage that can be given or withdrawn at a moment’s notice understanding that black consumers cannot get around spending dollars with nonblack companies the collective banking group of maryland wwwcollectiveempowermentgrouporg and its local chapters work with white owned and other companies in mutually beneficial strategic partnerships to obtain reciprocity banks furniture stores carpet stores automobile companies restaurants movie theaters supermarkets and many other companies that profit from the black dollar should reciprocate to their black customers beyond sponsoring a dinner or a youth baseball team if we are going to spend tremendous sums of money with white owned indian owned chinese owned and arabic owned businesses then it’s up to us to initiate and negotiate reciprocal agreements that benefit both groups one side of that equation is already complete we benefit them since we inevitably will keep spending our money with them don’t you think we should complete the equation by getting some benefit ourselves comments closed share    it’s your money — july  articles  posted by jim clingman july th  yet another report the nielsen african american consumer report was released in october  titled “young connected and black – african american millennials are driving social change and leading digital advancement” it points out various issues related to how blacks spend our dollars with an emphasis on our young people to put it bluntly this report is about your money—how much you earn what you spend it on and how it can be obtained from you in exchange for products and services yes it’s your money but for how long since most of us will not read a page consumer report i am going to draw heavily from its contents in hope that you the black consumer will learn to teach your dollars how to make more sense information is only power if you use it appropriately the nielsen report contains a lot of information but the question is who will benefit from it the report states “africanamericans are exuberant and reflective—optimistic about presentday advances in income education entrepreneurship and healthcare and determined to forge a better future as influential leaders and catalysts of social awareness against discrimination and social injustice with incomes steadily rising at a rate that outpaces that of the general population africanamericans’ ‘buying power’ is expected to grow  between now and  by which time it will reach just over  trillion…” is it black buying power or black buying weakness nielsen says “africanamerican consumers are focused on ‘eating well’ and ‘looking good’ overindexing across a wide variety of product categories ranging from beauty products to fresh foods and ingredients that reflect their proud heritage and cultural traditions there is a ‘clear opportunity’ for innovation and newproduct development in the convenienthealthy eating space” are black people taking advantage of the “opportunity” we have created in a section titled valuing the beauty within the report states “personal image is highly valued and is regarded with an immense sense of pride in the africanamerican community africanamerican millennials have higher buying rates per household for hair care products and personal soap and bath products than their millennial counterparts” do you think they are talking about black manufactured products another section feeling proud looking good and spending more points out that “personal image is highly valued and is regarded with an immense sense of pride in the africanamerican community consumer product companies have long been aware of the ‘dedicated consumption’ of personal healthcare items by black consumers africanamericans of all ages show higher buying rates than nonafricanamericans for women’s fragrances grooming aids personal soap and bath needs deodorant sanitary protection family planning and feminine hygiene…the long history of personal care spending has led many consumer products companies to offer highlydeveloped lines of popular africanamerican cosmetic fragrance and haircare products that cater to the wants and needs of africanamerican men and women” is that why l’oréal has purchased black hair care and cosmetic companies as their commercial says “because you’re worth it” uh oh here it comes the pièce de résistance “optimism about the future in  for the first time in american history africanamericans had the highest rate of voter registration and turnout of all races  versus  and while the majority of africanamericans are optimistic that the country is headed in the right direction there is an ongoing need in their communities for more affordable housing healthcare childcare and higher education” does that seem a bit oxymoronic to you besides what did we get from all that voting the report says “in  africanamericans ‘controlled’  trillion in buying power  of the nation’s total and a  increase over …the gains in black buying power reflect not only africanamericans’ population growth but also their increasing education and entrepreneurship as well as their advancing into their peak earning years” our money is “subject” to our “control” but we are not appropriately controlling it we do not leverage it finally the report says “nielsen has provided these reports to better illustrate the ‘unique’ qualities of the africanamerican community the ‘business opportunities’ that exist and the best methods for a productive and successful ‘connection’ as business executives look for opportunities to grow their businesses and gain market share it is critical to measure and evaluate the opportunities” dr james lance taylor points out that black millennials many who earn  to  straight out of college are migrating to the south in record numbers armed with that kind of money they must take full advantage of it collectively and build something for themselves and their progeny—something they “control” black consumers are the most studied segment in this nation because as willie sutton once said when asked why he robbed banks “that’s where the money is” it’s our money this report is talking about black folks are we accessing the opportunities therein comments closed share    a timeless strategy — july  articles  posted by jim clingman july th  before we are able to make the kind of meaningful progress necessary to bring about a change in our economic status we must educate ourselves in the areas of collectivism mutual economic responsibility and the advantages of supporting one another in our endeavors economic empowerment does not have to be shrouded by confusing economic terms nor as complicated as many of us think it is economics for our purposes must be brought down from the lofty heights of academia to the “street talk” with which we are all familiar it too must become a part of our vernacular because at that level we will be able to deal with our concerns our complaints and our problems with the only ammunition that is effective our dollars during the sitins of the ’s while we were seeking equality and the right to integrate socially we began to lose sight of the economic advantages we did have the most important of which were black owned businesses they soon began to fade away as we explored our new found “right” to buy the same products and services we had always bought only now we could enter through the front door instead of the back door we forgot about our own businesses another boycott was about to begin—that of our own businesses by our own people this is not to discredit the sacrifices we made to bring about our civil rights those were some of the most important and significant times in black history we owe a debt of gratitude to those who helped make it possible for many of us to have the things we have today but now with the socalled “new world order” with all of our political and social progress we are even more behind economically than we were a generation ago why is this true one reason is the political complacence that sets in after we elect black people black mayors and black congresspersons do not necessarily equate to black economic prosperity our africanamerican politicians can only do so much and sometimes that’s very little to relieve the plight and blight of our communities after we have helped them get into office we cannot then sit back and wait to see what they are going to do “for” us we must continue to help them so they will be able to do something “with” us our politicians at least the ones we helped get elected must be accountable to us and that will only happen if we abide by the one rule that counts in politics the money rule unless african americans are willing to support our candidates with our dollars as well as our voices we will have neither accountability nor influence in the political arena we as a national community are generally well skilled in making our points when it comes to social issues but we are sorely lacking in our knowledge and execution of basic economic strategies for our local communities politics is important but first we must support one another demand reciprocity from those with whom we do business and work together toward ownership of our communities politics will fall in place when economics succeeds collectivism was a very positive precept of our african ancestors today in some circles that principle has been put forth as the sole reason for the dearth of africanamerican entrepreneurs some say that because we are a communal people we are reluctant to seek the individual path of entrepreneurship this may be partially true but it does not have to prevent us from using that same spirit of communality to support those of us who are entrepreneurs can you imagine how empowered we would be if we drew upon our basic natural inclination to be a real community we would be well on our way to economic social and political parity right now we don’t count can you imagine that we spend a trillion dollars and we don’t count why there’s no need for the majority to deal with us in any serious manner especially economically because we do not act collectively that’s not to say that we should all think alike and act alike and never disagree it simply means that we should consider one another first and not be so willing to push one another aside for own individual advancement in this country for blacks economics must be collective and cooperative witness all of the mergers buyouts alliances and conglomerates occurring today among other companies african americans must practice the principle some of us only celebrate one day each year ujamaa cooperative economics if we do that we will count we will be empowered and we will prosper note believe it or not with the exception of two updates i wrote this article in march  comments closed share    look back and see the future part two — july  articles  posted by jim clingman july rd  an excellent example of the impact our history has on the way we are today especially economically can be found in an article titled the reluctant entrepreneurs by joel kotkin author of the book tribes the feature discusses several reasons for blacks not going into business and being surpassed in this area by other ethnic groups among other reasons the history of african americans was cited the article quotes robert hill a black historian at the university of california at los angeles who traced the lack of entrepreneurial tradition to african origin and the brutality of the american system of slavery “africa” hill explained “is more a communitarian society where notions of private property have never been so entrenched as in europe or north america the culture of capitalism is just not part of our african heritage” the piece goes on to say “…certainly slavery and its progeny the sharecropper system did nothing to foster confidence independence or a capitalist inclination among african americans before slavery and after white landowners believed the proper way to treat the black was in the words of one slave owner ‘to create in him a habit of perfect dependence…’ and it was a system that proved to be enormously successful and enduring” the article continued “we are a race of people who for generations both before and after emancipation were denied freedom of movement education and even a rudimentary familiarity with the free market not to mention credit legal status or safety from lynch mobs that we as descendants have not taken naturally to entrepreneurship should hardly come as a big surprise” the fact still remains that despite their poorest of circumstances some black people engaged in entrepreneurship even before the emancipation and did well at it according to john sibley butler in his outstanding work entrepreneurship and selfhelp among black americans “they black entrepreneurs became the merchant class in northern cities and it was through their enterprises that black income in the last third of the nineteenth century grew faster than that of whites” the inc article cited the economic protestations of booker t washington who established the national negro business league exhorting blacks to “uplift” themselves by striking out on their own it celebrated the “new” ministers like adam clayton powell who urged aspiring congregants to go into business on a larger scale while early black businesses had to rely solely on the black consumer market such is not the case today however if we do not move collectively through the economic maze making our monetary clout felt in the widest of circles and obtaining the reciprocity we deserve as a massive consumer army our businesses will not achieve the growth they need to prosper in this economy moreover african americans will have abdicated our responsibility to carry forth the legacy passed on to us by our fathers and mothers we must never forget our history and the reasons for our attitudes on economics business ownership and mutual support we must also realize that if we are going to make it in this country we had better get down to business now i think our ancestors would be proud economic empowerment is a constant struggle and if we do not view it as a struggle we will never achieve the goals to which we aspire no one is going to “give” us anything if they do it will not be without encumbrances the economic power we seek is within us all and examples for us to follow are everywhere we simply need more cooperation within our own ranks in seeking that economic power remember what frederick douglass said “…this struggle may be a moral one or it may be a physical one or it may be moral and physical but it must be a struggle power concedes nothing without demand it never did and it never will find out just what people will submit to and you have found the exact amounts of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them…the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress” i say if we rise up as marcus garvey exhorted us resolving to cooperate with one another and do for ourselves our economic manifesto would be clear our struggle will be easier and the powers we face will concede to our demands however if african americans choose individuality over collectivism yes a few of us will “make it” but we will go down in history as a paradoxical people a people who with all of our wealth and knowledge acquiesced and continued in economic oppression and the blame will rest squarely upon our shoulders let our past be the light that guides us to a brighter economic future comments closed share    older entries rss

educator home bio books cart checkout my account my little kiah radio shows shop videos contact us look back and see the future part one — june  articles  posted by jim clingman june th  i often use the phrase “our history is our future” to express the fact that everything we need to do today visàvis economic empowerment has been done before by african americans in this country just look back at what black people built in mound bayou mississippi durham north carolina and tulsa oklahoma’s greenwood district take a closer look at what booker t washington was doing with his national negro business league read about black entrepreneurs in cincinnati and philadelphia during the early ’s and you will see the economic future of african americans is indeed grounded in our history i wonder why it takes us so long to do what we know is right in the context of the economic wellbeing of african americans most of us know what “we need” to do yet we seem content to discuss “intellectualize” meet and complain about how unfair the system is for those “we need to…” folks out there if you see the need do the work one thing most of us know is that economic empowerment and business development—vertical business development—are vital to our economic prosperity naturally following the development of businesses is the support of those businesses by consumers to illustrate that point i am reminded of what a friend once told me “production minus sales equals scrap” in the ’s there were many flourishing black owned businesses in spite of the worst brand of slavery ever perpetrated on a people black businesses survived and grew economic growth was a reality even in the face of the racial prejudice that existed because we were determined and we stuck together in  a convention was held in rochester new york to discuss “afroamerican economics” slogans like “buy black” and “double duty dollars” began at conventions like this one all over the country what happened to us since that time have we drifted so far from our heritage and from the things that benefit us as a whole have we become so selfish and so selfcentered that we have completely lost sight of our values toward one another businesses are the foundation of a true community our current  million black owned businesses compared to the  million of us are but a drop of water in the ocean especially when you factor in the relatively meager annual revenues those businesses take in we must change that our time should be devoted to starting and supporting business ventures rather than complaining about how difficult things are out there and how the “arabs” and asians dominate our neighborhoods when it comes to business ownership we must find common ground to move beyond the stagnation and complacency in which we have been mired for so long organization unity and mutual support are the keys to our economic freedom cooperative economics among african americans is an idea that has been around for hundreds of years it could not be resisted during the early years of american history and it cannot be resisted today it is up to us to take advantage of that fact as we move forward it is time to make individual commitments to “do” something rather than sit back and “let someone else do it” it is time to stop complaining and blaming someone else for our plight it is time for us to give up that lame excuse “there is no use trying to change things because we are never going to get together anyway” i don’t buy those tired words and i hope you don’t buy them either all we have to do instead is buy from one another for the benefit of us all the precedent exists look at it and learn from it my primary example of seeing a need and doing the work although there are several during my lifetime that i could share is my current work for our people the one million conscious and conscientious black contributors and voters omccbcv our historical grounding is found in the words of marcus garvey “the greatest weapon used against black people is disorganization” thus we are organized united and unapologetically determined to contribute to the economic elevation of our people we saw the need and set out to do the work and we will continue that work as we learn from our past and strive for a better future for our children if you would like to join us go to wwwiamoneofthemillioncom next week part two of this article will give a deeper look at why and how the system in which we live has caused some of us to be complacent it will also offer a way to change our situation   comments closed share    another opportunity to support a black business — june  articles  posted by jim clingman june th  this week’s article is a follow up to my food desert article one week after writing it i learned about a young sister in the los angeles area compton to be exact who had bought a supermarket kia patterson the first black in la to do so now is the independent owneroperator of a grocery outlet store that in essence presents yet another opportunity for us to support a black owned supermarket question is will we do it i called ms patterson immediately after watching a video interview of her inside her store i was thoroughly impressed after speaking to her i contacted her marketingpr rep and suggested ways i could help get the word out about ms patterson’s venture this article is part of that effort in addition to my asking radio talk show personalities to feature her as a guest even those of us who do not live in la or its surrounding cities should be willing to cheer ms patterson on and share her information with others across this nation hers is one of the examples i wrote about in my previous article maybe similar ventures by black people will come from this latest foray into the food industry and this time it will be sustained i truly hope so kia patterson was born in gardena and raised in lynwood both located in california she has been in the grocery industry since the age of  starting as the “service clerk” for a wellknown supermarket her career moved very fast and was later promoted to store manager after that she had the opportunity to join the corporate office for a special project which resulted in a promotion to a store systems specialist kia’s dedication and professionalism did not go unnoticed and after having spent seventeen years in her first grocery job grocery outlet approached with the opportunity to become an independent owneroperator kia joined the grocery outlet family in june  she trained at their long beach location and was very grateful to have received training by two very experienced operators on april   kia made her dream of becoming an entrepreneur a reality when she became the independent owneroperator of the compton location i know the demographics have changed for compton over recent years but that should not be used as an excuse not to support kia’s store maggie and john anderson drove  miles round trip from oak park to southside chicago to support a black owned grocery store i drove a similar distance to support a black owned dry cleaners in cincinnati ohio call us crazy but we believe as web dubois said “we must cooperate or we are lost ten million people who join in intelligent selfhelp can never be long ignored or mistreated the mass of the negroes must learn to patronize business enterprises conducted by their own race even at some disadvantage” kia immediately connected with the community of compton because it is the neighboring city to lynwood where kia grew up and started donating food items on a weekly basis to some of the local churches kia has also partnered with el camino compton center to launch their food pantry to help less fortunate students with food items most recently kia began to help the community learn how to incorporate healthy and affordable eating habits by hosting “smart shopping” store tours where a registered nutritionist guided shoppers to identify nutritious food choices in addition to these initiatives and to further contribute to the advancement of her community during the month of may and june kia has partnered with the magic johnson foundation to conduct a fundraising competition to benefit four elementary schools in the compton unified school district as a result the schools will receive cash prizes that will be used in different educational activities and for those looking for healthier food choices grocery outlet stores like kia’s offer more than  natural organic specialty and healthy items now here is an appropriate response to kia’s business venture and her efforts to “give back” to the community dr rosie milligan nationally acclaimed author local entrepreneur community activist and selfproclaimed “mayor of south central la” will revise her “get on the bus” campaign which she implemented in past years to take groups of customers to black businesses to shop dr rosie will now organize groups to visit patterson’s store and do their weekly shopping i am very excited about this news and i want to see this business grow from the support of black consumers as well as all consumers—the same way black people support everyone else’s stores let’s flip the script on the mantra the song and the movie “straight outta compton” by making our refrain “straight into compton” to support a black business comments closed share    food deserts — june  articles  posted by jim clingman june rd  why do we have food deserts one reason is that we have deserted our own stores instead of taking care of ourselves we complain about stores owned by someone else we petition our politicians for a grocery store or seek private companies to open stores where we live but seldom do we open stores ourselves even when blacks do open new supermarkets we do not support them and they eventually are forced to close think i’m wrong keep reading at the turn of the last century  black people began to form food coops and other collective purchasing programs to feed themselves and to leverage lower prices for black consumers two of the first grocery coops were started in st louis and chicago by b g shaw and robert jackson respectively in  the most notable coop was the colored merchants’ association cma founded by ac brown in montgomery alabama in  with assistance from the national negro business league under the leadership of albon holsey the cma became a national organization that encouraged black grocers to unite in  holsey stated “…the cma began to lose the confidence of the black consumer” black economist abram harris said “members always found it difficult to sell cma brands the negro like the white consumer is habituated to the popular brands carried by the chains” source dr juliet ek walker desertion of black stores by black consumers led to market opportunities for outsiders to take full advantage of the black food dollar we became dependent upon others and now we even request their presence in our neighborhoods no better picture of that reality than singletary’s supermarket in columbus ohio in the mid’s i wrote many articles about singletary’s and even spent time there doing a product sampling program singletary’s was a brand new business at that time clean wellstocked and more convenient to blacks in the mt vernon neighborhood than other grocery stores author of “tribes” joel kotkin wrote “in columbus ohio…singletary plaza mart the nation’s largest blackowned ‘superstore’ went out of business…due to a lack of community patronage although blacks in columbus spend  million each week on food they couldn’t be convinced to spend less than a tenth of it or  to keep singletary afloat” the reluctant entrepreneurs inc magazine  desertion in  in lakeland florida an interdenominational group of black ministers took their church members shopping a two monthold blackowned grocery store was not doing very well in the community so the ministers got together to help the ministers took  people to the store called fresh supermarket foods after two hours the shoppers had spent  according to the owner mr frank jackson paul sanders pastor of greater st paul missionary baptist church said “at stake is getting more blacks to support one another we talk about power but if we don’t have some businesses or some money we can talk about power all we want and it won’t come” sanders continued “if the store does not succeed it will be because of a lack of community support” desertion three other recent examples include fresh market supermarket in nearly  black southside chicago owner karriem beyah whose store was included in maggie and john anderson’s “empowerment experiment” agreed that the awareness and enthusiasm the anderson’s created was important but beyah added that his business may have suffered from being highlighted as an enterprise owned by an africanamerican he closed the store in august  “if you’re under the radar then maybe you won’t get that belief from customers that the other guy’s ice is colder than yours” he said but “i’m not giving up” beyah plans to open a new store this year  second is the  closing on the last calhoun’s supermarket in montgomery al after losing money for “three or four years” according to owner greg calhoun who made history as the first african american in the south to own a supermarket at one point calhoun had seven stores in montgomery alone a majority black city shakenya calhoun cried as she closed the doors one final time “the market has just been oversaturated with grocery stores…with the lack of sales there’s not an economic impact for us to be in business” third there’s the much ballyhooed sterling farms’ grocery store in new orleans coowned by actor wendell pierce who wanted to bring healthy food to underserved communities that store closed one year after opening it drew national media attention when it opened including a visit from michelle obama who was touting her fresh food initiative to bring healthy grocery options to socalled “food deserts” what will it take for us to feed ourselves we have the money we just lack the mindset history will not treat us kindly if we fail to act appropriately comments closed share    naacp in transition — may  articles  posted by jim clingman may th  the national office of the naacp has made a couple of significant changes lately they dismissed the chairwoman roslyn brock and the president cornell brooks although i served in various capacities within the cincinnati branch for nine years  through which we did excellent work for our community i have not been a fan of the national office since myrlie evers took over back around  or so my experiences in our local branch left a bitter taste in my mouth as i watched the national office use its national representative the “luca brasi” of the naacp gill ford to intimidate members and even suspend them for life because they refused to capitulate to his will many branches across the country have suffered from ford’s arrogance collusion and disruption of local branch elections and other branch activities he had his own agenda for certain branches and exercised it summarily and arbitrarily without sanction or even a response from his national bosses despite branches calling writing suing and filing complaints against this guy he continued to ride roughshod over the local proletariat the volunteers who do much of the work and pay a great deal in dues and assessment fees to the national office ford’s actions supported or ignored by his superiors in baltimore showed me it was all about control and money and never about support of local branches that is unless those branches bent to the dictatorial will of gill ford but i am proud to say that during my tenure we stood up to the bully and did our work in spite of him doing everything he could to control us although i have not seen an announcement of his dismissal i really hope he is gone as well and if not that the new administration will reel him in and monitor what he does a lot more than his former bosses did much of the negativity and chaos within branches has been caused by ford and overlooked by brock brooks and ben jealous leon russell board chair and derrick johnson vicechair sent a letter out announcing the termination of brooks along with their intentions for the future of the naacp following is an excerpt from that letter “… in the coming months our leadership will embark on a ‘listening tour for the first time in our history’ it is clear that americans of all genders and ages from all of the corners of all  states have been aching to be understood to be seen — and now they are demanding to be heard we want to meet those demands and in doing so ensure that we are harnessing the energy and voice of our grassroots membership as we pursue transformational change as we reimagine ourselves we want to be formed in the likeness of the people whom we serve — and to do so we must first see meet and listen to them…as we embark on this journey everyone will have a place at the table” the most striking statement to me is that in  years the naacp has never gone on a “listening tour” to hear from its branches but i will let you draw our own conclusions from that excerpt and i encourage you to read the entire letter read it and critically analyze it to see if it meets your approval especially if you are a member the once vaunted and heralded naacp has finally gotten the message it seems and is ready to hear from the grassroots i trust they are truthful in that regard and will follow through on their statements if they do not and merely put a new face on the same old problems my advice is for members to walk away and leave them to their own devices if they are sincere i urge you to support this new vision and get involved to help bring it to fruition a black organization with over a half million members can do so much to move us toward economic empowerment it will not happen if corruption and distrust exist at the top nor will it happen if those on the local level participate in that corruption andor turn a blind eye a deaf ear and a mute voice to election tampering and mistreatment of branches that refuse to go along with the nonsense from the national office i wish brothers russell and johnson well in their quest to recapture the glory of the naacp but they should know there is a great deal of discontentment out there which must be heard and respected when that is acknowledged and dealt with fairly and immediately the organization can move forward but it will not until that happens suggestion a great place to start the listening tour is ohio it has been at the center of the storm for years comments closed share    older entries newer entries rss categories
