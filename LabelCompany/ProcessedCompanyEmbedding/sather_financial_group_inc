manage the needs of our clients lives        our clients who experience the best long term returns are the ones who continue to put more money into investments in all markets—whether good or bad this is the concept of dollar cost averaging you cannot try to time the market and you must be willing to invest when the market is at peak levels of pessimism        between  and  the sp  produced gains of  per year however the average investor only received  per year over the same time period why the average investor buys high and sells low chasing after the emotional decisions        studies by nobel prize winner william sharpe show that market timers must be right  of the time just to match the returns of an investor with a buy and hold strategy additionally market timers incur approximately twice as much risk or volatility as the buy and hold strategy         of the returns of the market came from  of the days        since  the stock market has averaged about  per year also it has incurred volatility as measured by standard deviation of about  per year this means that on any given year you should reasonably expect your returns to be in a range of  to  although the average is  per year the typical year is rarely average        investment returns in excess of  to  annualized are unsustainable regression to the mean is a powerful force        discipline is the premier investment virtue discipline is what keeps us from reacting impulsively and emotionally to what happens in our portfolios it is a willingness to stick to a strategy during those temporary times it may be out of synch with the market        although a stock certificate may be printed on a piece of paper it represents much more whether you buy one share of stock or many shares of stock you must function as if you own the entire company quite simply that is what stock is—ownership in a company     the stock market is a long term proposition—meaning a ten plus year commitment even if you are  years old and are retired you should be a stock market investor with an appropriate amount of funds for the remainder of your life which statistically is a very long time     if the volatility of the stock market is affecting your current standard of living then you have your assets invested incorrectly the stock market should be utilized to produce long term  years growth in assets fixed income assets cd’s bonds etc should be used to satisfy short to intermediate cash flow needs     assume your dream home is selling for  and one day some guy on the tv says that because of a variety of scary sounding issues this dream home is now only worth  most logical people would assess this discount as an opportunity to be pursued and buy their dream home only in the stock market have we witnessed people get so negatively excited when the prices of good quality companies are cut in half i suppose this is due to people’s aversion to volatility and their inability to properly analyze the true value of a business you must separate fear from opportunity     over the past  years the broad stock market has lost as much as  in any one year conversely over the same time period the stock market has gained as much as  in any one year the average of these one year time periods has been      also over the past  years the worst performance of the stock market over any five year time period has been a loss of  per year the best five year gain has been  per year the average of these one year time periods has been  time is your friend when dealing with the stock market and its short term volatility     over the short term the stock market is merely a popularity contest that is quite irrational in nature long term however the stock market is a weighing machine which weighs the value earnings created by good companies that consistently increase their earnings     while the date of december st may have some meaning to you it has no meaning to your investments do not become overly concerned with your investment performance as of this date or any other arbitrary date long term performance is what matters     volatility and controversy create fear as well as opportunities to take advantage of this you must embrace volatility and have a strong stomach     we own stocks personally and on behalf of our clients we do so to participate as owners of these companies in their increasing pool of earnings     most days there is a disconnect often substantial between a stocks price and the true value of their earnings or the company as a whole a perfect example is berkshire hathaway even though berkshire has increased its book value by  per year between  and  the stock price has done virtually nothing the stock markets emotional disconnect does not sway us from owning one of the greatest companies with arguably the greatest ceo of all time long term berkshire’s stock price will catch up to its increased book value and patient investors will benefit     although we make predictions about developing trends these trends take time to evolve when we first started warning about overvaluation in tech and internet stocks in  it took another year for these issues to become apparent the same has been true for real estate we first started verbalizing concerns about real estate in may of  only now are the flaws in real estate being openly discussed fortunately our clients were positioned to avoid the tech disaster and are currently positioned to avoid any impending real estate wreck     although the financial news focuses heavily on the stock market we do not obsess over it we constantly evaluate all investment categories relative to one another however stocks typically provide us with the best opportunities to outpace taxes and inflation     inflation is a silent killer you will never receive a bill for inflation and yet it has a bigger impact upon your assets than virtually anything else with great consistency the things we buy food energy housing etc go up in price if your assets do not outpace taxes and inflation you lose purchasing power     consider the following a ten year us treasury bond a default risk free investment currently yields about  in a  marginal income tax bracket our clients lose  of the possible  percentage points available leaving only  percentage points to deal with inflation currently inflation is running in excess of  on an annual basis therefore after factoring in the affects of inflation this seemingly “risk free” investment actually guarantees a negative  real rate of return bottom line this safe us treasury bond investment can produce horrible long term results     many of our more conservative clients experience unrealized losses in their accounts from time to time—not because of their stock market assets but because of their fixed income assets investors must realize that when interest rates rise bond prices will decline fixed income assets do not deliver the “safe” returns that many expect     for quite some time we have been discussing the need for foreign exposure we live in a large global world and as such want our clients to participate in global capitalism most of our clients own stocks that sell more than  of their products outside of the united states this provides us with tremendous international exposure via large mature and stable companies we have also placed many clients into mutual funds that only invest outside of the us this approach along with owning us based multinationals provides clients with substantial global diversification     most financial magazines newspapers and tv shows are designed to sell advertising newspapers etc—not individually customized financial advice jim cramer of cnbc’s mad money tv show is an idiot his show is designed to elicit emotion and entertainment—not sound investment advice cramer’s ridiculous “lightning round” method of choosing investments is the financial equivalent of russian roulette—entertaining but potentially catastrophic     all of our clients are different with different goals income needs volatility constraints etc to satisfy our client’s needs we constantly evaluate all types of investments for relative valuation liquidity needs income requirements time frames etc     we are honest with our clients even though it may not be what they want to hear our job is to look out for our clients with integrity and discipline       top business stories wells fargo may have charged  clients for unwanted insurance  fortune billionaire laurene powell jobs acquires a

business resource center recent articles authors about us meet the team board of directors careers our clients business resource center a collection of articles for business owners and executives tax reform benefits america by dave sather may   tweet as soon as treasury secretary mnuchin revealed the trump administration’s plan for tax reform my phone rang it was my older brother steve wanting to know my thoughts on the proposal to lower the corporate tax rate to  from as high as  he remembered that in the past i had written an article that discussed how the us had the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world however steve had read that us corporations have a much lower average tax rate than  as such he wanted to know why the rate should be lowered if the average corporation already pays a much lower effective rate my brother’s observation is mathematically accurate according to the congressional budget office the us has the highest top statutory tax rate of any g nation however the average corporate tax paid total tax paid divided by income was only  as such steve wondered if it really made sense to lower the rate it’s a good question that requires some explanation first companies are owned by shareholders not nations every corporation has an obligation to their shareholders to pay their legally owed taxes—but not a penny more as such they have an obligation to operate in the most efficient locations secondly corporations today are global in nature—meaning they sell product worldwide the average company in the sp  derives nearly half of its income outside the us this means their tax structure is anything but simple or straightforward if they sell product outside the us their average tax rate will be lower than the marginal rate assessed by the us when companies sell product into a foreign country they are taxed in the jurisdiction in which the product is sold many countries such as ireland canada france and the united kingdom have a corporate tax rate that is less than  since the us rate is nearly twice as high it can be much more profitable for us based companies to sell in these nations as it helps to maximize aftertax profits however the next step in global taxation is where the real confusion sets in if a usbased company sells product into england for instance they pay tax in england after they settle up with the brits the net profits sit in a british bank account if they bring the money back to the us they are required to pay a  tax on the foreign derived profits—just for moving the cash from one bank account to another this is a process called repatriation conversely if they leave the cash sitting in a british bank they can deploy  of it to expand foreign operations and hire foreign people these foreign people then take their paychecks and spend them in their neighborhood feed their families and expand their economy in the process unfortunately the us tax rates are so high in comparison that many corporations would rather keep their foreignearned profits outside the us this means they’re not reinvesting those profits in the us when profits are not reinvested factories don’t get built people aren’t employed and profits are not recirculated in a manner that stimulates our economy this limits pay raises opportunities for innovation and general advancement for the average family given how wide this impact is this is not a republican or democrat issue—it is an american issue this alone should be enough to get any elected official to revisit our uncompetitive tax structure however there is even more “low hanging fruit” for anyone who wants to seriously attack this issue us corporations currently hold  trillion in foreign bank accounts by lowering the tax rate to  hopefully a significant portion of these foreignheld assets will find their way home…and in the process serve as feedstock for innovation employment and gdp expansion right here at home topics taxes dave sather sather financial group

board of directors careers our clients business resource center a collection of articles for business owners and executives asset rich cash flow poor by dave sather march   tweet dave sathers money matters lately we’ve had numerous conversations with clients as well as others who have found themselves “asset rich and cash flow poor” they have put themselves in this predicament by owning illiquid real estate assets often these illiquid assets are from privately formed real estate partnerships which come with a slick sales pitch offering attractive cash flows at a time when traditional interest income continues to be pathetically low with money markets and cd’s offering less than  interest the thought of earning  or more sounds too good to be true—and it usually is more than likely the assets appeared sound and the buyer relied on the advice they received at the time however often that “advice” is motivated by a large commission that the selling broker stands to receive if you bite furthermore many investors in these partnerships later realize that the big “cash flow” they received was not “interest” income but rather a combination of interest and return of principal given this the check you receive may be very deceptive in terms of its actual rate of return although the majority of the concerns we currently hear about involve private real estate partnerships put together by brokers there are many other examples of assets with similar issues whether it is a private business acreage or even your house there are many issues to evaluate and consider for instance many illiquid assets are hard to value and even harder to find a buyer forespecially when time is of the essence think for a moment just how different shares of cocacola stock are when compared with any illiquid asset this past friday there were  million shares of cocacola that traded hands as such an owner of coke stock can rest assured that if they need to sell their shares there will be many willing people vying to buy their asset the same is not true for the illiquid assets sales may take months to complete and even then due to a lack of competing offers you may be forced to sell for a fraction of what an asset should be worth as such in a pinch which would you rather own buying illiquid assets can compound the liquidity trap that many retirees are now facing their single biggest asset is a house that cannot be used for cash flow and is illiquid consider an individual homeowner who allocates a significant portion of their remaining savings to other illiquid assets—and then something unforeseen occurs they have very little room to maneuver and their financial picture can quickly become a house of cards obviously the fact that an asset is not publicly traded does not mean you should run for the hills however some common sense is warranted don’t fall for something just because of a good sales pitch and don’t fall in love with an asset if someone is actively selling you a product of this nature ask many questions and get the responses in writing furthermore recognize that if you invest in a nonpublicly traded asset you need to be very confident that you have a very long time frame to hold that asset finally remember that the world’s greatest investment ideas may never be profitably completed if you don’t have the necessary cash flow in the meantime or if you don’t have other financial resources that allow you to be sufficiently patient   topics featured accounting  finance content type dave sather sather financial group dave sather is a certified
