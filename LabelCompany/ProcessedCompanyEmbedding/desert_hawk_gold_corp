clifton mining companys clifton otc  cftn joint venture partner desert hawk gold corp desert hawk completed the overhaul and renovation of the gold hill mill in september of   preliminary mill operations started in october with fine tuning of the mill over the past several months new crushing and grinding circuits have been put in place as well as additional banks of float cells and new gravity separation tables upgrading capacity and recoveries  a new automated crusher has been placed at the mine site so that ore can be crushed before being shipped to the mill for processing   phase one initial production   initial production has started at a mine site identified as the yellow hammer mine  current production includes the recovery of copper gold silver and tungsten  the average ore being processed by desert hawk is running  copper with gold silver and tungsten byproducts  high grade zones have exceeded  copper  the first copper gold and silver concentrate has been shipped to the smelter and the first payment is expected in april  several other known coppergold deposits located within the area will be used for additional mill feed   phase two   phase two involves the construction of a copper heap leach at the mill site to extract the oxide copper  the recovered copper will boost revenues and royalties  government filings have been submitted and the venture is currently awaiting approval   phase three   filings have been made with government agencies to construct a large heap leach pad near the kiewit properties  this pad is being engineered to accommodate not only the gold resources from the kiewit properties but also silver and gold material from surrounding mine sites  it is anticipated that the government approval will be granted later this year and that construction will begin thereafter  we expect this to be the largest and most profitable project for the company   technology   rustum roy one of the premiere solid state physicists and william moeller have developed a potentially important process and assigned the corresponding us patent  to the company  there was a error in the filing of the assignment but it has since been corrected  the patent involves the use of microwave technology and particular frequencies to treat certain types of refractory ore  preliminary testing at the department of metallurgy of the university of utah has shown this technology to increase precious metals recoveries by as much as tenfold  clifton will continue testing this process with the intent of using it in the mill process and potentially licensing the technology to other mining companies   lawsuits   the two lawsuits the company was previously named in have both been amicably settled   clifton trades on the us otc cftn    note any statements

tonsday production mill facility clifton mining clifton mining company summary just beginning to scratch the surface the clifton mining district the site of the first mill in utah were discovered and mined from the s until the early s what attracted so many prospectors to the region is a series of abundantly mineralized shear zones most of which average between  ⁄ and  feet wide and outcropping for more than a mile for almost a century the area now known as the clifton shear zones near gold hill utah was divided into a jumble of independent mining properties that had been mined by the original owners of the clifton claims and later inherited by their families because this had been an important historic mining district several large mining companies tried to consolidate these claims in the s and s but because the separate ownership of these small irregularly shaped parcels made modern large scale mining impossible and because these companies were unable to negotiate with so many families they abandoned the attempt william moeller presently the ceo of clifton mining spent more than two decades negotiating with these families and eventually acquired the heart of the clifton mining district gold hill operations gold hill utah positive outlook for silver prices it is widely agreed by precious metals analysts that silver prices will rise sharply in the coming years in each of the last  years world wide silver consumption has exceeded world wide silver production by more than  million ounces the excessive inventories of the early s have now been entirely exhausted and the us strategic stockpile of silver  billion ounces not that long ago is now entirely depleted inventories are at their lowest levels in more than  years and are continuing to decline at the same time persistently low silver prices have left silver companies with impaired balance sheets and forced them to cut back on exploration few new silver mines have been discovered in the past decade and little additional silver production is likely to come onstream for years independent of the silver price on the demand side the silver shortage of the late s led companies to restrict silver usage to only the highest value added applications these applications would be profitable even with silver many times today’s price as a result of the insensitivity of both supply and demand to the silver price once inventories are exhausted the price of silver will rise sharply this will make production from the clifton shear zones exceptionally profitable location location location the clifton mining district is arguably in one of the best locations in the world for mining precious metals it is readily accessible just over an hour south of wendover on the utahnevada border off interstate i yet it is remote with one of the lowest population densities in the country it lies directly uphill from a us air force gunnery range so that environmental concerns are as minimal as anywhere in north america it is located in the us where political risk is minimal and in utah one of the friendliest states to responsible mining when standing atop a clifton ridge just about the only sounds one may ever hear are occasional fighterjet flybys or explosives testing taking place at a nearby us military range because of its isolation local policymakers in the sparsely populated region have welcomed clifton’s combination of economic benefit and environmental conscientiousness “development in a remote relatively desolate area like ours is looked upon more favorably by agencies and government officials charged with balancing economic prosperity and environmental stewardship” says moeller “the sounds in the distance remind me that as a mining enterprise our location represents an important strategic advantage” such favor was evidenced in  when county officials authorized the issuance of industrial revenue bonds to finance plant construction at clifton’s property though the company has elected not to exercise its municipal debt option at present management realizes how rare this sort of “seal of approval” can be “if a bond issuance of this kind has ever been offered to another mining company i’ve never heard of it happening” says moeller “it speaks to the quality of our studies and the longterm relationship we have fostered with local and state regulators” it’s like a treasure map someone has laid out for us you can literally see the veins stretching across the mountainscape william d moeller former ceo clifton mining resource summary the clifton shear veins the clifton shear zones are just one of the numerous gold and silver deposits found on the clifton joint venture properties the shear vein system contains over forty identified veins that were mined historically in the ’s and early ’s the shear vein system is made up of mostly patented mining claims these claims were originally owned by as many as  surviving descendants of the original miners it took management almost  years to obtain every patented claim in this historic mine area and to form them into one contiguous block of claims two independent mine engineering reports have been issued on the property both outlining a very large ore potential in the shear vein system but with recent changes in the laws governing the issuance of proven and probable reserve estimates neither of the two reports meet the new requirements and as such will not be discussed further herein the veins are a rich source of silver lead and gold the shear veins are unique in the fact that they come right to the surface the shear veins are visible on the surface for distances of up to  ft approximately  mine workings penetrate the shear veins and give access into the veins for distances of over  ft the old workings are located on all sides of the shear vein property at varying elevations enabling the company to show consistent silver gold and lead values throughout the shear vein system these veins were originally mined from about  to the early ’s at that time the ore had to be shipped at least  miles by wagon to tons at a time to be processed this attests to the exceptionally high value of the mined ore other clifton mineral deposits clifton mining’s long term value is further enhanced by the identification of additional mineral deposits within the claim area two additional types of mineral deposits have been discovered within clifton mining’s property boundaries and there is strong evidence of a third they are skarn deposits bedded replacement deposits and the probable third is a porphyry deposit skarn deposits clifton mining’s skarn system is a twomilelong system with numerous surface exposures see figure  historical records in the area report some gold values associated with these skarns to be in the multipleounce gold category copper which is also associated with the clifton skarns can exceed  samples taken within clifton mining’s skarn system have already shown values in excess of  ozton gold further drill work and sampling will be necessary to delineate exact boundaries and tonnage potentials however it is currently estimated that clifton’s skarn system may hold as much mineral value potential as the shear zones bedded replacement deposits clifton mining has already discovered and assayed numerous bedded replacement deposits within the clifton claim block see figure   the assay values associated with these deposits have typically been very highgrade assay work completed on the surface and within accessible mine workings shows value ranges from  to  ozton gold  to  ozton silver  to  copper monocco bedding and lead values from  to  current information shows average values within the bedded replacement deposits of approximately  ozton gold  ozton silver and  lead the clifton cabin bedding which was core drilled see announcement  showed average values of  ozton silver  lead and  ozton gold porphyry deposit clifton mining can also show strong evidence that a large mineralized porphyry system intrudes the property from the east side holding promise for a large deepseated copper or copper molybdenum deposit see figure   it is expected that this porphyry deposit will be similar to the ruth robinson deposit located only  miles south of clifton mining’s property the ruth deposit has produced  million tons of ore to date including  million tons of copper and  tons of gold ultimate potential many geologists who have visited the clifton area have commented on the similarity of this district to the major gold producing areas of the carlin trend there are the same indicator minerals for gold along with numerous silica blowouts called jasperoids drill cores have shown intensive geological activity preparing the ground for significant mineralization ultimately we hope this district will provide similar world class deposits of gold similar to those of the carlin trend recent results the kiewit gold project is a lowgrade highvolume heap leach gold project the project started into production late in the fall of  the project is operated by clifton’s partner desert hawk gold corporation desert hawk desert hawk has announced that its intention is to produce  ounces of gold annually from this project clifton receives a five percent  net smelter return on the project for all precious metals coming from the kiewit deposit heap leach projects start slow and then move to higher production and recovery of gold and silver metals as more metal bearing rock is crushed and loaded onto the pad the management of clifton mining has recently completed an onsite inspection of the desert hawkclifton heap leach operation now that the weather is cooperating the project has moved from limited winter production back into full swing operations mining has commenced in a large way moving as many as  tons daily onto the large heap leach pad leaching operations are expanding as the first layer on the pad is being filled within a few months this much larger surface area will help increase gold production significantly in the latest update desert hawk mining clifton’s partner at kiewit has received approval to expand the current kiewit open pit operations to the east this should roughly double the size of the pit substantially increasing both the rate of production and the mine life new drilling that has been completed has revealed material of similar grade to the east of current operations this shows that the system is not limited to the immediate area of the current pit and has confirmed the potential for this deposit to be significantly larger than had previously been anticipated as rick havenstrite president of desert hawk put it “all that has been previously known is that the mineralized structures from the kiewit pit outcrop  feet to the east of the original pit due to topography it has not been previously feasible to drill in this area we have been working for two weeks to develop a haul road and prestrip the new zone the haul road is complete and the first production drill pattern was shot this week about  tons of waste has already been removed based on this drilling we have confirmed the geologic continuity the deposit remains wide open in nearly every direction” we expect further drilling to produce a certifiable resource by this time next year in order to have a direct view of the current operations please see the three new film clips downloaded to both the company’s website and also to youtube conclusion clifton’s management is very positive about the work completed so far and the potential deposits that have been outlined to date but feel that it is only the tip of the icebergk completed so far and the potential deposits that have been outlined to date but feel that it is

leachphotos heap leach update photos faq whats a heap leachmuch of the gold that’s mined around the world today uses chemicals to extract the gold from the ore the most common process for doing this is called a heap leach in a heap leach the gold ore is ground down to the optimal leaching particle size determined after a lot of testing and then it’s stacked in a layers on top of a very durable plastic type pad there is also a second safety pad usually put beneath the first one to make sure there are no leaks in the upper pad after a layer of protective sand is put on top of the pad to protect it from the rocks the ground up ore is piled on top of the sand usually in layers of  feet in thickness then a waterchemical solution is sprayed over the top of the heap of ground up ore as the solution flows over the ore particles it dissolves the gold out of the rocks the gold stays dissolved in the liquid thereby removing the gold from the ore this solution trickles down through the pile and is collected at the bottom in a pond called a pregnant solution pond the mine operator will then pull the liquid from the pond and put it through a process that strips the gold from the liquid the liquid will then be recycled back up to the top of the pile and the whole process will start again it takes quite a while to extract most of the gold out of the rock which is why heap leaches usually run for years you can still be extracting gold from the first ore put on the pile while new ore layers are being added on top a heap leach can ultimately end up more than  feet high the chemical used to extract the gold will eventually oxidize or break down chemically and become a plant fertilizer once the operation is complete the heap leach is reclaimed to look like any other hill in the area the chemical fertilizer may help plants to grow even faster to completely restore the natural look of the entire area clifton mining contact us for more information  east  south
