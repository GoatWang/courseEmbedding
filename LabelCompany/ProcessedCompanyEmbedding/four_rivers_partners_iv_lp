coordinator with four rivers “our joint customers will now be able to use the best features of both systems making operations more efficient” after the rtls asset tag id is added to tms the hospitals

asset management software for health care customers four rivers software is used to help hospitals track equipment everything from iv pumps and radiology machines to facilities and hvac the software tracks items including maintenance records location and work order schedules historically four rivers serves large customers with more than  beds but didn’t have a product offering for smaller

organizations the company has been trying to sell to these smaller organizations but the existing software was more than those potential customers needed and could be overwhelming o’donnell said since harvest already has customers and brand recognition it allows four rivers to get into that market quicker the forest hills company has  employees and isn’t planning to add staff as a result of the acquisition since current staff will be able to handle the added product offering the company will continue to service the existing harvest customers and wont require upgrade to four rivers flagship

february   — hospitals wishing to track the realtime locations of mobile medical equipment while using four rivers® total maintenance system tms® will experience improved workflows thanks to a recent integration with the versus realtime locating system rtls the integration already in use at children’s of alabama in birmingham features a singlesource procurement process where a versus asset tag id is entered once into the tms software through a bidirectional interface the asset is automatically registered within the versus system so its location can be immediately tracked versus then provides realtime location updates to tms permitting enterprisewide location visibility an average hospital can lose  per day in lost wages due to time spent searching for mobile assets such as iv pumps additionally many hospitals purchase  more equipment than necessary just to ensure availability in case inventory can’t be found by monitoring the realtime locations of these mobile assets and tracking how often they’re used in patient care hospitals can dramatically decrease operational costs and capital investments while increasing staff and patient satisfaction biomedical and other staff can quickly locate assets through the rtls location field in tms where they also track maintenance and other asset details clinical staff in patient care units can view equipment locations on versus glanceandgo™ boards displayed as either a floorplan of the unit or as a list view of available equipment inventory control staff may also use versus’ fullfeatured parlevel asset management software to automate replenishment functions children’s of alabama uses four rivers tms integrated with versus to track approximately  mobile assets including iv pumps beds and stretchers biomedical staff keep track of preventative maintenance warranties and recall notifications in tms where they now know an asset’s realtime location thanks to the rtls integration “by combining versus’ realtime location data with our tms we are enabling our customers to work smarter” says larry shields product coordinator with four rivers “our joint customers will now be able to use the best features of both systems making operations more efficient” after the rtls asset tag id is added to tms the hospitals also have immediate access to equipment and location information in versus software for example hospitals can use versus’ parlevel feature to ensure optimal inventory of iv and other pumps in patient care areas clinicians can also access lists of available equipment and their locations via versus glanceandgo boards on overhead screens or workstation web browsers “the integration with four rivers tms expands the benefits of rtls for biomedical engineering without placing additional process burdens on the department” explains kevin jackson chief technology officer for versus “versus seamlessly integrates realtime asset tracking with the tms features making it easy for inventory control staff to better serve the facility physicians and nurses this interoperability a cornerstone of versus solutions ultimately improves the efficiency of patient care” to learn more about asset
