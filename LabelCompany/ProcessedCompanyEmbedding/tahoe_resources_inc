contact us login search search better buy coeur mining inc vs tahoe resources inc with both silver stocks tumbling by double digits in recent months which one should you buy neha chamaria nehams mar   at am if youre a preciousmetals investor youve no doubt heard of silvermining stocks coeur mining inc nysecde and tahoe resources inc nysetaho right now both stocks look delectably attractive with coeur shedding almost  and tahoe nearly  in the past six months as of this writing both coeur and tahoe have kicked off their  financial year on a strong note in terms of operational performances and are aggressively expanding their businesses id consider now a great entry point and if i were to choose one of the stocks id go with coeur despite tahoes solid numbers and dividends heres why image source getty images coeur mining stupendous turnaround in  president and ceo mitchell j krebs perfectly summed up  for coeur mining during the companys last earnings call when he said that  marked a key inflection point for coeur coeur has indeed stepped into  on solid footing having achieved record silver equivalent production of  million ounces in  not one to rest on its laurels coeur aims to take its production to yet another level next year as it ramps up its primary mine at palmarejo mexico coeur is also guarding its position as the largest primary silver producer in the united states image source coeurs presentation at  annual roth conference march  palmarejos expansion is perfectly timed  and it isnt just about silver just last year coeur struck a new agreement with preciousmetals streaming and royalty company franco nevada corp nysefnv wherein franconevada will buy  of the gold produced at palmarejo at a cash price of  an ounce almost twice what it paid coeur under the old agreement so palmarejo should boost coeurs cash flows substantially going forward meanwhile coeur cut its cost of sales by almost  last year despite higher revenue more importantly a focus on highergrade metal in recent years has helped coeur bring down its allinsustaining cost substantially its aisc came in at only about  per silver equivalent ounce in  compared with  per ounce in  thanks to rising production and lower costs coeur ended  with adjusted net profits excluding impairment charges of  million versus an adjusted net loss of  million in  thats not all coeur also cut down its total debt by more than half in  using proceeds from noncore asset sales and stock issue even encouraging moodys to upgrade the miners debt ratings last september granted a stock issue dilutes shareholders capital but it isnt uncommon for preciousmetals miners to tap capital markets for funds can a company do any better to attract investors attention maybe not but theres one important area where coeur disappoints dividends unlike tahoe which pays a monthly dividend and boasts a current yield of  coeur doesnt pay a dividend at all and that isnt the only impressive thing about tahoe tahoe resources a young growing miner while coeurs history dates to  tahoe was incorporated in  in fact tahoes primary mine escobal in guatemala  also the worlds third largest silver mine  commenced production only about three years ago does that make you wary about investing in tahoe well it might be a young company but tahoe has a solid team backing it up heres an interesting tidbit tahoe was founded by former goldcorp inc nysegg ceo kevin mcarthur and several members on tahoes current board of directors and management teams were with goldcorp at some point in fact goldcorp even owned a substantial stake in tahoe until about  and it was from goldcorp that tahoe bought the escobal silver deposit tahoe ceo ron clayton also brings with him several years of mining experience with companies such as hecla mining and stillwater mining you wouldnt expect such a competent management to disappoint thankfully it doesnt in  tahoe made huge strides as it started operations at the shahuindo gold mine in peru and acquired lake shore gold in ontario taking its number of mines in operation to five  was in fact a significant year for tahoe for several reasons including  record silver and gold production an alltimelow aisc of  per ounce of silver on a byproduct basis aisc for gold came in at  per ounce record operating cash flow and positive free cash flow tahoes prospects look even brighter as it aims to increase its gold production by nearly  at the midpoint from  levels by   image source tahoes presentation at the bmo capital markets global metals  mining conference with capital expenditures also expected to taper by then tahoe should be able to generate strong cash flows in coming years to support and even raise its dividends tahoe has been paying a consistent monthly dividend of  per share since december  foolish bottom line tahoe is great but tahoe resources looks promising but it faces big risks at its key place of operation guatemala put simply the country has a history of political and social unrest while things have been quiet lately tahoe may face hurdles obtaining or retaining licenses and raising funds later thats a huge threat as tahoe is a relatively young company with a lot at stake in escobal coeur on the other hand operates in relatively safer zones and that combined with the potential that palmarejo holds makes coeur a better bet
