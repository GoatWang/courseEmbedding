fund i class shares returned  in june equities continued to deliver strong returns led by emerging markets and japan emerging market equities broadly outperformed developed markets returning  and  respectively european equities saw a pullback in june global bonds sold off in june initially triggered by marginally hawkish comments from the president of the european central bank this sentiment was echoed across the major central banks throughout the month the federal reserve fed increased interest rates and indicated it expects one more increase if the economy performs as expected in addition the fed detailed a plan for unwinding its  trillion balance sheet which could begin before the end of  us employment report data announced at the beginning of june disappointed despite the disappointment relative to expectations the unemployment rate fell to its lowest level in  years news of high inventory levels and rising us production drove oil prices to a sevenmonth low looking ahead we maintain conviction in our prorisk positioning in light of the pickup in the economic growth outlook which has also led us to more regionally diversify this exposure outside the us we also maintain a more balanced currency exposure between the us dollar and global currencies given our view that the growth and interest rate gap is closing between the us and the rest of the world we continue to focus our risk in global equities and continue to increase exposure to both developed international and emerging markets equities to further diversify equity risk within developed international and emerging markets equities the fund is near its highest allocations held since inception given the expectation for potential future market volatility we hold some of our global equity exposure in call options as a way to manage risk but still capture potential market gains we continue to believe that credit will be the most attractive area within fixed income and strongly emphasize our credit positions relative to global government bonds within credit we diversify our exposure within high yield emerging markets debt nonagency mortgages and investmentgrade corporates however given our view that equities will outperform high yield we have reduced highyield exposure to focus our risk within equities and limit downside risk in the fund additionally we maintain exposure to

diversification does not guarantee investment returns and does not eliminate the risk of loss bonds are subject to interest rate risks bond prices generally fall when interest rates rise the price of equity securities may rise or fall because of changes in the broad market or changes in a companys financial condition sometimes rapidly or unpredictably equity securities are subject to stock market risk meaning that stock prices in general may decline over short or extended periods of time international investing involves a greater degree of risk and increased volatility changes in currency exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the us can raise or lower returns also some overseas markets may not be as politically and economically stable as the united states and other nations investments in emerging markets can be more volatile real estate investments may be subject to a higher degree of market risk because of concentration in a specific industry sector or geographical sector real estate investments may be subject to risks including but not limited to declines in the value of real estate risks related to general and economic conditions changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trust and defaults by borrower investments in commodities may have greater volatility than investments in traditional securities particularly if the instruments involve leverage the value of commoditylinked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements commodity index volatility changes in interest rates or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity such as drought floods weather livestock disease embargoes tariffs and international economic political and regulatory developments use of leveraged commoditylinked derivatives creates an opportunity for increased return but at the same time creates the possibility for greater loss derivatives may be riskier than other types of investments because they may be more sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions than other types of investments and could result in losses that significantly exceed the original investment the use of derivatives may not be successful resulting in investment losses and the cost of such strategies may reduce investment returns there is no guarantee that the use of long and short positions will succeed in limiting an investors exposure to domestic stock market movements capitalization sector swings or other risk factors investing using long and short selling strategies may have higher portfolio turnover rates short selling involves certain risks including additional costs associated with covering short positions and a possibility of unlimited loss on certain short sale positions

japan emerging market equities broadly outperformed developed markets returning  and  respectively european equities saw a pullback in june global bonds sold off in june initially triggered by marginally hawkish comments from the president of the european central bank this sentiment was echoed across the major central banks throughout the month the federal reserve fed increased interest rates and indicated it expects one more increase if the economy performs as expected in addition the fed detailed a plan for unwinding its  trillion balance sheet which could begin before the end of  us employment report data announced at the beginning of june disappointed despite the disappointment relative to expectations the unemployment rate fell to its lowest level in  years news of high inventory levels and rising us production drove oil prices to a sevenmonth low looking ahead we maintain conviction in our prorisk positioning in light of the pickup in the economic growth outlook which has also led us to more regionally diversify this exposure outside the us we also maintain a more balanced currency exposure between the us dollar and global currencies given our view that the growth and interest rate gap is closing between the us and the rest of the world we continue to focus our risk in global equities and continue to increase exposure to both developed international and emerging markets equities to further diversify equity risk within developed international and emerging markets equities the fund is near its highest allocations held since inception given the expectation for potential future market volatility we hold some of our global equity exposure in call options as a way to manage risk but still capture potential market gains we continue to believe that credit will be the most attractive area within fixed income and strongly emphasize our credit positions relative to global government bonds within credit we diversify our exposure within high yield emerging markets debt nonagency mortgages and investmentgrade corporates however given our view that equities will outperform high yield we have reduced highyield exposure to focus our risk
