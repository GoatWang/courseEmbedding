let me turn the call over to brad bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director good morning thanks for joining us today as you can see from the results we released this morning we had another great quarter and we covered our distribution yet again even with continued volatility in the crude markets turnaround activity at some of our customers refineries and an unprecedented amount of rainfall in south texas despite the rainfall as well as operational issues at thirdparty gas processing plant during the quarter we experienced increased throughput volumes in the corpus christi an average – a record of  barrels per day into our north beach terminal which benefited both the pipeline and storage segments we also set another singleday loading record of  barrels across our docks in june total eagle ford volumes increased from about  barrels per day in the second quarter of  to around  barrels per day in the second quarter of  if crude oil prices remain at current levels we still expect these throughput volumes to increase but more modestly in the back half of the year now let me spend a few minutes updating you on some of our internal growth projects at our last investor conference in may we discussed six projects that are currently under development to increase distillate and propane supply throughout the upper midwest those include a project to build an eightmile eightinch pipeline at our conway kansas facility and an expansion at our rock rapids iowa terminal for additional propane supply to chs one of our largest central east region customers we expect to complete the chs propane supply project by the end of this year and the remainder of the projects are scheduled to be completed by the first quarter of  in may we began filling our inch pipeline between mont belvieu and corpus christi texas with propane and began operating the system unfortunately shortly after starting up the line we experienced a pressure reduction and upon investigation we identified an area of unexpected localized corrosion we have suspended propane delivery service and we are conducting further assessments our current estimate is that we should have the line back in full service in the fourth quarter of  turning to corpus christi we remain on schedule to complete construction of  barrels of additional storage at our north beach terminal in the third quarter this additional storage will provide our customers with the flexibility to segregate and deliver processed condensate across our docks in addition we announced earlier this week that the port of corpus christi approved a lease that will give us the space to develop another private marine and loading dock at our north beach terminal were currently developing plans for the new dock which will be designed to load up the suezmaxclass vessels at rates up to  barrels per hour and the ability to expand to  barrels per hour once completed this new dock would give us access to four loading docks in the port of corpus christi including two private docks and allow us to load crude ships simultaneously on all four docks at a maximum rate close to  barrels per hour early estimates provide for completion of this fourth dock in the second quarter of  with regard to our proposed joint venture with pmi we realize that this process is taking longer than anticipated but both pmi and nustar remain committed to developing the new pipeline infrastructure to transport lpgs and refined products from the us into northern mexico we hope to finalize those agreements in the third quarter beyond the projects just mentioned we continue to actively look for ways to further expand our operations within the eagle ford and beyond the eagle ford into the permian basin as well as to increase our storage capacity at some of our large terminal facilities now im going to turn the call over to tom shoaf nustars executive vice president and cfo so he can provide you with some additional detail on second quarter results tom thomas r shoaf  chief financial officer  executive vice president thanks brad and good morning everyone for the second quarter of  we reported ebitda from continuing operations of  million compared to  million for the same period last year epu for the second quarter of  came in at  per unit which was at the high end of the guidance range of  to  per unit that we provided on last quarters call dcf from continuing operations available to limited partners for the quarter was  per unit which exceeded our guidance range of  to  per unit and covered the distribution to limited partners by  times during our segment performance ebitda in our pipeline segment increased to  million which is  million higher than the second quarter of  total revenues for the segment increased  mainly due to the continued strength of our south texas crude oil pipeline system additionally operating expenses for the segment decreased  compared to the second quarter of  primarily due to a decrease in power and maintenance costs for that period crude oil pipeline throughputs were up  compared to the second quarter of  mainly due to a  increase in eagle ford throughputs compared to the same period last year during the quarter total eagle ford volumes increased from about  barrels per day in the second quarter of  to around  barrels per day in the second quarter of  while volumes strictly into our corpus christi north beach terminal and ultimately across our docks increased  from  barrels per day to about  barrels per day which was our highest quarterly average to date strong eagle ford throughputs were partially offset during the quarter by turnaround activity and unplanned operational issues at some of the refineries served by our crude oil pipelines throughputs on our refined products pipelines decreased  to  barrels per day mainly due to increased turnaround activity lower demand on our east system and unfavorable weather and operational related issues on our ammonia line our storage segment generated  million of ebitda up  million from the second quarter of  throughput revenues increased  which continue to benefit from increased eagle ford crude volumes shipped on the south texas pipeline system storage revenues were up  mainly due to increased revenues from us now owning  of the linden terminal our fuels marketing segment earned  million of ebitda during the quarter down  million compared to the second quarter of  mainly due to lower margins and sales volumes across the segment nustar ga expenses were  million  million higher than the second quarter of  due in part to the expiration of the asphalt jv services agreement on june   our interest expense net of interest of income was  million compared to the same quarter last year our june  debt balance was  billion while our debttoebitda ratio was  times on july  nustar energys board of directors declared a second quarter distribution of  per unit which will be paid on august  nustar gp holdings board also declared a second quarter distribution of  per unit which will be paid on august  now let me spend a few minutes talking about our projections for the third quarter and full year  in the third quarter we expect results to be negatively impacted by maintenance and turnaround activity at some of our customers refineries and reduce throughput volume projections on some of our pipeline systems we also expect maintenance and reliability capital spending to increase as we get into the back half of the year third quarter ebitda results in the pipeline segment should be slightly higher than the third quarter of  and second quarter of  while ebitda results in the storage segment should be higher than the third quarter of  but lower than the second quarter of  we expect third quarter ebitda results in our fuels marketing segment to be lower than the third quarter of  and comparable to the second quarter of  during the third quarter of  we expect ga expenses to be in the range of  million to  million depreciation and amortization expense to be around  million and interest expense of approximately  million based on these projections third quarter  earnings per unit should be in the range of about  to  per unit while distributable cash flow from continuing operations per limited partner unit should be in the range of  to  per unit with regard to the segment ebitda guidance for the fullyear  we now expect our pipeline segment ebitda to be  million to  million higher than  due to reduced volume projections for the remainder of the year our storage segment ebitda is now projected to be  million to  million higher than  due to higherthanexpected storage throughputs in the first half of the year and favorable renewals at several of our terminals we continue to expect  ebitda results in our fuels marketing segment to be in the range of  million to  million with regard to  strategic capital spending we now expect spending in the  million to  million range which includes both internal growth projects and acquisition spending  reliability capital spending is now projected to be  million to  million and now let me turn it back over to brad for any final remarks bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director thank you tom were pleased with our solid second quarter and our yeartodate results and where there may be challenges in the second half of the year we still expect to cover the distribution for the fullyear  with the coverage ratio comparable to that of  and we continue to focus on growing our core feebased storage and pipeline operations as well as our distributable cash flow through organic internal growth projects and synergistic acquisitions at this time ill turn it over to the operator and we can open it up for qa questionandanswer session operator your first question comes from the line of brian zarahn from barclays your line is open brian joshua zarahn  barclays capital inc good morning bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director good morning brian joshua zarahn  barclays capital inc on ebitda guidance can you give a little more color on the change in the mix a little bit on the crude pipeline – on the pipeline segment is it – any impact from the belvieu to corpus ngl line and is it – any impact also for the lower crude prices and then on the storage side of things is it across the board crude and refined product storage or – a little more color on better results from that business bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director yeah on the pipeline segment its both those things theres some from mont belvieu and theres some from just commodity prices and throughputs in general in south texas which we expect to go up just not as rapidly as they have been going up and ill let danny talk a little bit about the storage segment daniel s oliver  senior vpbusiness  corporate development storage segment were very still but very highly utilized across the segment i think were right at  utilized but some of the contracts that weve been renewing specifically lately at st james linden and amsterdam have been stronger than we were predicting but its really kind of across the board strong renewals in that segment brian joshua zarahn  barclays capital inc but on the renewal the rates are a little bit better than we thought were you able to have a longer duration or is it similar duration whenever youre contracting for those facilities bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director similar durations were – right now i think we have lets see if i can find the number for you were right at    of our storage lease contracts are inside the year of exploration about  are one to three years and about  are three years or greater brian joshua zarahn  barclays capital inc and then looking at some of your growth projects is pemex is that more of an update in the third quarter do you think the project will be finalized in the third quarter bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director we believe itll be finalized and we know its taken a long time to get that done a lot of that has to do with – were really not negotiating commercial terms with pmi right now but a lot of the delay i think has had to do with our jv partners pmi negotiations with their customer who is pemex brian joshua zarahn  barclays capital inc okay and then on the corpus stock expansion is that anticipated to be more for crude or are you positioning more for condensate or just it could be flexibility for either bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director flexibility for either brian joshua zarahn  barclays capital inc okay and then the last one for me on the guidance for capex was the modest increase in expansion capex more for the new propane project and then on maintenance is that just more of a timing issue christopher c russell  vice president  investor relations and treasurer brian this is chris russell on the maintenance side thats more of a timing issue some of the projects just got deferred into next year on the strategic side were building some tanks at st james that we didnt have weve got those capital costs in the forecast now we didnt have those in there initially and weve also got a couple more tanks at corpus that weve included in the strategic capital for this year brian joshua zarahn  barclays capital inc okay and then on st james whats the – since thats now a definite project whats the expansion christopher c russell  vice president  investor relations and treasurer its a couple of tanks that were building down there im not sure what the volume is danny do you know daniel s oliver  senior vpbusiness  corporate development yeah its  or  barrels between the two tanks those should go into service in the first half of next year of unknown speaker its two s brian joshua zarahn  barclays capital inc and so that gets you close to about  million barrels in st james christopher c russell  vice president  investor relations and treasurer right daniel s oliver  senior vpbusiness  corporate development right brian joshua zarahn  barclays capital inc okay thanks guys daniel s oliver  senior vpbusiness  corporate development you bet bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director thank you operator your next question comes from steve sherowski from goldman sachs your line is open steve c sherowski  goldman sachs  co hey good morning just a couple of quick ones apologies if i missed this but is there any way you could quantify what the volume impact on the crude lines was from the floods in thirdparty processing plants being down in the second quarter daniel s oliver  senior vpbusiness  corporate development thats kind of hard to do but i think it probably cost us somewhere in the neighborhood of  barrels a day to  barrels a day starting around the end of may through the first half of july or the first week or so of july steve c sherowski  goldman sachs  co got you okay that helps and for storage renewals any way you can talk about roughly what rate on average youre seeing or what percentage youre seeing in terms of the increase in rates on like a weighted average basis daniel s oliver  senior vpbusiness  corporate development no i dont really have that its so different from location to location i dont have that in front of me right now maybe we could get you some of that i dont have that in front of me steve c sherowski  goldman sachs  co okay no fair enough and just a quick final question what type of returns are you targeting for your new corpus terminal and can you comment on the capex spending daniel s oliver  senior vpbusiness  corporate development no i really dont think we can comment yet were still working on the final engineering on that project as you saw earlier this week weve got the lease signed with the port we filed for permits were working with the army corps of engineers weve had initial drawings submitted some initial engineering but weve still got a little bit of work to do on the engineering of that project steve c sherowski  goldman sachs  co got you and is that project going to be backstopped by volume commitments from customers or just how are the contracts going to be structured daniel s oliver  senior vpbusiness  corporate development it will be backstopped by commitments from customers steve c sherowski  goldman sachs  co got you okay thats it for me thank you daniel s oliver  senior vpbusiness  corporate development you bet operator your next question comes from the line of jeremy tonet from jpmorgan your line is open jeremy b tonet  jpmorgan securities llc good morning bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director good morning daniel s oliver  senior vpbusiness  corporate development good morning jeremy b tonet  jpmorgan securities llc i was wondering given the improvement in storage conditions that you – storage markets that you talked about if you could comment on piney point and what youre seeing there bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director not a lot at piney point thats strictly a contango terminal were watching that very closely staying in contact with some of our customers who would be interested in that the steepness of the contango curve has just not been sufficient to warrant that interest yet we have – basically we have that terminal mothballed right now it costs us very little to keep that terminal mothballed just waiting for the right market conditions jeremy b tonet  jpmorgan securities llc that makes sense and it might be a difficult question to answer but just wanted to see if you could provide any general thoughts on project potential upstream of the dock or what does new – with what you just talked about the corpus what could be the growth opportunity off that daniel s oliver  senior vpbusiness  corporate development the dock is supported by a project upstream that would involve both pipe and storage but its too early to comment on that project right now jeremy b tonet  jpmorgan securities llc got you and could there be further upside even or what the magnitude of the impact could be if the export ban were to be changed daniel s oliver  senior vpbusiness  corporate development absolutely absolutely but this project will – in fact i think brad mentioned it in his notes but this project already and starting in august will allow for a segregated stream of processed condensate all the way through our system to and through north beach jeremy b tonet  jpmorgan securities llc great thats helpful and then just one last one for me theres been some notable ma deals announced in the mlp space recently and discussion of sector consolidation appears to be picking up do you see nustar participating in this trend i was just curious as to your appetite to engage in ma do you see ns as more of a buyer or a seller or any thoughts there bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director obviously ourselves is more of a buyer than a seller in terms of the trend yeah i mean its obvious that there is consolidation taking place and were always on the lookout for good deals we prefer to grow organically and – but at some point we will – and were always actually looking for synergistic acquisitions jeremy b tonet  jpmorgan securities llc great thanks for that operator your next question comes from the line of mark reichman from simmons your line is open mark la france reichman  simmons  company international good morning i just wanted to go back – someone had asked about the guidance in the pipeline segment i just wanted to go back and revisit that a little bit last quarter it seemed like you kind of raised your expectations in terms of the ebitda contributions from the pipeline segment and now youve kind of moved it back to whats kind of your older expectations and so with the refined products the turnaround doesnt seem like that would have much of a – probably have much of a revenue impact so just looking at the crude oil pipeline throughputs whats your expectation i mean in terms of the crude oil throughput i guess what im kind of looking for is just little more specifics with how you might expect to end the year on just the crude oil pipelines and just kind of specifically what the driver is for the lowered expectations daniel s oliver  senior vpbusiness  corporate development yeah basically we – this is danny oliver by the way we still expect our crude volumes to grow through the end of the year just given the current price deck weve assumed that that growth may be a little bit more modest than we have had expected last quarter of course thats still subject to change i cant predict the price of crude oil but the basis – thats whats behind the change in the guidance as far as the crude pipelines go mark la france reichman  simmons  company international and when youre talking about growth you were at what  barrels per day in the first quarter are you talking about from the average in  or would you expect to finish at the end of the year higher or lower than the first quarter volumes daniel s oliver  senior vpbusiness  corporate development so its really all about our south texas crude system the eagle ford barrels mark la france reichman  simmons  company international right daniel s oliver  senior vpbusiness  corporate development so we expect the second half of  to grow versus the first half of  and certainly for many period in  weve just leveled out some of that – some of our growth expectations in the second half of this year mark la france reichman  simmons  company international so i had it like roughly around  i mean would that be a reasonable expectation or  thomas r shoaf  chief financial officer  executive vice president are you talking strictly crude mark mark la france reichman  simmons  company international yeah just crude oil pipeline thomas r shoaf  chief financial officer  executive vice president thats probably a little aggressive mark la france reichman  simmons  company international little aggressive okay that was kind of a yearend run rate okay thats helpful and then on – i was just thinking because actually the quarter came in pretty much in line with at least my expectations and so a lot of this was already kind of known in the first quarter when you kind of raised your expectations and now youre lowering them so i just didnt know if there was something drastically changed other than just – is it just primarily volumes  daniel s oliver  senior vpbusiness  corporate development its just volumes but whats changed since the first quarter is now were sitting on  crude mark la france reichman  simmons  company international well yeah yeah all right yeah clearly and then i wanted to also ask a little bit about the deal with chs that looks like a positive – kind of incremental positive project maybe not as big a deal as the expansion of the dock space down in corpus but could you just provide a little more color on that particular project and are there any other opportunities to expand along with that coops business daniel s oliver  senior vpbusiness  corporate development i believe there is we continue to talk – we have a very good relationship with chs we continue to talk to them about opportunities to help them out as they grow their business up there our current ill call it a basket of projects is really six different projects but they all have to do with either increasing propane supply up into the northern part of the system coming out of conway or increasing refined products through peak periods in their peak demand seasons up into the northern part of that system but all six of those projects are incremental or will provide incremental ebitda to us and as brad mentioned some of the propane project should come online here in the fourth quarter – we believe early in the fourth quarter of this year and the rest in the first quarter of  mark la france reichman  simmons  company international okay and then just one last item when you reported your earnings in the last quarter was the ferc pipeline adjustment was that pretty much in line with your expectations in terms of the tariff increase that you got beginning july  i mean at that time daniel s oliver  senior vpbusiness  corporate development yes yeah it was mark la france reichman  simmons  company international okay great well thank you very much daniel s oliver  senior vpbusiness  corporate development youre welcome bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director thank you operator your next question comes from the line of cory garcia from raymond james your line is open cory j garcia  raymond james  associates inc good morning fellas just kind of circling back to the chs question from just a second ago i believe you guys referenced sort of a  million sort of number for capex regarding that project first – i mean not if you correct me if im wrong there but just wondering how that – or how we should use that kind of going from propane to obviously the remainder of the project that dont hit into  just trying to see how that contribution works its way through what the step change is really  versus  christopher c russell  vice president  investor relations and treasurer yeah cory this chris russell the ebitda multiple is going to be our normal  ebitda multiple i would say maybe a third of that capex comes online with the propane system in late  and then the remaining twothirds kind of ratchets up the last half of  and early  cory j garcia  raymond james  associates inc okay thats perfect thanks and then also sort of switching focus from a bigger picture strategic standpoint and obviously potentially broadening your guys reach i know you guys referenced sort of the permian in the past should we be thinking about if there is any project opportunity set there itll be more cruderelated or is there even some ngl type of angles that you guys are exploring there bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director were looking at both and if you know anything about the permian it is the sort of the granddaddy of all the shale plays and we think theres a lot of opportunity on multiple fronts with the permian so were investigating several projects there cory j garcia  raymond james  associates inc okay great thanks for the color guys operator your next question comes from the line of john edwards from credit suisse your line is open john edwards  credit suisse securities usa llc broker yeah thanks for taking my question just if we could step back bigger picture just given the kind of commodities price environment were in just bigger picture maybe longer term in terms of your opportunity set that youre looking at i mean are you seeing it stay about the same are you seeing it fall off a bit seeing it rise a bit maybe if you could just comment directionally how thats looking bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director i would say its probably about the same we have great relationships with really good customers particularly in the eagle ford and so i think theres more business to be done – to be built around those customers there so were looking at several projects there so it is a challenging environment but we do think theres still opportunity john edwards  credit suisse securities usa llc broker okay so would it – kind of the capex run rate youre at right now would that be pretty fair going forward the next couple of years would you say bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director thats what wed like to target john edwards  credit suisse securities usa llc broker okay great thanks thats all i had thank you operator your next question comes from the line of selman akyol from stifel your line is open selman akyol  stifel nicolaus  co inc thank you good morning just going back to the pipeline segment real quick in terms of your operational expenses for this quarter is that a good run rate just going through the rest of the year the way you see things ramping up thomas r shoaf  chief financial officer  executive vice president im sorry you mean as far as throughputs go selman bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director no opex  thomas r shoaf  chief financial officer  executive vice president opex  selman akyol  stifel nicolaus  co inc on the opex expense the  million thomas r shoaf  chief financial officer  executive vice president opex were probably going to see our maintenance expense pick up in the back half of the year specifically in the pipeline segment but opex in the storage segment should be pretty pretty flat going forward i would think selman akyol  stifel nicolaus  co inc all right and then could you give a little more color in terms of in and around your corrosion issues and how much pipeline was affected and then i guess what are you doing in terms of looking at the rest of the line it seems like if it was a small piece that would come back on maybe a little bit quicker so im just wondering how big of an issue is it do you think you have on this pipeline bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director like i said we had an issue there weve investigated it were conducting further assessments and its going to take a while to get that data in so well know more later in the year selman akyol  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay and then in terms of – did you guys say how far you are through your capex budgets how much youve incurred so far in terms of the  million to  million thomas r shoaf  chief financial officer  executive vice president we did earlier  selman akyol  stifel nicolaus  co inc yeartodate thomas r shoaf  chief financial officer  executive vice president weve spent – that  million to  million includes  million we spent on linden and then weve spent about so if we backed that out selman that leaves about  million to be spent on internal growth projects and of that  million weve spent about  million of that through the first half of the year selman akyol  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay so  thomas r shoaf  chief financial officer  executive vice president were about halfway through the internal growth projects selman akyol  stifel nicolaus  co inc got you thomas r shoaf  chief financial officer  executive vice president – in terms of the guidance selman akyol  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay and then i guess last kind of questions from me but in terms of just looking at the balance sheet and everything in terms of financing the rest of this – can you just remind me on what your plans are for that bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director yeah i mean right now i think we have some anticipated equity possibly in the back half of the year im still looking at and its not imminent that we would need to issue any equity in the back half of the year its a very fine line there for us in terms of whether well need it or not no real debt capital markets plans at this time for  so maybe a little equity thats a big if were not really sure yet but no debt selman akyol  stifel nicolaus  co inc all right do you have an atm in place bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director well we filed a shelf registration for the atm we renewed an old one that we had and were in the process of putting an atm out there which we expect to do in the third quarter selman akyol  stifel nicolaus  co inc all right thank you very much appreciate the time operator your next question comes from the line of faisel khan from citigroup your line is open faisel h khan  citigroup global markets inc broker thanks good morning most of my questions have been answered but i just have one question on the new york harbor acquisition and the rest of your jv can you just talk a little bit about what – how those assets are performing now that you have the full – you have sort of full control over the entire asset base daniel s oliver  senior vpbusiness  corporate development sure its performing very well in fact weve renewed some contracts in linden that are a little better than we were anticipating were also working – in early stages of working a project for an expansion in that facility which – hopefully we have more to say about that maybe around the end of this year or early next year faisel h khan  citigroup global markets inc broker so would the scope of that expansion be more product storage or more dock capacity whats sort of the demand from customers for additional services bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director its more of product storage and we have sufficient capacity on our docks there to handle the expansion that were contemplating faisel h khan  citigroup global markets inc broker okay so the docks arent – when you say the docks arent being fully utilized because of maybe youre not having as much storage as youd like or how would you describe it bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director correct correct faisel h khan  citigroup global markets inc broker and with that if you increase the storage i mean whats the thing with the dock capacity there whats the percentages being utilized right now and what could it be going forward bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director well its probably  to  now so weve got room for additional storage across those docks faisel h khan  citigroup global markets inc broker okay got you and as i understood the last question on the atm so right now youre not – you havent issued any equity under your old atm program is that right or  bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director no we didnt it was just a tiny bit that was done few years ago but no effectively no we really havent issued anything under it faisel h khan  citigroup global markets inc broker okay got it thanks for the time appreciate it operator your next question comes from the line of louis shamie from zimmer partners your line is open louis shamie  zimmer partners lp hi good morning everyone so my question was just mostly around the corpus christi potential dock expansion i just wanted a little bit more of a broad deal of whats going on around there how it relates with the sort of phase  of your eagle ford project and put it in the context of potential competition lot other midstream guys have infrastructure in that area and theyve got similar projects so sort of where do you stand with that in the competitive landscape daniel s oliver  senior vpbusiness  corporate development i think we have probably the greatest capacity to load eagle ford crude out in the corpus area our customers experience very little demurrage or time waiting on a dock as brad mentioned in his notes weve been setting records of almost – singleday records almost  barrels thats very important when you have several ships show up at the same time and want to get their crude out but again thats why were very busy in corpus now and utilizing our docks we do have some expansion plans that were working on and its nice to be able to grow these pipeline demands and things like that but you have to take care of business at the dock or it just doesnt all work louis shamie  zimmer partners lp so the idea would be that youd come up with some plans and then go into an open season or something like that to market it daniel s oliver  senior vpbusiness  corporate development it may or may not involve an open season but we do have some definite specific expansion projects that were working in the eagle ford right now louis shamie  zimmer partners lp got it can you talk a little bit about what the potential capital spend would be for those plans daniel s oliver  senior vpbusiness  corporate development its a little early for that louis shamie  zimmer partners lp okay and then the last thing i wanted to ask about was the st james rail facility what have you guys been seeing there and whats your expectation of how that performs over next few years daniel s oliver  senior vpbusiness  corporate development its hard to talk about expectations because the lls spreads vary and we certainly saw on the first half of this year those spreads were almost flat to wti to lss and those volumes in st james went to basically nothing or down to our contract minimums but weve seen here just in the last couple of months is those spreads have improved and weve seen some incremental volume coming back over those systems louis shamie  zimmer partners lp got it okay thank you very much daniel s oliver  senior vpbusiness  corporate development good operator your next question comes from the line of lin shen from hite your line is open lin shen  hite hedge asset management llc hey good morning just – we have a quick question about corpus christi just wondering like what are the current destination to receive crude or products from your corpus christi dock now and do you think that their same destination will be used to have enough capacity to receive your expansion project bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director right now ships leave our corpus christi facility and they head up the coast to refining centers in houston they head up to louisiana some of the ships head up to canada so i would think – and i think your question further ask what would happen at the crude export ban were lifted theres a great potential for those ships to go almost anywhere mexico has talked about projects with the united states to take us crude into mexico well be well positioned to handle that crude as well lin shen  hite hedge asset management llc okay great thank you bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director youre welcome operator there are no further audio questions

us today as you may have seen in this mornings press release  is off to a great start as we were able to cover our distribution  times in the first quarter this marks the fourth consecutive quarter that weve covered our distribution let me walk you through some of the positive developments from the first quarter at the beginning of the year we purchased the remaining  interest in our linden terminal joint venture this immediately accretive transaction had a positive effect on our first quarter results and has already provided synergies with our adjacent whollyowned terminal during the first quarter we moved record and higher than expected eagle ford throughput volumes on our south texas crude oil pipeline system the late february completion of an expansion to our south texas system contributed to these record volumes and increased the throughput capacity of our system to  barrels per day our storage segment also benefited from record eagle ford throughputs during the quarter as our corpus christi north beach terminal set records for the amount of crude that was loaded across its docks during the quarter we loaded an average of approximately  barrels per day and set a single day loading record of  barrels in early february although were pleased with the performance of our south texas system so far this year we realized that our throughput volumes could be negatively affected as we progress throughout the remainder of the year if crude oil prices remain at current levels or decline further we are cautiously optimistic that throughput levels in the eagle ford will remain strong but remain conservative in our projections given the uncertainty exists in the crude markets now let me spend a few minutes updating you on some of our internal growth projects im happy to report that we completed construction on our mont belvieu inch pipeline conversion project if you recall last year we signed a longterm agreement with occidental petroleum to ship ngls on nustars currently idled mile inch pipeline between mont belvieu and corpus christi texas we plan to commence line fill in may earlier this month we announced that we increased naphtha storage capacity at our edinburg terminal by  barrels to accommodate additional grades and volumes we also extended our agreement with pmi for an additional year to transport naphtha on our burgosvalley pipeline system to our edinburg terminal in addition we continue to work with pmi to finalize the agreements associated with the proposed joint venture and wish the two companies will develop new pipeline infrastructure to transport lpgs and refined products from us into northern mexico we hope to finalize the agreement in the second quarter in the third quarter this year we expect to complete the construction of  barrels of additional storage at our corpus christi north beach terminal this additional storage will provide our customers with the flexibility to segregate and store additional grades of crude and condensate in addition were actively looking for ways to further expand our operations in south texas and increase our storage capacity at some of our facilities further details on these projects will be provided throughout the year as they develop now im going to turn the call over to tom shoaf nustars executive vice president and cfo so he can provide you with some additional detail on our first quarter results thomas r shoaf  chief financial officer  executive vice president thanks brad and good morning everyone for the first quarter of  we reported ebitda from continuing operations of  million and adjusted ebitda from continuing operations of  million with or without the  million gain associated with acquiring the remaining  of our linden terminal joint venture ebitda from continuing operations was the highest first quarter ebitda ever reported in our history  dcf from continuing operations available to limited partners covered the distribution to the limited partners by  times our highest first quarter distribution coverage since  adjusted epu for the first quarter of  improved  over the first quarter  epu to  per unit from  per unit and exceeded our guidance range of  to  per unit dcf from continuing operations available to limited partners for the quarter was  per unit  higher than the  per unit generated in the first quarter of  which again exceeded our guidance range of  to  per unit our first quarter results exceeded our guidance expectations primarily due to higher than expected eagle ford throughput volumes stronger than expected margins in our fuels marketing segment and some foreign exchange gains realized in the first quarter during our segment performance or turning to our segment performance ebitda in our pipeline segment to  million which is  million higher than the first quarter of  within the segment we experienced a  increase in total throughputs and a  increase in total revenues first quarter throughputs on our crude oil pipeline system were up  and exceeded  million barrels per day for the first time in our history due to increased eagle ford throughputs and increased crude oil demand at one of our customers refineries that was in turnaround in early  eagle ford volumes increased  from about  barrels a day in the first quarter of  to around  barrels per day in the first quarter of  throughputs on our refined products pipelines increased  to  barrels per day benefiting from increased production at a customers refinery that was in turnaround during last years first quarter our storage segment generated  million of ebitda up  million from the first quarter  throughput revenues increased  also benefiting from increased eagle ford crude volumes shipped on the south texas pipeline system storage revenues were up  due to increased revenues from us now owning a  of the linden terminal as well as higher lease utilization rates at our st eustatius and point tupper terminals these increased revenues were partially offset by reduced unit train activity at our st james louisiana terminal our fuels marketing segment earned  million of ebitda during the quarter up slightly over the first quarter  stronger than expected margins on our bunkering operations were mostly offset by challenging market conditions in our heavy fuels trading operations nustars ga expenses were  million  million higher than the first quarter of  largely due to expiration of the asphalt jv services agreement on june   our interest expense net of interest income was  million down  million from last years first quarter our march  debt balance was  billion while our debt to ebitda ratio was  times on april  nustar energys board of directors declared a first quarter distribution of  per unit which will be paid on may  nustar gp holdings board also declared a first quarter distribution of  per unit which will be paid on may  now let me spend a few minutes talking about our predictions for the second quarter and full year  while our first quarter results were very strong we expect our second quarter results to be negatively impacted by a day turnaround at one of our customers refineries as well as seasonal increases in maintenance operating expenses and reliability capital spending second quarter ebitda results in the pipeline and storage segments should be higher than the second quarter of  but lower than the first quarter of  we expect second quarter ebitda results in our fuels marketing segment to be lower than the second quarter of  and the first quarter of  as we feel bunkering margins will return to more historic norms during the second quarter of  we expect ga expenses to be in the range of  million to  million depreciation and amortization expense to be around  million and interest expense of approximately  million based on these projections second quarter  earnings per unit should be  to  per unit while distributable cash flow from continuing operations per limited partner unit should be in the range of  to  per unit with regard to segment ebitda guidance for the full year of  we now expect our pipeline segment ebitda to be  million to  million higher than  due to the higher than expected throughputs we experienced on our south texas crude oil pipeline system in the first quarter of  our storage segment ebitda is still projected to be  million to  million higher than  while we continue to expect  ebitda results in our fuels marketing segment to be in the range of  million to  million with regard to  strategic capital spending we continue to expect spending in the  million to  million range which includes internal growth and acquisition spending  reliability capital spending is now projected to be  million to  million and now with that let me turn it back over to brad for any final remarks bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director with a record first quarter behind us and the projections tom just provided you we once again expect to cover the distribution for the full year  with a coverage ratio comparable to that in  even with the uncertainty in the crude markets we continue to focus on growing our core feebased storage and pipeline operations that are executing our internal growth capital program identifying synergistic acquisitions we expect this strategy to allow us to continue to build strong foundation for dcf growth in the future i turn it back over to you chris christopher c russell  treasurer  headinvestor relations okay now were ready to open up to qa john questionandanswer session operator certainly and our first question comes from the line of steve sherowski from goldman sachs steve c sherowski  goldman sachs  co hi good morning on the pipeline segment your south texas phase  project did that roughly contribute about half a quarters worth of cash flow during the first quarter bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director roughly that steve c sherowski  goldman sachs  co if i understood that correctly bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director thats correct steve c sherowski  goldman sachs  co okay and your houston inch line when is – thats expected to come on next month is that correct as well bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director thats correct well start line fill in may steve c sherowski  goldman sachs  co okay and then so i guess im just trying to drill down on guidance so youve increased the midpoint of your yearoveryear pipeline growth by roughly  million but it looks like first quarter was up about  million yearoveryear and i recognize that included a partial quarter contribution from the south texas phase  project and also the phase  project but it still seems like guidance is pretty conservative which you alluded to in your opening remarks im just trying to get a sense of are you expecting throughput on these pipelines on your south texas system to decline at all during the remaining half of the year just what are your thoughts that really drove that are behind your guidance and what are you thinking later on in the year in terms of volume growth bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director yeah no were not expecting any decline in those volumes although we have tempered the growth that we had originally expected in our budget on those lines so i think on the eagle ford today were doing right at  barrels a day average  barrels in the first quarter but throughout the remainder of the year were expecting about  barrels a day of growth mostly in the fourth quarter due to some specific customer conversations that were having but thats about half of the growth that we had originally anticipated in our budget steve c sherowski  goldman sachs  co okay thats helpful and obviously you had strong coverage this quarter i guess you expect full year coverage to be roughly in line with last year any thoughts on growing your distribution or any changes to how youre thinking about that bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director we were taking bets on whether thatd be the first question steve c sherowski  goldman sachs  co second question bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director last year this time the big question was will we cut the distribution weve worked our way out of that and so the first step for us has been to secure the distribution we feel like weve done that now the next step for us particularly in an uncertain market is to increase our distribution coverage ratio when we feel like that is sufficient then we will entertain a distribution increase were not there yet were working towards that and thats really about all i can tell you steve c sherowski  goldman sachs  co got you okay thats helpful and just a quick final question any thoughts on your potential project backlog i think your – based on last guidance youre roughly in the  billion range of potential projects has that changed at all or just how youre thinking about that bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director about right i mean the uncertainty in the crude oil markets makes it more difficult to do some of the big projects that youre looking at its harder for producers to want to commit they dont know what the environment looks like but were still confident that we have a lot of good projects out there that are either bolton to what we are doing synergistically what were doing or maybe even some greenfield project so yeah id say thats still a good number steve c sherowski  goldman sachs  co okay thats it from me thank you operator our next question comes from the line of theresa chen from barclays capital theresa chen  barclays capital inc good morning following up on the last question about the project backlog can you just give us an update on your discussion with customers on potentially exporting condensate from corpus christi bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director sure weve got active conversations going on with several of our customers in the eagle ford we are in the process of building some additional storage in our south texas crude system that will allow us to segregate that stream we have several customers that are processing condensate in the field so were working towards that goal and hope to be in a situation probably by the end of this year where we can segregate those volumes for export theresa chen  barclays capital inc got it and on the pemex pipeline project could you provide us with some additional color on how thats going potentially what do you think the cost of the project could be bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director we havent given any guidance to that yet its a little early we expect to complete our negotiations in all of the contracts here in the second quarter and then well be able to provide a little more color at that point theresa chen  barclays capital inc understood and in terms of storage what are you seeing in terms of the general trends in crude and refined product storage rates for current contract renewals bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director i think were minus piney point which is a mothballed facility we have were about  fully utilized in our storage segment so its a healthy market i think the contango in the crude market has bolstered that segment for us and were starting to see some indications of strengthening in prices but its solid theresa chen  barclays capital inc okay thank you and last one from me so in regards to your capex guidance the organic capex guidance for full year can you just give us a sense of what you think that will be in the first quarter how the cadence of that guidance will be broken out throughout the year thomas r shoaf  chief financial officer  executive vice president first quarter the strategic capital spending was  million and then we also had the acquisition of the linden terminal for another  million and then our liability spending in the first quarter was  million theresa chen  barclays capital inc thank you very much operator our next question comes from the line of shneur gershuni from ubs shneur z gershuni  ubs securities llc hey good morning guys bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director good morning shneur z gershuni  ubs securities llc just kind of want to ask some follow ups on some of the questions that have already been asked i guess starting with the pemex contract i mean are you guys at the stage where everything in principal is basically been agreed to and its just lawyers trading paperwork at this point or is there still like an active negotiation actually occurring bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director no were really working on finalizing the legal documents thats where were at shneur z gershuni  ubs securities llc okay so this is just dealing with the government entity and it just always takes longer bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director correct shneur z gershuni  ubs securities llc okay and then just kind of wanted to follow up – just sort of on your guidance for this year and so forth i mean i kind of want to know – or i was wondering if you can isolate what in your opinion was somewhat temporary versus what you sort of think about is kind of on an ongoing basis i mean do we view this stepup in the pipeline segment is really just sort of a temporary stepup and you know thats why youre sort of hesitant on making more bullish coverage statements and growth statements and so forth bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director i think – yeah we can answer that i think the stepup in pipeline volumes we expect that to remain steady over the year i think what we want to convey is that the growth wont be ramping up as fast as what we had budgeted for in terms of things that could change throughout the year one big thing is bunker margins were very strong in the first quarter and we see that probably normalizing through the second half of the year another thing that contributed to a very strong first quarter is that most of our maintenance capex takes place in the second and third so you have very little of that in the first quarter you see that ramping up in the second which will bring it down from the first quite a bit so are there other things tom thomas r shoaf  chief financial officer  executive vice president no that was pretty much it shneur z gershuni  ubs securities llc so thomas r shoaf  chief financial officer  executive vice president weve got customer turnaround in the second quarter as well that will mute the results there bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director right shneur z gershuni  ubs securities llc so i mean – so the strong coverage for the quarter is pretty strong i mean maybe you take a couple of basis points off for a couple of – a couple of things that worked the right way but its still a solid number in your opinion and thats the way we should look at it correct bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director i mean it was a great quarter and we plan to have a great year what im trying to convey is the second quarter isnt going to be nearly as strong as the first shneur z gershuni  ubs securities llc okay thats fair and then in terms of the distribution growth – and yes i know you went from – is it going to be there last year to now were asking about growth and so forth i was wondering if maybe you can expand a little bit on the sign posts that youre looking for i think you mentioned you want to build coverage next and so forth is there kind of a number that you want to get to coverage wise does your net debt to ebitda leverage ratio also play into that as you triangulate as to when to step forward do some of the new projects do you want to hold back some cash potentially for that is retained dcf sort of part of your philosophy now as well so if you can sort of expand the discussion a little bit as to how we should be thinking about how youre thinking when it finally comes time to raise it thomas r shoaf  chief financial officer  executive vice president sure i mean the way we look at it is we need a strong foundation in order to weather any sort of storm we dont want to live close to the edge on the distribution coverage ratio so we want to make sure that theres enough cushion built in that we can weather anything that comes our way what is that number i cant tell you exactly is it  times is it  times who knows theres not a precise number in mind probably the more important thing is we need visibility towards for big streams of dcf coming our way and as we continue to execute on our projects those things will develop shneur z gershuni  ubs securities llc does the fact that you potentially have a lot of project potentially cause you to want to retain dcf and run a higher coverage ratio to help fund that for a period of time or you would just sort of view each project on its own merits and raise the equity thats necessary thomas r shoaf  chief financial officer  executive vice president no its not really about trying to fund the projects we have plenty of capital to do that its more about – some of these projects we have in development that weve talked about getting those to a point where they are viable they are working its a project thats in construction and we can see that ebitda coming in on those projects is going to be imminent so once we start bringing some of that backlog into the front and getting some of those projects across the finish line weve talked about pmi and some others we can feel a little better about talking about distribution increases shneur z gershuni  ubs securities llc okay cool all right thank you very much guys bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director thank you operator our next question comes from the line of cory garcia from raymond james cory j garcia  raymond james  associates inc good morning fellows great quarter bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director thank you cory j garcia  raymond james  associates inc if we take a look at the st james market and then perhaps some potentially changing dynamics in that market from a crude standpoint several of potential projects bringing more the inland shale crude into that market over the next couple of years what sort of storage expansion opportunities or even sort of participation in other projects should we look at and as we see maybe potentially leveraging that growth of your current and potential st james assets bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director we would expect any one of those changes in the market maybe the reversal of cap line some other pipelines coming over from the beaumont area coming into louisiana would generate additional storage interest were waiting for those to happen but we do think that any of those would probably generate some additional interest cory j garcia  raymond james  associates inc okay so right now its more of a wait and see as those projects come to fruition bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director right cory j garcia  raymond james  associates inc got you okay thank you guys operator our next question comes from the line of mark reichman from simmons mark la france reichman  simmons  company international thank you just had a couple of questions first on the transportation segment it seems like the operating expenses were at least lower relative to my expectations did they come in pretty normal to your expectations or was there something there in terms of lower operating expenses within the transportation segment thomas r shoaf  chief financial officer  executive vice president no i think they came in pretty much along our expectations mark mark la france reichman  simmons  company international okay and then on the projects mainly the naphtha project that was announced you talked about the agreement was revised with a slight increase in throughput commitment but youve added roughly what  barrels of storage capacity could you just maybe provide some additional color on what the upside to nustar is within that segment going forward as a result of that contract and then with regard to the propane project i think youd mentioned in your last call that if you could get an agreement struck within the first quarter that you would expect that project to commence service in the second half of  and so this modest delay in terms of getting the contracts finalize that has no impact on the timing of the project right bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director well let me address your second question first the propane line is – were commencing linefill in may it will be in service in may thomas r shoaf  chief financial officer  executive vice president hes talking about pmi bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director oh its pmi okay yeah were out late  early  now on that project going into service on the naphtha project basically what happened there is we had an agreement with pmi to – they ship one grade of naphtha this allows us to ship two different grades we increased their td commitment by  barrels a day but the biggest thing is we were able to renew that contract for  years mark la france reichman  simmons  company international okay and when you bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director thats a real upside there mark la france reichman  simmons  company international yeah well i mean – but in terms of the additional cost of constructing the additional  barrels of capacity i mean are the economics better now as a result of your – in terms of the new contract as it applies to your expanded capital commitment to that project thomas r shoaf  chief financial officer  executive vice president yes because we were able to increase the volumes without being able to ship two grades of naphtha they would have reduced their commitment to us on a volume basis significantly its worth about  million a year mark la france reichman  simmons  company international okay great and then i guess lastly there has been talk about conversion of a bulk terminal in vancouver in order to receive crude by rail and i was just wondering where that project stands if there is any color you can provide there bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director were still working through the permitting process on that and so there is really not much else to say about other than were diligently pursuing the permit mark la france reichman  simmons  company international is the permit – whose – is that vancouver bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director uhhuh mark la france reichman  simmons  company international okay and then what would be – what type of i mean is it premature to talk about maybe the timing of commencement of the service from the point of receiving the permit and in terms of what kind of volumes you might envision bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director yeah i mean i think the volumes there would be fairly small the project is currently the air permit is less than  barrels a day or  barrels a day mark la france reichman  simmons  company international okay okay bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director it is less than  barrels a day mark la france reichman  simmons  company international okay bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director so as rail projects like that go its relatively small mark la france reichman  simmons  company international yeah okay great thank you very much and good quarter bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director thank you operator our next question comes from the line of matt niblack from hite matt niblack  hite hedge asset management llc my questions were answered thank you bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director thank you operator our next question comes from the line of selman akyol from stifel selman akyol  stifel nicolaus  co inc thank you good morning couple of quick followup questions as it relates to the pipeline expenses i mean down pretty sharply from q and i know youve got phase  coming online you got the ngl pipeline coming online so is that kind of a base rate and then incremental for those other pipelines coming on thomas r shoaf  chief financial officer  executive vice president as far as the base rate goes selman i think im looking real quick they should increase a little bit as they go through the years because were going to have more maintenance cost hit us in the second quarter and the third quarter so thats probably the low point of the year to be honest with you as far as opex goes selman akyol  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay thomas r shoaf  chief financial officer  executive vice president as brad said earlier our maintenance tends to pick up in the second and third quarters and so we should be higher as we go through the year selman akyol  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay and then previously on piney point you said that storage just really works in a contango market i was just kind of wondering whats going on with that asset right now bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director well its still currently mothballed we still dont have any contango on the gasoline side the contango on the distillate side is not very steep the last time i looked a few days ago i think it was about  a barrel per month thats not going to pay for time value of money alone much less storage so the markets have improved theyre just not quite there to generate that kind of interest yet selman akyol  stifel nicolaus  co inc all right thanks and then last one maintenance capital looks like its up at the midpoint slightly from your previous guidance anything going on there thomas r shoaf  chief financial officer  executive vice president we just increased the amount of our api  tank maintenance work weve got some tanks coming on that need scheduled maintenance this year so we increased the spending because of that selman akyol  stifel nicolaus  co inc all right thanks very much operator our next question comes from the line of jeremy tonet from jpmorgan jeremy b tonet  jpmorgan securities llc good morning bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director good morning jeremy b tonet  jpmorgan securities llc congrats on the strong quarter there thanks for all the color this morning i just want to go touch on the ma market and see if the linden terminal if that was just kind of a oneoff opportunity or if you guys were exploring that now and do you see opportunities out there or are bidask spreads pretty wide any thoughts on that would be helpful bradley c barron  president chief executive officer  director the sellers expectations are still fairly high on some of the stuff so were actively looking for good bolton acquisitions that are synergistic with our current operations were not looking to step outside of what we currently do so it needs to be synergistic to what we have in our current expertise but we are actively looking all the time jeremy b tonet  jpmorgan securities llc thats helpful thats it from me thank you
