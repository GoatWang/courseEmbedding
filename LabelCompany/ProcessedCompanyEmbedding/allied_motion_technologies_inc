multiaxis motion controllermxcallied motion’s new mxc motion controller is a very compact multiaxis motion controller capable of coordinating the motions of and powering up to six brushless servomotorsthe mxc is a modular standalone unit consisting of a power chassis base that includes a master control module and up to six axis drive modules the axis drive modules are available in  a and  a continuous output current versions a combination of both  a and  a axis drive modules can be mixed in a mxc chassis to suit application needs bus voltage capability ranges from  up to  vdc to accommodate a broad array of motors special function or io expansion cards can be substituted for one or more of the axis drive cards greatlly expanding the applicability of the mxc allied motion can work with you to define and develop these auxiliary cards to suit your specific application demandsthe master control card handles all higher level motion control operations and feeds command information to the axis drive cards it also handles all communication with a host controller or pc if presentthe mxcs master module is equipped with an ethernet port enabling high speed communication with a system controller or host pcthe mxc will also able run in standalone mode with no need for a host the mxcs multitasking preemptive runtime environment is capable of running several program blocks called pobs simultaneously pobs can be downloaded and executed on the fly or recalled and run from local non volatile storage at powerup the run time environment also features an extensive programmable event driven mechanism for starting and stopping program blocks based upon such factors as a change of io state or a reaction to a fieldbus messageallied motion provides complimentary in control software with the mxc in control is a windowsbased development and control software application for use with the mxc and other allied motion drive and controller products in control enables
