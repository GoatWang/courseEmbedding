million surcharge action it is alleged that while acting as copersonal representatives they expended estate funds with creditor  but not court  approval on multi­million dollar real estate development projects around the country in which the decedent had an ownership interest collectively the decedent personally guaranteed over 0 million in loans used in his development projects his death triggered a default across the entire loan portfolio and the personal representatives worked with the creditors  the only beneficiaries of the insolvent estate  and developed a business plan with a goal of salvaging the projects to enable them to repay the debt during the time the workout plan was in place the creditors continued to demand that their debt be serviced and interest payments made due to the fact that the decedent passed away on the cusp of the worst real estate rescission in decades the efforts of the personal representatives were ultimately not successful in salvaging all of the projects resulting in many going into foreclosure though the efforts of the personal representatives reduced the estates exposure by over  million the creditors took the positon that despite their agreement to the plan and the expenditures and despite that the funds were used to the creditors benefit because the personal representatives failed to obtain prior court approval to use estate funds the personal representatives should be ordered to repay to the estate the funds expended in connection with the real estate projects following mediation we were able to negotiate a settlement of all claims and obtain releases in favor of all clients and a discharge from the probate court share this bioshare on facebookshare on twittershare on googleshare on linkedinshare on redditshare by mail we

million surcharge action it is alleged that while acting as copersonal representatives they expended estate funds with creditor  but not court  approval on multi­million dollar real estate development projects around the country in which the decedent had an ownership interest collectively the decedent personally guaranteed over 0 million in loans used in his development projects his death triggered a default across the entire loan portfolio and the personal representatives worked with the creditors  the only beneficiaries of the insolvent estate  and developed a business plan with a goal of salvaging the projects to enable them to repay the debt during the time the workout plan was in place the creditors continued to demand that their debt be serviced and interest payments made due to the fact that the decedent passed away on the cusp of the worst real estate rescission in decades the efforts of the personal representatives were ultimately not successful in salvaging all of the projects resulting in many going into foreclosure though the efforts of the personal representatives reduced the estates exposure by over  million the creditors took the positon that despite their agreement to the plan and the expenditures and despite that the funds were used to the creditors benefit because the personal representatives failed to obtain prior court approval to use estate funds the personal representatives should be ordered to repay to the estate the funds expended in connection with the real estate projects following mediation we were able to negotiate a settlement of all claims and obtain releases in favor of all clients and a discharge from the probate court share this bioshare on facebookshare on twittershare on googleshare on linkedinshare on redditshare by mail we
