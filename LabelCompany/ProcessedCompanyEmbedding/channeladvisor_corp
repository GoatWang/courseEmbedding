that google rewards the relative load speed and performance of sites with more impressions and higher rank but how much has always been the question historically we’ve seen many different aspects of site development performance and impact weighing heavily on search results but speed has never been one of those coveted virtues   that is until recently many search engines have indicated that the speed of sites will now have a greater impact on how sites rank than ever before ecommerce has always gotten a bit of pass in this regard  it has been generally understood that large sites with expansive product offerings would always take more time to load and require more resources for performance however with improved server response time enhanced javascript resources and faster content management systems the time has come for ecommerce sites to step up their game this is especially true for mobile search   the mobile impact as mobile search continues to dominate the seo landscape those of us working in ecommerce have mostly been exempt from concerns in this arena customers have largely used desktop computers to search for and complete their purchases for reasons ranging from an increase in perceived security to better navigation through the conversion process   well the times have finally caught up to our industry and mobile is now becoming an increasingly important factor for online businesses and the speed with which we can guide our customers through the conversion funnel matters  additionally mobile is taking a larger share of all search traffic in general  more and more searchers are turning to their mobile devices when searching online and this trend is unlikely to change in the future what can you do so then where do we start to establish a baseline

of many free online tools like tinypng or compressorio to compress the images without losing image quality in addition you may need to manually resize your images instead of relying on dynamic

like jscompress and minify that can do the hard work for you  simply copy the source code and submit and they’ll return the minified code eliminate renderblocking javascript and css in abovethefold

business rules  blog login community contact us  request a demo   menu search for search channeladvisor by laurel lockhart subscribe to our blog insights opinions trends lots of them subscribe to the blog february   business rules  introduction to business rules business rules are powerful tools that allow you to customize and transform your data from the information you have to the information you need they can help you cut down on the need for additional attributes allow you to apply logic use formulas manipulate date or filter items business rules can also be intimidating and confusing to new users of channeladvisor this blog post is the first in a new series designed to demystify the process of writing your own business rules types of business rules let’s start by discussing the two types of business rules generally referred to as inventory and marketplace rules inventory rules act on data coming into channeladvisor and marketplace rules act on data as it leaves channeladvisor inventory business rules are applied to an inventory template as data is brought into our system they can reference columns in your upload file but cannot reference data that already exists in channeladvisor for the sku  the output of these rules will be stored into an inventory field in channeladvisor that you can then map to your marketplace templates these rules can be found under inventory  product mapping  business rules marketplace business rules are applied to outgoing data templates while they’re normally called marketplace rules the same rules can be used for webstores or digital marketing these rules can reference inventory fields that exist in channeladvisor and alter the data that’s sent to the marketplace prior to being sent the output of the rules won’t  show in our system outside of rule and template previews these rules can be found under many menus but the most common are marketplaces  marketplace name  product mapping  business rules using the business rule editor once you’re on one of the business rules pages you can view existing rules or click on the ‘new business rule’ button in the upper left to create a new rule this will open the business rule editor as seen below click to enlarge i’ve numbered certain portions of the screenshot so we can discuss them more easily this is where you enter the business rule name and description make sure the name is as precise as possible so you can easily find the rule in the future for example if i’m making a rule to adjust the brand field on my amazon template i might call the rule “amazon brand rule” in the description i can enter more details about the rule it’s a good practice to use this space to describe in words what the rule is doing as well as to save any previous versions of the rule if you are making changes to an existing one the editor is where you will compose or write the actual business rule function we’ll come back to this in a moment and walk through writing a simple if statement rule the big thing to know now is that inventory fields are referenced with a  and text strings need to be in quotes in rules the ‘reference’ section has three tabs that will show you your available inventory fields and how to reference them in a rule the functions you have available what they do and how to format them as well as the lookup lists you can use in your rules once you have a rule written in the editor you can use this section to pick a sku you want to preview the rule on  this will allow you to see what the rule will output on a given sku once you select a sku in  the actual preview will show up here  keep in mind that if you use variations some fields will send a parent sku value to the marketplace so what you see in the rule preview won’t  always match what’s in the template preview  this is also where any errors if any  will show up as you’ re writing the rule writing a business rule now that we have the basics down let’s start writing a rule  for this example i’m going to write a rule that will take the brand name “acme co” and send the value “acme” for all other brands it should send the brand name unchanged first we’ll want to look at the inventory fields and functions tabs under ‘reference’ to find what we’ll need to build the rule  under ‘inventory fields’ we see ‘brand itembrand’ so to reference the brand in a rule we need to use the reference itembrand  we know that we want to use an if statement that’s formatted as ifconditional statement true return false return so the conditional statement we’re interested in is if the brand name is “acme co” if it is then the true return would be “acme” and if not the false return is the brand  putting this into the rule we generally have ifbrand is “acme co” “acme” brand we know that brand can be referenced as itembrand so taking this a step further we have ifitembrand”acme co” “acme” itembrand this is how it all looks in the editor click to enlarge we gave the rule a good name and description so we’ll remember what the rule does in the future and where we intend to use it  we also have the rule expression in the editor notice how the editor uses different colors for different parts of the rule  purple is used for functions blue for field references and strings are in red  if your cursor is next to a parenthesis it will highlight the corresponding opening or closing parenthesis in green or will be red to indicate that there isn’t a corresponding one these colors are a good indication that you’re writing the rule correctly  please also note that the preview will show errors in the rule for example if i typed “itembrad” instead of “itembrand” it would indicate it as an error in the preview click to enlarge once a rule is created and saved you need to still map it to the marketplace or inventory template before it’s applied  to do this open the template in question and click on the field to map it  select the ‘business rule’ button and search for the rule you created select it and then click ‘done’ and save the template changes on the next sync to the marketplace your items will update to send the business rule output values business rules are a great way to help optimize your business  hopefully you’re a bit more familiar with them now  in upcoming blog posts we’ll explore additional functions as well as how to combine multiple functions into one rule things to consider while business rules are powerful it’s important to remember that they have their limits  rules can only work on a single sku at a time so they can’t compare values across skus even ones in the same variation  it may sound obvious but keep in mind that rules can’t read your mind  in order to write a business rule you need to be able to define which criteria need to be used for all of your items  if you find yourself coming up with too many exceptions or your data input isn’t consistent it might be better to create a new attribute to store your

rules  introduction to business rules business rules are powerful tools that allow you to customize and transform your data from the information you have to the information you need they can help you cut down on the need for additional attributes allow you to apply logic use formulas manipulate date or filter items business rules can also be intimidating and confusing to new users of channeladvisor this blog post is the first in a new series designed to demystify the process of writing your own business rules types of business rules let’s start by discussing the two types of business rules generally referred to as inventory and marketplace rules inventory rules act on data coming into channeladvisor and marketplace rules act on data as it leaves channeladvisor inventory business rules are applied to an inventory template as data is brought into our system they can reference columns in your upload file but cannot reference data that already exists in channeladvisor for the sku  the output of these rules will be stored into an inventory field in channeladvisor that you can then map to your marketplace templates these rules can be found under inventory  product mapping  business rules marketplace business rules are applied to outgoing data templates while they’re normally called marketplace rules the same rules can be used for webstores or digital marketing these rules can reference inventory fields that exist in channeladvisor and alter the data that’s sent to the marketplace prior to being sent the output of the rules won’t  show in our system outside of rule and template previews these rules can be found under many menus but the most common are marketplaces  marketplace name  product mapping  business rules using the business rule editor once you’re on one of the business rules pages you can view existing rules or click on the ‘new business rule’ button in the upper left to create a new rule this will open the business rule editor as seen below click to enlarge i’ve numbered certain portions of the screenshot so we can discuss them more easily this is where you enter the business rule name and description make sure the name is as precise as possible so you can easily find the rule in the future for example if i’m making a rule to adjust the brand field on my amazon template i might call the rule “amazon brand rule” in the description i can enter more details about the rule it’s a good practice to use this space to describe in words what the rule is doing as well as to save any previous versions of the rule if you are making changes to an existing one the editor is where you will compose or write the actual business rule function we’ll come back to this in a moment and walk through writing a simple if statement rule the big thing to know now is that inventory fields are referenced with a  and text strings need to be in quotes in rules the ‘reference’ section has three tabs that will show you your available inventory fields and how to reference them in a rule the functions you have available what they do and how to format them as well as the lookup lists you can use in your rules once you have a rule written in the editor you can use this section to pick a sku you want to preview the rule on  this will allow you to see what the rule will output on a given sku once you select a sku in  the actual preview will show up here  keep in mind that if you use variations some fields will send a parent sku value to the marketplace so what you see in the rule preview won’t  always match what’s in the template preview  this is also where any errors if any  will show up as you’ re writing the rule writing a business rule now that we have the basics down let’s start writing a rule  for this
