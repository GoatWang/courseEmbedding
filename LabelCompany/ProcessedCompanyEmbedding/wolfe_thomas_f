intentions after four more years writing in brooklyn the second novel wolfe submitted to scribners was the october fair a multivolume epic roughly the length of marcel prousts in search of lost time after considering the commercial possibilities of publishing the book in full perkins opted to cut it significantly and create a single volume titled of time and the river it was more commercially successful than look homeward angel in an ironic twist the citizens of asheville were more upset this time because they hadnt been included the character of esther jack was based on bernstein in  maxim lieber served as his literary agent wolfe was persuaded by edward aswell to leave scribners and sign with harper  brothers by some accounts perkins severe editing of wolfes work is what prompted him to leave others describe his growing resentment that some people attributed his success to perkins work as editor in  bernard devoto reviewing the story of a novel for saturday review wrote that look homeward angel was hacked and shaped and compressed into something resembling a novel by mr perkins and the assemblyline at scribners wolfe spent much time in europe and was especially popular and at ease in germany where he made many friends however in  he witnessed incidents of discrimination against jews which upset him and changed his mind about the political developments in the country he returned to america and published a story based on his observations i have a thing to tell you in the new republic following its publication wolfes books were banned by the german government and he

entire right side of his brain without regaining consciousness he died  days before his th birthday his last writing a journal of his twoweek trip through the national parks was found among his belongings hours after his death despite his disagreements with perkins and scribners on his deathbed and shortly before lapsing into a coma wolfe wrote a deeply moving letter to perkins whom he considered to be his closest friend he acknowledged that perkins had helped to realize his work and had made his labors possible in closing he wrote i shall always think of you and feel about you the way it was that fourth of july day three years ago when you met me at the boat and we went out on the cafe on the river and had a drink and later went on top of the tall building and all the strangeness and the glory and the power of life and of the city was below thomas wolfe is buried in riverside cemetery asheville north carolina beside his parents wo and julia wolfe and his siblings the next day the new york times wrote his was one of the most confident young voices in contemporary american literature a vibrant fulltoned voice which it is hard to believe could be so suddenly stilled the stamp of genius was upon him though it was an undisciplined and unpredictable genius there was within him an unspent energy an untiring force an unappeasable hunger for life and for expression which might have carried him to the heights and might equally have torn him down time wrote the death last week of thomas clayton wolfe shocked critics with the realization that of all american novelists of his generation he was the one from whom most had been expected posthumous worksedit wolfe saw less than half of his work published in his lifetime there being much unpublished material remaining after his death he was the first american writer to leave two complete unpublished novels in the hands of his publisher at death two wolfe novels the web and the rock and you cant go home again were edited posthumously by edward aswell of harper  brothers the novels were two of the longest onevolume novels ever written nearly  pages each in these novels wolfe changed the name of his autobiographical character from eugene gant to george webber o lost the original authors cut of look homeward angel was reconstructed by f scott fitzgerald scholar matthew bruccoli and published in  on the centennial of wolfes birth bruccoli said that while perkins was a talented editor look homeward angel is inferior to the complete work of o lost and that the publication of the complete novel marks nothing less than the restoration of a masterpiece to the literary canon critical receptionedit upon publication of look homeward angel most reviewers responded favorably including john chamberlain carl van doren and stringfellow barr margaret wallace wrote in the new york times book review that wolfe had produced as interesting and powerful a book as has ever been made out of the drab circumstances of provincial american life an anonymous review published in scribners magazine compared wolfe to walt whitman and many other reviewers and scholars have found similarities in their works since when published in the uk in july  the book received similar reviews richard aldington wrote that the novel was the product of an immense exuberance organic in its form kinetic and drenched with the love of life i rejoice over mr wolfe both in his  nobel prize for literature acceptance speech and original press conference announcement sinclair lewis the first american to win the nobel prize for literature said of wolfe he may have a chance to be the greatest american writer in fact i dont see why he should not be one of the greatest world writers upon publication of his second novel of time and the river most reviewers and the public remained supportive though some critics found shortcomings while still hailing it for moments or aspects of greatness the book was well received by the public and became his only american bestseller the publication was viewed as the literary event of  by comparison the earlier attention given to look homeward angel was modest both the new york times and new york herald tribune published enthusiastic frontpage reviews clifton fadiman wrote in the new yorker that while he wasnt sure what he thought of the book for decades we have not had eloquence like his in american writing malcolm cowley of the new republic thought the book would be twice as good if half as long but stated wolfe was the only contemporary writer who can be mentioned in the same breath as dickens and dostoevsky robert penn warren thought wolfe produced some brilliant fragments from which several fine novels might be written he went on to say and meanwhile it may be well to recollect that shakespeare merely wrote hamlet he was not hamlet warren also praised wolfe in the same review though as did john donald wade in a separate review while acclaimed during his lifetime as one of the most important american writers comparable to f scott fitzgerald ernest hemingway or william faulkner wolfes reputation has been all but destroyed since his death although the new york times wrote in  that wolfes reputation and related scholarship appeared to be on an upswing he is often left out of college courses and anthologies devoted to great writers faulkner and w j cash listed wolfe as the ablest writer of their generation although faulkner later qualified his praise despite his early admiration of wolfes work faulkner later decided that his novels were like an elephant trying to do the hoochiecoochie ernest hemingways verdict was that wolfe was the overbloated lil abner of literature legacyedit southerner and

and impressionistic prose with autobiographical writing his books written and published from the s to the s vividly reflect on american culture and the mores of that period filtered through wolfes sensitive sophisticated and hyperanalytical perspective after wolfes death contemporary author william faulkner said that wolfe may have been the greatest talent of their generation for aiming higher than any other writer wolfes influence extends to the writings of beat generation writer jack kerouac and of authors ray bradbury and philip roth among others he remains an important writer in modern american literature as one of the first masters of autobiographical fiction and is considered north carolinas most famous writer ernest hemingway whose succinct writing style and manly voice were in

february  he began teaching english as an instructor at new york university nyu a position he occupied periodically for almost seven years careeredit wolfe was unable to sell any of his plays after three years because of their great length the theatre guild came close to producing welcome to our city before ultimately rejecting it and wolfe found his writing style more suited to fiction than the stage he sailed to europe in october  to continue writing from england he traveled to france italy and switzerland on his return voyage in  he met aline bernstein – a scene designer for the theatre guild eighteen years his senior she was married to a successful stockbroker with whom she had two children in october  she and wolfe became lovers and remained so for five years their affair was

autobiographical novel titled o lost the narrative which evolved into look homeward angel fictionalized his early experiences in asheville and chronicled family friends and the boarders at his mothers establishment on spruce street in the book he renamed the town altamont and called the boarding house dixieland his familys surname became gant and wolfe called himself eugene his father oliver and his mother eliza the original manuscript of o lost was over  pages  words long and considerably more experimental in style than the final version of look homeward angel it was submitted to scribners where the editing was done by maxwell perkins the most prominent book editor of the time who also worked with ernest hemingway and f scott fitzgerald he cut the book to focus more on the character of eugene a standin for wolfe wolfe initially expressed gratitude to perkins for his disciplined editing but he had misgivings later it has been said that wolfe found a father figure in perkins and that perkins who had five daughters found in wolfe a sort of foster son the novel which had been dedicated to bernstein was published  days before the stock market crash of  soon afterward wolfe returned to europe and ended his affair with mrs bernstein the novel caused a stir in asheville with its over  thinly disguised local characters wolfe chose to stay away from asheville for eight years due to the uproar he traveled to europe for a year on a guggenheim fellowship look homeward angel was a bestseller in the united kingdom and germany some members of wolfes family were also upset with their portrayal in the book but his sister mabel wrote to him that she was sure he had the best of intentions after four more years writing in brooklyn the second novel wolfe submitted to scribners was the october fair a multivolume epic roughly the length of marcel prousts in search of lost time after considering the commercial possibilities of publishing the book in full perkins opted to cut it significantly and create a single volume titled of time and the river it was more commercially successful than look homeward angel in an ironic twist the citizens of asheville were more upset this time because they hadnt been included the character of esther jack was based on bernstein in  maxim lieber served as his literary agent wolfe was persuaded by edward aswell to leave scribners and sign with harper  brothers by some accounts perkins severe editing of wolfes work is what prompted him to leave others describe his growing resentment that some people attributed his success to perkins work as editor in  bernard devoto reviewing the story of a novel for saturday review wrote that look homeward angel was hacked and shaped and compressed into something resembling a novel by mr perkins and the assemblyline at scribners wolfe spent much time in europe and was especially popular and at ease in germany where he made many friends however in  he witnessed incidents of discrimination against jews which upset him and changed his mind about the political developments in the country he returned to america and published a story based on his observations i have a thing to tell you in the new republic following its publication wolfes books were banned by the german government and he was prohibited from traveling there in  chickamauga his short story set during the us civil war

traveling through  national parks in the west the only part of the country he had never visited wolfe wrote to aswell that while he had focused on his family in his previous writing he would now take a more global perspective in july wolfe became ill with pneumonia while visiting seattle spending three weeks in the hospital there his sister mabel closed her boarding house in washington dc and went to seattle to care for him complications arose and wolfe was eventually diagnosed with miliary tuberculosis on september  he was sent to baltimores johns hopkins hospital for treatment by the most famous neurosurgeon in the country dr walter dandy but an operation revealed that the disease had overrun the entire right side of his brain without regaining consciousness he died  days before his th birthday his last writing a journal of his twoweek trip through the national parks was found among his belongings hours after his death despite his disagreements with perkins and scribners on his deathbed and shortly before lapsing into a coma wolfe wrote a deeply moving letter to perkins whom he considered to be his closest friend he acknowledged that perkins had helped to realize his work and had made his labors possible in closing he wrote i shall always think of you and feel about you the way it was that fourth of july day three years ago when you met me at the boat and we went out on the cafe on the river and had a drink and later went on top of the tall building and all the strangeness and the glory and the power of life and of the city was below thomas wolfe is buried in riverside cemetery asheville north carolina beside his parents wo and julia wolfe and his siblings the next day the new york times wrote his was one of the most confident young voices in contemporary american literature a vibrant fulltoned voice which it is hard to believe could be so suddenly stilled the stamp of genius was upon him though it was an undisciplined and unpredictable genius there was within him an unspent energy an untiring force an unappeasable hunger for life and for expression which might have carried him to the heights and might equally have torn him down time wrote the death last week of thomas clayton wolfe shocked critics with the realization that of all american novelists of his generation he was the one from whom most had been expected posthumous worksedit wolfe saw less than half of his work published in his lifetime there being much unpublished material remaining after his death he was the first american writer to leave two complete unpublished novels in the hands of his publisher at death two wolfe novels the web and the rock and you cant go home again were edited posthumously by edward aswell of harper  brothers the novels were two of the longest onevolume novels ever written nearly  pages each in these novels wolfe changed the name of his autobiographical character from eugene gant to george webber o lost the original authors cut of look homeward angel was reconstructed by f scott fitzgerald scholar matthew bruccoli and published in  on the centennial of wolfes birth bruccoli said that while perkins was a talented editor look homeward angel is inferior to the complete work of o lost and that the publication of the complete novel marks nothing less than the restoration of a masterpiece to the literary canon critical receptionedit upon publication of look homeward angel most reviewers responded favorably including john chamberlain carl van doren and stringfellow barr margaret wallace wrote in the new york times book review that wolfe had produced as interesting and powerful a book as has ever been made out of the drab circumstances of provincial american life an anonymous review published in scribners magazine compared wolfe to walt whitman and many other reviewers and scholars have found similarities in their works since when published in the uk in july  the book received similar reviews richard aldington wrote that the novel was the product of an immense exuberance organic in its form kinetic and drenched with the love of life i rejoice over mr wolfe both in his  nobel prize for literature acceptance speech and original press conference announcement sinclair lewis the first american to win the nobel prize for literature said of wolfe he may have a chance to be the greatest american writer in fact i dont see why he should not be one of the greatest world writers upon publication of his second novel of time and the river most reviewers and the public remained supportive though some critics found shortcomings while still hailing it for moments or aspects of greatness the book was well received by the public and became his only american bestseller the publication was viewed as the literary event of  by comparison the earlier attention given to look homeward angel was modest both the new york times and new york herald tribune published enthusiastic frontpage reviews clifton fadiman wrote

and impressionistic prose with autobiographical writing his books written and published from the s to the s vividly reflect on american culture and the mores of that period filtered through wolfes sensitive sophisticated and hyperanalytical perspective after wolfes death contemporary author william faulkner said that wolfe may have been the greatest talent of their generation for aiming higher

american literature as one of the first masters of autobiographical fiction and is considered north carolinas most famous writer ernest hemingway whose succinct writing style and manly voice were in

february  he began teaching english as an instructor at new york university nyu a position he occupied periodically for almost seven years careeredit wolfe was unable to sell any of his plays after three years because of their great length the theatre guild came close to producing welcome to our city before ultimately rejecting it and wolfe found his writing style more suited to fiction than the stage he sailed to europe in october  to continue writing from england he traveled to france italy and switzerland on his return voyage in  he met aline bernstein – a scene designer for the theatre guild eighteen years his senior she was married to a successful stockbroker with whom she had two children in october  she and wolfe became lovers and remained so for five years their affair was

establishment on spruce street in the book he renamed the town altamont and called the boarding house dixieland his familys surname became gant and wolfe called himself eugene his father oliver and his mother eliza the original manuscript of o lost was over  pages  words long and considerably more experimental in style than the final version of look homeward angel it was submitted to scribners where the editing was done by maxwell perkins the most prominent book editor of the time who also worked with ernest hemingway and f scott fitzgerald he cut the book to focus more on the character of eugene a standin for wolfe wolfe initially expressed gratitude to perkins for his disciplined editing but he had misgivings later it has been said that wolfe found a father figure in perkins and that perkins who had five daughters found in wolfe a sort of foster son the novel which had been dedicated to bernstein was published  days before the stock market crash of  soon afterward wolfe returned to europe and ended his affair with mrs bernstein the novel caused a stir in asheville with its over  thinly disguised local characters wolfe chose to stay away from asheville for eight years due to the uproar he traveled to europe for a year on a guggenheim fellowship look homeward angel was a bestseller in the united kingdom and germany some members of wolfes family were also upset with their portrayal in the book but his sister mabel wrote to him that she was sure he had the best of intentions after four more years writing in brooklyn the second novel wolfe submitted to scribners was the october fair a multivolume epic roughly the length of marcel prousts in search of lost time after considering the commercial possibilities of publishing the book in full perkins opted to cut it significantly and create a single volume titled of time and the river it was more commercially successful than look homeward angel in an ironic twist the citizens of asheville were more upset this time because they hadnt been included the character of esther jack was based on bernstein in  maxim lieber served as his literary agent wolfe was persuaded by edward aswell to leave scribners and sign with harper  brothers by some accounts perkins severe editing of wolfes work is what prompted him to leave others describe his growing resentment that some people attributed his success to perkins work as editor in  bernard devoto reviewing the story of a novel for saturday review wrote that look homeward angel was hacked and shaped and compressed into something resembling a novel by mr perkins and the assemblyline at scribners wolfe spent much time in europe and was especially popular and at ease in germany where he made many friends however in  he witnessed incidents of discrimination against jews which upset him and changed his mind about the political developments in the country he returned to america and published a story based on his observations i have a thing to tell you in

traveling through  national parks in the west the only part of the country he had never visited wolfe wrote to aswell that while he had focused on his family in his previous writing he would now take a more global perspective in july wolfe became ill with pneumonia while visiting seattle spending three weeks in the hospital there his sister mabel closed her boarding house in washington dc and went to seattle to care for him complications arose and wolfe was eventually diagnosed with miliary tuberculosis on september  he was sent to baltimores johns hopkins hospital for treatment by the most famous neurosurgeon in the country dr walter dandy but an operation revealed that the disease had overrun the entire right side of his brain without regaining consciousness he died  days before his th birthday his last writing a journal of his twoweek trip through the national parks was found among his belongings hours after his death despite his disagreements with perkins and scribners on his deathbed and shortly before lapsing into a coma wolfe wrote a deeply moving letter to perkins whom he considered to be his closest friend he acknowledged that perkins had helped to realize his work and had made his labors possible in closing he wrote i shall always think of you and feel about you the way it was that fourth of july day three years ago when you met me at the boat and we went out on the cafe on the river and had a drink and later went on top of the tall building and all the strangeness and the glory and the power of life and of the city was below thomas wolfe is buried in riverside cemetery asheville north carolina beside his parents wo and julia wolfe and his siblings the next day the new york times wrote his was one of the most confident young voices in contemporary american literature a vibrant fulltoned voice which it is hard to believe could be so suddenly stilled the stamp of genius was upon him though it was an undisciplined and unpredictable genius there was within him an unspent energy an untiring force an unappeasable hunger for life and for expression which might have carried him to the heights and might equally have torn him down time wrote the death last week of thomas clayton wolfe shocked critics with the realization that of all american novelists of his generation he was the one from whom most had been expected posthumous worksedit wolfe saw less than half of his work published in his lifetime there being much unpublished material remaining after his death he was the first american writer to leave two complete unpublished novels in the hands of his publisher at death two wolfe novels the web and the rock and you cant go home again were edited posthumously by edward aswell of harper  brothers the novels were two of the longest onevolume novels ever written nearly  pages each in these novels wolfe changed the name of his autobiographical character from eugene gant to george webber o lost the original authors cut of look homeward angel was reconstructed by f scott fitzgerald scholar matthew bruccoli and published in  on the centennial of wolfes birth bruccoli said that while perkins was a talented editor look homeward angel is inferior to the complete work of o lost and that the publication of the complete novel marks nothing less than the restoration of a masterpiece to the literary canon critical receptionedit upon publication of look homeward angel most reviewers responded favorably including john chamberlain carl van doren and stringfellow barr margaret wallace wrote in the new york times book review that wolfe had produced as interesting and powerful a book as has ever been made out of the drab circumstances of provincial american life an anonymous review published in scribners magazine compared wolfe to walt whitman and many other reviewers and scholars have found similarities in their works since when published in the uk in july  the book received similar reviews richard aldington wrote that the novel was the product of an immense exuberance organic in its form kinetic and drenched with the love of life i rejoice over mr wolfe both in his  nobel prize for literature acceptance speech and original press conference announcement sinclair lewis the first american to win the nobel prize for literature said of wolfe he may have a chance to be the greatest american writer in fact i dont see why he should not be one of the greatest world writers upon publication of his second novel of time and the river most reviewers and the public remained supportive though some critics found shortcomings while still hailing it for moments or aspects of greatness the book was well received by the public and became his only american bestseller the publication was viewed as the literary event of  by comparison the earlier attention given to look homeward angel was modest both the new york times and new york herald tribune published enthusiastic frontpage reviews clifton fadiman wrote in the new yorker that while he wasnt sure what he thought of the book for decades we have not had eloquence like his in american writing malcolm cowley of the new republic thought the book would be twice as good if half as long but stated wolfe was the only contemporary writer who can be mentioned in the same breath as dickens and dostoevsky robert penn warren thought wolfe produced some brilliant fragments from which several fine novels might be written he went on to say and meanwhile it may be well to recollect that shakespeare merely wrote hamlet he was not hamlet warren also praised wolfe in the same review though as did john donald wade in a separate review while acclaimed during his lifetime as one of the most important american writers comparable to f scott fitzgerald ernest hemingway or william faulkner wolfes reputation has been all but destroyed since his death although the new york times wrote in  that wolfes reputation and related scholarship appeared to be on an upswing he is often left out of college courses and anthologies devoted to great writers faulkner and w j cash listed wolfe as the ablest writer of their generation although faulkner later qualified his praise despite his early admiration of wolfes work faulkner later decided that his novels were like an elephant trying to do the hoochiecoochie ernest hemingways verdict was that wolfe

where the editing was done by maxwell perkins the most prominent book editor of the time who also worked with ernest hemingway and f scott fitzgerald he cut the book to focus more on the character of eugene a standin for wolfe wolfe initially expressed gratitude to perkins for his disciplined editing but he had misgivings later it has been said that wolfe found a father figure in perkins and that perkins who had five daughters found in wolfe a sort of foster son the novel which had been dedicated to bernstein was published  days before the stock market crash of  soon afterward wolfe returned to europe and ended his affair with mrs bernstein the novel caused a stir in asheville with its over  thinly disguised local characters wolfe chose to stay away from asheville for eight years due to

portrayal in the book but his sister mabel wrote to him that she was sure he had the best of intentions after four more years writing in brooklyn the second novel wolfe submitted to scribners was the october fair a multivolume epic roughly the length of marcel prousts in search of lost time after considering the commercial possibilities of publishing the book in full perkins opted to cut it significantly and create a single volume titled of time and the river it was more commercially successful than look homeward angel in an ironic twist the citizens of asheville were more upset this time because they hadnt been included the character of esther jack was based on bernstein in  maxim lieber served as his literary agent wolfe was persuaded by edward aswell to leave scribners and sign with harper  brothers by some accounts perkins severe editing of wolfes work is what prompted him to leave others describe his growing resentment that some people attributed his success to perkins work as editor in  bernard devoto reviewing the story of a novel for saturday review wrote that look homeward angel was hacked and shaped and compressed into something resembling a novel by mr perkins and the assemblyline at scribners wolfe spent much time in europe and was especially popular and at ease in germany where he made many friends however in  he witnessed incidents of discrimination against jews which upset him and changed his mind about the political developments in the country he returned to america and published a story based on his observations i have a thing to tell you in

traveling through  national parks in the west the only part of the country he had never visited wolfe wrote to aswell that while he had focused on his family in his previous writing he would now take a more global perspective in july wolfe became ill with pneumonia while visiting seattle spending three weeks in the hospital there his sister mabel closed her boarding house in washington dc and went

birthday his last writing a journal of his twoweek trip through the national parks was found among his belongings hours after his death despite his disagreements with perkins and scribners on his deathbed and shortly before lapsing into a coma wolfe wrote a deeply moving letter to perkins whom he considered to be his closest friend he acknowledged that perkins had helped to realize his work and had made his labors possible in closing he wrote i shall always think of you and feel about you the way it was that fourth of july day three years ago when you met me at the boat and we went out on the cafe on the river and had a drink and later went on top of the tall building and all the strangeness and the glory and the power of life and of the city was below thomas wolfe is buried in riverside cemetery asheville north carolina beside his parents wo and julia wolfe and his siblings the next day the new york times wrote his was one of the most confident young voices in contemporary american literature a vibrant fulltoned voice which it is hard to believe could be so suddenly stilled the stamp of genius was upon him though it was an undisciplined and unpredictable genius there was within him an unspent energy an untiring force an unappeasable hunger for life and for expression which might have carried him to the heights and might equally have torn him down time wrote the death last week of thomas clayton wolfe shocked critics with the realization that of all american novelists of his generation he was the one from whom most had been expected posthumous worksedit wolfe saw less than half of his work published in his lifetime there being much unpublished material remaining after his death he was the first american writer to leave two complete unpublished novels in the hands of his publisher at death two wolfe novels the web and the rock and you cant go home again were edited posthumously by edward aswell of harper  brothers the novels were two of the longest onevolume novels ever written nearly  pages each in these novels wolfe changed the name of his autobiographical character from eugene gant to george webber o lost the original authors cut of look homeward angel was reconstructed by f scott fitzgerald scholar matthew bruccoli and published in  on the centennial of wolfes birth bruccoli said that while perkins was a talented editor look homeward angel is inferior to the complete work of o lost and that the publication of the complete novel marks nothing less than the restoration of a masterpiece to the literary canon critical receptionedit upon publication of look homeward angel most reviewers responded favorably including john chamberlain carl van doren and stringfellow barr margaret wallace wrote in the new york times book review that wolfe had produced as interesting and powerful a book as has ever been made out of the drab circumstances of provincial american life an anonymous review published in scribners magazine compared wolfe to walt whitman and many other reviewers and scholars have found similarities in their works since when published in the uk in july  the book received similar reviews richard aldington wrote that the novel was the product of an immense exuberance organic in its form kinetic and drenched with the love of life i rejoice over mr wolfe both in his  nobel prize for literature acceptance speech and original press conference announcement sinclair lewis the first american to win the nobel prize for literature said of wolfe he may have a chance to be the greatest american writer in fact i dont see why he should not be one of the greatest world writers upon publication of his second novel of time and the river most reviewers and the public remained supportive though some critics found shortcomings while still hailing it for moments or aspects of greatness the book was well received by the public and became his only american bestseller the publication was viewed as the literary event of  by comparison the earlier attention given to look homeward angel was modest both the new york times and new york herald tribune published enthusiastic frontpage reviews clifton fadiman wrote in the new yorker that while he wasnt sure what he thought of the book for decades we have not had eloquence like his in american writing malcolm cowley of the new republic thought the book would be twice as good if half as long but stated wolfe was the only contemporary writer who can be mentioned in the same breath as dickens and dostoevsky robert penn warren thought wolfe produced some brilliant fragments from which several fine novels might be written he went on to say and meanwhile it may be well to recollect that shakespeare merely wrote hamlet he was not hamlet warren also praised wolfe in the same review though as did john donald wade in a separate review while acclaimed during his lifetime as one of the most important american writers comparable to f scott fitzgerald ernest hemingway or william faulkner wolfes reputation has been all but destroyed since his death although the new york times wrote in  that wolfes reputation and related scholarship appeared to be on an upswing he is often left out of college courses and anthologies devoted to great writers faulkner and w j cash listed wolfe as the ablest writer of their generation although faulkner later qualified his praise despite his early admiration of wolfes work faulkner later decided that his novels were like an elephant trying to do the hoochiecoochie ernest hemingways verdict was that wolfe

guild eighteen years his senior she was married to a successful stockbroker with whom she had two children in october  she and wolfe became lovers and remained so for five years their affair was turbulent and sometimes combative but she exerted a powerful influence encouraging and funding his writing wolfe returned to europe in the summer of  and began writing the first version of an autobiographical novel titled o lost the narrative which evolved into look homeward angel fictionalized his early experiences in asheville and chronicled family friends and the boarders at his mothers establishment on spruce street in the book he renamed the town altamont and called the boarding house dixieland his familys surname became gant and wolfe called himself eugene his father oliver and his mother eliza the original manuscript of o lost was over  pages  words long and considerably more experimental in style than the final version of look homeward angel it was submitted to scribners where the editing was done by maxwell perkins the most prominent book editor of the time who also worked with ernest hemingway and f scott fitzgerald he cut the book to focus more on the character of eugene a standin for wolfe wolfe initially expressed gratitude to perkins for his disciplined editing but he had misgivings later it has been said that wolfe found a father figure in perkins and that perkins who had five daughters found in wolfe a sort of foster son the novel which had been dedicated to bernstein was published  days before the stock market crash of  soon afterward wolfe returned to europe and ended his affair with mrs bernstein the novel caused a stir in asheville with its over  thinly disguised local characters wolfe chose to stay away from asheville for eight years due to the uproar he traveled to europe for a year on a guggenheim fellowship look homeward angel was a bestseller in the united kingdom and germany some members of wolfes family were also upset with their portrayal in the book but his sister mabel wrote to him that she was sure he had the best of intentions after four more years writing in brooklyn the second novel wolfe submitted to scribners was the october fair a multivolume epic roughly the length of marcel prousts in search of lost time after considering the commercial possibilities of publishing the book in full perkins opted to cut it significantly and create a single volume titled of time and the river it was more commercially successful than look homeward angel in an ironic twist the citizens of asheville were more upset this time because they hadnt been included the character of esther jack was based on bernstein in  maxim lieber served as his literary agent wolfe was persuaded by edward aswell to leave scribners and sign with harper  brothers by some accounts perkins severe editing of wolfes work is what prompted him to leave others describe his growing resentment that some people attributed his success to perkins work as editor in  bernard devoto reviewing the story of a novel for saturday review wrote that look homeward angel was hacked and shaped and compressed into something resembling a novel by mr perkins and the assemblyline at scribners wolfe spent much time in europe and was especially popular and at ease in germany where he made many friends however in  he witnessed incidents of discrimination against jews which upset him and changed his mind about the political developments in the country he returned to america and published a story based on his observations i have a thing to tell you in the new republic following its publication wolfes books were banned by the german government and he was prohibited from traveling there in  chickamauga his short story set during the us civil war battle of the same name was published wolfe returned to asheville in the summer of  for the first time since publication of his first book deathedit in  after submitting over one million words of manuscript to his new editor edward aswell wolfe left new york for a tour of the west on the way he stopped at purdue university and gave a lecture writing and living and then spent two weeks traveling through  national parks in the west the only part of the country he had never visited wolfe wrote to aswell that while he had focused on his family in his previous writing he would now take a more global perspective in july wolfe became ill with pneumonia while visiting seattle spending three weeks in the hospital there his sister mabel closed her boarding house in washington dc and went to seattle to care for him complications arose and wolfe was eventually diagnosed with miliary tuberculosis on september  he was sent to baltimores johns hopkins hospital for treatment by the most famous neurosurgeon in the country dr walter dandy but an operation revealed that the disease had overrun the entire right side of his brain without regaining consciousness he died  days before his th birthday his last writing a journal of his twoweek trip through the national parks was found among his belongings hours after his death despite his disagreements with perkins and scribners on his deathbed and shortly before lapsing into a coma wolfe wrote a deeply moving letter to perkins whom he considered to be his closest friend he acknowledged that perkins had helped to realize his work and had made his labors possible in closing he wrote i shall always think of you and feel about you the way it was that fourth of july day three years ago when you met me at the boat and we went out on the cafe on the river and had a drink and later went on top of the tall building and all the strangeness and the glory and the power of life and of the city was below thomas wolfe is buried in riverside cemetery asheville north carolina beside his parents wo and julia wolfe and his siblings the next day the new york times wrote his was one of the most confident young voices in contemporary american literature a vibrant fulltoned voice which it is hard to believe could be so suddenly stilled the stamp of genius was upon him though it was an undisciplined and unpredictable genius there was within him an unspent energy an untiring force an unappeasable hunger for life and for expression which might have carried him to the heights and might equally have torn him down time wrote the death last week of thomas clayton wolfe shocked critics with the realization that of all american novelists of his generation he was the one from whom most had been expected posthumous worksedit wolfe saw less than half of his work published in his lifetime there being much unpublished material remaining after his death he was the first american writer to leave two complete unpublished novels in the hands of his publisher at death two wolfe novels the web and the rock and you cant go home again were edited posthumously by edward aswell of harper  brothers the novels were two of the longest onevolume novels ever written nearly  pages each in these novels wolfe changed the name of his autobiographical character from eugene gant to george webber o lost the original authors cut of look homeward angel was reconstructed by f scott fitzgerald scholar matthew bruccoli and published in  on the centennial of wolfes birth bruccoli said that while perkins was a talented editor look homeward angel is inferior to the complete work of o lost and that the publication of the complete novel marks nothing less than the restoration of a masterpiece to the literary canon critical receptionedit upon publication of look homeward angel most reviewers responded favorably including john chamberlain carl van doren and stringfellow barr margaret wallace wrote in the new york times book review that wolfe had produced as interesting and powerful a book as has ever been made out of the drab circumstances of provincial american life an anonymous review published in scribners magazine compared wolfe to walt whitman and many other reviewers and scholars have found similarities in their works since when published in the uk in july  the book received similar reviews richard aldington wrote that the novel was the product of an immense exuberance organic in its form kinetic and drenched with the love of life i rejoice over mr wolfe both in his  nobel prize for literature acceptance speech and original press conference announcement sinclair lewis the first american to win the nobel prize for literature said of wolfe he may have a chance to be the greatest american writer in fact i dont see why he should not be one of the greatest world writers upon publication of his second novel of time and the river most reviewers and the public remained supportive though some critics found shortcomings while still hailing it for moments or aspects of greatness the book was well received by the public and became his only american bestseller the publication was viewed as the literary event of  by comparison the earlier attention given to look homeward angel was modest both the new york times and new york herald tribune published enthusiastic frontpage reviews clifton fadiman wrote in the new yorker that while he wasnt sure what he thought of the book for decades we have not had eloquence like his in american writing malcolm cowley of the new republic thought the book would be twice as good if half as long but stated wolfe was the only contemporary writer who can be mentioned in the same breath as dickens and dostoevsky robert penn warren thought wolfe produced some brilliant fragments from which several fine novels might be written he went on to say and meanwhile it may be well to recollect that shakespeare merely wrote hamlet he was not hamlet warren also praised wolfe in the same review though as did john donald wade in a separate review while acclaimed during his lifetime as one of the most important american writers comparable to f scott fitzgerald ernest hemingway or william faulkner wolfes reputation has been all but destroyed since his death although the new york times wrote in  that wolfes reputation and related scholarship appeared to be on an upswing he is often left out of college courses and anthologies devoted to great writers faulkner and w j cash listed wolfe as the ablest writer of their generation although faulkner later qualified his praise despite his early admiration of wolfes work faulkner later decided that his novels were like an elephant trying to do the hoochiecoochie ernest hemingways verdict was that wolfe was the overbloated lil abner of literature legacyedit southerner and harvard historian david herbert donalds biography of wolfe look homeward won the pulitzer prize for biography in  wolfe inspired
