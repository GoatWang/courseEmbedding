and gentlemen and welcome to the second quarter  oildri corporation of america earnings conference call at this time all participants are in a listenonly mode later we will facilitate a questionandanswer session operator instructions i would now like to turn the conference over to your president and ceo dan jaffee daniel s jaffee thank you and welcome everybody to our second quarter and six month teleconference im going to turn it over to dan smith weve got doug graham here and reagans going to do safe harbor as always reagan b culbertson thank you dan welcome everyone on todays call comments may contain forwardlooking statements regarding the companys performance and future periods actual results in those periods may materially differ in our press release and our sec filings we highlight a number of important risk factors trends and uncertainties that may affect our future performance we ask that you review and consider those factors in evaluating the companys comments and in evaluating any investment in oildri stock thank you for joining us daniel s jaffee dan lets cover the six months and quarter and then im sure everyone online is going to want to hear about whats coming down the road so lets take a look back first daniel t smith we’ll do dan thank you good morning to everyone oildri reported another strong quarter our earnings per share of  per diluted share of the second quarter were approximately  more than the second quarter of fiscal  the quarterly results were driven by improved product mix lower cost and higher selling prices the positive results were partially offset by increased sga expenses the increased earnings were primarily a result of improvements in the retail and wholesale segment earnings for the first six months of fiscal  were up over  from fiscal  our sales for the quarter and for the first six months were up  and  respectively over the same periods in fiscal  our gross profit margins were about  for the quarter and  for the first six months of fiscal  improved selling prices and product mix only with lower natural gas packaging and freight cost all helped our gross margins our retail and wholesale team generate increased sales for both the quarter and on a yeartodate basis our branded and private label lightweight litters have contributed to the growth the segment has achieved income values for the second quarter and for the first six months as compared to the same periods in fiscal  the income growth was driven by favorable product mix lower trade spending and costs however as we look to the second half of the fiscal year we believe that our integrated marketing campaign for our new and improved fresh  light ultimate care lightweight cat litter will significantly increase advertising expenses and reduce earnings in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  bb had a  sales decline but nevertheless achieved a  profit increase in the second quarter the segment sales and profits were up for this first six months our agsorb and verge product lines helped drive the profit growth for both periods the segment also benefited from lower cost from a balance sheet perspective our cash investment balances have grown about  million from the fiscal  yearend totals the increase was achieved despite spending over  million on capital dividends and debt payments during the first six months of fiscal  we paid out about  million in dividends for the first six months of fiscal  our dividend yield would be above  based on the  closing price of  per share and our latest quarterly dividend of  per share thanks ill turn the meeting back over to dan jaffee daniel s jaffee thank you dan and lauren lets open up the lines for question and as always i encourage everyone to ask your most important question first and then go back to the end of the queue so we let everybody have a chance to ask at least one question questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from john bair from ascend wealth advisors john bair good morning on the road here so hopefully this comes through la question on the new marketing campaign can you tell us how long this engagement is indiscernible is it like a one year and then as kind of a parallel question with this is the contribution of part of the sales to the foundation can you share how long that commitment is daniel s jaffee im sorry i heard the first part of your question but not the second what was the second part of your question john bair the second part was in conjunction with the partial that supported the foundation how long of a commitment that might be if you can share that or not yes daniel s jaffee that sort of well is going with the first part but after an answer if i dont get it just add to followup question were getting some beeping here and i dont know why but anyway hopefully you guys can hear the beeping its a multiyear deal the goal is to have it be a real longterm partnership i can just tell you that the heigls have been fantastic i mean obviously this was something thats very near and dear to them jason heigl is katie’s brother nancys son who when he was years old perished he fell out of a back of a pickup truck and he was a lover of camping animals and they started this foundation as their star grew and they are as excited about partnering with cats pride as we are with partnering with them so to us it couldnt be going any better the goal to have it in my opinion go on forever but to start with it’s a multiyear deal and our goal is to more than exceed their expectations so that they are going to continue partnering with us as we move forward does that answer your question john bair thats great thats commendable and i have other questions but ill get back in the queue daniel s jaffee please dont john bair okay operator next question comes from ethan starr ph a private investor unidentified analyst good morning what are the opportunities to save money and or improve efficiency by improving the consumer products manufacturing facilities is there a big opportunity there daniel s jaffee yes a large opportunity as you know weve executed a divide and conquer strategy where tom cofsky is a longterm vice president of manufacturing is overseeing certain suite of our plans and then aaron christiansen has come in to oversee the reminder of the plans and then they have also divided other duties for instance the raw materials which is something that’s on this intimate knowledge is underneath him aaron has engineering and process improvement under him and so thats really what he is focused on weve already made a lot of improvements by those two as i say divide and conquering its allowing them both to get deeper into the subjects that are under their control so im not going to put a number on it for you but historically i would say weve been inefficient and it makes sense we are in our th anniversary and i would say for the first  some odd years we were mining and processing company packaging really was just something we did to try and get the mining and processing we did with our customers so a lot of time packaging came in the form of a railcar or a bulk bag or a £ sack and for the last few years now its been putting tough that high speeds in the jugs which is a totally different discipline it’s nothing that we really did in the past and our team has done a phenomenal job of embracing the change and moving forward but there are lot of best practices out there as you well know of companies that have been putting stuff in jugs at high speeds for years and rather than reinvent the wheel we want to adapt and adopt those practices and so thats where aaron comes in he comes from pg and unilever he has been in that world and he is bringing those skills to our team so its been a great marriage on all parts between tom aaron and mark lewry who is the chief operating officer the whole supply chain really is functioning very well unidentified analyst okay i understand you don’t want to quantify things where you can already see things improving or you notice it daniel s jaffee yes unidentified analyst okay glad to know that ill get back in the queue daniel s jaffee thanks operator next question comes robert smith from center fpi robert smith good morning could you give us some color on how china is developing daniel s jaffee that’s nothing substantial its proceeding i mean dan i don’t know if you want to make any comment daniel t smith the sales are drawing but were still trying to gain market share we still have more sga than sales relative for the sales because were in a growth mode so were still exploring were still trying to grow the market daniel s jaffee main products are being registered but thats still… daniel t smith and right now as you probably well know the china economy is slowing down a little bit too so thats obviously impacting our business and everybody elses business robert smith so for the quarter end declined but china was growing daniel s jaffee yes i think thats very accurate the currency fluctuations in south america really did a number on the aml and animal health business there so thats a good thing that china was growing because it did help or offset some of the declines we saw in south america robert smith i see okay thanks a lot ill get back in the queue daniel s jaffee alright operator next question comes from john bair with ascend wealth advisors john bair shed some light on what you see happening in the agricultural market so far i mean your press release showed that there was an increase in sales both to for quarter in the six month do you see that trend increasing or improving daniel t smith yes the ag market is really difficult to predict it kind of depends on what the formulators decide to do in terms of what they produce and they are going to look at the corn prices and things like that to really making a judgment call so its very difficult for them to predict their business and its very difficult for us to predict our business so far as youve indicated weve been strong and we hope that trend continues john bair and is that primarily domestic oriented or do these products source out to south america or other areas daniel t smith i would say its mostly domestic john bair okay so you had a relatively mild winter conditions in the midwest and ag prices of course are down but maybe cyclically things are going to pick up and maybe there is going to be higher plannings and so forth so that was where i was trying to go with that if there is some sort of preemptive activity if you will coming into the growing season daniel t smith nothing i can immediately point at this time john bair okay all right fair enough all right ill get back in the queue operator next question comes from robert smith from center fpi robert smith yes it’s the center for performance investing so could you give us some further information on private label lightweight penetration daniel s jaffee yes so its interesting because its now been on the shelf long enough where you are starting to see some sales velocity and some repeatability and some actual iri trend data so from a dollar share and remember historically our share of the scoopable private label market was about two from a dollar standpoint we have a  share of the private label lightweight and of the  we dont have our private label lightweight partners are showing a sales velocity and unit per store per week and dollars per store per week thats more than double the competition now the competition again we were not naturally inclined to compete in heavy because we don’t have heavy minerals our minerals our lighter so in the heavy market where its all price per pound we were at a natural disadvantage now that you go to the lightweight they are at a natural disadvantage so what they have to do to come up with the lightweight item is take their active ingredient which is sodium bentonite cut it by   or  and then fill back in a filler to make it lighter but they are literally delivering  to  of the active ingredient our private label lightweight is a  active ingredient its all calcium bentonite but no fillers added so its no wonder that the sales velocity has more than doubled when consumers says anything i mean if you were heavy or twice as much in a laundry detergent it wouldnt have been a great innovation on the liquid concentration instead it was you were able to use less and do the same number of loads so our partners are very happy with us its going very well were already seeing a couple of the major accounts that we didnt get right out of the gate because they were being supplied for years by the heavy guys so they naturally went to them they are already switching so were already fully switched at one account and were sort of partially switched at another and so again i would love to say were the worlds greatest salespeople and maybe we are but in reality it gets down to the raw material and our raw material because its a  calcium bentonite which is very absorbing controls odors and because we have plants from the west coast to the midwest to the east our freight footprint for any national account is fantastic so nobody can deliver a better product at a better price than we can so to answer your question we currently have a  share i see that share growing and i see the distance between the competition expanding too so right now i would sell them two to one i think thats just going to continue as consumers needs our product robert smith so then were talking about  of  is that daniel s jaffee well ultimately  yes now you are still talking its a nascent market so it does not currently represent  of the private label scoop market yet so it will be nice when it does at the moment im looking at a share that basically represents about  so could it grow  times you would hope it would but it should as consumers continue to adopt lightweight and lightweight continues to be the norm i mean i can tell you all the consumers i talk to who have experienced lightweight in a positive way they will never switch back i mean why would they ever say okay i hear you are putting some item in there we have our competitors are actually launching the items which is interesting with new additives and their interesting bells and whistles and features but you know in a  pound box whos bringing that home so i joked when a make a lot of sales calls and i joked rather than put these additives in there they ought to put ben gay in there so that when that brings it home they can actually repair their sore back i mean who is going to buy it so its all playing out very well for the industry very well for the consumer and very well for oildri robert smith okay thanks daniel s jaffee thanks operator next question comes from ethan starr private investor unidentified analyst thank you how was your retail sell through with the cats pride light weight scoopable litter is going daniel s jaffee so the media is going to hit starting next week so i think in sell through you are seeing now is just advanced buzz loading up the shelves pipeline fill and really the big read is going to come in the next days so when were with you in days to be able to look at that iri data it will be days in arrear so we will only have a couple of months of the data but thats okay that will be the real proof the efficacy of the campaign but we are very very excited and very optimistic of course unidentified analyst you can’t comment on the recent past daniel s jaffee i mean we can but its not relevant you have got so many dynamic changes that its like talking about the dead ball era versus the new ball era the new ball is going into play next week so i can do it for if you want but as an investor i know you are a big investor in oildri the biggest thing will be in days unidentified analyst okay thats fine take somebody else’s question daniel s jaffee yes operator next question comes from robert smith robert smith hi dan can you give me an idea is to the level of spending in the quarter is there any fourth quarter i mean not at the level but is there going to be more spending in the third quarter or would it appear than the fourth quarter daniel s jaffee yes definitely yes because these are the key viewership times then the market tends to go a little quieter during the warmer months and then the goal is to read the data define and refine the feedback we get from our media mix both social and tv and cable and then come back in the fall with another campaign so the goal is to keep the snow ball rolling and keep it growing we are the inventors of lightweight litter as i described we have the natural advantages and now we need the consumer to know what a great product we have and thats why we are literally over the moon with our relationship with katherine heigl i mean with her star power and her queue scores with our demographic women to  are off the charts i feel so fortunate that we are partnered with her it could not have gone better robert smith dan who is doing a creative work for you daniel s jaffee so we have an ad agency here in chicago called magnani and it was their campaign you will be seeing the tv commercials and for those of you who are can reach out there at may i will be doing some investor road shows i will be in new york in april we will be doing in boston again we will be doing in chicago and im going to bring the commercials obviously with me so they will already be on the year but ill be showing you the commercials next week is the global pet show down in orlando we will be unveiling in our boots on big screen tvs all the commercials with katie actually introducing each of them and talking about the partnership between foundation and cats pride so were expecting a big buzz down in orlando next week robert smith thank you daniel s jaffee okay operator there are no other questions at this time daniel s jaffee great well look as i said i mean really the company is doing very well the margins are expanding the strategy of creating value from solvent minerals is working you have obviously noticed the topline is not exploding in any way shape or form but the margins are expanding thats because we keep trading higher value profitable items and as we do that we push out some of the lower value unprofitable items rather than to keep maintaining there is no point otherwise we are churning up our reserves for no benefit however with this campaign you guys know that the magnitude of this category its  billion of retail you can do the math but any share point is the big deal and the question is how high is up and in days i think we will have a much better feel for that than we have today but i can tell you we couldnt be happier from where were seating today as were going to hit the launch button starting what we call the air campaign next week you are going to love the tv spots and katie is literally fully committed and invested to making this work and so she is going to use her  she is already using her social media power she has got a  million twitter followers she has been tweeting about us she has got  million facebook likes she has got instagram she has been out there on the social talking about the partnership encouraging her royal fan base to go out and try cats pride fresh  light ultimate care because with each sale a donation is made to the jason debus heigl foundation and so thats the beauty of the partnership and like i said my absolute goal is to far exceed her and nancys expectations so that they are going to absolutely want to keep the partnership going so well be back here at you days obviously im always excited and enthusiastic im more excited and more enthusiastic than i usually am so thank you everybody and we will talk to you

vulnerable to the fluctuations of the world coffee market written in a clear and accessible style the book carries readers into the lives of these coffee producer households and their communities offering a nuanced analysis of both the effects of fair trade on everyday life and the limits of its impact brewing justice paints a clear picture of the complex dynamics of the fair trade market and its relationship to the global economy drawing on interviews with dozens of fair trade leaders the book also explores the changing politics of this international movement including the challenges posed by the entry of transnational corporations into the fair trade system it concludes by offering recommendations for strengthening and protecting the integrity of fair trade read more read less

transform a hillside village in thailand paperback mark pendergrast  out of  stars   prime editorial reviews from the inside flap the idea of fair trade in a global economy is central to contemporary debates over neoliberalism globalization and the rule of the free market but what are the coordinates of the fair trade moment what sort of alternative does it offer for producers and consumers daniel jaffee is at once a fierce proponent of fair trade but also a critical voice how he asks can fair trade coffee be in and against the market with one foot in the central american coffee fincas and the other in the intellectual world of karl polanyi and his disciples daniel jaffee has on offer a very heady brew brewing justice is a pioneering study of the variety of fair trade movements a prospectus for a more radical vision of fair tradean alternative sort of market and a vital contribution to contemporary debates over free trade the global agrofood system and the socalled movement of movements a tour de forcemichael watts university of california berkeleydaniel jaffee has done the fair trade movement a real service in his meticulous research into the actual effect of fair trade on coffee farmers in a group of villages in oaxaca mexico up till now the claims of fair trade benefits for the producers have been largely based on brief visits and anecdotes but now there is hard evidence in analysing the market for fair trade he distinguishes clearly between those who wish to break the market those who would reform the market and those who simply want access to a growing market but his book will be of great value not only in his conclusions about how fair trade can be made fairer but in extending our understanding of the overwhelming power of the giant corporations in international trade even seeking to improve their image by cooptation and dilution of the standards when faced by the challenge of fair trade” michael barratt brown author of fair trade reform and realities in the international trading systemit is possible to establish a global economy that is just humane and sustainable but it will not be easy the forces favoring injustice inhumanity and exploitation are powerful and entrenched and for too long they have been supported by academics and researchers who have not bothered to examine the real costs of globalization on a standard freetrade model let alone the real opportunities of globalization on an enlightened fairtrade model daniel jaffee breaks new ground with brewing justice his scholarship is stellar his conclusions are at once realistic and inspiring in these pages it is possible to find the roadmap to a new and better global economy read them closely embrace them and then get to work on building a fairtrade futurejohn nichols the nationbrewing justice is an impressive account of the relationships and ethics embedded in fair trade coffee engaging the reader in a comparative global ethnography of fair and free trade coffee production the author evaluates the gains and losses of fair trade for mexican peasants jaffees unique accomplishment is to show the consuming public how fair trade can be realized through improving the tenuous existence of producersphilip mcmichael author of development and social changebrewing justice is at once a sobering account of what the fair trade movement has achieved and an optimistic statement that only by deepening movements like this one will society advance in the direction of economic democracy and justicegerardo otero professor of sociology and latin american studies simon fraser universitybrewing justice is not just a study of fair trade coffee it also provides alternatives to the unfair rules of trade imposed by the wto and it shows that we can all play a role in shaping the economy drinking coffee is a political actvandana shiva author of earth democracy read more about the author daniel jaffee is assistant professor of sociology at portland state university

reviewstop customer reviews out of  starscoffee for justicebye n andersonon december  format paperbackverified purchasethis is a stunning book written by a sociologist it combines the best of anthropology sociology and economics to produce a work that transcends all of them and makes major contributions to the literature on social justice and on developmentthe core of it is a detailed study of the fall of coffee prices and the consequent rise of fair trade coffeebuying in oaxaca mexico oaxaca was an ideal choice because it is an impoverished area that produces very good coffee and because mexico was particularly hard hit by the world meltdown in coffee prices in the s oaxaca can now claim that much of its coffee is fair trade organic and shade grown to say nothing of being a fine drink thus it can command a relatively good price that keeps the small producers there alivebarely jaffee not only describes the coffee economy he shows from a wonderful village study how it relates to maize agriculture labor outmigration forest conservation and other important aspects of life the shadegrown coffee plantations of south mexico are incredible wildlife paradisesa birdwatchers mad dream of heavenand are absolutely critical not only for the survival of mexican birds but of migrants from the rest of north america as welljaffee seems not to know just how bad mexican coffee was in the old days of state control of the coffee economy the state saw fit in many cases to push mass production of lowgrade coffee trying to compete with brazil this failed the free market came and wrecked the economy but it did what competition is supposed to do it improved the coffee and provided better markets for what was already good it also had the sad effect of driving many producers of lowgrade coffee out of the field and into dire poverty this problem remains with ussomewhat more important is jaffees stress on the more general problems of the free market economy and neoliberalism he blames this for the worldwide woes of commodity production i do not read the evidence quite the same way as he points out the world coffee trade is really dominated by five huge multinational firms like nestle and a few more smallish ones like starbucks these firms are supported by various direct and indirect subsidies and get various other special favors an oligopoly especially when maintained by government action to some extent is not a free market he also shows that the dominance of first world buyers over third world producers of coffee and other commodities has been maintained by war subversion and other ugly procedures that are the absolute antithesis of the free market the fact isas most third world countries and a few first world scholars like aihwa ong now realizethat the world under neoliberalism has if anything even more neocolonial governmental control and manipulation than before first world interests have forced their idea of free markets on the poor nations but have kept the subsidies for their home folks to say nothing of such exercises in free marketing as the us invasion of iraq forthrightly called by alan greenspan a war for oil i have no vested interest in free markets per se but i dont think they are the whole problem herethat said jaffee is certainly correct in saying that we need much more fair trade in coffee and that it will take workneither first world strongarming nor free marketing but actual reform of trade he gives a number of very valuable and practical recommendations including protection of the term fair trade from misuse and cooptationreaders this is one place you can really make a difference i have seen mexicos smallscale coffee production and studied it and i think the situation is really night and day insist on shadegrown organic fair trade coffee seek it out even if the label is somewhat weaseled as jaffee correctly shows it often is your insistence sends a clear message recently there has been a major decline in ordinary coffee consumption but a spectacular rise in demand for fair trade and organic coffee the firms cannot ignore thatmore generally anyone interested in current problems of smallscale agriculturewhether coffee potatoes or cattleshould read this bookread morecomment  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abuse out of  starsa good working

is about much more than coffee it is a detailed look into the lives of people living in the mountains of southern mexico i have been involved with a village in the mountains of nicaragua for  years where the people also grow coffee along with staple food crops mr jaffee gets all of the details right and adds a myriad more it is worth digging into his statistics they truly help understanding the situation the people and their lives little can compare with the impact of  and  on page  the percentage of people in two categories who do not always have adequate food for their children he does not overdo it though and gives the social impacts of the economic situations both locally and worldwide that drive these peoples livesthe free vs fair trade discussion will make anyone think the book starts down a path of pushing fair trade over free trade but the more i read and digested the situation the more i tended back to free trade it is a rare book that can so tie the chain of economic events from a poor farmer in oaxaca to my morning cup of coffee but even more so i start to see many ways that we shape the world and even more where there is a shape i have no control over in the end
