adw capital partners lp seeks strategic sale of company to maximize shareholder value adw capital partners lp seeks strategic sale of company to maximize shareholder value may    et from adw capital partners lp new york may   prnewswire  ladies and gentlemen i am very concerned about the current direction of radiant logistics inc amex rlgt the company and managements sustained failure to generate shareholder value in particular the company has been marked by stagnant growth acquisition blunders poor shareholder liquidity and material dilution all resulting in a depressed share price as management seems unable to correct this situation and for the reasons outlined below i urge the company and the board to immediately engage a financial advisor in order to explore a transaction with a strategic partner or acquirer i have arrived at this conclusion for the following reasons the companys average trading volume over the last  days has been a meek  with the stock failing to trade at all on some days this dearth in liquidity seems to be largely the result of the shares being so closely held with my internal estimates showing insiders ie executive management and agent station owners the board and a few institutions controlling over  percent of the stock as these holders are keenly aware that their shares are grossly undervalued very few shares are on the open market for sale so as to allow for stock appreciation the public nature of the companys mandatory investor disclosures is preventing management from sharing certain segmentunit information that i believe is necessary to attract serious investors such as information about the companys organic revenue growth new franchise development and the implementation of new horizontal business lines unless management feels comfortable disclosing this information i believe that it will be very hard for the company to attract sufficient interest to justify remaining as an independent public company given these facts l urge the company to explore a transaction with a synergistic strategic or financial partner who could provide i capital to accelerate the growth of the companys business ii economies of scale and other builtin infrastructure that would lower the companys per capita operating costs and iii increased purchasing power at the very least the company would benefit from the reduction of public company costs to give the company an idea of the value i believe is being left on the table by remaining as an independent public company just look at uti worldwide inc  while utiws business is not identical to the companys the two companies overlap substantially in their major product category – freight forwarding however utiw currently trades at  x total enterprise value to trailing twelve month ebitda after adjustments for nonrecurring expenses i believe that the company should earn almost  mm of ebitda in the next twelve months ending june   if the company were taken private by a strategic partner i believe that the companys business could save at least  mm in costs through the elimination of overhead  at least  mm in executive salaries and an additional  mm in public company costs if the company were to go private through a transaction with a strategic partner like utiw with its deep bench of back office personnel and superior technology platform it could result in meaningful cost reductions that could contribute at least another  mm to  mm in cost synergies by my conservative estimates of fye  ebitda i believe that the company could contribute roughly  mm of ebitda to a new buyer in fye  ascribing a multiple somewhere between x and x ebitda the company could enjoy a share price in the ranges of  to  – roughly two to three times the value of the listed shares today this valuation also ascribes zero value to the potential revenue synergies that would come from a platform acquirer that has already built out a sizable truck brokerage and customs brokerage division see exhibit a below for reference i am asking management to do the right thing for all stakeholders today and refocus its effort on building shareholder value through a transaction with a strategicfinancial partner adw capital partners lp and its affiliates hold a sizable stake in the companys basic shares and urge the board to take these recommendations very seriously i look

capital partners lp seeks company review of capital allocation to maximize shareholder value at outerwall inc aug    et from adw capital partners lp new york aug   prnewswire  the following is a letter issued from adam d wyden managing member of adw capital partners lp to the outerwall inc board of directors august     outerwall inc  th avenue se bellevue wa    dear members of the board of directors as a shareholder of outerwall inc the company we are very concerned about the companys current direction while the company has seen ebitda from its redbox unit grow from roughly  mm in  to over  mm expected in  the companys market capitalization has yet to reflect this growth we believe that the companys share appreciation has been stunted by investor concern over the long term viability of redbox managements inability to manage a mature business and effectively deploy capital beyond redbox along with the workings of an entrenched board that has very little invested in the company in order to reverse this situation and create value for its shareholders we strongly urge the company to reduce its wasteful spending and return excess capital to its shareholders most of whom have seen very little return from their investment over the past few years in particular we urge that the following actions be taken immediately capital allocation initiatives    optimize and harvest cash flows at redbox redbox is a mature asset and should be treated as such while expansion in canada and in the us may result in positive npv projects there are much higher returns available for the companys capital    eliminate new ventures segment supplementing the companys renewed focus on optimizing and harvesting redbox we think it is in the companys best interest to shut down its new ventures segment the company will spend between  and  mm dollars in fy  on unproven concepts that have produced little to no revenue to date and we are highly skeptical that these concepts will produce meaningful revenue anytime soon what the company does have experience doing is taking a proven concept – a  mm  revenue business and bringing it to the masses we believe the company has this opportunity in ecoatm and should focus its time energy and capital on this proven concept with very attractive returnoninvestment characteristics    restructure  eliminate redbox instant joint venture with verizon while we admire the companys ambition to become a tier three player in the streaming videoondemand space we also recognize its challenges with fierce competitors like amazon hulu netflix and itunes we question redboxs ability to go up against established players with substantial libraries and even more substantial financial resources the capital commitments that the company needs to sustain to keep its ownership stake in instant are rising quickly and there are much more certain places the company can deploy the capital in the meantime    the company is substantially underlevered while we believe that the longevity of redbox is far greater than the market expects it faces longterm challenges however if redbox experiences an accelerated decline it would create an even greater sense of urgency to reduce capital expenditures and begin returning capital to shareholders as quickly as possible we believe the company has an extraordinary opportunity to borrow money at record low rates today given the companys modest maintenance capital requirements going forward we believe the company could increase its leverage profile to roughly a modest x  net debt  ebitda and still have substantial cash flow to fund shareholder distributions and the growth of ecoatm    dramatically increase share repurchases through an acceleratedstockrepurchase program or tender offer we acknowledge that the company has periodically returned capital to shareholders through various share repurchase programs unfortunately the company has been limited in its scope and scale of these initiatives due to the expanding capital requirements of redbox and its various new ventures if the company were to pare its spending on redbox and eliminate its new ventures spending we believe the company could generate more than enough free cash flow to service its debt continue to grow ecoatm and reward its patient shareholders today with a very accretive transaction we have built a basic financial model outlining the financial outcome of our proposed changes we have used the midpoint of the companys  ebitda projections and its year ending  expected cash balance proforma for the ecoatm transaction as our starting points we then added our expected contribution from an accelerated ecoatm rollout in  and  while eliminating the effect of the companys new ventures segment our model also assumes that the company repurchases  percent of its diluted shares outstanding roughly  mm shares at an average price of  while repurchasing this much of the stock at these prices may be unrealistic the outcome is staggering we believe the company could pay up to  a share to retire  percent of its outstanding stock and still be able to consummate a very accretive transaction for remaining shareholders  in hindsight the boards choices regarding capital allocation appear tightfisted and are even more disheartening in light of the rapid growth of the companys redbox segment bluntly speaking we dont think the company is doing enough with a cash position of almost x ebitda we believe the company is approximately x full turns of leverage below comparable mature companies despite its relatively lower capital intensity and higher cash generation abilities we also note that the board has almost no ownership of the companys shares even after receiving ample sharebased compensation for its services over the years this disparity raises serious concerns about the current boards sense of urgency and its alignment of interests with shareholders  we are aware that our concerns and beliefs are shared by other shareholders and were previously presented to the board and management only to later be ignored also we understand from various media outlets that the board rejected a private equity firms offer to acquire the company last summer at a substantial premium to its current market valuation perhaps such actions are explained by the fact no board member or member of management has made a single open market acquisition of company shares since august of  and thus has very little invested in the companys stock appreciation we are asking the board and management to do what is right for the companys shareholders to whom the board has a fiduciary duty  it is our belief that successful execution of the initiatives outlined in this letter will reward the companys patient shareholders

of adw capital partners lp adw capital and eric shahinian of camac partners llc camac new york city based investment firms transmitted today a letter to the board of directors and management of imvescor restaurant group inc the company or imvescor irgto seeking a strategic sale of the company adw capital and camac along with their affiliates which collectively hold approximately  of the companys shares and warrants believe that in seeking a strategicfinancial partner it will ensure that the company can best continue on its growth plan while maximizing shareholder valuefound below is the full text of the funds letter to the companyaugust  imvescor restaurant group incco françoisxavier seigneur chairman decarie suite montreal qc hp p canadadear board and management of imvescor restaurant group inc irgtowe would like to begin by commending the board and management on the companys successful turnaround and implementation of its restaurant rejuvenation plan specifically we think the hiring of frank hennessy almost two years ago has brought a great deal of stability and focus to an organization that had been orphaned of leadership and strategy for many years prior to that end it is not surprising that the operational results have followed suit with a material reversal in same store sales trends and increased profitability at both the franchisee and corporate levels we also expect these trends to continue for the foreseeable futureas you know adw capital and camac have been longterm shareholders of the company with certain purchases dating back almost  years we have also almost unilaterally approved with the capital markets and operational decisions the company has made in the last few years including its recent implementation of a quarterly dividend notwithstanding these accomplishments we believe the company is at a crossroads today and as likely its two largest shareholders believe we have identified the most advantageous path for the company going forward frankly we do not think it makes sense for imvescor to continue as a publicly traded entity and that it should hire a financial advisor to pursue a sale of the company immediately if you have not done so alreadywe have arrived at this conclusion for the following reasonswhile the company has averaged trading volume of  cad  over the last  days the company has gone days in the nottoodistant past without trading a single share this lack of trading activity is due in large part to the very closely held nature of the shares today we estimate across a few select institutionsshareholders over  percent of the companys shares are in firm hands and are not for salewe think it is fair to assume that these shares are not for sale because the companys concentrated investor base many of whom have owned its shares for several years now have followed its progress closely and recognize the companys continued discounted value and business trajectoryin addition to the sparse liquidity barring new investors from taking a meaningful stake in the company management has been unwilling to share certain segmentunit information in its disclosures and generally engage in open dialog with its shareholders about its longterm growth and monetization strategywe believe the company could ameliorate this issue and continue growing with the help of the right strategicfinancial partner in addition to being able to provide capital to accelerate the growth of imvescors platform which is already taking hold we think the company could benefit immensely from substantial cost and revenue synergies by joining with a larger strategic partner while not being burdened by the disclosure requirements of being an independent public company perhaps most relevant to our analysis is that we think a transaction benefits all the companys stakeholders  franchisees included in our conversations with franchisees owners often cite high food costs and burdensome payments for their share of advertising costs if the company were to merge with a strategic partner some of the savings from combined food procurement and pooled advertising could be shared with the companys franchiseesin fiscal  corporate ga ex onetime restructuring charges amounted to approximately cad  mm it is our belief that additional corporate costs may also be getting allocated to the companys franchising segment notwithstanding any such allocation we believe a strategic partner could reduce at minimum cad  mm costs from the platform inclusive of procurement savings on  cad  mm of system sales we expect the company to earn on a standalone basis roughly cad    mm of ebitda in fiscal  with minimal maintenance capital expenditures in the hands of the right strategic buyer we could expect imvescors contribution to approximate cad    mm of ebitda at a multiple of x to x this would amount to exit values of cad    per shareit should also not be lost on management and the board that control premiums in the marketplace for portfolios of franchised restaurants are at record highs as evidenced by the recent st hubert and kahala brands acquisitions we think the company could structure a stockforstock transaction or partial cash and stock with a larger public company that would allow current shareholders to receive a premium for their stock while allowing them to participate in the tremendous value and synergy imvescor will add to the new platformanother interesting option for the company would be to explore a transaction with a financial buyer given the durability and predictability of franchise restaurant company cash flows companies like imvescor are favored for platform rollup strategies a wellcapitalized private equity firm could take advantage of imvescors lower canadian tax base coupled with a low cost of debt capital and use it as a platform to roll up additional franchise concepts or better yet many private equity firms already have portfolios of franchise restaurants and could inure many of the same strategic cost saves as well as tax basis savings by combining their portfolios with imvescorread morewe are asking management to do the right thing for all stakeholders today by seeking a strategicfinancial partner at this stage in the game it will ensure that the company can grow significantly without many of the competitive

hedge fund transmitted yesterday a letter to the board of directors and management of imvescor restaurant group inc the company tsx irg seeking a review of the current dividend policy for the company  adw capital along with its affiliates hold approximately  of the company on a nondiluted basis found below is the full text of mr wydens letter to the company february   imvescor restaurant group inc co denis richard president and chief executive officer  main street suite  moncton nb ec y dear board and management of imvescor restaurant group inc adw capital partners lp and its affiliates currently own approximately  of the outstanding common stock of imvescor restaurant group inc imvescor or the company and additional shares upon conversion of warrants making us one of the companys largest shareholders we would like to commend the board and management on the beginning of a successful turnaround of the company we are also excited about the return of denis richard as ceo however now that the company has proven its ability to generate consistent free cash flow we believe it is time for imvescor to reinstate its dividend to reward patient shareholders and to ensure financial discipline we have come to this conclusion for several reasons the company has strong recurring cash flow today while the market responded poorly to imvescors q  earnings release on january  we were impressed by the recurring cash flows imvescor generated though imvescor reported adjusted ebitda of  million for  we believe recurring ebitda was actually much higher legal fees of  million and lease exit costs of  million added up to  million in  almost twice the average for the past three years of  million and much higher than s  million if we accept the  million figure as the recurring level of costs recurring  ebitda for the company was closer to  million in all likelihood as operations normalize we believe this number should approximate k to k almost  million in savings from current levels adding in the  million of incremental ebitda that can be expected from the recent commensal acquisition and additional retail sales and imvescor should generate at least  million in ebitda going forward if we are to reverse the recent stock based compensation which is noncash the number is closer to  million at  million in ebitda imvescor is left with around  million in levered free cash flow we believe over time imvescor should pay out about  percent of its free cash flow to shareholders implying approximately  million in annual dividends at  million diluted shares outstanding the suggested dividend would be around  cents per share peers appear to be valued on dividend yield imvescors four closest public comps each pay significant dividends and investors have rewarded them for it aw revenue royalties income fund awun boston pizza royalties income fund bpfun keg royalties income fund kegun and pizza pizza royalty corp pza each trade at dividend yields of  if imvescor were to pay an annual dividend of  cents per share such a dividend yield should produce a valuation range of  to  per share substantially higher than imvescors current stock price of  the company is underlevered and mispriced imvescor is wellcapitalized considering the companys reliable franchise revenues and low capital expenditures while we are open to opportunistictransformational acquisitions like that of commensal at attractive multiples x  x pro forma ebitda we believe imvescor should not set aside cash for ma rather if the companys cash cannot cover an acquisition the company should take on additional debt given the attractiveness of the transaction relative to its market value we believe that taking on debt will command discipline out of the companys management team and only allow them to pursue deals that are truly accretive low multiple  x  x on a side note we believe reinstating a dividend will give the market confidence in the companys ability to generate consistent and recurring free cash flow and reward it with a substantially higher multiple as the peer group indicates we believe this will provide a currency for future accretive ma open the company up to higher multiple deals when stock price reflects full fair value and offer an alternative to using leverage we believe the company has significant avenues for internal growth going forward that are not substantially capital intensive a return to unit growth at baton rouge a successful rollout of the scores express concept the introduction of additional skus in the retail segment and most importantly the massive revenue opportunity from insourcing the franchise system supplychain with commensal currently the company has approximately  million of systemwide sales the commensal acquisition provides the opportunity for our franchisees to purchase their food products directly from the company we believe this ensures quality control for the company and offers the opportunity for our franchisees to lower their cost of goods for illustration purposes if the company was able to replace a thirdparty as the primary supplier of  million of the franchisees food costs at a  percent ebitda margin that would lead to  million of incremental ebitda far in excess of the companys projections it is noteworthy that the companys ga expenses approach the same levels of mty food group  a company with twice the revenues we expect the company over time to identify cost savings and grow into its cost base through the organic growth initiatives outlined above if this is not possible we believe it is in the best interest of shareholders to pursue efforts to successfully monetize some or all of the companys assets to a larger strategic player who can better leverage their own cost structure we have worked constructively and successfully with small companies in the us and canada over the last several years we urge the board to take our recommendations seriously and we look forward to hearing your

letter –  cagr by vw staff on january    am in value investing sharetweetpin itsubmit adw capital partners  letter to investors dear partners adw capital up  in   hedge fund letters it is our pleasure to report results for the th quarter of  and our th quarter since inception at the risk of sounding like a broken record we want to reiterate a critical point discussed in all quarterly letters adw capital partners lp the “fund” operates a concentrated taxsensitive and longterm strategy designed to minimize correlation to the broader indices with a focus on avoiding permanent capital loss inevitably this approach will result in periods of underperformance by the same token our efforts to maintain a lower correlation strategy driven by companyspecific outcomes may produce significant outperformance in periods of market weakness as we saw in  we are not traders return chasers or monthtomonth stock jockeys we are investors who look for opportunities to return multiples on the fund’s capital in a taxefficient manner over an extended period of time while this strategy may yield lumpy results we believe it limits idea dilution and protects the fund’s returns from uncle sam and wall street adw capital partners adw capital partners – “stick to the script to stay in the movie” wow  percent for  and returns of  percent for six years it could intoxicate even the best of us better yet the fund is already off to a roaring start in january…it is so easy to get caught up in the noise hysteria and cacophony that is the “institutional hedge fund business” let’s be clear here we don’t believe we run a prototypical “hedge fund” for those of you familiar with my background adw capital was birthed out of a personal lifetime passion for investing and need to “get leverage on my own best ideas” there were no monte carlo simulations run to target sortino or sharpe ratios or differential equations to target ideal leverage and position sizes in the olden days “hedge fund” really meant a fund that does not have a single mandate to make money – as long as they made money long short sideways it didn’t matter if you were creating value for your customers it also meant that you were allowed to charge modest fees to your investors because you earned them by consistently outperforming your benchmarks net of fees today the industry is plagued with too many players and investors with unrealistic expectations about volatility liquidity concentration and targeted exposures why have we been successful while others have struggled the answer is quite simple you because i love what i do so much i have been able to build a business that has allowed me to invest the way i would invest personally – chunky positions long hold times  low turnover and use volatility as a tool as opposed to letting it cripple me i was very fortunate to not get a single call from an unhappy investor while the fund was going through a greater than  percent drawdown through the end of  and into  in fact i got many words of encouragement and a few checks too to add to our names we had increasing conviction in as you might recall from this year’s earlier letters all of our companies reported tremendous th quarter results and were tirelessly creating value that the market for one reason or another didn’t care about at that fine moment but it was because of you – our army of almost seventy likeminded limited partners that we did not retreat but we in fact “doubled down” while there are always “shortcuts” available to those anxious to get somewhere in a hurry we are proud of the business we have built and the loyal partners that have built it we believe it presents an excellent foundation for the future furthermore we believe this excellent foundation “allowed us to stick to script so we could stay in the movie” had we accepted limited partners who had short term goals different than our own could it have affected what we would have done in those more difficult moments earlier in the year certainly in fact i would go as far as to say that that is perhaps the single biggest problem in the fund business today managers are running their portfolios to meet unrealistic investor expectations as opposed to managing them for long term results fortunately we have selfselected away from that investor cohort and have built a business i can run for the rest of my life and at some point even my progeny so this is a long winded way of saying that after six years i am very thankful for the kind words support and loyalty of our partners while i cannot promise things will always go up and to the right i can promise you that our resolve has never been stronger so thank you for creating an environment to let me go to war for you everyday to that end we will not be talking about current or prospective investments in this letter it has become quite evident that there are a number of “home gamers” who get their hands on our letters and are trying to replicate our positionsportfolio as many of you are aware we are actively raising funds to increase our prorata stakes in many of our positions and by no means want to “frontrun” ourselves or you my allegiances are firmly to the current partners of adw capital partners lp – myself being the largest if current partners are interested in giving me my mom and the rest of the adw family a hug or learning more about what we are up to in a controlled environment i encourage you to come to our meeting next month operational updateconclusion this will be a little repetitive… in connection with the growth of the firm and based on reverse inquiry we have decided to host our first annual meeting  breakfast the morning of february th at jefferies in nyc while the meeting is reserved for existing limited partners we may have select availability for a few “serious fans” please let us know if you would be interested in attending as we need contact info for security we want to thank all of you again for the opportunity to steward your capital and look forward to many more years with you as partners as always we are available to answer any and all of your questions regarding the operations of the fund or
