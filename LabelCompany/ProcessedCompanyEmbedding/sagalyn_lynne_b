motion a chain of events that fundamentally transformed both the united states and the wider world war has raged in the middle east for a decade and a half and americans have become accustomed to surveillance enhanced security and periodic terrorist attacks but the symbolic locus of the post world has always been ground zerothe sixteen acres in manhattans financial district where the twin towers collapsed while idealism dominated in the initial rebuilding phase interestgroup trench warfare soon ensued myriad battles involving all of the interests with a stake in that spacereal estate interests victims families politicians the port authority of new york and new jersey the federal government community groups architectural firms and a panoply of ambitious entrepreneurs grasping for pieces of the pieraged for over a decade and nearly fifteen years later there are still loose ends that need resolution in power at ground zero lynne sagalyn offers the definitive account of one of the greatest reconstruction projects in modern world history sagalyn is americas most eminent scholar of major urban reconstruction projects and this is the culmination of over a decade of research both epic in scope and granular in detail this is at base a classic new york story sagalyn has an extraordinary command over all of the actors and moving parts involved in the drama the long parade of new york and new jersey governors involved in the project mayor michael bloomberg various port authority leaders the ubiquitous real estate magnate larry silverstein and architectural superstars like santiago calatrava and daniel libeskind as she shows political competition at the local state regional and federal level along with vast sums of money drove every aspect of the planning process but the reconstruction project was always about more than complex real estate deals and jockeying among local politicians the symbolism of the reconstruction extended far beyond new york and was freighted with the twin tasks of symbolizing american resilience and projecting american power as a result every aspect was contested as sagalyn points out while modern city building is often dismissed as coldhearted and detached from meaning the opposite was true at ground zero virtually every action was infused with symbolic significance and needed to be debated the emotional dimension of  made this largescale rebuilding effort unique it supercharged the complexity of the rebuilding process with both sanctity and a truly unique politics covering all of this and more power at ground zero is sure
