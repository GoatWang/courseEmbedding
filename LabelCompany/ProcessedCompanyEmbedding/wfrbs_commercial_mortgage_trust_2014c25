scheduled loan amortization at issuance the pool consisted of  fixedrate loans secured by  commercial and multifamily properties as at the november  remittance all loans remain in the pool with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of  million according to the most recent yearend reporting the pool reported a weightedaverage wa debt service coverage ratio dscr of  times x and a wa debt yield of  at issuance the dbrs wa dscr and debt yield for the pool were x and  respectively per ye financials the top  loans reported a wa dscr of x and a wa net cash flow ncf increase of  over the dbrs underwritten cash flows as at the november  remittance there are no loans in special servicing and six loans are on the servicers watchlist representing  of the current pool balance of these six loans two have been flagged for deferred maintenance concerns generally minor in nature one was flagged for a casualty event that is being addressed and another loan representing  of the pool balance has been watchlisted because of a marketdriven performance decline see below the two other loans both secured by apartment complexes in warrensville heights ohio and owned by the same sponsor have reported cash flow declines from the dbrs uw figures of  and  as at ye resulting from increased operating expenses as occupancy and rental rates have remained stable both loans have reported an improvement with the q  annualized financials the two largest loans in the pool representing  of the total pool balance are secured by large regional malls operated by simon property group and are highlighted below the st johns town center loan prospectus id  of the current pool balance is secured by a  million square foot sf regional mall located in jacksonville florida and is considered to be the preeminent shopping destination in the city as at september  mall occupancy remains strong at  with an average rental rate of  per square foot psf  figures comparable with  and  psf at issuance respectively the slight decrease in occupancy is attributable to the premature departure of forever   of the net rentable area nra in march  which was noted as a surprise as the store appeared to be popular with shoppers this space currently represents the largest vacancy at the mall and according to local news reports apple is planning to move into this space from its smaller unit at the mall with a  million buildout planned in addition several large tenants have recently executed fiveyear lease renewals including joann fabrics ross dress for less dsw shoe warehouse and barnes  noble tenant rollover remains minimal in the next  months the loan which is interest only io for the full term reported a q  wholeloan dscr of x an improvement over x at ye and represents an annualized ncf increase of  over the dbrs uw figures at issuance dbrs assigned an investmentgrade shadow rating to this loan dbrs has today confirmed that the performance of this loan remains consistent with investmentgrade loan characteristics the colorado mills loan prospectus id  of the current pool balance is secured by a  million sf regional mall located in lakewood colorado a denver suburb the subject is the largest mall statewide with the most inline space and contains a mix of regular and outlet space tenants as well as some nontraditional tenants such as an indoor trampoline park and an indoor putting green park mall occupancy has recently declined to  as a result of sports authority  of the nra vacating its  sf anchor space in july  however this space is being assumed by dicks sporting goods with an april   planned opening date as per the online mall directory there is considerable upcoming tenant rollover as united artists theatre  of the nra jumpstreet  of the nra and saks off th  of the nra have leases maturing in the second half of  junior anchor burlington coat factory recently executed a fiveyear renewal through  at a similar rental rate the loan reported a q  wholeloan dscr of x on an amortizing basis in line with ye and represents an annualized ncf increase of  over the dbrs uw figures the loan has a remaining io term of  months the loans sponsor simon property group is currently developing another outlet mall the  sf denver premium outlets located  miles north of the subject with a planned opening in october  dbrs believes the impact to the subject will be minimal as the new mall will be located much farther out and will not have the large population and existing infrastructure surrounding the subject which benefits from being closely located to interstate  and highway  the cornerstone apartments loan prospectus id  of the current pool balance is secured by a unit multifamily complex located in midland texas the loan has been placed on the servicers watchlist as a result of a decline in property performance resulting from the decline in the energybased local economy as at june  the property was  occupied with an average rental rate of  per unit a decline from  and  per unit at issuance respectively the current vacancy rate is in line with the  vacancy rate reported by reis for similar vintage properties in the midlandodessa market the march  property inspection revealed that lowered rents movein incentives and solid longterm management have prevented an even larger occupancy decline during the inspection it was noted that the neighboring residential complex was  vacant at the time the q  dscr of x reflects an ncf decline of  from the dbrs uw figures with collateral performance dependent on a recovery in the local economy the loan is expected to perform at a similar level in the medium term the ratings assigned to the classes c e f and pex certificates materially deviate from the higher ratings implied by the quantitative model dbrs considers a material deviation to be a rating differential of three or more notches between the assigned rating and the rating implied by the quantitative model that is a substantial component of a rating methodology in this case the rating reflects the sustainability of loan performance trends not demonstrated for more information on this transaction and supporting
