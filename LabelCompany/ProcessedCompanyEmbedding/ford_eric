standardized mass production and mass consumption the concept is named for henry ford it is used in social economic and management theory about production working conditions consumption and related phenomena especially regarding the th century contents  overview  background  history  regulation theory  postfordism  cultural references  see also  references  bibliography overviewedit fordism is the eponymous manufacturing system designed to spew out standardized lowcost goods and afford its workers decent enough wages to buy them it has also been described as a model of economic expansion and technological progress based on mass production the manufacture of standardized products in huge volumes using special purpose machinery and unskilled labor although fordism was a method used to improve productivity in the automotive industry the principle could be applied to any kind of manufacturing process major success stemmed from three major principles the standardization of the product nothing is handmade but everything is made through machines and molds by unskilled workers the employment of assembly lines which use specialpurpose tools andor equipment to allow unskilled workers to contribute to the finished product workers are paid higher living wages so that they can afford to purchase the products they make the principles coupled with a technological revolution during henry fords time allowed for his revolutionary form of labor to flourish his assembly line was revolutionary but in no way original his most original contribution to the modern world was breaking down complex tasks into simpler ones with the help of specialised tools simpler tasks created interchangeable parts that could be used the same every time that allowed for a very adaptable flexibility creating an assembly line that could change its constituent components to meet the needs of the product being assembled in reality the assembly line had already been around before ford although not in quite the same effectiveness as he would create his real accomplishment was recognizing the potential by breaking it all down into its components only to build it back up again in a more effective and productive combination thereby producing an optimum method for the real world the major advantages of such a change was that it cut down on the manpower necessary for the factory to operate and it deskilled the labour itself cutting down on costs of production there are four levels of fordism as described by bob jessop backgroundedit ford cars model a shown became a symbol of effective mass production efficiency both decreased the price of the cars and allowed ford to increase his workers wages hence common workers could buy their own cars the ford motor company was one of several hundred small automobile manufacturers that emerged between  and  after five years of producing automobiles ford introduced the model t which was simple and light but sturdy enough to drive on the countrys primitive roads the mass production of this automobile lowered its unit price making it affordable for the average consumer furthermore ford substantially increased his workers wages to combat rampant absenteeism and employee turnover which approached  annually which had the byproduct of giving them the means to become customers that led to massive consumption in fact the model t surpassed all expectations because it attained a peak of  of the automobile output within the united states the production system that ford exemplified involved synchronization precision and specialization within a company ford and his senior managers did not use the word fordism themselves to describe their motivations or worldview which they did not consider an ism however many contemporaries framed their worldview as one and applied the name fordism to it historyedit the term gained prominence when was used by antonio gramsci in  in his essay americanism and fordism in his prison notebooks since then it has been used by a number of writers on economics and society mainly but not exclusively in the marxist tradition according to historian charles s maier fordism proper was preceded in europe by taylorism a technique of labor discipline and workplace organization based upon supposedlyscientific studies of human efficiency and incentive systems it attracted european intellectuals especially in germany and italy from the fin de siècle to world war i after  however the goal of taylorist labor efficiency thought in europe moved to fordism the reorganization of the entire productive process by the moving assembly line standardization and the mass market the grand appeal of fordism in europe was that it promised to sweep away all the archaic residues of precapitalist society by subordinating the economy society and even the human personality to the strict criteria of technical rationality the great depression blurred the utopian vision of american technocracy but world war ii and its aftermath revived the ideal the principles of taylorism were quickly picked up by vladimir lenin and applied to the industrialization of the soviet union later under the inspiration of gramsci marxists picked up the fordism concept in the s and developed postfordism in the s antonio and bonanno  trace the development of fordism and subsequent economic stages from globalization to neoliberal globalization during the th century and emphasized americas role in globalization fordism for gramsci meant routine intensified labor to promote production antonio and bonanno argue that fordism peaked in the postworld war ii decades of american dominance and mass consumerism but collapsed from political and cultural attacks on the people in the s advances in technology and the end of the cold war ushered in a new neoliberal phase of globalization in the s antonio and bonanno further suggest that negative elements of fordism such as economic inequality remained allowing related cultural and environmental troubles which inhibited americas pursuit of democracy to surface historian thomas hughes has detailed how the soviet union in the s and the s enthusiastically embraced fordism and taylorism by importing american experts in both fields as well as american engineering firms to build parts of its new industrial infrastructure the concepts of the fiveyear plan and the centrallyplanned economy can be traced directly to the influence of taylorism on soviet thinking hughes quotes joseph stalin american efficiency is that indomitable force which neither knows nor recognizes obstacles which continues on a task once started until it is finished even if it is a minor task and without which serious constructive work is inconceivable the combination of the russian revolutionary sweep with american efficiency is the essence of leninism hughes describes how as the soviet union developed and grew in power both the soviets and the americans chose to ignore or deny the contribution of american ideas and expertise the soviets did so because they wished to portray themselves as creators of their own destiny and not indebted to their rivals americans did so because they did not wish to acknowledge during the cold war their part in creating a powerful rival regulation theoryedit this article possibly contains original

his most original contribution to the modern world was breaking down complex tasks into simpler ones with the help of specialised tools simpler tasks created interchangeable parts that could be used

assembly line had already been around before ford although not in quite the same effectiveness as he would create his real accomplishment was recognizing the potential by breaking it all down into its components only to build it back up again in a more effective and productive combination thereby producing an optimum method for the real world the major advantages of such a change was that it cut

could buy their own cars the ford motor company was one of several hundred small automobile manufacturers that emerged between  and  after five years of producing automobiles ford introduced the model

furthermore ford substantially increased his workers wages to combat rampant absenteeism and employee turnover which approached  annually which had the byproduct of giving them the means to become

ford exemplified involved synchronization precision and specialization within a company ford and his senior managers did not use the word fordism themselves to describe their motivations or worldview

in  in his essay americanism and fordism in his prison notebooks since then it has been used by a number of writers on economics and society mainly but not exclusively in the marxist tradition according to historian charles s maier fordism proper was preceded in europe by taylorism a technique of labor discipline and workplace organization based upon supposedlyscientific studies of human efficiency and incentive systems it attracted european intellectuals especially in germany and italy from the fin de siècle to world war i after  however the goal of taylorist labor efficiency thought in europe moved to fordism the reorganization of the entire productive process by the moving assembly line standardization and the mass market the grand appeal of fordism in europe was that it promised to sweep away all the archaic residues of precapitalist society by subordinating the economy society and even the human personality to the strict criteria of technical rationality the great

negative elements of fordism such as economic inequality remained allowing related cultural and environmental troubles which inhibited americas pursuit of democracy to surface historian thomas hughes has detailed how the soviet union in the s and the s enthusiastically embraced fordism and taylorism by importing american experts in both fields as well as american engineering firms to build parts of its new industrial infrastructure the concepts of the fiveyear plan and the centrallyplanned economy can be traced directly to the influence of taylorism on soviet thinking hughes quotes joseph stalin american efficiency is that indomitable force which neither knows nor recognizes obstacles which continues on a task once started until it is finished even if it is a minor task and without which serious constructive work is inconceivable the combination of the russian revolutionary sweep with american efficiency is the essence of leninism hughes describes how as the soviet union developed and grew in power both the soviets and the americans chose to ignore or deny the contribution of american ideas and expertise the soviets did so because they wished to portray themselves as creators of their own destiny and not indebted to their rivals americans did so because they did not wish to acknowledge during the cold war their part in creating a powerful rival regulation

machinery and unskilled labor although fordism was a method used to improve productivity in the automotive industry the principle could be applied to any kind of manufacturing process major success stemmed from three major principles the standardization of the product nothing is handmade but everything is made through machines and molds by unskilled workers the employment of assembly lines which

fordism  wikipedia fordism from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search fordism describes modern economic and social systems based on industrialized standardized mass production and mass consumption the concept is named for henry ford it is used in social economic and management theory about production working conditions consumption and related phenomena especially regarding the th century contents  overview  background  history  regulation theory  postfordism  cultural references  see also  references  bibliography overviewedit fordism is the eponymous manufacturing system designed to spew out standardized lowcost goods and afford its workers decent enough wages to buy them it has also been described as a model of economic expansion and technological progress based on mass production the manufacture of standardized products in huge volumes using special purpose machinery and unskilled labor although fordism was a method used to improve productivity in the automotive industry the principle could be applied to any kind of manufacturing process major success stemmed from three major principles the standardization of the product nothing is handmade but everything is made through machines and molds by unskilled workers the employment of assembly lines which use specialpurpose tools andor equipment to allow unskilled workers to contribute to the finished product workers are paid higher living wages so that they can afford to purchase the products they make the principles coupled with a technological revolution during henry fords time allowed for his revolutionary form of labor to flourish his assembly line was revolutionary but in no way original his most original contribution to the modern world was breaking down complex tasks into simpler ones with the help of specialised tools simpler tasks created interchangeable parts that could be used the same every time that allowed for a very adaptable flexibility creating an assembly line that could change its constituent components to meet the needs of the product being assembled in reality the assembly line had already been around before ford although not in quite the same effectiveness as he would create his real accomplishment was recognizing the potential by breaking it all down into its components only to build it back up again in a more effective and productive combination thereby producing an optimum method for the real world the major advantages of such a change was that it cut down on the manpower necessary for the factory to operate and it deskilled the labour itself cutting down on costs of production there are four levels of fordism as described by bob jessop backgroundedit ford cars model a shown became a symbol of effective mass production efficiency both decreased the price of the cars and allowed ford to increase his workers wages hence common workers could buy their own cars the ford motor company was one of several hundred small automobile manufacturers that emerged between  and  after five years of producing automobiles ford introduced the model t which was simple and light but sturdy enough to drive on the countrys primitive roads the mass production of this automobile lowered its unit price making it affordable for the average consumer furthermore ford substantially increased his workers wages to combat rampant absenteeism and employee turnover which approached  annually which had the byproduct of giving them the means to become customers that led to massive consumption in fact the model t surpassed all expectations because it attained a peak of  of the automobile output within the united states the production system that ford exemplified involved synchronization precision and specialization within a company ford and his senior managers did not use the word fordism themselves to describe their motivations or worldview which they did not consider an ism however many contemporaries framed their worldview as one and applied the name fordism to it historyedit the term gained prominence when was used by antonio gramsci in  in his essay americanism and fordism in his prison notebooks since then it has been used by a number of writers on economics and society mainly but not exclusively in the marxist tradition according to historian charles s maier fordism proper was preceded in europe by taylorism a technique of labor discipline and workplace organization based upon supposedlyscientific studies of human efficiency and incentive systems it attracted european intellectuals especially in germany and italy from the fin de siècle to world war i after  however the goal of taylorist labor efficiency thought in europe moved to fordism the reorganization of the entire productive process by the moving assembly line standardization and the mass market the grand appeal of fordism in europe was that it promised to sweep away all the archaic residues of precapitalist society by subordinating the economy society and even the human personality to the strict criteria of technical rationality the great depression blurred the utopian vision of american technocracy but world war ii and its aftermath revived the ideal the principles of taylorism were quickly picked up by vladimir lenin and applied to the industrialization of the soviet union later under the inspiration of gramsci marxists picked up the fordism concept in the s and developed postfordism in the s antonio and bonanno  trace the development of fordism and subsequent economic stages from globalization to neoliberal globalization during the th century and emphasized americas role in globalization fordism for gramsci meant routine intensified labor to promote production antonio and bonanno argue that fordism peaked in the postworld war ii decades of american dominance and mass consumerism but collapsed from political and cultural attacks on the people in the s advances in technology and the end of the cold war ushered in a new neoliberal phase of globalization in the s antonio and bonanno further suggest that negative elements of fordism such as economic inequality remained allowing related cultural and environmental troubles which inhibited americas pursuit of democracy to surface historian thomas hughes has detailed how the soviet union in the s and the s enthusiastically embraced fordism and taylorism by importing american experts in both fields as well as american engineering firms to build parts of its new industrial infrastructure the concepts of the fiveyear plan and the

encyclopedia jump to navigation search fordism describes modern economic and social systems based on industrialized standardized mass production and mass consumption the concept is named for henry ford it is used in social economic and management theory about production working conditions consumption and related phenomena especially regarding the th century contents  overview  background  history  regulation theory  postfordism  cultural references  see also  references  bibliography overviewedit fordism is the eponymous manufacturing system designed to spew out standardized lowcost goods and afford its workers decent enough wages to buy them it has also been described as a model of economic expansion and technological progress based on mass production the manufacture of standardized products in huge volumes using special purpose machinery and unskilled labor although fordism was a method used to improve productivity in the automotive industry the principle could be applied to any kind of manufacturing process major success stemmed from three major principles the standardization of the product nothing is handmade but everything is made through machines and molds by unskilled workers the employment of assembly lines which use specialpurpose tools andor equipment to allow unskilled workers to contribute to the finished product workers are paid higher living wages so that they can afford to purchase the products they make the principles coupled with a technological revolution during henry fords time allowed for his revolutionary form of labor to flourish his assembly line was revolutionary but in no way original his most original contribution to the modern world was breaking down complex tasks into simpler ones with the help of specialised tools simpler tasks created interchangeable parts that could be used the same every time that allowed for a very adaptable flexibility creating an assembly line that could change its constituent components to meet the needs of the product being assembled in reality the assembly line had already been around before ford although not in quite the same effectiveness as he would create his real accomplishment was recognizing the potential by breaking it all down into its components only to build it back up again in a more effective and productive combination thereby producing an optimum method for the real world the major advantages of such a change was that it cut down on the manpower necessary for the factory to operate and it deskilled the labour itself cutting down on costs of production there are four levels of fordism as described by bob jessop backgroundedit ford cars model a shown became a symbol of effective mass production efficiency both decreased the price of the cars and allowed ford to increase his workers wages hence common workers could buy their own cars the ford motor company was one of several hundred small automobile manufacturers that emerged between  and  after five years of producing automobiles ford introduced the model t which was simple and light but sturdy enough to drive on the countrys primitive roads the mass production of this automobile lowered its unit price making it affordable for the average consumer furthermore ford substantially increased his workers wages to combat rampant absenteeism and employee turnover which approached  annually which had the byproduct of giving them the means to become customers that led to massive consumption in fact the model t surpassed all expectations because it attained a peak of  of the automobile output within the united states the production system that ford exemplified involved synchronization precision and specialization within a company ford and his senior managers did not use the word fordism themselves to describe their motivations or worldview which they did not consider an ism however many contemporaries framed their worldview as one and applied the name fordism to it historyedit the term gained prominence when was used by antonio gramsci in  in his essay americanism and fordism in his prison notebooks since then it has been used by a number of writers on economics and society mainly but not exclusively in the marxist tradition according to historian charles s maier fordism proper was preceded in europe by taylorism a technique of labor discipline and workplace organization based upon supposedlyscientific studies of human efficiency and incentive systems it attracted european intellectuals especially in germany and italy from the fin de siècle to world war i after  however the goal of taylorist labor efficiency thought in europe moved to fordism the reorganization of the entire productive process by the moving assembly line standardization and the mass market the grand appeal of fordism in europe was that it promised to sweep away all the archaic residues of precapitalist society by subordinating the economy society and even the human personality to the strict criteria of technical rationality the great depression blurred the utopian vision of american technocracy but world war ii and its aftermath revived the ideal the principles of taylorism were quickly picked up by vladimir lenin and applied to the industrialization of the soviet union later under the inspiration of gramsci marxists picked up the fordism concept in the s and developed postfordism in the s antonio and bonanno  trace the development of fordism and subsequent economic stages from globalization to neoliberal globalization during the th century and emphasized americas role in globalization fordism for gramsci meant routine intensified labor to promote production antonio and bonanno argue that fordism peaked in the postworld war ii decades of american dominance and mass consumerism but collapsed from political and cultural attacks on the people in the s advances in technology and the end of the cold war ushered in a new neoliberal phase of globalization in the s antonio and bonanno further suggest that negative elements of fordism such as economic inequality remained allowing related cultural and environmental troubles which inhibited americas pursuit of democracy to surface historian thomas hughes has detailed how the soviet union in the s and the s enthusiastically embraced fordism and taylorism by importing american experts in both fields as well as american engineering firms to build parts of its new industrial infrastructure the concepts of the fiveyear plan and the centrallyplanned economy can be traced directly to the influence of taylorism on soviet thinking hughes quotes joseph stalin american efficiency is that indomitable force which neither knows nor recognizes obstacles which continues on a task once started until it is finished even if it is a minor task and without which serious constructive work is inconceivable the combination of the russian revolutionary sweep with american efficiency is the essence of leninism

squeeze too hard but feel secure and look sharpsunglasses sunglasses are very nicethey are very fashionableawesomequality sunglasses i was truly surprised of the quality of these persol sunglassestotally fabi love these sunglasses the only not completely positive comment i have is that they are a bit large i am a female and i knew when i purchased them that they are actually mens sunglasses however because the description does state that they are perfect for men and women both i went ahead and ordered them i havent had a chance to ask friends what they think of them on me and even though they are slightly big on my face i think friends will say they look greatbecause they are so cool just the right amount of color and bling to be super cool without being garish or ugly or too outrageous i am not even a beatles fanatic and i love the designs on the earpieces item as describedperfect sunglasses at a great price you wont be disappointedguess gu gunmetal metal rectangular
