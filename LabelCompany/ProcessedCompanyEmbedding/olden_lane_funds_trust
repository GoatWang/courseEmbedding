clients to provide solutions that might benefit individual and institutional clients alike growth is being driven by investor demand for strategies and asset classes that can diversify portfolios through income streams less correlated to equity and fixed income investments in working with clients olden lane generally classifies alternative investment return streams into two categories access products delivering exposure to a specific asset class or risk factor — for example many of today’s investors are interested in accessing the return streams of asset classes traditionally beyond the reach of all but the most sophisticated investors outcome products targeting a specific return unattainable though a traditional equity or fixed income investment — for example an investor may desire an enhanced level of equity market upside or some protection against downside loss next our target outcome funds   olden lane’s target outcome funds bring a new combination of capability and convenience to portfolio and risk management this new family of innovative funds provides investors a broad set of alternatives to build more robust and resilient portfolios each target outcome fund allows investors to participate in the return of a benchmark market index or other reference asset over a certain period of time and within specific risk constraints these funds generally offer some measure of principal protection in exchange for a limit on participation in price appreciation some funds may also include features that leverage a particular return profile in all cases target outcome funds are designed to provide an investor with the means to target an investment outcome aligned with hisher objectives and risk tolerance target outcome funds are designed to reduce the risk and uncertainty inherent in the capital markets the range of outcomes over a certain interval of time is defined when the fund is brought to market the outcome orientation of these funds brings a new dimension to the rapidly growing market for index investing  in a target outcome fund the uncertainty of an unconstrained allocation is replaced by a confidence in a controlled allocation target outcome funds encourage investors to consider how both positive and negative markets might affect their portfolios allowing for better planning and portfolio management products  offerings next new
