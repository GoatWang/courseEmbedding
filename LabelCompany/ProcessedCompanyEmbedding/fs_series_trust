safety applications7 july safety engineers need to know that they can rely on their instrumentation to maintain safe process operations while warning them or preventing possible hazardous conditions it’s not enough for products to say they work – engineers need proof of their reliability and applicability in safety settingsmoore industries created the fs functional safety series to give peace of mind to safety engineers when implementing instrumentation in safety applications these products have been designed and built to strict iec  standards ensuring safe and reliable function – particularly in environments where hazardous or emergency situations are likely to occur this can assist engineers looking to add a single safety loop isolating a few points or augmenting a larger safety instrumented system sis designing instruments in accordance with the iec  standard from the ground up forces the components any related firmware and circuit design to undergo additional scrutiny that ensures the highest level of reliability leading thirdparty safety auditing firm exida audits moore industries products and processes to ensure they are in compliance with the iec  standard with this certification end users can rely on fs functional safety series instruments to perform as expected and when demanded current products in the fs functional safety series ssx and sst functional safety isolators and splitters the ssx and sst protect safety systems by isolating an sis from basic process control or monitoring systems so that disconnections or other failures don’t impact the safety system unlike standard isolators they also allow the passing of valuable hart data between critical field transmitters and hart enabled host monitoring systems  the products are certified by exida for use in an sis up to sil  in monitor mode where only the input circuit is part of the safety function for single use mode the ssxsst is approved for use in an sis up to sil  sta safety trip alarm sil  capable and certified by exida the sta is a singleloop logic solver that acts on hazardous process conditions provides emergency shutdown and provides onoff control in safety instrumented systems  a few or multiple stas are often used as a cost effective logic solver strategy where larger and more complex safety plcs or control systems are cost prohibitive or too complex srm safety relay module the versatile relay repeater module has been certified by exida to sil  it accepts single contact closure inputs from safety logic solvers or other alarm units including the sta unlike many other interposing relays the srm is a force guided relay avoiding the possibility of not knowing when contacts have become stuck or welded in position due to unexpected higher than normal switching loads learn more about the fs functional safety series at wwwmiinetcomsafetyseries you can download datasheets and copies of our latest white papers logic solvers for overfill
