the dream wedding the dream kitchen the dream vacation all too often pursuing these dreams is a total nightmare why because the typical options available for getting the money you need to make these dreams a reality aren’t that great if you own a home you can pursue a home equity line of credit heloc but that process often takes weeks and comes with a ton of paperwork – and there’s no guarantee you’ll actually get the loan alternatively you can take money out of your investment account but you may have to pay taxes on the withdrawal not to mention shrinking your nest egg but at wealthfront we think differently we want you to have your cake and eat it too that’s why today we are excited to launch a new service that is our first foray into personal banking introducing portfolio line of credit we live in a world of “instant delivery” from taxis to groceries to handymen so why not add lines of credit to the mix at wealthfront we want our clients to be able to borrow what they need when they need it directly from their smartphones portfolio line of credit establishes a line of credit of up to  of your account value for wealthfront clients with at least  invested in an individual or joint investment account the best part we do this instantly and without the hassle of paperwork — you’re already approved when you open your account it takes  seconds to sign up and in many cases you get your money in  hours but there’s more good stuff we offer this line of credit at interest rates well below traditional alternatives like helocs how because your line of credit is secured by your own investments in fact you get an even better interest rate the more you have invested in your wealthfront account oh and you repay on your own timeline interest accrues and is added to your monthly balance but you pay back the loan when it works for you how’s that for flexibility our goal at wealthfront is to keep innovating so that you can live your best life with portfolio line of credit you’ll get immediate access to credit that’s less expensive and more convenient all the while continuing to grow your investment account how’s that for a winwin so dream big we’ve got your back

list x offerings overview invest savings plan for retirement save for college borrow with ease sell company stock philosophy expertise origin menu career advice the  wealthfront careerlaunching companies list by andy rachleff   today we are pleased to present our fifth annual list of us midsized information technology companies with momentum we publish this list because it is our responsibility as a financial advisor to provide the advice that maximizes your net worth as proud as we are of our investment service we think we can add even more value by helping you start your career on the right foot that’s because choosing the right job can add far more to your ultimate net worth than making good planning or investment decisions we believe the companies we list each year are the ideal places for young people to start their careers because they are all highly likely to turn into large businesses and nothing early in your career is more important than achieving success — and nothing signals success more than working for a successful company for a complete explanation of this logic it’s important that you read the post that accompanied our original list  hot tech companies to build a career to qualify for our list a company must be privately held have a current revenue run rate between  million and  million and be on a trajectory to grow at a rate in excess of  over at least the next three or four years this year we’re adding a further qualification the companies must have compelling unit economics selling a product at very low margins can lead to rapid revenue growth but it doesn’t necessarily imply a great longterm business we built our list by surveying the partners of the following  venture capital firms accel partners andreessen horowitz benchmark dag ventures greylock partners index ventures lightspeed kleiner perkins caufield  byers matrix partners redpoint ventures ribbit capital sequoia capital the social capital and spark capital changes since last year this year’s list includes  companies down  from last year’s  we added  new companies which is about our five year average and about half the number as last year we dropped  which includes  companies that have filed to go or went public  that were acquired  that grew beyond the  million revenue cap and  that experienced growth that was too slow to continue to qualify the largest number of drops in any one year i am struck by a few things this year first only  of the  new additions were consumer companies a higher percentage than ever  of the new additions are from the bay area half of the new bay area companies are based south of san francisco the traditional silicon valley which is probably a function of the high percentage of enterprise companies this counters the trend of san francisco gaining share los angeles had a strong showing with  new additions which is a much higher percentage  than we would traditionally expect the number of ipos declined to an all time low of  this year although i understand a number of our listed companies are in the process of filing their registration statements with the sec there were also very few company sales we had a very large number of drops due to slowing revenue growth relative to previous years but the vast majority of the dropped companies are still growing at a rapid rate even though they don’t qualify for the lofty hurdle of  expected compounded growth for the next few years other fun facts as usual the majority of the companies are based in the san francisco bay area  the majority of the bay area companies  are still located in san francisco rather than silicon valley although this is the second year in a row in which san francisco has lost share and is down from a peak of  in  all geographies other than the bay area lost share this past year while other geographies may be experiencing an increased level of startup activity it still appears that the more successful companies are likely to be based near silicon valley this means you should seriously consider moving to the bay area to launch your career and consider moving home to start your own company once you’ve gained the halo and experience enterprise gained share to  of the companies up significantly from  in the previous year this year only  of the bay area consumerfocused companies are not headquartered in san francisco and that’s down from only  the previous year people who want to work for a consumer facing company on the peninsula may need to look for slightly earlier stage companies there are still only three hardware companies left on the list and  are based in the bay area one moved from north carolina to get access to better talent this is amazing when you consider that semiconductor and hardware companies created silicon valley your career matters to your financial future we hope you find the  list helpful please remember it is very important to evaluate these companies in the context of the advice provided in our silicon valley career guide while it is always possible that we may have missed a few companies we believe this list is an excellent start for professionals looking for differentiated success in their careers we hope that you will also consider opening a wealthfront account if you find our advice valuable disclosure nothing in this article should be construed as tax

wealthfront including heads of product marketing and compliance  riabiz news vision  voice for the advisory communityelliot shmukler is credited with much of the product development that vaulted the robo from  million to  billionjuly   —  pm utc by brooke southall  commentsbrooke’s note the straighta atmosphere and whiteboard ether that seems to permeate most of the roboadvisors makes it easy to forget that these are basically small businesses with a bunch of folks toiling away on laptops people and the companies they work for stock options aside have different destines that show up over time wealthfront has been around since  and so there has been time for life to intervene in some cases in fact it’s really been around since  when it relaunched with its current business model see investing site kaching gets classier as wealthfronth if there is an inconvenient quality to these departures for wealthfront it may be more in regard to appearances the company is on the watch list of analysts wondering whether the aum ground it has lost to betterment is a sign of lost momentum in the larger sense of startup success — and the idea that you can go direct to investors with financial advice using automation and the internetwealthfront inc is experiencing its first big talent exodus — a flurry of departures that includes some csuite titles and a unicorn shepherdthe latter mythic creature is product chief elliot shmukler who left the redwood city califbased automated advisor in june to join instacart — one of silicon valley’s hot startups other recent palo alto califbased wealthfront executive departures include brian dennen chief operating officer maya grinberg marketing director and brad mauney director of product management there are an additional three designers and four engineers who have departed recently see andy rachleff is out as ceo of wealthfront as former linkedin star takes his place observers give shmukler credit for spearheading the series of paid roboservices that vaulted wealthfront’s growth from  million to  billion he also oversaw the introduction of direct indexing singlestock diversification service and its first mobile app wealthfront currently manages  billion of assets and has  employees according to its adv andy johns is stepping into the big shoes of elliot shmukler shmukler has a similarly stellar list of accolades connected to his time at linkedin where he gets much of the credit for monetizing the onlineresume social media site over his career shmukler’s become renowned for his copious and successful application ab testing comparing two versions of a web page to see which one performs better for his products and team the who behind who’s viewed my profile’at linkedin shmukler led a team responsible for generating nearly half of linkedin’s page views with features such as profile search contacts new user registration people you may know who’s viewed my profile and more as linkedin’s overseer of membership growth he grew the site from  million members to million members during his tenure according to his linkedin pagestill a top linkedin exec reached for comment says shmukler though successful was not without peccadilloes “he was well respected but he struck me as someone hard to work with and i would have disagreed with some of the product decisions he made with regards to the registration flow” the person says “but being difficult is what most great leaders have in common and linkedin enjoyed enormous growth during his time — and i think he was with linkedin at the right time so some level of luck for sure as well”the wealthfront departures come at a time when the company has lost bragging rights as the biggest fastestgrowing bestfinanced roboadvisor that honor now goes to betterment which hit  billion of managed assets recently and hints at  billion soon enough see betterment makes cfo hire with  billion aum line of sight’ and ipo mindfulnessnew yorkbased betterment holdings inc also has  employees to wealthfront’s  and betterment’s recent vc round puts it at  million raised wealthfront has raised  milliongetting while getting’s goodwill trout senior analyst with celent llc says it’s important to note that a startup can only ride so far with dependence on its product talent — if it is falling behind to betterment in the race for aum“the problem for wealthfront is that product innovation is not a gamechanger in itself” he writes in an email “investors lose track get bored etc of hearing about the latest whizbang feature aum growth — and the big news stories that it fuels — is both more powerful and selfreinforcing and i’d say wealthfront has lost a bit of its luster visàvis betterment and other nextgen players yes the artificial intelligence angle around wealthfront  is cool but it’s still pretty vague and undefined in my view it’s unlikely to fuel the kind of growth that will be needed for wealthfront to remain independent long term so shmukler is getting out while on top…with all that implies”still wealthfront has long been considered silicon valley’s most significant bestfunded financial advice startup but it is no longer the best funded with redwood city califbased personal capital corp having surpassed it with  million see personal capital gets  million investment and an exschwab retail chief in jeff carney embarrassment of riches’wealthfront still has plenty of cards to play — starting with its stack of talentandy johns who reported to shmukler will now step up to fulfill his role at wealthfront andy rachleff cofounder and chairman of wealthfront adds that johns is a gifted talent he says the departures come at a time when wealthfront has an “embarrassment of riches” when it comes to people that understand the development of webdelivered products for example it was ali rosenthal wealthfront’s director of strategic partnerships who helped get the wealthfront  plan out the door it is now the designated plan for the state of nevada rosenthal joined wealthfront from facebook about two years ago as vice president of strategic partnerships she helped launch facebook’s “share” button helped make facebook available on mobile platforms during her time facebook mobile its active user base grew from fewer than  users to over  million see wealthfront takes on another facebook vet — a clue that going dark in palo alto doesn’t mean going away johns is also a facebook alumni maya grinberg never quite caught the same fire at wealthfront as she did at google fouryear vestingwealthfront currently employs about  people and its recent departures represent less than a  turnover rate — a rate not considered high in the fluid silicon valley labor market that rate is also affected by the customary vesting programs which go in four years cycles — short by fortune  standards wealthfront has fouryear vesting according to a source turnover is also fueled by aggressive headhunting mauney left to be a product manager for new yorkbased compass grinberg joined up with segment in san francisco grinberg was formerly the chief evangelist at social advertising startup wildfire after wildfire’s acquisition by google in  grinberg joined the google product marketing organization as wildfire caught fire and which now serves over  businesses worldwide powering over  campaigns thirty of the top  brands worldwide use wildfireof the four engineers who recently left two went to google one to uber and another to apple sources say wall street mindstrout agrees that new blood could be good for a firm playing some catchup in assets but thinks rachleff’s laser focus on bluechip silicon valley talent may be overdone “i think wealthfront would be best off pivoting from its silicon valleysoftware roots and pick up some sharp minds with connections to nyc or wall street” he writes “this could be a product guy but doesn’t need to be … good ideas can come from a range of people and sources”rachleff has historically been loath to hire outside a circle of people he knows share his vision for marketing and serving millennials aged  to  with the idea that they are remarkably different not only from baby boomers  to  — but even different from members of gen x ages  the key is that millennials don’t want to talk on the phone and will even pay to avoid the inconvenience of
