annexe in brisbane the states politics are traditionally regarded as being conservative relative to other states there are several factors that differentiate queenslands government from other australian states the legislature has no upper house for a large portion of its history the state was under a gerrymander that heavily favoured rural electorates this combined with the already decentralised nature of queensland meant that politics has been dominated by regional interests queensland along with new south wales formerly operated a balloting system known as optional preferential voting for state elections this is different from the predominant australian electoral system the instantrunoff voting system and in practice is closer to a first past the post ballot similar to the ballot used in the uk which some say is to the detriment of minor parties the next queensland election will use instantrunoff voting these conditions have had notable practical ramifications for politics in queensland the lack of an upper house for substantial legislative review has meant that queensland has had a tradition of domination by strongwilled populist premiers

apart from a handful of tiny outpost settlements mining centres and aboriginal townships there are no townsbecause of its pattern of population dispersal queensland is the only australian state with a clearly defined set of major provincial cities this is reinforced by brisbane’s peripheral location in the southeastern corner of the state the cities of bundaberg rockhampton mackay townsville and

century some onefifth of the population was living alonecooktown queensland australiafrancesdemographic trendssince  queensland’s rate of population growth has markedly exceeded the australian average accelerated growth has been caused primarily by interstate migration stimulated by a buoyant economy that has benefited from booms in mining transport tourism and construction and further assisted by a strong element of discretionary migration attracted by the sunbelt image while retirement migration is significant in practice migrants are slightly younger than the australian average intrastate interstate and overseas migration are all strongly focused on the major cities and the coastal resortsthe provincial cities continue to acquire new service functions and generally maintain rates of population growth above the national average the most rapid growth has occurred in the main coastal resorts scattered as far north as cairns and port douglas but there is a high concentration of developing resort areas in the southeast that offer not only accessibility to brisbane and other cities but also fine beaches and surfing on the exposed coastline south of the great barrier reef extending some  miles  km along the shoreline the city of gold coast grew in just a few decades from a scattering of small resort villages into a stcentury city dominated by a beachside wall of highrise buildings and flanked by an elaborate maze of waterfront canal estates north of brisbane on the sunshine coast the resort towns of caloundra mooloolaba maroochydore and noosa have been

this image was maintained during the booms of the s and ’s based largely on the expansion of coal mining and tourism at the same time population growth and urbanization beginning at the end of the th century acted as stimuli to a rapid expansion in investment and employment in a wide array of service activitiesagriculturemost of the state’s land is used for extensive cropping and grazing systems requiring large areas and little labour and relying on economies of scale to remain competitive in world markets more than onethird of all holdings specialize in extensive livestock grazing mainly for beef cattle but with some finewool sheep those grazing holdings encompass the vast majority of the state’s rural lands a smaller yet significant segment of holdings engage in intensive livestock activities mainly dairying and raising pigs and are concentrated in the southeast which is climatically more favourable and close to main markets the australian tropical dairy institute provides research toward extending dairying beyond the temperate zonesthe most successful cropping systems are largescale and highly mechanized a substantial portion of the holdings is used mainly for grain production often with a livestock sideline an increasingly significant segment specializes in sugarcane production in intensive monocultural agricultural regions close to crushing mills the main agricultural exports are beef sugar wheat and wool queensland also produces a large portion of the country’s cotton and is a major supplier of tropical fruits and winter vegetables to the southern states and asia agriculture continues to be a leading contributor to the state economy accounting for more than onethird of the value of queensland’s overseas exports and roughly onefifth of queensland’s rural exports commercial fisheries produce for both the australian and asian marketsbecause of the irregularity seasonality and low volume of surface water particularly in inland areas where water is most needed irrigation in queensland is confined to a series of small schemes and prospects for expansion are limited extensive irrigation is used in cotton farming however the highly

coastal areas however the prime timber stands were rapidly cleared during the initial wave of pioneer settlement the limited stands that remain are confined to poorer soils and steeper slopes much of this remaining forestland has been set aside in national parks although much of queensland’s timber now comes from plantations of introduced pine trees and from imports forestrybased activities still constitute an important component of the state economyresources and powerthe state has a diversity of major mineral resources as elsewhere in australia gold mining dominated in the late th and early th centuries major discoveries at gympie mount morgan ravenswood charters towers and croydon stimulated population growth and investment in infrastructure providing foundations for subsequent regional development earlier gold booms however were overshadowed by the spectacular mineral boom of the late th century with coal mining leading the way there are also copperleadzinc and bauxite mines of world significance and a considerable variety of other mineralswhile mining employs a tiny fraction of the workforce and contributes only a small proportion of the state’s gross domestic product its significance to the economy is enhanced by its substantial links to transport processing and other related industries by its high share of total exports and by its contribution to decentralization by value more than half of mining output is provided by coal almost entirely produced from mammoth lowcost opencut operations in the bowen basin of central queensland the basin yields highgrade steaming and coking coals which are transported by electric railways to specialized ports australia is the world’s largest coal exporter with more than half being supplied by queensland the value of coal production dwarfs that of other hydrocarbons the state’s petroleum and natural gas reserves piped from the southern interior to the coast cannot fully satisfy its needs other worldscale mining operations are the copperleadzincsilver mine at mount isa and the bauxite quarries at weipa located respectively in the remote northwest and north mineral sands magnesite cadmium cobalt tantalite and tin are also exported as are precious and semiprecious gemstones sapphires opals and chrysoprase the wik court case  on aboriginal land rights which was heard in the federal high court essentially

greenhatch a new major freezedrying manufacturing facility has opened on queensland’s sunshine coast owned and operated by freeze dry industries the site will use the latest technology to freeze dry australia fruit vegetables and other raw materials chief executive officer of freeze dry industries michael buckley said the new facility is a significant step for the company “the official opening today of our new facility is a huge step for us something that i’ve been looking forward to over the past  months” he said the site will create freezedried products for its recently opened retail arm sunlife and freeze dry industries hopes to begin exporting to japan the company has also been exploring how to freeze dry food scraps like plum skins and pineapple cores to stop them from going to waste “it gives us the chance to turn something that would traditionally be thrown out into a potential superfood” buckley said call for food companies to set up on the sunshine coast there are a number of food manufacturing facilities now located on queensland’s sunshine coast including coyo coconut yoghurt gourmet garden the happy snack company and the country chef sunshine coast mayor mark jamison said he encourages more food players to set up in the region “the food and agribusiness industry is one of the seven highvalue industries identified in our regional economic development strategy and currently contributes more than  million to our local economy with significant growth seen in the region’s food processing sector” he said buckley said when choosing a location for freeze dry industries he wanted to choose somewhere appealing to live and a location with talent plus connection to a major city via road and rail “the sunshine coast provided all of this and much much more” buckley said “we’ve been able to take advantage of the support of sunshine coast council and in particular the local food and agribusiness network fan which has connected us with a range of highly

need to know to judge for yourself aapdan peled email twitter facebook linkedin whatsapp messenger how much debt is queensland really in how much of that debt can past labor governments bear responsibility for and has the current liberal national government cut or added to it and how does queensland’s debt compare both within australia and up against other countries this is an article for anyone wanting to know the answers to those questions and more – including the many readers who requested an explanation on the state’s debt after my recent article on queensland’s economy for those interested in the technicalities of where i got my data from and why i chose to look at the ratio of debt to gross state product that’s all explained in notes at the end of this article but for everyone else let’s move straight to what the data shows how does queensland’s debt compare table  below reports the ratio of debt to gross state product gsp in percentage terms for australian states and territories over the last  years as a reference the bottom of the table also reports the ratio of debt to gross domestic product gdp in selected countries of the world that data refers to general government debt only and it’s sourced from the international monetary fund’s world economic outlook author provided what’s clear from that table is that the debttogsp ratio in queensland has increased considerably since  and that most of this increase occurred under anna bligh’s labor governments and in comparison to other states queensland now has the highest debttogsp ratio however this ratio remains relatively low in comparison to other g countries including the australian commonwealth the ratio is also significantly lower than  which some previous studies have identified as the level above which longterm growth is reduced you can read more in these  and  papers from reinhart and rogoff but not everyone agrees on that  threshold other studies have failed to identify any threshold and conclude that there is no relationship between debt and growth another important point is that the  threshold is estimated from crosscountry data on national or federal debt the threshold at state level might be lower than  – but no conclusive estimates are yet available in the literature in other words working out how much debt queensland has is the simple part deciding whether that debt is too high about right or quite low remains a much more subjective matter is all debt bad so perhaps a simple comparison of debt ratios is not the best way to assess the extent of the problem in fact debt is not always bad and the objective of fiscal policy cannot simply be the minimisation of debt levels that’s not a sentiment you’re likely to hear either queensland premier campbell newman or labor leader annastacia palaszczuk express between now and saturday’s polling day yet that is something we should all be able to agree on if a government borrows to finance investment andor to help the economy overcome a bad cyclical contraction then a certain level of debt is not just acceptable it’s arguably desirable in the end debt is a tool that governments should use to achieve fundamental goals like growth and welfare the fact that in queensland debt is higher than say new south wales is not in itself enough to conclude that queensland has a debt problem the more relevant question for us to consider is then whether the debt level is sustainable or not and that means looking at whether or not the debttogsp ratio is likely to climb too rapidly in future you can’t evaluate debt without growth in this regard three factors determine the evolution of the debttogsp ratio the interest paid on the existing stock of debt the rate of gsp growth and the primary balance which is the budget balance after the government has made its interest payment if the primary balance is zero that is revenues are equal to expenditures after accounting for the interest payment then debt is sustainable as long as the rate of growth is not smaller than the interest rate on debt when growth is higher than the interest rate then the government can even run a limited primary deficit and debt would still be sustainable a numerical example with numbers that approximate the current situation of queensland might help understand the importance of economic growth for the purpose of sustainability given an initial debtto gsp ratio of  and a nominal interest rate of  a nominal growth rate of  is enough to maintain the debttogsp ratio constant even with a primary deficit of  with inflation at say  a nominal growth of  is equal to a real growth rate of  which incidentally is very close to the average annual real growth rate in queensland over the period june  to june  so more than an issue of reducing the absolute level of borrowing sustainability is a matter of economic growth an economy that grows is an economy that can sustain its debt where could queensland debt end up let’s consider a few different scenarios to show how much different government approaches would cut queensland’s debt suppose that economic and fiscal conditions – that is the growth rate interest rate and primary balance – in queensland over the next  years were the same as it has been under the current lnp government where would debt be by  the answer is  of gsp if we repeat the exercise using the economic and fiscal conditions that occurred under the first of the two bligh governments then the answer would be  with the conditions of the second bligh’s government the debttogsp ratio would be higher at  a government that was able to eliminate the primary deficit but delivered the same rate of growth as the newman government would still produce a debttogsp ratio of  by  the chart below shows the projected debt trajectories under all those different scenarios starting from the current level of debt author provided author provided bligh i – meaning the first term of the bligh labor government – was characterised by a higher primary deficit and interest rate than newman but the growth rate was also significantly higher it is indeed this higher growth rate that in the simulation moderates the increase in the debttogsp ratio in fact the chart shows that in terms of stabilising the debttogsp ratio it is better to have a limited primary deficit and grow fast than to have zero primary deficit and grow slowly this does not mean that the queensland government or any other government should permanently run a deficit quite the contrary the best way to avoid a debt problem is to alternate deficits in time of recession with surpluses in time of expansion however it does mean that in the pursuit of debt stabilisation a government should not make choices that cause sharp fiscal restrictions when the economic outlook is fragile or that compromise the state’s longterm growth potential technical notes to measure debt levels i primarily used data from the australian bureau of statistics abs  the latest release of this data was in  and the figures are reported up until fiscal year  for queensland and a few other states the data for  and  are not reported for these years i referred to the midfiscal year review various years i also used those midfiscal year reviews to extend the data to  the aggregate i considered was the “borrowing” of the nonfinancial public sector which includes the general government and nonfinancial public corporations then i scaled debt data to gross state product gsp in some analyses debt is scaled to a variable like tax revenues but this is not entirely appropriate as borrowing is a stock measure while tax revenues is a flow measure moreover gross state product is the scaling factor commonly adopted in the academic and

other states there are several factors that differentiate queenslands government from other australian states the legislature has no upper house for a large portion of its history the state was under a gerrymander that heavily favoured rural electorates this combined with the already decentralised nature of queensland meant that politics has been dominated by regional interests queensland along with new south wales formerly operated a balloting system known as optional preferential voting for state elections this is different from the predominant australian electoral system the instantrunoff voting system and in practice is closer to a first past the post ballot similar to the ballot used in the uk which some say is to the detriment of minor parties the next queensland election will use instantrunoff voting these conditions have had notable practical ramifications for politics in queensland the lack of an upper house for substantial legislative review has meant that queensland has had a tradition of domination by strongwilled populist premiers often with arguably authoritarian tendencies holding office for long periods the judicial system of queensland consists of the supreme court and the district court established by the constitution of queensland and various other courts and tribunals established by ordinary acts of the queensland parliament in  queensland adopted a new

annexe in brisbane the states politics are traditionally regarded as being conservative relative to other states there are several factors that differentiate queenslands government from other australian states the legislature has no upper house for a large portion of its history the state was under a gerrymander that heavily favoured rural electorates this combined with the already decentralised nature of queensland meant that politics has been dominated by regional interests queensland along with new south wales formerly operated a balloting system known as optional preferential voting for state elections this is different from the predominant australian electoral system the instantrunoff voting system and in practice is closer to a first past the post ballot similar to the ballot used in the uk which some say is to the detriment of minor parties the next queensland election will use instantrunoff voting these conditions have had notable practical ramifications for politics in queensland the lack of an upper house for substantial legislative review has meant that queensland has had a tradition of domination by strongwilled populist premiers

other states there are several factors that differentiate queenslands government from other australian states the legislature has no upper house for a large portion of its history the state was under a gerrymander that heavily favoured rural electorates this combined with the already decentralised nature of queensland meant that politics has been dominated by regional interests queensland along with new south wales formerly operated a balloting system known as optional preferential voting for state elections this is different from the predominant australian electoral system the instantrunoff voting system and in practice is closer to a first past the post ballot similar to the ballot used in the uk which some say is to the detriment of minor parties the next queensland election will use instantrunoff voting these conditions have had notable practical ramifications for politics in queensland the lack of an upper house for substantial legislative review has meant that queensland has had a tradition of domination by strongwilled populist premiers often with arguably authoritarian tendencies holding office for long periods the judicial system of queensland consists of the supreme court and the district court established by the constitution of queensland and various other courts and tribunals established by ordinary acts of the queensland parliament in  queensland adopted a new
