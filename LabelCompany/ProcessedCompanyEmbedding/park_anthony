village called hipperholme in yorkshire he loved art and would spend hours drawing with his beloved father he says of his father “he was an unusual man – outwardly strong and confident but also shy and sensitive – a bit like the gorillas i love to illustrate now as well as drawing he encouraged me to play a lot of sports such as rugby and soccer and cricket i was small for my age and i used to go to a fairly tough school – if i hadn’t been good at sports i would probably have been bullied” after he left school anthony studied graphic design and then went on to paint the insides of people’s bodies for medical textbooks he found this fascinating but after three years found that the work was becoming repetitive “if you’ve seen one stomach operation you’ve seen ‘em all” and instead began designing greetings cards this in turn led him to illustrating children’s books – his book gorilla began life as a picture on a birthday card anthony lives in kent and has two grownup children gorillas feature in many of anthony’s books he says “i am fascinated by them and the contrast they represent – their huge strength and gentleness they’re thought of as being very fierce creatures and they’re not” anthony’s illustrations also reveal his love of the surrealist painters whose pictures often depict strange dreamlike scenes look out for all the disguised bananas hidden in anthony’s books when anthony first has an idea for a picture book he says “it’s a strange combination of story and images deciding what will be illustrated on the pages of a book is like deciding on the scenes of a film” anthony has won many prizes for his work including the kate greenaway medal twice and the kurt maschler award three times in  he received the highest international honour for illustration the hans christian andersen award for his services to children’s literature – the first british illustrator to win the prize since  anthony was also children’s laureate from  reviews this product has
