irbt simple investment ideas longshort equity value growth growth at reasonable pricesummarydespite irobots current heavy reliance on its consumer robotic vacuum segment the company is significantly increasing its overall robotic ai capabilities through rdthe exponential trend of robotic ai progression is allowing irobot to diversify out of the consumer robotics segment in an impactful wayirobot intends to showcase many new robotic technologies moving forward with  marked as a banner year for these technologiesirobot nasdaqirbt is currently the largest pure robotics firm in the united states possessing a sizable lead over its competitors with that being said the vast majority of irobots business is concentrated in its home vacuum robot line which seems risky to say the least while the company has many other business segments including defensesecurity and telepresence these segments only account for about  of irobots total revenue this heavy reliance on its home robotics segment is not so worrying upon deeper inspection though as this is more a reflection of its vacuums popularity rather than a sign of weakness in other robotic markets in fact irobot is actively trying to diversify its businesses constantly increasing its investments into new products this is clearly evident in its increasing emphasis outside the consumer robotics segment putting more and more attention on nonvacuum related products such as its ava  the company has even announced that it has significant technological innovations ready for launch in  hinting at a drastic broadening of its robotics markets even without such diversification efforts irobots heavy concentration on its roomba product line should not hurt the company in the longrun this is because there is significant technological similarities between its different products which means that even rd spent specifically on developing its vacuum bots could also benefit the companys other robotic products just recently for instance irobot sent an application to the fcc asking for a permission to create a robotic lawnmower there is no doubt that the rd spent on developing irobots vacuum robots will have massive crossover benefits for the companys potential lawn mower robots especially given the huge similarities between vacuum robots and lawn mower robots rd crossover benefits robotic artificial intelligence ai is still in its infancy which means that ai specialization among different products is not so pronounced current ai innovation usually has broad reaching benefits for different types of robotic products as many of these products share basic functionalities for instance developing better motion sensor capabilities for robotic vacuums could also have benefits for a plethora of other products given that motion sensing in integral in almost all types of robots this is a primary reason why irobots heavy concentration on one area of its business is not so big of a concern according to irobot the company spends around th of its approximately m rd budget advancing core robotic technologies such as navigation and manipulation which benefit not only its vacuum bots but nearly all of its products even the rest of the companys rd which is spent on product development can have positive crossover effect between the companys current or potential future products for instance the product development rd being spent on irobots roomba bots could easily translate into benefits for its potential lawnmower product given the striking similarities between these two types of robots of course there will always be rd spent on product development that will only ever be useful for specific products but much of irobots rd has huge crossover benefits increasing product diversification given the current infant state of robotic ai it is understandable why irobot has so much of its revenue concentrated on its vacuum product line vacuum bots after all require comparatively less sophisticated ai to function which means that it serves as a great base for more sophisticated products given the exponential nature of ai irobot will almost certainly start to diversify its product base in fact ceo colin angle stated for  we expect revenue of  to  million eps of between  and  and adjusted ebitda of  to  million additionally  will be an important year for irobot as we begin to roll out and monetize investments we have been making in crucial robotic technology these crucial robotic technology investments were later revealed to be in robotic cloud integration technologies navigation technologies through visual simultaneous localization and mapping vslam and touch screen interface upoint for its defense robots clearly irobots future lies in a widerange of products rather than being almost solely concentrated on its roomba vacuum line again while vacuum bots have been a great starting point for irobot given its relatively simplicity and large market robotic ai advancements are now allowing irobot to look beyond the home consumer market this diversification should give irobot huge upside moving forward especially given the immense promise of robot technology irobots ava  is among the list of promising new technologies that the company is focusing its attention on source extremetech risks the rapid advancement of ai have been great for irobot in terms of widening its possibilities and subsequently its addressable market despite this robotic ais accelerating progress could also act as a double edged sword for irobot by attracting technology heavyweights such as google nasdaqgoog nasdaqgoogl or apple nasdaqaapl to the industry if such corporations decide to directly compete with irobot this could wipe out irobots industry lead in an instant while this scenario is a very likely outcome irobot should still have an extremely strong presence in the robotics industry even with an influx of highcaliber competition while irobot would definitely lose market share and likely even market positioning to such companies these companies entrance may not necessarily be a bad thing after all these companies would very likely raise consumer awareness on robotics due to their advertising prowess which would also be a boon for irobot finally in the case of heavyweight technology corporations looking to stake a foothold in the robotics market such corporations would very likely acquire irobot before competing with it an acquisition of irobot would only make sense given its current huge lead on the industry this of course would very likely be great news for irobot investors while the risk of increased competition from large technology companies have been a constant source of concern for irobot the company has a strong enough presence in the robotic industry to be relevant no matter what conclusion once again irobots current disproportionate focus on its vacuum line is not a reflection of the companys limited capabilities but rather a reflection of high demand for vacuum robots the company has highly sophisticated robotic ai capabilities in a huge number of arenas which is not fully reflected in its vacuumcentric business profile despite irobots heavy focus on its vacuum bots the companys rd generally have broadreaching benefits for all of its products given the companys significantly widening product lineup and exponentially increasing revenues irobot expects mm in  alone the company is an attractive investment at a market capitalization of m not only are irobots revenues expected to skyrocket but the company will also likely maintain extremely high gross margins in the  range such growth and impressive metrics are not surprising given the highly promising and specialized nature of the robotics industry disclosure

we could never keep up with the pet hair and dirt that they would track in now we have been using the roomba for a few months and we will never go back we have it set to run every day at am every day we empty the debris bin and say wow look at all the pet hair some days well even run it a second time it really does a fantastic job of course it is not perfect once in awhile you drag out the old vacuum and get the places that the robot misses there are not many of those places it gets under the bed too no more trying to stuff the big vacuum under there if your furniture is high enough it will go right under my couch is too low every couple weeks we pull it out and send the robot in not much under there because it is getting the pet hair every daybottom line yes i would recommend this to a

irobot® roomba® i agree with some of the procon points the roomba  doesnt have a large enough bin for homes with pets that shed the area i am cleaning is usually less than  square feet and with the charging time included it is taking approx  hours to complete a cleaning job i try to run the roomba every other day because i have a german shepherd in my home it would not be able to complete a job if i am not home to empty the bin because the debris bin doesnt easily slide out and is in an awkward place for removing to empty the job often cancels as the roomba loses contact with the charging prongs when it is being jarred around while removing the bin other than this i love the roomba as it does efficiently clean carpets and hard surfacesbottom line yes i would recommend this to a

like the idea of having the house floors cleaned while i am at work or otherwise away the irobot roomba  almost fills the bill it usually takes three charges to completely cover the desired floor space which is a combination of carpet  vinyl  and ceramic  with floor mats through in for good measure while it cannot compete with a real vacuum cleaner for thoroughness it makes up for that by being able to run unattended or it should the only issue i have is that it gets stuck quite often im positive i can eventually overcome most of the issues by placing the base in a more accessible spot and by prepping my house before running the roomba  i have used it  times and it has gotten stuck  times  times it closed a door behind itself trapping it in a room  times it could not find the base and one time it thought it was at a cliff which was actually just a carpet to vinyl floor transition i believe i can overcome all these with better placement of the base using things to prop the problematic doors open and proper cleaning of the sensors however i do wish that the software was smart enough to reroute itself if there is more than one way to enter or leave a room if it can build a map of the area covered it should be able to tell if there are multiple paths into and out of an areabottom line yes i would recommend this to a friendwas this review helpful yes  no  you may also
