find an advisor contact us client login checklist  questions every advisor should be able to answer whatever your priorities this can help you find someone who understands you and has the resources to help you manage your financial life at one time or another we all face major turning points in our lives—getting married becoming a parent receiving a lifechanging promotion getting ready to retire at times like these many people feel a need for financial help and start to wonder whether working with a financial advisor might make sense thats when the search begins the challenge is finding someone youll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family your money your hopes for your future someone wholl be there for you for years to come and who can provide more than just stock recommendations to find an advisor who can help you with those decisions dont be afraid to ask the following tough questions—theyll help you get a clear idea of what you can expect from the relationship and whether it makes sense for you  what types of clients do you work with some advisors have special experience working with business owners or members of a specific profession others might have particular knowledge in a specialty such as sustainable investing or retirement planning ask what team members or resources from around their company they can call upon to help you meet your specific needs the challenge is finding someone youll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family your money your hopes for your future  what is your track record no advisor can or should promise financial results based on past performance and beware those who do but an advisor with a record of long relationships with clients likely provides the kind of service that earns their loyalty  how often will we talk an advisor should be committed to conversations in person by phone or online—whatever your preference is—as often as you require every client has different needs and expectations be upfront with the advisor about how frequently and by what means you would like to get together to discuss your finances  how realistic are my goals even if you have a strong idea of what you want to accomplish with your money the right advisor can help you better understand and prioritize your goals including making any necessary tradeoffs based on your finances timelines and investing preferences more insights wondering what its like to work with an advisor tune in to a candid conversation on “the value of advice” watch the webcast  how will we keep my strategy on course even the best strategy will need adjusting as financial markets and your goals change an advisor should have a plan for regular reviews and the ability to correct as market conditions and your priorities shift  what happens if the markets are volatile will you call me when markets get scary theres nothing worse than feeling isolated and alone one of an advisors most vital functions is to reach out at such times hear your concerns offer perspective and talk about any needed adjustments to your strategy  what if im upset about a service issue or an investment as life becomes increasingly automated theres nothing like a human voice and quick response when youre concerned about a financial matter advisors who define their success by your success will be eager to quickly resolve any such issues  who will i actually be working with many advisors have teams of professionals to enhance the services they provide ask who youd be working with on a regular basis and their level of experience beyond the immediate team does the company supporting them have access to a broad array of financial insights and resources  how do i pay you for your work its never easy to ask but the right advisors will welcome this question clarity about fees is vital to a successful relationship payment—whether a percentage of assets or per transaction—should be structured around your needs and preferences what can an advisor do for you watch making the leap to see how one couple – with the help of their advisor – built a business while keeping their retirement goals in sight

llc aug   home  previous page investment advisers act of   section a amerivest investment management llc august   response of the chief counsels office division of investment management im ref no  your letter dated august   requests our assurance that we would not recommend enforcement action to the securities and exchange commission the commission or sec under section a of the investment advisers act of  the advisers act against amerivest investment management llc amerivest an investment adviser that is an affiliate of td ameritrade inc td ameritrade and is registered with the commission under the advisers act if amerivest offers to certain clients an advisory fee rebate the proposed fee arrangement in the manner described in your letter and summarized below background you state the following amerivest currently offers a discretionary advisory service known as amerivest portfolios which is made available to retail brokerage clients of td ameritrade the service under the service amerivest serves as the investment adviser to the clients and is responsible for implementing the asset allocation models and corresponding mutual fund and exchangetraded fund investment recommendations provided by morningstar associates llc morningstar associates morningstar associates serves as an investment adviser and independent consultant to amerivest with respect to the service but does not enter into an investment advisory agreement with amerivests clients amerivest vets and implements morningstar associates investment recommendations in their entirety subject to noninvestment related factors such as tax considerations and any reasonable restrictions a client may impose morningstar associates is compensated by amerivest based on a fee schedule that includes an assetbased fee component and a licensing fee component accordingly morningstar associates does not receive performancebased compensation under the proposed fee arrangement amerivest would continue to charge a quarterly assetbased advisory fee in advance however amerivest would rebate investment advisory fees for eligible clients who are invested in a model portfolio that experiences two consecutive discrete calendar quarters of negative performance before advisory fees during a twelvemonth period a term the amount of the rebate would be equal to  of the advisory fees paid by each eligible client for the two calendar quarters in which the performance composite for the model portfolio corresponding to the clients account experienced negative performance to determine whether performance was negative each calendar quarter would be measured independently the performance for multiple quarters would not be aggregated amerivest will fully and clearly disclose the rules governing eligibility for the proposed fee arrangement and the methodology for calculating the composite performance together the rebate terms to all clients participating in the service amerivest will follow the rebate terms and apply them fairly and consistently in the event that amerivest decides to change the rebate terms in a manner that would disadvantage participating clients amerivest will notify participating clients of the change and no such change will become effective prior to the commencement of the next subsequent term the proposed fee arrangement will not contain any catch up or other provision that would allow amerivest to recapture foregone fees through future appreciation amerivest will not deviate from or otherwise seek to influence morningstar associates investment recommendations for the purpose of avoiding payment of any fee rebate under the proposed fee arrangement amerivest may deviate from morningstar associates recommendations solely i for noninvestment and nonperformance related reasons such as tax considerations or reasonable client restrictions or ii to the extent so required to fulfill its fiduciary duty to clients amerivest will make and keep true accurate and current records detailing any such deviation and explaining why such deviation was necessary there will be no contract arrangement or other understanding explicit or tacit by and between amerivest and morningstar associates or any principals thereof such that morningstar associates compensation or continued engagement would be affected by the payment or nonpayment by amerivest of any fee rebate pursuant to the proposed fee arrangement the proposed fee arrangement would be implemented for i all new discretionary client accounts and ii all existing discretionary client accounts with a new deposit of  or higher provided that the new deposit represents net new assets to amerivest clients would not have to elect to participate in the proposed fee arrangement or request a fee rebate the fee rebate would automatically apply in the event of two consecutive calendar quarters of negative performance to be eligible for the proposed fee arrangement an account must participate in the service for a minimum of two consecutive calendar quarters during the term and during such participation the client must not withdraw more than the required deposit of  to remain eligible for subsequent quarters amerivest would reserve the right to extend the term for additional twelvemonth periods or to discontinue the proposed fee arrangement upon ninety  days advance written notice to clients subject to enforcing the requirements set forth in the preceding paragraph amerivest will not take any action for the purpose of negating or compromising a clients eligibility for the rebate including without limitation any action that would result in a client no longer participating in the service analysis section a of the advisers act generally prohibits registered investment advisers from entering into extending renewing or performing any investment advisory contract that provides for compensation to the investment adviser on the basis of a share of capital gains or capital appreciation in a clients account or any portion thereof section a is designed among other things to eliminate profit sharing contracts that are nothing more than heads i win tails you lose arrangements and that encourage advisers to take undue risks with the funds of clients to speculate or to overtrade you argue that section a does not on its face extend to fee waivers or rebates that are contingent on negative performance you acknowledge however that the sec staff in investment advisers act release no  may   release  stated that the concerns animating the performance fee ban are as apposite to advisory fees which are contingent upon an advisory account obtaining a certain level of performance as they are to fees which vary directly with capital gains or appreciation you note that the sec staff has nonetheless provided noaction assurances in situations where fees are contingent on performance but the conflicts of interest associated with performance fees are not present or are substantially mitigated in particular you state that in trainer the sec staff took the position that although a general satisfaction guarantee supported by the offer of a full refund was a contingent fee arrangement squarely within the scope of release  it was structured in a manner that would greatly reduce any incentive on the part of the advisers to take undue risks speculate or overtrade and could serve to encourage the advisers to develop a strong culture of client service and responsiveness while you acknowledge that the proposed fee arrangement represents a contingent fee arrangement of the kind prohibited by section a for the reasons discussed in release  you argue that several aspects of the proposed fee arrangement make it highly unlikely that amerivest would attempt to avoid the rebate by taking undue risks timing transactions in a clients account or overtrading in particular you argue that amerivest would not be in a position to directly affect the value of a clients account because morningstar associates an investment adviser that is independent from amerivest would be responsible for security selection and asset allocation recommendations with respect to the model portfolios moreover you believe that any incentive that amerivest might have to override morningstar associates asset allocation recommendations in order to invest in more speculative investments is mitigated by the inability to recapture waived or rebated fees you argue that the proposed fee arrangement is designed to further align amerivests interests with those of its clients because amerivest does not make money if an eligible client does not make money you contend that the proposed fee arrangement is the opposite of the heads i win tails you lose approach that section a was designed to prevent we believe that certain aspects of the proposed fee arrangement  particularly the role of morningstar associates in selecting securities and making asset allocation recommendations and the limited discretion amerivest would have to deviate from such recommendations  help to alleviate the concerns that form the basis of section a based on the facts and representations in your letter we would not recommend enforcement action to the commission under section a of the advisers act against amerivest if amerivest enters into the proposed fee arrangement as described in your letter and summarized above our position is based particularly on your representations that  amerivest will fully and clearly disclose the rebate terms to all clients participating in the service and will follow the rebate terms and apply them fairly and consistently  in the event that amerivest decides to change the rebate terms in a manner that may disadvantage participating clients amerivest will notify participating clients of the change and no such change will become effective prior to the commencement of the next subsequent term  the proposed fee arrangement will not contain any catch up or other provision that would allow amerivest to recapture foregone fees through future appreciation  amerivest will not deviate from or otherwise seek to influence morningstar associates investment recommendations for the purpose of avoiding payment of any fee rebate under the proposed fee arrangement  amerivest may deviate from morningstar associates recommendations solely i for noninvestment and nonperformance related reasons such as tax considerations or reasonable client restrictions or ii to the extent so required to fulfill its fiduciary duty to clients  amerivest will make and keep true accurate and current records detailing any such deviation and explaining why such deviation was necessary  the mere fact that amerivest has deviated from or declined to implement a recommendation of morningstar associates will not  in and of itself  result in a loss of eligibility for the rebate  there will be no contract arrangement or other understanding explicit or tacit by and between amerivest and morningstar associates or any principals thereof such that morningstar associates compensation or continued engagement would be affected by the payment or nonpayment by amerivest of any fee rebate pursuant to the proposed fee arrangement and  subject to enforcing certain eligibility requirements amerivest will not take any action for the purpose of negating or compromising a clients eligibility for the rebate including without limitation any action that would result in a client no longer participating in the service because our position is based on the facts and representations made in your letter you should note that any different facts or circumstances might require a different conclusion kyle r ahlgren senior counsel  you state that amerivests vetting process is designed to consider whether the asset allocations and securities recommendations provided by morningstar associates are reasonable in relation to the investment mandate and riskreturn characteristics of each model portfolio and the overall operation of the service you state further that amerivest may choose not to implement a recommendation provided by morningstar associates based on noninvestment related considerations that might adversely impact client accounts eg the tax ramifications of substituting one etf for another you represent that the mere fact that amerivest has deviated from or declined to implement a recommendation of morningstar associates will not  in and of itself  cause a client to be ineligible for the rebate

this can help you find someone who understands you and has the resources to help you manage your financial life at one time or another we all face major turning points in our lives—getting married becoming a parent receiving a lifechanging promotion getting ready to retire at times like these many people feel a need for financial help and start to wonder whether working with a financial advisor might make sense thats when the search begins the challenge is finding someone youll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family your money your hopes for your future someone wholl be there for you for years to come and who can provide more than just stock recommendations to find an advisor who can help you with those decisions dont be afraid to ask the following tough questions—theyll help you get a clear idea of what you can expect from the relationship and whether it makes sense for you  what types of clients do you work with some advisors have special experience working with business owners or members of a specific profession others might have particular knowledge in a specialty such as sustainable investing or retirement planning ask what team members or resources from around their company they can call upon to help you meet your specific needs the challenge is finding someone youll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family your money your hopes for your future  what is your track record no advisor can or should promise financial results based on past performance and beware those who do but an advisor with a record of long relationships with clients likely provides the kind of service that earns their loyalty  how often will we talk an advisor should be committed to conversations in person by phone or online—whatever your preference is—as often as you require every client has different needs and expectations be upfront with the advisor about how frequently and by what means you would like to get together to discuss your finances  how realistic are my goals even if you have a strong idea of what you want to accomplish with your money the right advisor can help you better understand and prioritize your goals including making any necessary tradeoffs based on your finances timelines and investing preferences more insights wondering what its like to work with an advisor tune in to a candid conversation on “the value of advice” watch the webcast  how will we keep my strategy on course even the best strategy will need adjusting as financial markets and your goals change an advisor should have a plan for regular reviews and the ability to correct as market conditions and your priorities shift  what happens if the markets are volatile will you call me when markets get scary theres nothing worse than feeling isolated and alone one of an advisors most vital functions is to reach out at such times hear your concerns offer perspective and talk about any needed adjustments to your strategy  what if im upset about a service issue or an investment as life becomes increasingly automated theres nothing like a human voice and quick response when youre concerned about a financial matter advisors who define their success by your success will be eager to quickly resolve any such issues  who will i actually be working with many advisors have teams of professionals to enhance the services they provide ask who youd be working with on a regular basis and their level of experience beyond the immediate team does the company supporting them have access to a broad array of financial insights and resources  how do i pay you for your work its never easy to ask but the right advisors will welcome this question clarity about fees is vital to a successful relationship payment—whether a percentage of assets or per transaction—should be structured around your needs and preferences what can an advisor do for you watch making the leap to see how one couple – with the
