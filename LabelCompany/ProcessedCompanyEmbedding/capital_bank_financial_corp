companys thoughtlessness and occasional ruthlessness emily rusch the executive director of the california public interest research group found the companys assertion of a right to spoof caller id particularly disturbing saying now more than ever consumers need to be able to trust companies capital one spokeswoman pam girardo responded that the company would not actually make personal visits to customers except as a last resort    if it becomes necessary to repossess a sports vehicle capital one also attributed its assertion of a right to spoof as necessary because sometimes the number is displayed differently by some local phone exchanges something that is beyond our control girardo told the new york times that the company was reviewing the language involved david lazarus noted that now that a little sunlight has been applied the company is not as comfortable as it previously was with behaving like a total maniac in the meantime cardholders can make up their own minds do they
