to rss feed follow us on google home » all posts » why a proofofconcept prototype why a proofofconcept prototype you have a great product idea  what should you do next if you are an inventor or an entrepreneur you have probably come up with some great product ideas when these ideas were conceived you probably envisioned the thousands of people who would buy the revolutionary product your second thought might have been to ask yourself “what do i do now to take this idea to the next step” endotracheal tube translation prototype by leardon solutions the team at leardon solutions has designed engineered prototyped and manufactured products in the medical devices and diagnostic health and lifestyle commercial consumer electronics and active sports industries  regardless of the product complexity one of the first things that leardon solutions does is to prove that the product idea is technically feasible it isn’t always necessary to hire an engineering or prototyping company to create your proofofconcept prototype depending on the complexity of the product idea a proofofconcept prototype can sometimes be constructed by a handy person assuming that they have a good understanding of the required function also complex engineering drawings and designs are not always needed since the proofofconcept prototype can sometimes be made using offtheshelf components from the local hardware store for products that are more technically challenging and require engineering skill you can work with companies such as leardon solutions to develop your proofofconcept prototype apt innovations floe prototype by leardon solutions if your product idea is conceptually and technically simple or complex leardon solutions finds it important to create a proofofconcept prototype for many reasons first as the name implies the proofofconcept prototype allows you to validate to yourself that the idea actually works and functions as envisioned this first prototype does not need to be pretty normally it does not bear any resemblance to your final product since the goal is to only prove it functions and not to prove that it looks nice the second use of the proofofconcept prototype is to act as an aid in obtaining intellectual property such as a patent it is extremely important that you have the ability to concisely explain your product idea to an intellectual property attorney the proofofconcept prototype can help you explain how your product functions while also providing a functioning model that the attorney can use to seek out additional patent claims that might not have been found without the proofofconcept prototype the final use of the proofofconcept prototype is as a showandtell device potential investors or patent licensees will typically ask you to show them how your product works if two investment seekers enter a room one with a business plan presentation and another with a proofofconcept prototype the investor’s eyes will gravitate toward the showandtell product demonstration the prototype adds validity not only to the product but also to you as a business person don’t underestimate the important of a proofofconcept prototype and don’t try to cut corners by skipping the proofofconcept stage and moving forward without having proven to yourself and others that your idea is technically feasible author nick  editor at large leardon solutions share
