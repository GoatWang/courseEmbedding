were no off balance sheet arrangements critical accounting policies in december  the sec requested that all registrants list their most critical accounting polices in the management discussion and analysis the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of a companys financial condition and results and requires managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain our accounting policies are discussed in detail in the footnotes to our financial statements included in our annual report on form k for the year ended august   we do not consider any of our accounting policies as critical going concern as of may   we had an accumulated deficit of  our ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon the successful completion of additional financing arrangements and our ability to achieve and maintain profitable operations while we are expanding our best efforts to achieve the above plans there is no assurance that any such activity will generate funds that will be available for operations these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern recently issued accounting pronouncements we do not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements

sleepsupportsupplementscom insomnia facts what are sleep disorders our top sleep supplement reviews » top  sleep supplements of which brands think youre stupid if you’re looking for a better sleep support supplement look no further posted on by paul grudnitsky  sleepsupportsupplementscom see how we make our pick according to the center of disease control and prevention cdc  of adults in america aren’t getting enough sleep and sleeping less than seven hours a night is associated with serious health consequences obesity diabetes high blood pressure heart disease stroke and frequent mental stress   needless to say sleep is vital to your overall health and mental health so any interruptions in your normal sleep schedule should be taken seriously   « skip to our top reviewed sleep remedy »   “what causes sleep disorders”   the most common sleep disorder is insomnia which is when you’re unable to fall asleep or remain asleep and it’s usually the main reason people look for sleep remedies unfortunately this sleep disorder is extremely common and about  of american adults experience it at some point in their lives   there are a variety of causes but some of the most common are   stress anxiety and depression these are two of the most common causes of chronic insomnia stress anger worry anxiousness and negative thoughts can have a dramatic effect on sleep quality   stimulants excessive use of caffeine such as energy drinks and coffee is one of the most common causes of intermittent and transient insomnia this is insomnia that occurs periodically or only for a few nights at a time   medications some medications can interfere with sleep such as antidepressants adhd medication corticosteroids thyroid hormone high blood pressure medication some contraceptives pain relievers that contain caffeine diuretics and diet pills   allergies and respiratory problems colds sinus infections and upper respiratory problems can make it hard to breathe at night which can cause sleeping difficulties   nocturia frequent urination and constantly getting up in the middle of the night to use the restroom causes sleep disturbances   chronic pain a variety of conditions that cause chronic pain can also disrupt sleep such as arthritis chronic fatigue syndrome fibromyalgia inflammatory bowel disease headaches lower back pain   “how are sleep disorders treated”   the most common problem people have is falling asleep and staying asleep for serious sleep disorders a doctor may advise a prescription drug to be taken nightly   selective gammaaminobutyric acid medications ambien lunesta sonata these prescription medications target the gaba receptors in the brain gaba is the neurotransmitter that reduces alertness and promotes relaxation   unfortunately this medication is known to cause side effects like hallucinations memory disturbances and  “blackouts” wherein people report sleepwalking sleepeating and even sleepdriving   benzodiazepines xanax valium restoril halcion ativan typically prescribed for anxiety these prescription drugs activate the gaba receptors in the brain and cause sedation and relaxation they are considered extremely addictive with very difficult withdrawal symptoms and can cause a similar “blackout” effect with users   antihistamines benadryl advil pm dramamine unisom zzzquil etc these overthecounter antihistamines are a common alternative for people who don’t want to take prescription drugs the most common side effects of antihistamines are dryness constipation upset stomach and feeling groggy the next day   ​warning ​recently these common antihistamine sleep aids have been associated with an increased risk of dementia and various forms of mci mild cognitive impairment these sleep aids all have several things in common•  they’re unnatural pharmaceutical drugs•  they’re expensive•  they all come with serious sideeffects so the real question is   “are there any natural sleep remedies that actually work”   with any condition there will inevitably be a line of natural remedies created to help alleviate symptoms and build a path towards remission and health judging by the number of customers these companies have year after year the volume of verified testimonials and the support some of their ingredients have from the medical community they must be doing something right   these natural remedies are often used in order to avoid the cost inconvenience and side effects of prescription drugs and invasive treatments among so many choices we have to ask   “how do you separate the good products from the junk”   we have a passion for natural health and many of us have suffered from insomnia and sleep issues ourselves that’s why we went out and compared some of the top natural neuropathy remedies to see which ones really worked and which ones we can throw in the garbage   here’s what we looked for in a product   with years of experience our research team dove into stacks of medical journals and consumer reports and studied exactly how certain vitamins and herbs can promote relaxation and deep restful sleep we narrowed the list to  essential ingredients that no effective sleep remedy would be without   ​melatonin▼  click to read  ▼this is a ‘nobrianer’ for any sleep formula melatonin is the hormone made by your pineal gland that controls your sleep and wake cycles light affects melatonin production and your body will naturally release more melatonin at night which is why indoor lighting tvs and your cellphone’s brightness can disrupt sleep melatonin causes drowsiness lowers body temperature and puts the body into sleep modemagnesium▼  click to read  ▼this is one of the most vital minerals when it comes to relaxation sleep and mental health a magnesium deficiency can cause anxiety sleep disorders irritability and abnormal heart rhythms the relaxing sleepboosting properties of magnesium are well known one study shows that magnesium improved subjective measures of insomnia sleep efficiency sleep time and sleep onset theanine▼  click to read  ▼this amino acid promotes a sense of calm and has many observable antianxiety properties and this happens quickly usually within minutes by reducing anxiety and stress theanine helps ‘quiet’ the mind before sleep studies note that theanine improved overall sleep quality  essential herbs▼  click to read  ▼valerian root valerian root helps increase the amount of the neurotransmitter gaba in the brain which brings about relaxation and calm drugs like xanax and valium increase gaba synthetically but valerian is all natural and safe in one study  reported perfect sleep and  reported improved sleep with valerian root passionflower passionflower is actually listed as a tranquilizing herb in germany and its calming sleep inducing effects have been known for a long time it has a similar effect on anxiousness too so in combination with valerian root it’s a perfect way to slip into deep restful sleep several studies show it’s an effective remedy against anxiety lemon balm lemon balm is well studied it encourages deeper and more restful sleep as shown in a german sleep study additionally it’s an excellent antioxidant for the liver a brain booster that helps improve memory and mood booster as well hops it’s not just for beer studies show that those who drank nonalcoholic beer with hops actually had improved sleep quality and reduced levels of anxiety hops have a lot in common with valerian root as far as its relaxing calmpromoting effects which makes the two a perfect combination chamomile chamomile is a sleep remedy as old as time it’s most commonly consumed in the form of tea and its health benefits are incredible it’s an antiinflammatory helps with digestive issues helps with skin irritation helps get rid of sore throat and of course is an excellent sleep remedy liquid delivery method▼  click to read  ▼we gave a heavy favoritism to liquid extracts and it wasn’t for no good reason studies show the body uses  of the liquid extract compared to only about  of a capsule or tablet meaning the remainder of those ingredients and the money spent on them are just flushed down the toilet furthermore capsules have to travel through the stomach and liver before their ingredients are even available to the body while  of the liquid extract is absorbed in the first  seconds   what we looked for in a brand   ​strength of moneyback guarantee a moneyback guarantee shows the manufacturer is so confident in the product that they’re willing to put their money where their mouth is there’s simply no reason to trust a product that doesn’t offer a moneybackguarantee  hour customer support a hour customersupport service shows a manufacturer’s commitment to their customers because hour support isn’t cheap with any remedy you’re likely to have questions and those questions can arise at any time of the day or night hour customer service offers a peaceofmind knowing the answers are only a phone call away   what we discovered   there are tons and tons of sleep formulas out there and unfortunately most seem to be merely copycats of other sleep formulas as if they’re all buying the same product from one pill manufacturer and slapping on a different label and price   however some formulas did attempt to separate themselves from their competition and for us there was a clear winner what you will learn estimated read time   what causes sleep disorders   how are sleep disorders treated   is there a sleep remedy that actually works our main sources  nocturest™  rating read

service    visit their website » our review we put nocturest in our number one spot as the best natural sleep remedy on the market it’s one of the newest sleep formulas we’ve seen and being late to the game is clearly an advantage   first the liquid formula set this formula apart from the competition in our test nocturest was much much faster acting than its competitors we noticed the sleepinducing effects of nocturest in mere minutes sometimes less than a minute which is ideal when you want to get to sleep quickly with pills and capsules it’s difficult to time we didn’t notice pill and capsule effects for up to thirty minutes or more   the liquid formula was also very convenient you don’t need to get up for a glass of water and swallow some clumsy pills all you need to do is pinch the dropper and drink the formula easy   next the formula has a wide variety of natural herbal extracts which combined to create an incredibly calm and relaxing drift into sleep most of the formulas only contained two or three of our recommended herbs but nocturest did their homework and included all of them it’s truly a testament to their dedication to not just produce a product that sells but one that works as effectively as they claim   here’s where most formulas fail they stick to herbs or nutrients vitamins and minerals but don’t combine the two again nocturest excels by combining essential nutrients like magnesium with high quality herbs and despite the rather earthy flavor it’s mixed quite well   lastly nocturest is made in the united states in an fda registered facility rather than china like most of the supplement industry with a  moneyback guarantee and hour customer service nocturest worked hard to earn our vote of confidence and our  spot    liquid delivery yes    recommended nutrients  of     recommended herbs  of     moneyback guarantee yes    hour customer support yes   nocturest does not contain htp this ingredient that’s commonly placed in sleep formulas doesn’t work well for everyone it boosts serotonin in the brain and some people actually find it makes them irritable angry causes teethgrinding and nightmares not to mention htp is downright dangerous to combine with antidepressants and can cause serotonin syndrome   ingredients magnesium theanine melatonin valerian passionflower lemon balm hops chamomile try this product »
