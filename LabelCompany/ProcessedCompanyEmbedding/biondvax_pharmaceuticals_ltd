biopharmaceutical company developing immunomodulation therapies for infectious diseases the companys lead product candidate m is a peptidebased vaccine that offers longlasting protection against multiple strains of both seasonal and pandemic influenza virus in contrast to the currently available influenza vaccines that must be administered yearly and only offer protection against a limited range of specifically targeted influenza strains influenza influenza is one of the most common infectious diseases and is caused by the influenza virus it is an airborne virus that is highly contagious and tends to occur in seasonal outbreaks during winter months there are a variety of symptoms associated with the disease with almost all infected developing a fever along with cough nasal congestion runny nose body aches fatigue and headache complications of influenza can be serious and include pneumonia sinus infections and exacerbation of underlying morbidities such as heart disease and asthma the disease can be fatal particularly in those with weaker immune systems such as the very young and the elderly there are three types of influenza viruses that infect humans influenza type a with many subtypes and responsible for about  of influenza illness influenza type b with many fewer subtypes and responsible for about  of flu illness in human and influenza type c which only rarely and mildly infects humans the influenza virus spreads easily from person to person through contact as well as through airborne droplets from coughs and sneezes inhalation of infected aerosols leads to viral binding and uptake by cells of the respiratory tract once inside the cell the virus takes over the cellular machinery to replicate produce many multiple additional copies of itself and release viral progeny the incubation period for influenza ranges from one to four days with aerosol transmission occurring up to one day before symptoms begin gu et al  viral shedding then continues for an additional five to seven days though in young children and immunocompromised patients this may continue for longer influenza outbreaks occur at different times of the year depending upon the location in areas near the equator influenza occurs yearround in the northern hemisphere influenza infections typically begin in early fall peaks in february and then ends in late spring the world health organization who estimates that annually around the world  of adults and  of children will contract influenza with three to five million severe cases and approximately  to  deaths who factsheet n° the us centers for disease control cdc estimates influenzaassociated deaths ranged from  annually between  and  in the us with an average of  american dying from influenza and its complications each year  of them elderly influenza viruses the influenza viruses belong to the family orthomyxoviridae have a singlestranded rna genome that is separated into eight segments and typically are of a spherical shape hay et al  there are three genera of influenza virus influenza a infects birds mammals and humans influenza b infects seals ferrets and humans influenza c infects pigs dogs and rarely humans influenza a wild aquatic birds are the natural host for most influenza a viruses which have been the cause of all influenza pandemic outbreaks in humans different influenza a serotypes are classified according to the two most prominent surface antigens hemagglutinin ha or h and neuramidase na or n thus far  ha serotypes and nine na serotypes have been identified with the varying combinations yielding  potential subtypes of influenza the ha and na variants are used to identify different subtypes of the virus eg subtype hn expresses hemagglutinin  and neuramidase  the most common subtypes of influenza a contain hemagglutinins   and  and neuramidases  and  the hn serotype caused the infamous  spanish flu at the end of world war i which killed an estimated  million people worldwide influenza b this virus is less common than influenza a and only infects humans seals osterhaus et al  and ferrets jakeman et al  there are only two lineages  yamagata and victoria  of influenza b and it is known to mutate at a much slower rate than influenza a nobusawa et al  the slow mutation rate and the limited number of potential host species means that pandemics of influenza b do not occur zambon  influenza c this is the least common of the three genera it infects pigs dogs and humans and is typically associated with the least severe symptoms including in children matsuzaki et al  however it is possible for local outbreaks of the virus that can result in severe disease matsuzaki et al  there is no vaccine currently available for influenza c the seasonal outbreaks that occur each year are typically caused by different serotypes of the influenza virus as the viruses are constantly mutating and evolving due to the absence of rnaproofreading enzymes in the host cell machinery it is estimated that there is one error in the genome each time the influenza genome is replicated drake  mutations resulting in changes to the amino acid sequence of ha or na on the surface of the virus results in antigenic drift which is a slow process by which novel strains of the influenza virus are produced until one evolves that can infect people by evading their immune system this new strain then spreads rapidly through the population replacing the previous strain of the virus that had been circulating and often causing an epidemic wolf et al  however since the new serotype is still similar to the prior serotype in circulation a large percentage of the population will still be immune in contrast to the yearly epidemics when influenza viruses that normally infect two different species reassort a novel strain is produced with entirely new antigens that very few if any members of a population will have immunity to in a process called antigenic shift a novel strain produced through antigenic shift has the potential to produce a pandemic and spread uncontrolled through the population parrish et al  while antigenic drift occurs in all influenza genera antigenic shift only occurs in influenza a since it infects so many different species of animals an example of antigenic shift would be if a human and avian influenza virus both infected the same cell with the host cell then forming new viral particles that combine parts of each of the original strains the recent pandemic outbreak of hn in  was the result of antigenic shift that occurred through the reassortment of human avian and swine viruses smith et al  the following figure shows what occurs during antigenic shift influenza vaccines the influenza vaccine is a yearly inoculation given to protect against influenza there are currently three types of influenza vaccine available inactivated influenza vaccine iiv which include whole virus vaccines split virus vaccines where the virus has been disrupted by a detergent and subunit vaccines where ha and na have been further purified from other viral components these are administered intramuscularly or intradermally live attenuated influenza vaccine laiv which are based on temperaturesensitive variant vaccine strains that replicate well in the nasopharynx but poorly in the lower respiratory tract these are administered intranasally recombinant influenza vaccine riv which uses recombinant ha proteins produced in insect cells these are administered intramuscularly a new version of the vaccine is produced each year due to antigenic drift that results in novel strains of the influenza virus circulating through the human population each year each year three strains are chosen by the who global influenza surveillance and response system for inclusion in the yearly vaccine with a fourth strain identified for use in the quadrivalent vaccine the chosen strains are serotypes of hn hn and a typeb strain that is forecasted to be most prevalent during the next influenza season a second typeb strain is added for the quadrivalent vaccine it is noted that the random unpredictable mutations drifts are typically different in the different parts of the northern hemisphere but still the same vaccine strain composition is used for a specific season often resulting in mismatch with actual circulating flu strains and therefore poor vaccine effectiveness the global influenza surveillance and response system gisrs was established in  and is comprised of a number of different institutions in  countries around the world the primary purpose for these institutions is to monitor disease outbreaks as well as perform primary virus isolation and preliminary antigenic characterization the samples are then sent back to the who for further antigenic and genetic analysis with the results being the basis for the whos recommendation for the next influenza vaccine since the groups recommendation is based on its best estimate for which strains will predominate in the next years influenza season around  months later it is tantamount to an educated guess and is susceptible to a mismatch between the vaccine and the circulating strains thus the poor vaccine effectiveness of current straindependent influenza vaccines there are currently three methods through which influenza vaccines are produced eggbased this is still the most common method for producing influenza vaccines and has been in use for more than  years eggbased vaccine manufacturing is used to produce both inactivated vaccine delivered through an injection as well as attenuated vaccine delivered through a nasal spray the process begins with the cdc delivering vaccine viruses serotypes of which were chosen for that upcoming influenza seasons vaccine by the gisrs grown in eggs to the drug manufacturers the vaccine viruses are then injected into fertilized chicken eggs embryos and incubated for several days to allow for viral replication to take place the viruscontaining fluid is then harvested from the eggs and the virus is inactivated and viral fragments are filtered for use in a vaccine this production technique requires a very large quantity of eggs and takes the longest amount of time to produce vaccine typically six months the yields in the eggbased production technology are variable and depend on the strains in general for one seasonal influenza vaccine dose one to two eggs are required the yields for pandemic strains and in particular avian strains ie h and h are much lower because the avian strains kill the chicken embryo therefore approximately  eggs are needed for one pandemic vaccine dose alternatively an adjuvant typically added to vaccines to boost immune response is added to the vaccine since it contains less pandemic influenza antigen cellbased first approved in  the cellbased method uses the same egggrown vaccine viruses supplied by the cdc which are then mixed with cultured mammalian cells and allowed to incubate for several days the viruscontaining fluid is then collected and the viral proteins are filtered or purified for use in the vaccine there is currently one fda approved cellbased influenza vaccine available in the us flucelvax® although yields of the cellbased production are higher than those achieved in eggbased production costs of production in cellbased are higher than the eggbased due to the expensive growth media used for the cell cultures the advantage of this technology is the reduction of the production cycle to four months in comparison to the six months needed for the eggbased technology another advantage is that mammalian cells are not as sensitive to the avian influenza strains as the chicken embryos recombinantbased this process does not require the use of eggs or the influenza virus during any step of vaccine production instead the vaccine is composed of the ha proteins from the selected influenza strains that are produced through recombinant dna technology there is currently one fda approved recombinantbased influenza vaccine available in the us flublok® which was first approved in  and is approximately double the cost of the other vaccines measuring immune response to vaccines the hemagglutinin inhibition hai assay is used to determine the immune response to seasonal influenza vaccines however this assays efficacy applies only to the strains included in the vaccine which may not be relevant to the vaccine effectiveness against the unpredicted circulating strains in the upcoming flu season ha binds to erythrocytes red blood cells and causes the formation of a lattice structure a process called hemagluttination the hemagglutinin assay involves mixing twofold serial dilutions of virus with a fixed amount of red blood cells to the wells of a plastic tray to determine the titer of virus that will cause hemagglutination the red blood cells that are not bound by the virus sink to the bottom of the well which can be visualized as a dark red dot the following image shows the results of a hemagglutinin assay involving different viruses ah and their corresponding dilutions    in the preceding figure sample a causes hemagglutination up to a dilution of  while sample b has no detectable virus in order to perform the hai assay a fixed amount of virus that causes hemagglutination is utilized along with twofold dilutions of patient sera to determine the dilution at which the antibodies in the sera will still prevent hemagglutination which is referred to as the ha antibody titer typical outcomes for immunogenicity include the proportion of subjects with seroconversion which is defined as a going from a preimmunization ha titer of ≤  to postvaccination ha titer of ≥ or b a significant increase at least a fourfold increase from a prevaccination ha titer of ≥ geometric mean titer gmt increase of vaccinationspecific antibodies of  the proportion of patients with postvaccination ha antibody titer ≥ regulatory authorities utilize the immunogenicity of the each seasons influenza vaccine as a surrogate marker for approval while specific antibody titers postvaccination have not been correlated with protection from influenza some clinical trials have shown that antibody titers ≥ have been associated with protection from influenza illness in up to  of subjects hannoun et al  influenza vaccine market the following vaccines were available for sale in the us for the  influenza season  according to pharmapoint the seasonal influenza vaccine market was valued at approximately  billion in  and is expected to grow to over  billion in  approximately  million doses of the seasonal flu vaccine are sold annually in the us each year with a total of  million doses sold worldwide in  sales of the pandemic swine flu hn vaccine by novartis sanofi and glaxosmithkline totaled  billion worldwide the us government has a goal to stockpile enough influenza vaccine to cover  million individuals in the critical workforce for example the emergency services as well as medical and government workers at an average of  per dose the cdc adult vaccine price that is a potential  million opportunity as shown in the table above the influenza vaccine market is currently served by a limited number of companies each of the vaccines offered by those companies are identical in terms of which influenza strains are targeted with the only differences being how the vaccines are produced what other components are in the vaccine eg if the vaccine contains thimeorsal as a preservative and the mode of delivery sales figures for the topselling influenza vaccines are given below influenza vaccine efficacyeffectiveness how well vaccines perform in preventing the disease for which they are developed is a function of the vaccines efficacy and effectiveness two related terms that have distinct epidemiological meanings the formula to calculate a vaccines efficacy is over  years old and was first proposed in  in a study on whole cell cholera and typhoid vaccines greenwood et al  using results from a randomized double blind placebo controlled clinical trial vaccine efficacy is calculated using the relative risk rr of disease between unvaccinated uvac and vaccinated vac patients as follows and for example the efficacy of flublok® was evaluated in a randomized double blind placebo controlled clinical trial of  adults treanor et al  patients were evaluated for cdcdefined influenzalike illness cdcili and any patients with an episode of cdcili had throat and nasal swab samples evaluated for the presence of influenza virus the results showed that out of  patients immunized with flublock®   exhibited ili and tested positive for any influenza strain compared to   of  patients administered placebo flubloks® efficacy was calculated as  in preventing cultureconfirmed cdcili in contrast to efficacy which is calculated for a vaccine under ideal circumstances and  vaccine uptake a vaccines effectiveness measures how well a vaccine performs when it is used in normal circumstances in a community it can also measure the net benefits compared to adverse effects of a vaccination program a vaccines effectiveness is proportional to vaccine efficacy but is also affected by vaccine uptake in a target population and nonvaccinerelated factors such as hospitalization rates ambulatory visits and costs the cdc vaccine effectiveness ve network is composed of five study sites across the us that work together to conduct studies to measure the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccination each year these prospective casecontrol studies include patients with acute respiratory illness and cough and utilize a highly accurate laboratory test to confirm influenza infection with the cases being those that test positive for influenza virus and the controls being those that test negative each patients vaccination status is then confirmed by self reporting and medical records ve estimates are calculated as a rate difference using the odds ratio otcor for developing infection despite vaccination eg the odds of vaccination among outpatients with acute respiratory illness and laboratoryconfirmed influenza infection compared to the odds of vaccination among outpatients with acute respiratory illness who test negative for influenza infection the cdc has conducted ve studies for the seasonal influenza vaccine since the  influenza season with the results shown in the following table the ve numbers shown above point to one of the main problems with the currently available seasonal vaccine which is that if the vaccine is not matched up well with the strain of influenza that circulates the following season there is a very low effectiveness eg in last years  influenza season the ve was only  if a poor match is determined between the vaccine and the circulating strain there is nothing that can be done since it takes approximately six months to produce sufficient quantities of the vaccine and begin dispensing them influenza and the elderly while influenza can be a serious disease for people of all ages those that are age  and older are the most vulnerable to developing complications from influenza including death mortality associated with seasonal influenza disproportionately affects elderly persons as  of influenzarelated deaths occur in persons aged  years or older thompson et al  this is due in part to the fact that the seasonal influenza vaccine is not as effective in the elderly with ve rates as low as  in this population who complicating matters is the fact that  of elderly individuals suffer from some type of chronic illness national council on aging and influenza is known to worsen outcomes in those with chronic diseases the total economic impact of influenza in the elderly population is estimated at approximately  billion molinari et al  from  to  the influenza vaccination rate for persons aged  and older in the us increased from  to  however mortality and hospitalization rates continued to increase rather than decline as would be expected glezen et al  part of the reason for this could be due to declining immunological function and frailty that are experienced by elderly patients for this reason a new highdose seasonal influenza vaccine has been formulated fluzone® high dose that was reported to have relative efficacy of  compared to the standard dose vaccination in elderly patients diazgranados et al  while encouraging these results were obtained during influenza seasons where there was a relatively good match between the seasonal vaccine and circulating strains and different results could possibly be seen in years where the relatedness between the vaccine and circulating strains differed materially the need for a better influenza vaccine the preceding discussion on currently available influenza vaccines identifies a number of deficiencies including strain specificity the current seasonal influenza vaccine is only formulated against three or four specific past strains of the influenza virus which are identified based upon worldwide laboratory monitoring and identification of the most likely strains to be circulating through the population during the next influenza season in a pandemic situation by the time that the industry formulates the pandemic strainspecific vaccine approximately six months after the outbreak and identification of the pandemic flu strain different drifted pandemic strains will circulate that will result in mismatch and a reduced pandemic vaccine effectiveness new vaccine required every year due to antigenic drift a seasonal influenza vaccine only offers limited protection for one season and must be reformulated and readministered every year long production cycle the seasonal influenza vaccine takes approximately five to six months to be produced from the initial identification of a new viral strain to being reviewed and approved by regulatory authorities the timetable shown below is from the who limited immunological response the seasonal influenza vaccines elicit a humoral response from the immune system which results in the production of antibodies directed against the influenza virus specifically against ha however there is little if any generation of influenza virusspecific tcells which are the primary means through which the body eliminates virallyinfected cells in the body egg allergies the majority of seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines are produced in fertilized hen eggs thus they cannot be administered to individuals with egg allergies clearly based upon the aforementioned shortcomings there is a significant unmet need for a more effective influenza vaccine that can overcome these deficiencies in particular there is a need for a more robust vaccine to overcome the most significant challenge of the seasonal influenza vaccine which is strainspecificity brought about by the sometimes inaccurate forecasting of which influenza strains to target m biondvax has developed the m vaccine a synthetic peptidebased protein that targets both existing and future seasonal and pandemic strains of the influenza virus the vaccine targets conserved regions of type a and b influenza viruses such that m could be considered a universal influenza vaccine capable of offering immunological protection against all strains of the influenza virus the company is planning to seek regulatory approval through a twopart strategy as a universal primer to be used before any habased flu vaccine biondvax targets two indications for its universal primer i seasonal primer for influenza vaccine in the elderly and ii pandemic primer for national stockpile as a standalone independent universal vaccine against influenza many infectious diseases have been eradicated over the past century for example polio and smallpox thanks to vaccination in order to eradicate an infectious disease a community or herd immunity must be achieved three conditions are required to achieve community immunity an effective vaccine broad coverage and unchanging vaccine formulation and enough people to be vaccinated with a universal flu vaccine such as biondvaxs m it appears theoretically possible for the first time in history to achieve the goal of influenza eradication m composition m is composed of nine peptides that are believed to be common to most known influenza strains in existence in part because these peptides seem to be critical for the virus ability to infect a host cell they are derived from hemagglutinin ha matrix  m and nucleoprotein np viral proteins and are arranged as triplicates into a single recombinant protein easily manufactured in bacteria as discussed above ha is an antigenic glycoprotein found on the surface of influenza viruses and is also the main constituent for a number of seasonal influenza vaccines however the peptides from ha in m are derived from the inner parts of the protein where little to no variability between strains exists m is a matrix protein that forms a layer under the patches of the viral cell membrane that contain ha na and m proteins and is responsible for mediating the encapsulation of rnanucleoprotein complexes into the membrane envelope sha et al  np is a structural protein that encapsidates the viral rna inside the virus the sequence of each of the peptides is shown below along with the order in which the peptides are arranged in the fulllength recombinant protein the peptides were selected based upon their ability to elicit either a b or tcell immune response and each of them has the ability to bind to a wide array of human leukocyte antigen hla proteins both class i and class ii which are responsible for presenting peptides to the immune system some may question the use of peptides from proteins located inside the virus however there is a strong rationale for their use it has long been known that a mild influenza infection in animals provides protection against a subsequent more severe challenge with a virus harboring different ha and na yetter et al  this effect appears to be mediated by both cd and cd tcells that recognize conserved regions on viral proteins furuya et al  the cd tcells that are specific for conserved internal viral antigens also potentiate antibody responses to the ha of subsequently encountered viruses scherle et al  the end result is that immunizing with conserved internal viral antigens results in an increased immunological response to infection following subsequent exposure to influenza viruses m clinical trial results thus far m has been tested in  participants through five different clinical trials with the details presented in the following chart in each of the trials the vaccine was shown to be safe and able to induce a robust immune response due to the fact that m does not target the variable region of ha the hai assay cannot be employed as a surrogate endpoint for determining vaccine efficacy when m is administered on its own thus the company has developed additional immunological assays to determine immunogenicity in addition in its first stage in bringing m to market the company is pursuing a primeboost strategy where m is given prior to immunization with the traditional seasonal influenza vaccine in which case the hai assay can be utilized to compare immunogenicity to currently available influenza vaccines the results from some of those trials are presented below bvx atsmon et al  this was a singlecenter randomized placebo controlled single blind firstinhuman study to examine the safety and immunological response to m in healthy adults age  for safety purposes three subjects were dosed once with  mg of m and monitored for  days before the rest of the patients were administered the planned doses there were four dosing cohorts and within each cohort subjects were randomized in a  fashion to receive either  mg or  mg m n or placebo n with or without adjuvant the results showed that m was well tolerated with only mild and moderate adverse events aes with no significant difference between vaccine and placebo recipients for aes a robust humoral antibodies to m and cellular pbmc proliferation to viral peptides immune response was noted for participants immunized with m and while there were greater humoral responses in patients immunized with m plus adjuvant there did not appear to be a difference in cellular response between subjects dosed with adjuvant and those without bvx atsmon et al  this was a twocenter randomized placebo controlled study in a total of  elderly volunteers age  the subjects were randomized  into four parallel groups to receive either  two sequential nonadjuvanted  mg m or  a single nonadjuvanted  mg m or  a single adjuvanted im injection of  mg m or  one placebo injection all participants subsequently received the seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine tiv three weeks following the last m or placebo injection the primary outcome measures were safety tolerability and tolerance of m with secondary outcomes being humoral and cellular immune responses the results showed that priming with m enhanced seroconversion towards all three strains in that seasons influenza vaccine denoted on the yaxis in the figure below the following figure shows the percentage of patients that tested positive for seroconversion defined as a mean fold increase in antiha antibody levels of ≥ fourfold from levels detected in sera collected on day  and reaching a level of ≥ postimmunization and seroprotection defined as the number of participants per cohort expressing antiha antibody levels of ≥ postimmunization addition of an adjuvant did not appear to offer any additional immunostimulatory effect in  a new swiss epidemic influenza strain hn aswitzerland emerged that did not exist in  which was when the bvx trial took place and the participants in the trial were immunized with m blood serum samples from the participants in the bvx trial were exposed to the swiss influenza strain with results showing that greater than  of the m vaccinated group had seroprotection against this new swiss strain compared to only  of those immunized with just the seasonal vaccine this suggests that m may offer a broader longlasting immune response not just to strains currently in existence but to future strains that do not even exist yet final phase  clinical trials for m biondvax has initiated two phase  clinical trials that will involve a total of  participants one that is ongoing in europe bvx and one that will soon start admitting participants in the us bvx the bvx trial is currently taking place in hungary with support by the european unisec consortium with enrollment ongoing the bvx trial is taking place in the us and is being fully funded by the national institutes of health nih and conducted by the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid bvx this is a phase b clinical trial that is expected to enroll  adults age  the study will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of m when used as a primer to the hn avian influenza vaccine the hn avian influenza vaccine will be given once at a suboptimal dose in order to test whether m can enhance its immunogenicity if successful this trial could show the dose sparing potential of m which in the case of a pandemic situation could allow for the available doses of pandemic vaccine to be administered to more subjects the trial is being funded through a grant from the european union and is being conducted in conjunction with the european unisec consortium which is a group of three academic partners five national health institutes and three companies with the objective to identify develop and clinically test the most promising leads for a universal influenza vaccine we anticipate results from this trial to be reported in the fourth quarter of  bvx this will be a phase  clinical trial being conducted by the niaid which is part of the nih the double blind multicenter randomized placebo controlled trial is expected to enroll  adults  and will examine the use of m as a primer vaccine to be given several weeks before the hn avian pandemic vaccine the primary outcome will be safety and tolerability with secondary endpoints examining humoral and cellular immune responses we anticipate this trial will begin during the second quarter with results from this trial in late  or early  biondvax regulatory strategy and opportunity biondvax is pursuing a twopart strategy for the development of m that involves first attaining approval for the vaccine as a universal primer for use before any seasonal influenza vaccine in the elderly and before any pandemic influenza vaccine as part of preparing for any pandemic outbreak using a national stockpile of m the company will then continue development of m as a standalone independent universal influenza vaccine following the successful completion of the companys ongoing phase  clinical trials biondvaxs management anticipates an end of phase  meeting being held with the fda in the  timeframe such that an investigational new drug ind application can be filed for phase  clinical trials for m in order to fund the phase  trials we believe the company is pursuing nondilutive financial sources either via grants from royalty bearing regional manufacturing and distribution agreements with down payments or in collaborations with larger pharmaceutical companies we believe the phase  program could cost between  million the following chart gives additional details about the planned phase  clinical trials using m as a universal primer vaccine to be used before any seasonal and pandemic vaccines is a wise strategy as it allows biondvax to leverage the existing approved regulatory marker hai for influenza vaccines and therefore to conduct smaller clinical trials providing a faster time to market than could be achieved for m as a standalone independent vaccine we believe that for the seasonal primer for the elderly indication a post marketing phase  clinical trial with clinical efficacy as an endpoint may be required for obtaining permanent marketing authorization similar to what was required for the approval of fluzone hd the clinical efficacy endpoint is defined as reduction of illness rate and severity and will require significantly more participants than for the primer indications the standalone indication will also require a clinical efficacy endpoint however that will be part of the phase  program the company has already shown that m enhances the immunogenicity of the seasonal vaccine in young adults and elderly participants including to the pandemic hn swine flu strain that is included in the seasonal flu vaccines since  currently the company together with the unisec consortium eu and the nihniaid us is testing the ability of the vaccine to be used as a universal pandemic primer vaccine both of these indications are potentially quite lucrative there were approximately  million doses of the influenza vaccine administered last year with approximately  of those administered to the elderly assuming a  penetration rate which will use m as part of primeboost vaccine then at approximately  per dose based on a midpoint between the fluzone hd geared to the elderly price of  and the standard fluzone price of  per dose it is a potential  million opportunity just in the us another market is the pandemic primer for national stockpile the critical workforce in the us is approximately  of the population  million people and rd of the stockpile is replaced annually given a shelflife of three years at  per dose that represents another  million opportunity the total influenza vaccine market is expected to be over  billion by  so even with only a  penetration rate that is a potential  million annual opportunity other universal influenza vaccines under development there are a number of other companies developing universal influenza vaccines however biondvax appears to be the furthest ahead in development seek seek is developing a universal influenza vaccine based on six unique peptides that induce a cellular response by the immune system the vaccine fluv has been tested in  individuals in a phase  and a phase  clinical trial results from those studies showed that vaccinated subjects had significantly lower symptom scores and viral titer levels compared with nonvaccinated subjects in addition blood from vaccinated subjects showed a crossreactive immunity to both typea and typeb influenza viruses inovio inovio is developing synthetic dna vaccines against both seasonal and pandemic strains of the influenza virus the company has conducted two phase  open label studies to evaluate the safety tolerability and immune responses against multiple combinations of type a influenza subtypes both studies showed the vaccine to be safe and well tolerated as well as capable of generating a robust immune response flugen flugen is developing a vaccine made from a genetically engineered influenza virus msr that has a specific deletion in the viral genome this deletion allows for only a single replication of the vaccine virus within the host cell which results in longlasting crossprotective immunity against multiple viral subtypes without the generation of progeny virions the company recently raised  million in order to perform a phase  clinical trial financials and capital structure biondvax is well capitalized and has a very lean structure with minimal cash burn each quarter as of september   the company had  million in cash and cash equivalents due to a us initial public offering in may  of  million american depository shares adss with each ads representing  of the companys common shares which are listed on the tel aviv stock exchange the adss were sold for  per ads gaining investors one share and one warrant convertible at  to  share this netted the company gross proceeds of  million in june  the company closed an additional and partial exercise of the overallotment option granted to the underwriters who purchased  additional adss for  per ads total gross proceeds to biondvax from the offering were approximately  million the company is currently burning approximately  per month it is noted that its two ongoing clinical trials bvx and bvx are being funded primarily by third parties we estimate there is sufficient capital to fund operations until mid and if the warrants are converted to shares it will provide additional funds of up to  million in addition there is no debt on the balance sheet biondvaxs common shares are traded on the telaviv stock exchange while the companys adss are traded on the nasdaq there are currently  million shares outstanding listed in tel aviv or  million adss listed on nasdaq and when factoring in the options and warrants the company has a fully diluted share count of approximately  million shares or  million adss the following table breaks down the companys capital structure valuation methodology we value biondvax using a probability adjusted discounted cash flow model that takes into account potential revenues from the sale of m as  a seasonal primer for influenza vaccine in the elderly  a pandemic primer for a national stockpile and  a standalone independent universal influenza vaccine at this point we are assuming that the company will enter into one or more partnerships with larger pharmaceutical companies that will result in biondvax receiving royalties we model  for all indications on the sale of m as a primer for both the seasonal vaccine in the elderly and a pandemic stockpile we model for the current phase  clinical trials to be completed by the first half of  this will allow for an endofphase  meeting with the fda and initiation of a phase  program in  regulatory filings in  and approval in  in the us there were approximately  million doses of the influenza vaccine administered last year with approximately  of those administered to the elderly assuming a  penetration rate which will use m as part of primeboost vaccine then at approximately  per dose based on a midpoint between the fluzone hd geared to the elderly price of  and the standard fluzone price of  per dose it is a potential  million opportunity just in the us we believe the rest of the world represents a potential  million peak opportunity we apply an  discount rate and a  probability of approval to arrive at a net present value for m as a primer for seasonal vaccination in the elderly of  million another market is the pandemic primer for national stockpile the critical workforce in the us is approximately  of the population  million people and rd of the stockpile is replaced annually given a shelflife of three years at  per dose that represents another  million annual opportunity we apply an  discount rate and a  probability of approval to arrive at a net present value for m as a primer for a pandemic vaccine of  million as a standalone universal vaccine we anticipate phase  trials initiating in  with a regulatory filing in  and approval in  by that time we model for approximately  million doses of the influenza vaccine being administered in the us and with a peak market share of  we model for peak revenues of over  million we apply an  discount rate and a  probability of approval to arrive at a net present value for m as a standalone universal vaccine of  million combining the net present value for each of the companys development programs along with the companys cash total as of september    million and expected operating burn of  million we arrive at a net present value for the company of approximately  million dividing this by the companys fully diluted share count of  million adss leads to a fair value of approximately  per share and we are assigning a buy rating to the stock risks to consider additional capital will be necessary to fund phase  trials the company currently does not have enough cash to conduct the phase  trials that will be necessary to seek fda approval for m as a universal primer for the seasonal influenza vaccine in the elderly and as a universal primer for pandemic strainspecific vaccines raising additional capital from the capital markets could result in significant dilution to current shareholders if the company enters into strategic collaborations or partnerships in order to fund the phase  program it may be necessary to relinquish some rights of the companys technologies and products as a result of royalty bearing regional manufacturing and distribution agreements with down payments in selected territories m may not be successful in future clinical trials while m has shown to been safe and well tolerated in the clinical trials that have been conducted thus far there is no guarantee that the compound will show efficacy or meet endpoints in phase  clinical trials that involve thousands of patients in addition it is possible that safety signals not seen in earlier clinical trials could arise when m is tested in a much larger cohort of subjects m is currently the companys only product under development biondvax is solely focused on the development of m as it is the only product currently in the companys pipeline thus the companys success relies solely on the ability to commercialize m disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next  hours business relationship disclosure i work as a consultant analyst

million americans while complications of the disease can be dire there is hope biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments diabetes the patient perspective diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose sugar in the blood normally the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy with diabetes the body either does not make enough insulin type  diabetes or does not use it properly type  diabetes leading to high blood glucose levels uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications such as heart attack lowerlimb amputation vision impairment and blindness endocrinologist dr william bill chin has experience treating endocrine disorders including diabetes as chief medical officer at phrma he works to ensure that patient voices are heard drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes when dr chins son danny was  he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst dr chin diagnosed his son himself with type  diabetes he says i don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease particularly one that will be chronic in many ways it’s forever but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed the changing landscape of diabetes treatment the medications that danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years a decade ago a number of insulin options were available to patients as well as oral and injected medications successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels to control their glucose patients needed multiple daily injections andor multiple oral medicines in recent years researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients from fewer pills to less frequent injections careful monitoring and treatment are still needed but current medicines in development offer a promising future there are  medicines currently in development for type  and type  diabetes and diabetesrelated conditions a new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetesrelated complications that affect the kidneys blood vessels and eyes all of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the fda while these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type  diabetes ongoing research remains critical in fact diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the united states in  dr chin says collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes  we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease this can only be achieved by having

boldly do not go gentle todays breakthroughs are becoming tomorrows medicines watch the video we cannot take progress for granted we cannot take progress for granted share tweet link email print we are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases but we must not take this progress for granted  to ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop lifesaving treatments and cures in order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients our country must     make medicines more affordable by rewarding value  today america’s biopharmaceutical companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment or agreements may lower copays if patients achieve better health outcomes while these partnerships will vary they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system yet outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements  government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines rather we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for americans     ensure patients get the best deal on medicines america’s biopharmaceutical companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers pbms those rebates are growing every year and now exceed  billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers but we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price even when their insurers get a rebate in fact patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine  that’s wrong health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive this could lower outofpocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year     make new breakthroughs accessible and promote competition we need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines it simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over  years and over one billion dollars on average  outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more to get medicines approved faster while ensuring safety we need to modernize the fda with new technologies and expertise to keep up with st century science modernizing the fda will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines which will bring medicines to patients faster and enhance competition in the market we also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the us food and drug administration fda  this will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection  at the same time we must avoid policies that deter risktaking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients learn more about our plan to build a sustainable sciencebased health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here related news mustknow facts about drug costs did you know due to negotiation and competition medicine costs are growing at the slowest rate in
