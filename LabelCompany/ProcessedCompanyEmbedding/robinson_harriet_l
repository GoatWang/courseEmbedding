higher levels of t cells than either dna or mva immunizations alone the goals of this program project are to evaluate the cross clade activity of dna mva protocols for immunodeficiency virus vaccines can worldwide vaccination be accomplished with a single dnamva immunogen or will a mixture of dnamva immunogens or geographically targeted cladespecific immunogens be necessary the charges for project  are to perform the preclinical testing that will determine which dnas or formulated dnas will be used for priming mva boosters in human trials and to provide preclinical data to support ind applications for human trials one major goal for project  is to determine in preclinical models how dnamva immunogens from two different clades affect the height and breadth of tcell responses compared to those raised by single clade immunogens a second major goal is to identify conditions that will allow the amount of dna needed for priming mva boosters to be reduced by tenfold project  will be accomplished by a team of emory investigators dr ahmed will be responsible for screening novel dnas and formulated dnas in mouse models for effects on the height and breadth of the memory t cell response dr robinson will be responsible for glp studies in macaques testing the ability of selected immunogens both singly and in combination to raise memory tcell responses studies will be done
