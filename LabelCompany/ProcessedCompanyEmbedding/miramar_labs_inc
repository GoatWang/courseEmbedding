otcqbmrlb is a medical technology company focused on developing and commercializing products utilizing our proprietary microwave technology platform our first commercial product the miradry system is designed to ablate axillary or underarm sweat glands through the precise and noninvasive delivery of energy to the region where sweat glands reside  the energy generates heat which results in thermolysis of the sweat glands  at the same time a continuous hydroceramic cooling system protects the superficial dermis and keeps the heat focused at the sweat glands  because sweat glands do not regenerate after the treatment we believe the results are lasting  microwaves are the ideal technology as the energy can be focused directly at the fat and dermal junction where the glands reside we
