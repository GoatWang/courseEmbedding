income fund nysepci  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»pci is pdi and pko it should trade like itsep  about pimco dynamic pci alpha gen capital deep value cfa registered investment advisor contrarianmarketplaceyield hunting alt inc oppssummarypci was launched with a different management team and investment policy statement and underperformed early onpimco changed out the manager to the same group that runs pdi in addition to altering the investment policy to give it more flexibilitythe three funds pci pdi and pko are largely composed of the same sectors primarily nonagency mbs with strong correlation in nav performancethere is a large opportunity in pci for investors to not only generate strong and consistent yield but an arbitrage with pdi and pkosubscribers to yield hunting received an early look to this article investors have long known of one of the best bond funds out there the pimco dynamic income fund nysepdi but we see as one of the best opportunities today in its new larger cousin the pimco dynamic credit and mortgage income fundnysepci let me first preface this by saying that we think pdi is one of the greatest fixedincome funds of all time spanning across both open and closedend spaces despite its short lifespan of under four years however we think there is a possible arbitrage opportunity between it the pimco opportunity fund nysepko and pci ongoing thesis there is nearly a  spread in discounts between the prices of the two funds despite several factors for one the portfolios are being positioned almost identically in the nonagency mbs sector highyield and nonusd credit secondly nav performance of pci has been better ytd possibly indicating a shift in leadership among the funds lastly as the change in management and investment policy recedes more institutional ownership are likely to scoop up the shares in terms of trading the probability of another decentsized special distribution is likely to draw in the yieldseekers as we approach yearend this should help increase the price and reduce the discount of pci and press up the premium of pdi up until the exdate a good strategy would be to coattail that runup through middecember then sell and rebuy after the exdate and the yieldseekers have gotten out investment policy change at pci in march the company made a change to its nonfundamental investment policy while rescinding their previous policy the new policy is stated below when a nonfundamental policy is changed shareholder approval is not required the fund will normally invest at least  of its net assets plus any borrowings for investment purposes in a portfolio of mortgagerelated securities and other debt instruments of varying maturities the  policy the previous investment policy statement required the managers to invest at least  of its net assets in corporate incomeproducing securities of varying maturities pimco believed that the change would provide them much more flexibility in their goanywhere approach giving them greater ability to allocate to noncorporate creditrelated assets which they believe have more attractive relative value on june th pimco then announced they were changing the name of pci to the pimco dynamic credit and mortgage income fund adding in and mortgage into the fund name the change gives a greater indication of what the fund actually invests within and is clearly an attempt to close the discount of the fund change in management and strategy at pci in early  pimco announced that they were changing the management team of the fund from marc seidner to the same team that manages both pdi and pko they include star manager dan ivascyn alfred murata mark keisel elizabeth maclean and sai devabhaktuni the change in management was driven by the poor performance of the fund when it launched in early  at that time they had significant exposure to emerging market debt and senior loans with just  in nonagency mbs since then the portfolio composition has shifted fairly drastically going to over  nonagency mbs this compares to the  that is held in pdi and  in pko below is pcis industry breakdown and sector allocation source pimco now compare it to pdis information source pimco pimco income opportunity composition source pimco the differences among the three portfolios in terms of their composition is fairly negligible in other words the risks that pdi and pko are exposed to and the tailwinds that have made them perform so well are now almost identical with pci the correlation between the navs have tightened in the last year and are extremely tight ytd among the three funds pcis nav has performed the best on a price basis pci is doing better given the discount and better nav performance during the minitantrum on september th and september th the higher premium funds suffered more than the funds at discounts earnings factors and discounts as we recently highlighted in our monthly update on pimco funds in update to pimco closedend funds unii august  earnings coverage continues to increase in june the three funds all benefited from the settlement with bank of america nysebac countrywide that had long been coming this is certainly not the last settlement that investors in these securities from prior to the financial crisis are likely to receive us justice department officials recently announced that they were seeking more than  billion from deutsche bank nysedb in mortgagerelated violations in april goldman sachs nysegs agreed to pay  billion in mbsrelated claim settlements these are the toxic waste cmos that the restricted entities had to dump at the worst possible time many hedge funds and credit pools scooped up these leftfordead securities at in some cases pennies on the dollar but in most cases more than that it was a quality opportunity as these formerly investmentgrade rated structures were forced out of pensions insurance general accounts and other regulated funds after the nros derated the securities by  when pdi and pci were launching they scooped up these after substantial amounts of due diligence by this time if the mortgage payer was going to default they likely would have they had taken out the mortgage prior to  and made it through the financial crisis without defaulting on the loan while defaults obviously still occurred they came at a much reduced rate compared to prior years the funds unii continues to trend higher though earnings have trended lower over the first two months of the fiscal year pci has generated  in taxable nii or  per month unii rose nine cents to  if we extrapolate that growth for the remainder of the year unii should be around  we assume a  special distribution at yearend below nav is going to contain all the actions of management in the portfolio in that respect pci is starting to catch and in the shorterterm pass pdi in terms of performance why perhaps when they began shifting the portfolio towards nonagency securities there was a major buying opportunity similar to what was available in  when pdi was launched pdi having a full complement of these securities did not have as much of an opportunity to add to these securities the opportunity we see the current discount on pci is likely to close and move to a premium given the change and the strength of the portfolio when pimco made the alteration to their investment policy the star management team clearly saw an opportunity within the nonagency mortgage space and that has played out well judging by the performance noted above in the table below we attempt to make a valuation between the three funds each months distribution is noted plus what we expect to be a special distribution around yearend the funds are ranked by our adjusted total return based solely on distributions essentially assuming a flat nav over the course of the year we think the current discountpremiums of the funds will converge to within  bps of each other the adjusted total return formulates that the two funds at premium pdi pko will decline towards par and that pci will move up towards par we would caveat the above that we do not think pdi and pko are not deserving the premiums at which they trade in fact we believe they should be at much larger premiums to nav given their yields stability and management performance our base case forecast calls for all three funds to be trading at  to  premiums over the next year or two given that pdi is there and pko close to it the main beneficiary of that move should it occur will be pci the below table shows the relevant information for each of the three funds the variance in the discounts is likely due to the market balancing out the distribution yields pcis yield on price excluding the forecasted special distributions is above that of pdi pcis distribution yield on price is  versus pdis  pdi certainly has the longer track record and better performance with pci struggling during their early years likely accounting for that  bps variance in yield but as the track record of pci catches pdi the variance between the two distribution yields should close if pcis distribution yield was  today its price would be  or  above todays price as pdis overearning to the massive extent it has historically comes to an end and it will eventually the fund should still generate  for some time even if the large specials are gone the boards objective has been to keep the regular distribution yield around that  store the excess until forced as a ric to pay out and avoid the excise tax and earn additional income in the process in a world of very low rates that yield should come at a premium to nav as total yields including the specials converge between the three funds discounts are likely to unite the bottom line pci continues to be underappreciated much of that is likely due to its shorter lifespan weak early performance and the changes to management and the investment policy this is one of the larger closedend funds of the  or so that exist meaning that it has significant liquidity k daily shares traded add in the starpower of the financial sponsor and the premier fixedincome investment team and you have the basis for more institutional ownership but that will take time as those institutional players mostly pension funds and insurance companies allow for those changes to move further into the past given the sad state that most of these organizations are in and their reach for yield these products make complete sense today the largest risk of these pools of mortgages comes not from default risk although it is still there but from prepayments these structures were launched with coupons in the  to  range but pimcos ability to buy them at half off or more means that investors in the fund are receiving  returns on these investments as they recover in price the fund itself is generating large unrealized capital gains in the process as always if you have any questions please
