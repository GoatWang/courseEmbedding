returns while controlling risk of a portfolio of closedend funds there are two advantages to our approach first since closedend funds typically trade at discounts to the value of the underlying securities they hold we can effectively purchase securities at a discount to the market the second advantage is one of greater diversification because a portfolio of closedend funds effectively holds a much broader set of individual securities discounts and diversification benefits lead to better returns and lower risk for the product portfolio manager dr tony tessitore and his team have extensive
