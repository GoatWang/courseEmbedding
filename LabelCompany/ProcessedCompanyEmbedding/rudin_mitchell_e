with mitchell e rudin chief executive officer mackcali realty corporation editors’ note mitchell rudin has served in his current post since joining the company in june  prior to this he served as president and chief executive officer of us commercial operations at brookfield office properties overseeing a portfolio in excess of  million square feet in nine markets before that he served as president and chief executive officer of the new york tristate region for cbre rudin has a juris doctor from boston college law school and is a phi beta kappa graduate of franklin  marshall college company brief mackcali realty corporation mackcalicom is a real estate investment trust reit providing management leasing development and other tenantrelated services for its twoplatform operations of waterfront and transitbased office and luxury multifamily assets mackcali owns or has interests in approximately  office and flex properties totaling approximately  million square feet and  multifamily rental communities containing approximately  residential units and a pipeline of approximately  units all located in the northeast mackcali strives to provide its tenants and residents with the most innovative communities that empower them to reimagine the way they work and live you came in to change this company will you talk about how that process has gone i started with a terrific partner mike demarco and we had a vision coming in for the company and for the markets that we are in and we have exceeded expectations we announced a plan  days after we started called “” which indicated that we would be consolidating the office portfolio to  million square feet and increasing the multifamily portfolio to  units by  at the time we indicated our approach would be to tour every property and develop a strategy for the  or so office buildings that we owned we identified the markets we considered strategic and those that weren’t this led to an acquisition strategy and a disposition program the latter of which was executed mostly in  and will be finished in  this involved selling properties that are not part of our future even though they’re good properties we have enormous confidence in the hudson river waterfront and anticipate that we could have perhaps  percent of the value of the company along the waterfront between fort lee and jersey city but primarily between weehawken where we developed port imperial into hoboken and jersey city we have a number of other markets that we are committed to including metropark parsippany white plains red bank and short hills as well as a few others we have already seen substantial rent growth in these markets on the waterfront office side we have seen rents increase by almost  percent in the  months we’ve been there we have driven occupancy to  percent with a more varied type of tenant at the end of last year we finished a deal with omnicom the world’s second largest media and advertising company they had two criteria when entering the marketplace they looked at the boroughs as well as at us and they wanted to drive rent down and do something that would synergize with their offices in new york this led them to our portfolio there are a number of fashion and technology companies that have come into the market as well who are interested in this area the grow nj program allows us to take rents into the single digits or even remain flat for a year period on the multifamily side we have also continued to drive growth we opened m at marbella in jersey city six months ago and it is now  percent leased we opened another building during the first week in march that stands out on the skyline jersey city urby at harborside it’s a function of providing a highquality product at a fraction of the cost of not only manhattan but of brooklyn and long island city our multifamily product is approximately  percent of the cost of comparable apartments in manhattan  percent of those in brooklyn and  percent of long island city for example you can lease a studio in a fully amenitized building for approximately month does your split between office and multifamily provide the right balance for you today we are going to grow both and we see them as highly synergistic in three ways first we can create and control a great mixeduse environment workliveplay is what we do it’s about having office space with apartments right next door we’re also going to be developing  square feet of retail in harborside in jersey city minutes from all of our office and multifamily projects in the major tech hubs like new york and san francisco where housing is so costly the fact that we can provide reasonable housing alternatives that are next to work and proximate to manhattan is really a plus we also have one of the most dense concentrations of tech workers living in jersey city second we have been able to repurpose buildings that had formerly been used for offices into multifamily communities rather than selling them at a deep discount we have created value as well as a builtin pipeline finally people on that side have greater experience with amenities such as gyms cafeterias and the like being able to take advantage of that aesthetic has been terrific will you talk about the startup nature of the new offices we wanted to do something that we would be proud of organizationally that would increase communication and energy in the office and show the architectural elements of our plusyearold home there is an integration of open space and common areas with terrific views we were able to create a showcase while exercising economic prudence in building it out how important is brand to the company the brand is critical ours was a great brand that had suffered and people were looking to us to restore it there is pride in this organization so people want to see us succeed we do have outstanding competitors but they don’t have the scale and public exposure we do how does the leadership at the top work so well our strengths are complementary and we both bring a drive and desire to get things done yesterday through the better part of my career i have worked in cooperative leadership environments so i understand the strengths of it as a result we have been able to portray a face of cooperation and confidence to the marketplace while in the process do you take time to celebrate the wins i love coming to work every day but we’re always striving to achieve the next goal• click here to download a pdf of an interview with mitchell e rudin chief executive officer

professional management an interview with mitchell e rudin president and chief executive officer new york tristate region cb richard ellis group inc editors note mitch rudin overseas all the business and operating functions for cbre’s operations in the region he has significantly improved the region’s operating margins since assuming this role and led the region to profitability every year including in the past two years the most tumultuous the industry has seen while doing this cbre’s market dominance in tristate has continued to expand among rudin’s other corporate activities he is a member of cbre’s diversity committee and executive sponsor for the africanamerican affinity group he is also chair of the firm’s global law firm practice group he was previously president – brokerage services for cbre and held a similar position at insigniaesg as president of us transaction services until cbre’s acquisition of that firm in  rudin also ran the transition team for insigniaesg in connection with the merger with cbre before joining insigniaesg rudin was a partner at tishman speyer properties he was formerly an attorney with davis  gilbert where he practiced real estate law company brief cb richard ellis group inc wwwcbrecom is a fortune  and sp  company headquartered in los angeles the company has approximately  employees excluding affiliates and serves real estate owners investors and occupiers through more than  offices excluding affiliates worldwide cb richard ellis offers strategic advice and execution for property sales and leasing corporate services property facilities and project management mortgage banking appraisal and valuation development services investment management and research and consulting were you surprised by the speed and severity of the economic crisis and where are we in terms of the real estate market coming back virtually everyone was surprised by the depth and severity of the crisis when it hit starting in june  we anticipated a downturn we started to manage into a declining economy and that enabled us to avoid many more precipitous steps now we’re somewhere in the bottom of a flat u so we don’t foresee a further decline and we’re seeing modest improvements depending upon which segment of the market that you’re in it’s going to bounce along the bottom for awhile how challenging is it to differentiate in this space and how do you define that differentiation for cbre it depends on the market segment that you’re looking at on the one hand if you’re somebody who has global requirements then a global footprint is important and ours is not only significantly larger but best in class in almost all major markets and business lines on the other hand if you’re somebody who has a building to lease and manage in new york or an occupier who has a specific requirement we have several points of differentiation the strength and depth of our consulting department which is plus years old and unique in the entire industry not just in new york our market research department which has continued unabated for as long as i’ve been here and the training strength and coordination of our brokers in crain’s new york business’  annual list of the  largest transactions we had  of the top  and six of the top  and we again secured the real estate board of new york deal of the year for the th time has technology had a major impact on the business and has it changed the way you operate yes and no it has certainly helped with communication and it certainly has enhanced our ability to deliver research and other services but like everything else in the professional service field it may be an enhancement but it all starts with the individuals – the selection training and management of them before any other firm in our industry cbre made the decision to move to professional management having said that when we move into our new tristate headquarters next year we will have the best technology in our industry – telepresence and teleconferencing – significant upgrades in capacity new computers wireless offices etc you are actively involved in cbre’s diversity committee how critical is it from a global standpoint to maintain a diverse workforce that mirrors your client base and what is the message out there about the opportunities for women and minorities the commitment to diversity flows from the top and we are the leader in this area approximately  percent of our management team in tristate arre women in addition in one year cbre’s top producer top investment sales professional and top retail sales professional were all women from tristate what region in any company in almost any industry can say that the challenge with minorities is greater but we are attacking that hire by hire we started a program a few years ago called the wheel program where we bring in somewhere between four and six people out of college and rotate them through six different departments over an month period then mutually settle on fulltime employment our retention rate in that program has been almost  percent and we have succeeded in meeting our diversity objectives for that program both in terms of women and people of color every year we truly have become the company that we want our kids to work at will there be a new framework for pricing in the market going forward and will we reach and exceed the pricing of some years back real estate professionals and developers are optimists by nature we have a natural governor though because of the cost and complexity of building so we’re going through this current cycle with a fairly limited amount of new construction do i think we will return to the heights we had reached yes is that going to be in the next year or two no but the environment in new york is healthy in addition our building stock is fairly old we still like to characterize ’s and ’s product as new so if you’ve made the decision that you want to be in a leedcertified building or you want the most modern technology you have very few choices here will the environmental focus be a given in future building it will be on any new multitenant building you would be foolish not to because there will be a portion of the market that will not consider that as an alternative where you are on that spectrum from green to gold to platinum is a little less significant but the corporate interest in sustainability will continue• click here to download a pdf of an interview with mitchell e rudin president and chief executive officer new york tristate
