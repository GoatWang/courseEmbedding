scenario larger than originally envisaged which with significant additional exploration upside offered by the companys prospective joint venture ground offers potential to potentially catalyze share

exploration upside bhakti pavani euro pacific canada  we are initiating coverage on mag silver corp with a buy rating  based on both the grade and scale the juanicipio deposit is by far the best undeveloped silver deposit in mexico  the exploration potential at the juanicipio property is significant eric zaunscherb canaccord genuity  mag silver corp recently revealed plans to develop juanicipio subject to a formal production decision expected in q  we focus on the potentially impactful q anticipating an expanded project resource a renewed mine plan capturing mineralization at depth and a positive production decision despite increased capital demands we believe that the company remains fully funded with m in working capital at the end of q heiko ihle rodman  renshaw  construction remains on schedule for mag silver corps juanicipio project and we anticipate first production by h although we had previously expected production by h we now expect the company and fresnillo to evaluate a larger throughput scenario of  tpd up from the current plans of  tpd we think the additional capital required to build the larger facility should be modest and the incremental time improves the nav of the project macquarie capital markets  mag silver corp potentially is on the cusp of justifying another expansion the company indicated that fresnillo decided to expand saucito once resources supported a year life at  ktpd this implies that once resources exceed  mt juanicipio may look to expand resources at valdecanas are  mt michael gray macquarie capital markets  mag silver corps peter megaw won the prospector of the year thayer lindsay award for the juanicipio agzbpbcu joint venture discovery in zacatecas state mexico this is one of the great precious metal discoveries since  and has led to the documentation of over  moz highgrade silver including ounces on partner fresnillos  ground michael gray macquarie capital markets  we see the geologic center of gravity for the district continuing to point towards mag silver corps juanicipio both in terms of endowment and high grades  the deep zone ag eq resource  increase to  moz is in line with our backoftheenvelope estimate  moz ag eq we are encouraged by the increase and see further potential within valdecanas and also other veins philip ker pi financial  mag silver corp recently announced very positive extension and infill assay results from drilling targeting highgrade mineralization from the deep zones of the valdecanas vein system  the successful discovery and continued delineation of highgrade mineralization at depth is rapidly changing the scope and potential of the project assays are demonstrating a significant increase in gold content at depth while intersecting attractive widths to support future bulk mining techniques joe reagor roth capital partners  on feb   mag silver corp announced additional drill results from its juanicipio joint venture we are encouraged by the continued expansion of the deposit and believe these drill will results will drive a significant resource estimate increase thus we are reiterating our buy rating heiko ihle rodman  renshaw  drilling at mag silver corps juanicipio during the ramp development has continued to return impressive results primarily at the projects deep zone  the discovery and development of the deep zone have the potential to be transformational for juanicipio  we think juanicipio could prove itself as not only a largescale highgrade silver asset with strong base metal credits but a project that has the potential to host a significant amount of gold  the project continues to outperform both construction and explorationrelated expectations�making juanicipio one of the leading developmentstage silver projects in the world chris thompson raymond james  mag silver corp announced another set of deep drill results from the valdeca�as vein on its juanicipio  jv project  a slowing of tonnage growth driven by a thinning of mineralization outside of dilation zones is offset by resource growth potential offered by new vein anticipada and the emergence of a gold rich zone  mag continues to offer investors multiple avenues to value accretion  drill results continue to support the prospectivity and size potential offered by juanicipio and mags rank as our top pick among silver developers andrew kaip bmo capital markets  mag silver corp provided an exploration update on  drill holes including  infill holes focused on expanding and defining the valdeca�as deep zone and new anticipada vein at the juanicipio project results continue to validate the emerging potential of both the deep zone and anticipada vein which remain open to further expansion  the deep zone and anticipada zones

in our view the best undeveloped precious metal asset in the world as located in the worldclass fresnillo silver district zacatecas state mexico  the stock posted a  return in  as driven by the increased silver price and the successful drilling at valdecanas deep  mag was our  pick amongst our developers in our  picking the winners report   mag continues to be an attractive takeover target in our view and we note fres owns  of mag independent investment research  the key standout of mag silver corps  owned juanicipio property is the bonanza zone indicated resource silver grade of gt and

highestgrade silver mine in the world and is fully funded to production it is a cheap option on the silver price with limited downside philip ker pi financial  mag silver corps recent pull back in valuation is offering investors what may be their last chance to enter into a position prior to further advancements at mags flagship juanicipio asset  mag silver and its jv partner fresnillo are charging ahead into  with solid advancements being made underground with ramp development and exciting exploration efforts which could significantly expand and augment the project production profile of the future operation  we continue to maintain our sh target price and have increased our rating to buy from neutral joe reagor roth capital partners  we believe mag silver corp has a number of potential catalysts lined up over the next few quarters   first management will provide an updated resource including an initial resource for valdecanas deeps early in   we expect management to provide an updated mine plan shortly after that although the valdecanas deeps has not yet been quantified into a resource we believe mag will include this zone in its revised mine plan as it represents a potential significant change in engineering and scale for the project  all of these pending catalysts should be positive  we are maintaining a buy rating and our target price of  the gold report interview with doug groh  mag silver corp seems to have a deposit that keeps on giving the companys joint venture with fresnillo has not only gained the markets attention but also its partners full attention every time i speak to the company the news gets better and better in august the company confirmed an extension of highgrade mineralization from the deep zone discovery on the juanicipio joint venture with fresnillo the deep valdeca�as vein now is offering further upside great grades great metal content interesting geology its strike length has now been reported as exceeding m to a depth of m to m beneath the current resource estimate mineralized widths range from m to m of highgrade multimetal zones including silver gold lead zinc and copper they report more consistent copper occurrences in the deeper levels it is an amazing discovery and geologically fascinating as well the deep zone discovery is still open in several directions and there is more to learn about the extent of that mineralization there appear to be several veins that make up the broader zone which has yet to be defined it is the type of discovery that is likely to be one of the best this decade if not beyond read more  joe reagor roth capital partners  on september   roth capital partners attended an analyst site visit to mag silver corps juanicipio project we came away impressed with both the exploration potential on the project as well as the potential to have reduced operating costs as compared to the projects pea  we are increasing our price target from  to  and upgrading from neutral

growth plans  the company offers significant fully funded production and cash flow growth potential unlocked through organic development  our operatingvaluation assumptions remain unchanged and we continue to rank mag as our favourite developer heiko ihle rodman  renshaw  we attended mag silver corps group analyst visit of the juanicipio asset outside of zacatecas mexico  we were impressed by the development progress made at juanicipio  we believe juanicipio has significant exploration potential  juanicipio is a worldclass asset operated by an experienced miner and the ma potential this provides  we reiterate our view that mag could eventually be taken out by a larger firm as juanicipio has proven itself to be a cornerstone asset with exceptional potential for further exploration

silver corp target price to c from c and our rating to speculative buy  our strengthened view follows a successful second site visit to the juanicipio jv in zacatecas mexico we believe that investors

part of ma chris thompson raymond james  mag silver continues to offer investors multiple avenues to value accretionunlocked by the current bullish sentiment surrounding precious metals silver in particular a nearterm e production opportunity and significant exploration upside  drill results continue to support resource growth potential offered at juanicipio and mag�s rank as our top pick amongst silver developers  our c target is derived by applying a x multiple our on minesite nav estimate for juanicipio which compares with our silver producer peer group trading at x nav  we believe this gap will narrow as mag moves towards producer status philip ker pi financial  mag silver corp announced they have approved a m budget to fund further exploration efforts to delineate the deep zone discovery which is presently ongoing with  drill rigs  drilling is demonstrating wide dilated zones of mineralization that remain open to depth and along strike within the outline of the jv property boundary  deep zone has sufficient grades to be economic and could provide significant mine life longevity to an already attractive world class deposit  given the growing nature of the deposit we are increasing our nav multiple from x to x and increasing our target price from sh to sh eric zaunscherb canaccord genuity  mag silver corp is the discoverer and owner of a  interest in the juanicipio silvergoldleadzinc project in fresnillo district mexico  our shortterm trading idea was predicated on mag�s release of potentially very catalytic drill results  the company recently completed a hole followup drill program on a new discovery made at depth in  results are expected by the end of july this discovery may change the way the entire fresnillo district is viewed and could if confirmed justify a second mining unit project  at juanicipio what experts predict for the new silver bull market gold report article  raymond james resumed coverage of mag silver corp as of july  we view the juanicipio project mag  as without doubt the best undeveloped silver asset globally our thesis for mag is reinforced quite simply by the exploration upside offered at juanicipio and elsewhere cinco de mayo and a lack of broader highquality silverfocused investible opportunities analyst chris thompson noted in the report we see mag trading at a developer discount to producers and primed to rerate catalyzed by development progress andor exploration success� raymond james also included mag on its list of preferred silver equities in its july  q precious metals preview read more  chris thompson raymond james  mag silver corp is a magnum opportunity for the silver aficionado  we are resuming coverage of mag silver with an op rating and c target we view the juanicipio project as without doubt the best undeveloped silver asset globally  mag offers investors multiple avenues to value accretion unlocked by the current bullish sentiment surrounding precious metals silver in particular a nearterm e production opportunity and significant exploration upside  mag is a clear stand out amongst our  primary silver assets under coverage eric zaunscherb canaccord genuity  we initiate coverage of mag silver corp with a ca target price and speculative buy rating  the story of juanicipio�s discovery david and goliath struggles a further discovery with imminent results and ultimate development is operatic in scope  the company is managed by a strong technical and financial management team this is reflected in a solid balance sheet and the lead project�s fully funded status  mag silver discovered one of the best undeveloped silver projects globally based on grade and scale  in the case of juanicipio mother nature has furnished a worldclass geological score joe reagor roth capital partners  we met with mag silvers ceo george paspalas at the  roth precious metals conference in new york city  after meeting with management we believe the market is pricing in a number of potential project growth opportunities as mvg has continued to derisk the project as a result we are increasing our price target from  to  while maintaining our buy rating  we believe mvg will continue to benefit from a rising silver price heiko ihle rodman  renshaw  mag silver corp announced q results during the quarter mag closed a  million equity financing which we believe provides the necessary capital to fully fund mag�s  share of juanicipio�s remaining capital costs notably the capital raise allowed the firm to exit the quarter with  million in cash�enough to cover remaining capital costs in addition to an approximate  million safeguard should unexpected increases in capital costs arise during the final stages of construction the gold report interview with joe reagor  we like mag silver corp because it has very highquality assets with a large number of silver ounces high grade in a good jurisdiction and has a solid management team with a proven track record if a company has those things then its in position to turn it into a worldclass producing asset  do you think mag being a silver company will get an extra push in light of silvers appreciation i think mag already has the company did raise some money earlier this year and it came out of that very strong the valuation has moved significantly higher since before the raise was announced i think that thats a demonstration of  the silver price outperformance of gold over the last month or two and  that the company is now in position to fund its share of its project if it isnt acquired before the development decision is announced its larger partner fresnillo has the power to make that development decision which we expect sometime this year but there is less risk for an investor now which was part of the reason for its outperformance in the last few months read more  heiko ihle rodman  renshaw  with closing the recent m capital raise mag silver corp now has a strong balance sheet consisting of m and no debt�allowing for continued advancement of the juanicipio project the capital raise serves as a significant derisking event for the firm there should be no need to raise additional capital once a formal production decision is made  continued exploration success at the property could significantly improve the already impressive resource base at the project  the economics of juanicipio could be greatly enhanced following the receipt of additional drilling results making the already robust project even more attractive david sadowski raymond james  mag silver corp successfully closed an oversubscribed bought deal equity financing for gross proceeds of m we estimate this raises the companys cash position to m sufficient to cover remaining preproduction capital requirements at the flagship owned juanicipio project in mexico as well as to fund further aggressive exploration philip ker pi financial  mag silver corp and its joint venture partner fresnillo have had their heads down focused on the underground development at juanicipio which continues to progress steadily with ramp development construction of the decline ramp is now over m in length and the joint venture partnership is beginning to evaluate its longer lead items for surface construction  we are increasing our target price from share to share and maintain our buy rating greg mccoach mining speculator  since recommending mag silver corp the company is now up almost  in a bad market just stick with the highest quality and when it comes to a great silver company mag is about as good at is gets most of this gain has been during a bad market and now well begin to see how higher silver prices will affect our share price the gold report interview with joe reagor  mag silver corp has a new discovery that is different from the bonanza zones that make up the existing pea and resource estimates at its juanicipio project in mexico a joint venture with fresnillo the intercepts so far on the new deposit tend to be closer to m thick versus perhaps m on the bonanza zones the grade tends to be a touch higher too in a sense it could be a second mine which demonstrates to fresnillo that there is upside beyond the juanicipio and the valdeca�as veins and leaves some meat on the bone for a potential acquirer also as we mentioned earlier we like companies that are nearing construction decisions and mag silver is roughly six months away from making one  under the joint venture agreement fresnillo cant make a hostile bid to acquire mag silver it would need to make a friendly offer i dont expect any tension in the relationship created by the upside of that deposit  theres going to be an updated pea that will include an additional resource and a rework of the mine model which should show improved economics even with flat gold and silver prices by the middle of  mag silver should have all the necessary permits to break ground on construction mag silver was responsible for  of the m capital budget originally estimated for the project that should come down in the new pea given the money already spent to date the next step after the pea is a construction decision read more  chris thompson raymond james  we highlight mag silver corp fortuna silver mines and tahoe resources as defensive choices reflective of our view that  will be challenged by continued lackluster metal price performance  mag silver continues to rank as our top developer pick in the silver sector given its standout economically robust project  mag silver and tahoe resources rank favorably given their low operating cost structure high margin and strong balance sheets philip ker pi financial  mag silver corp and its joint venture partner fresnillo continue to move ahead through construction of its juanicipio project furthermore anticipation is mounting for commencement of follow drilling on a previously announced discovery at depth at juanicipio where drills have recently begun to turn once again gwen preston resource maven  mag silver corp is one silver name that interests me the company is looking ahead to production at its juanicipio project in zacatecas state a developing mine that is a joint venture with  owner fresnillo three highgrade silverleadzinc veins will provide the initial mill feed but the exploration upside at juanicipio is substantial the probability of more�and better�ore below the current deposit is high�fresnillos faith that the mine will end up bigger and better than planned shines through in the majors decision to build a much bigger ramp than the current mine plan requires heiko ihle rodman  renshaw  on dec   mag silver corp announced the completion of its phase  drilling program at the salamandra property  the company has fulfilled the cam requirement for the initial  earnin option on the property with a final cak final option payment due by may   in our view given its expertise in relation to carbonate replacement deposits and presence of mineralization at salamandra we expect the final earnin payment to be made by mag kevin mackenzie salman partners  we may see an associated pullback in the price of mag silver corp as the result of the burst pipeline at the saucito mine given that the juanicipio project  mag silver  fresnillo is located immediately adjacent we view any associated pullback in the price of mag as an attractive opportunity to buy  we maintain our buy recommendation on the company with a target price of cashare heiko ihle rodman  renshaw  on nov  mag silver corp announced q results  we believe the current cash balance should be sufficient to support activities for the next year  in addition to advancing the decline exploration efforts at juanicipio are beginning to uncover what could be a vast longerterm grade improvement  we view juanicipio as one of the highestgrade undeveloped silver deposits in the world and believe recent drill results have the potential to uncover further potential and mine life for the site david sadowski raymond james  on friday mag silver corp released q results which provided a number of corporate and operational highlights including on its flagship owned juanicipio in mexico  we urge investors to bolster positions in the companys stock our analyst current favorite and top precious metals developer pick we believe the currently depressed share price does not reflect the true potential of deeps let alone the main valdecanas bonanza grade silver zone which could double mine plan throughputs and extend mine life we model first ounces produced at lowestdecile cash costs in early  the gold report interview with markus bachmann  mag silver corp is actually not in production yet but it is a scarcity story because its one of the best silver projects around mag silver has a very strong joint venture partner and a lot of exploration upside you can have an agnostic view on silver and that company will do well if you have a more constructive outlook on silver that company has the potential to do very well we like companies that have that special touch mag silver is one of them read more  the gold report interview with john hathaway  mag silver corp has a tremendous suite of silverrich assets in mexico one of which is a joint venture with fresnillo the worlds largest silver producer its hard to imagine that at some point fresnillo doesnt want to take over mag for that asset however mags strong shareholder base including tocqueville wont let that happen at too low a price the dice are loaded for a deal and for a big move in the silver price which could come on the heels of a big move in the gold price i think mag is one of the best pure silver stories out there read more  john bridges jp morgan  mag silver corp was excited about the progress at the juanicipio jv  which it called a boxticker with its partner fresnillo plc  seen as a great executor of projects fresnillo also separately in its presentation shared its positive view about development of this project juanicipio is a year minelife silver project with an impressive expected allin sustaining costs of oz the gold report interview with david morgan  we have followed mag silver corp for a very long time in fact before anyone even knew the name i was given a preview to the company by dr peter megaw mag chief exploration officer whom i consider a friend and mentor mag silver has two projects in the mexican silver belt the valdecanas and juanicipio properties the company did get into a problem with joint venture partner fresnillo plc which has been straightened out you dont need to look much further than mag silver if youre really a silver bull to put something in your portfolio that i think for the longer term will certainly do well read more  philip ker pi financial  given the state of the sector we believe the most attractive mergers and acquisitions target would be mag silver corp it possesses a strong balance sheet m is well funded in the near term to support its capex requirements and its juanicipio joint venture project is well underway into the construction phase with  years remaining  therefore we believe now is the time to increase our nav multiple from x to x in line with the more recent acquisition premiums kevin mackenzie salman partners  we see further potential upside to our target price on mag silver corp and therefore maintain our current buy recommendation  if followup drilling of valdecanas deep supports the greater exploration thesis then we could see a material increase to our applied exploration credit  with reference to the rampup of fresnillos adjacent saucito ii mine which is focused on mining the strike extension of the valdecanas vein it is clear that there exists the potential to reduce the  juanicipio pea opex assumptions heiko ihle rodman  renshaw  on august  mag silver corp announced q results the company is currently focused on the continued ramp advancement at its flagship highgrade juanicipio project which is being undertaken by mags jointventure partner fresnillo mag ended the quarter with m cash which we believe is sufficient to fund the companys planned activities for at least the next year  during h we expect the focus to remain on driving ramp development at juanicipio in addition to increasing the focus on exploring the newly discovered deeper zone which we think has the potential to significantly increase resources at the site the gold report interview with jeff mosseri and doug loud  we still like mag silver corp  what

silver production more the first  years at close to zero cash costs at  silver they will have  million in cash flow for  years the zero costs are from offsets in gold zinc and lead juanicipio is very high grade  to  opt and a high silver recovery rate  the capex is only  million and fresnillo will pay for  and is the operator mags share of the capex is  million and they have  million in cash they
