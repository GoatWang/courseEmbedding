market and has no market penetration to date once we have entered the market we will be one of many participants in the business of human translation service many established yet well financed entities are currently active in the business of providing such services nearly all petrichor corps competitors have significantly greater financial resources technical expertise and managerial capabilities than petrichor corp we are consequently at a competitive disadvantage in being able to provide such services and become a successful company in the webbased human translation service therefore petrichor corp may not be able to establish itself within the industry at all while we have plans for marketing and sales there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful there can be no assurance that our proposed services will gain wide acceptance in its target market or that we will be able to effectively market our services additionally we are a newlyformed development stage company with no prior experience in our industry we are entirely dependent on the services of our sole officer and director liudmila shokhina to build our customer base our company has no prior experience which it can rely upon in order to garner its first prospective customers to use our cervices company description petrichor corp was incorporated in the state of nevada on january   we have minimal assets and have incurred losses since inception we are a developmentstage company formed to commence operations in the business of webbased human translation as of today we have registered our company developed our business plan and registered a domain name for our web site petrichor corp hopes to position itself to take full advantage of the fast growing internet industry it is our intent to have our web site completed within the next  months after completing our public offering it is our desire to represent webbased human translation service on our website our concept would allow anyone who has a mobile devise or computer and access to the internet to send us documents for translation from different languages however there is no assurance that our website and our business will be ever developed and our potential customers will use our human translation service  petrichor corp is onlineonly translation company we plan to provide ondemand humantranslation services to businesses individuals and enterprises webbased human translation is generally favored by companies and individuals that wish to secure more accurate translations in view of the frequent inaccuracy of machine translations we believe that human translation remains the most reliable most accurate form of translation available while not instantaneous like its machine counterparts such as google translate and yahoo babel fish webbased human translation has been gaining popularity by providing relatively fast accurate translation for business communications legal documents medical records and software localization webbased human translation also appeals to private website users and bloggers to process any translation human or automated the meaning of a text in the original source language must be fully restored in the target language ie the translation while on the surface this seems straightforward it is far more complex translation is not a mere wordforword substitution a translator must interpret and analyze all of the elements in the text and know how each word may influence another this requires extensive expertise in grammar syntax sentence structure semantics meanings etc in the source and target languages as well as familiarity with each local region with the emergence of many pc and webbased translation applications commonly known as machine translation it is no longer difficult to translate documents or websites from one language into another however just because something is easy does not necessarily make it the best option most of the world’s languages have evolved over time and as such there are occasions when an exact conversion of a single word or phrase from one language to another is not possible it is in these circumstances that the machine translation software will fall short using rules rather than judgment or equations instead of expertise we intend to build our freelancer translation team to be able to translate different languages both from english and into english to insure quality translation we plan to hire translators that worked as a professional translator for over  years our goal is using technology to offer quality speed and value translation of different documents from different languages our planed turnaround time for translation is  hours depending on the language and page count we plan to develop our website in rdth month after completion of this offering our website will allow our potential customers to choose the languages for translation upload the files for translation and pay the order online after the order is placed the document is reviewed and a translator with relevant expertise will begin carefully working on the order the work will be then double checked for accuracy and the final product will be sent back in an email  we maintain our statutory registered agents office at  corporate circle suite  henderson nevada  our business office is located at  collins ave ste  sunny isles beach fl
