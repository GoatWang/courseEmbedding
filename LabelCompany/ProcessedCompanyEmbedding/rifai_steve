shelley george presents… a little look at factors affecting pr skip to content homeabout me case studies pr insights ← should brands use foursquare asda smart price valentine’s day stunt → steve jobs product vs personality posted on october   by shelley makes as the world comes to terms with the passing of apple founder and former ceo steve jobs many writers and analysts are remembering the man who helped shape a generation and indeed an era through the medium of technology renowned for his ‘visionary and creative genius’ and for creating products that are synonymous with modern day life many are asking what the legendary steve jobs has taught us about marketing well i wanted to join the discussion by taking a little look at what steve jobs has taught me for me steve jobs is synonymous with the brand apple when i think of apple i think of steve jobs do i myself own any apple products no but do i like the brand yes the truth is – for me apple does not only represent the end products – ipads ipods itunes iphones – but also a sense of style and the sense of an astute overarching personality a brand identity if you will tantamount to ‘the cool kid’ in school who always has the latest greatest gadgets ready to thrill surprise and enthral we have all seen clips of steve jobs proudly presenting his new creations in front of a branded backdrop teasing his audience with fanciful treats new launches and the expectation of more to come – almost like the willy wonka of the technological world proud to be different proud to be better proud to be back he is a person so synonymous with his brand that fans created a logo after his passing which encapsulates this inseparable association between man and brand i am sure all will agree that it is an unbreakable association and will be a part of a lasting legacy as apple state on their homepage ‘his spirit will forever be the foundation of apple’ so what can we learn from this to me it is a warning against faceless corporations and a reminder of the importance of maintaining a personable and consistent brand identity consumers look not just to products but to people and jobs was the finest ambassador of his work – the pièce de résistance if you will leading both the product and the consumer to their shared playing field like the pied piper whilst most companies leave pr to their agencies jobs understood the importance of his own recommendation he was the key spokesperson the frontman without him would we have been so excited about apple products do other ceos share their excitement about new launches so openly do they lead us on a journey jobs has also taught us to take risks to lead technology products and markets into new territory to revamp existing products and to make them beautiful and he has shown us that it is possible to take the nation by the hand to this brave new land as well as his brands pixar and apple jobs will be remembered as a person for his enthusiasm his intelligence his creativity and pizazz but also his advice it goes a long way to explaining how this unseeming man with his harrypotteresque glasses cast a spell over us all at a presentation for stanford university jobs encouraged graduates to view life as a giant dottodot whereby everything you learn and everything you pursue or accomplish becomes a dot within the larger picture creating the premise of your future he states “you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future you have to trust in something – your gut destiny life karma whatever because believing that your dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart even when it leads you off the well worn path and that will make all the difference” he also said “your time is limited so don’t waste it living someone else’s life don’t be trapped by dogma which is living with the results of other people’s thinking don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice and most important have the courage to follow your heart and intuition – they somehow already know what you truly want to become everything else is secondary” in conclusion and to acknowledge that we all have a lot to learn from steve jobs albeit about marketing or about living i will leave you with jobs’ final parting advice “stay hungry stay foolish” advertisements tweet

know one of the things that really hurt apple was after i left john sculley got a very serious disease it’s the disease of thinking that a really great idea is  of the work and if you just tell all these other people “here’s this great idea” then of course they can go off and make it happen and the problem with that is that there’s just a tremendous amount of craftsmanship in between a great idea and a great product and as you evolve that great idea it changes and grows it never comes out like it starts because you learn a lot more as you get into the subtleties of it and you also find there are tremendous tradeoffs that you have to make there are just certain things you can’t make electrons do there are certain things you can’t make plastic do or glass do or factories do or robots do designing a product is keeping five thousand things in your brain and fitting them all together in new and different ways to get what you want and every day you discover something new that is a new problem or a new opportunity to fit these things together a little differently and it’s that process that is the magic” this really captures the awesome part of product design for me it’s the part you can’t put into words…the problem that gets in your head and doesn’t go away the creative part that you can’t capture in a process and the discovery part is crucial here…the discoveries you make along the way that you couldn’t have foreseen at the beginning…those are as much a part of the fun as anything else there are many types of people in the world some live to make money some live to get stuff done some live to look good to others some live to solve problems like these published february nd  currently working on what to wear daily be prepared for your day a daily email that delivers

views the iphone  and apple watch double launch may have put some minds at rest but apple is undeniably still struggling to shake off lingering pessimism regarding its future—countless column inches having been dedicated to assessments of the companys mojo and conclusions on whether it can be regained in a postjobs era time of course will be the judge but the recent ios update withdrawal celebgate icloud scandal and even the astronomical beats buyout are all reminders painful for the most fanatic that things have not quite been the same since the untimely departure of steverecorded in  and released in  steve job the lost interview full video shows the thenousted visionary offering a striking summation of how technology giants like ibm and xerox lost their foothold at the height of their success this clip from the interview is now of course making rounds with the suggestion that jobss analysis bears striking relevance regarding the current state of his former companyin this part of the interview jobs offers a stark warning to technology giants—or perhaps indeed any other manufacturer service provider or brand— who could be accused of resting on their laurels putting too much faith in the powers of sales and marketing the story may sound all too familiar to inhouse designers struggling to make an impactcompanies forget what it takes to make great products the product sensibility the product genius that brought them to this monopolistic position is rotted out the people running these companies then have no conception of a good product versus a bad product theyve got no conception of the craftsmanship thats required to take a good idea and turn it into a good product they really have no feeling in their heart about wanting to really help the customersthe writing may not be on the wall but rather the retina display whether apple can reassert their strength is yet to be seen but any revival is sure to dovetail with the reinstatement of product people at

idealized the past report as spam jotham mcmillan  years ago z z reply there are many ways in which apple may fall but not for most of the reasons that people focus on i think the majority of random prognosticators forget two main points that define apples strategy as well as amazon netflix google etc  they are not product companies any longer nor do they wish to be they are ecosystem companies they release products that may not be apparent wins or may address a niche market but are part of an ecosystem strategy see apple tv google glass amazon fire tablets  they have a long term view of the ecosystem battle much like netflix and amazon spending like crazy to grow marketshare google giving away android and free gmail apple creating their own maps program purchasing beats they are doing this for the long haul focusing on glitches along the way means you are ignoring their overarching strategy where a few glitches are consider an acceptable loss lastly steve jobs wasnt perfect he made frequent decisions that didnt pan out or initially looked bad however for better or for worse he had an essential belief in his own taste that allowed him to keep pushing forward despite apparent failures he often was able to take a great idea with mediocre execution and eventually turn it into a great idea with great execution he was stubborn the evidence that ive seen is the short term thinkers like steve forstall have been forced out and only the collaborative longterm thinkers are being groomed and they are all very quiet about their plans because they would rather the competition
