modern portfolio theory which is the cornerstone of portfolio management  when constructing a client portfolio our primary consideration is effective asset class utilization followed by strategic sector allocation and finally individual security selection  each step in our process is made within a welldefined disciplined framework that maintains independence while emphasizing quality and relative valuation  generally client portfolios will be well diversified holding reasonably valued securities issued by domestic and internationalcompanies with strong and improving fundamentals  our
