investing real estate website wwwrealtysharescom about realtyshares founded by nav athwal realtyshares is a crowdfunding website for real estate developments that claims to help you diversify your portfolio and invest in prescreened and professionally managed residential commercial retail and mixeduse projects not only does realtyshares claim to help you purchase shares in private real estate investments but the company also claims to help companies access a new source of funding to raise capital for their investments how does realtyshares claim to work by now you’re almost certainly familiar with crowdfunding sites like kickstarter indiegogo gofundme and boostercom which help people raise money for their business ventures and personal needs using these websites all you have to do is list your project and if other people are interested in helping you out they can contribute as much money as they’re comfortable with recently though a new era of crowdfunding has entered the market with websites like realtyshares which claims to serve two primary purposes  to help accredited investors invest in a variety of real estate projects and  help companies fund their real estate projects without having to go through traditional banks or other large lenders since coming online in late  realtyshares has garnered quite a lot of media attention having been featured on the wall street journal forbes cnn money business times and more due in no small part to their claimed focus on helping individuals invest in real estate projects from their living rooms and giving them everything they need to invest intelligently in short realtyshares acts as a centralized area where companies who need funds for their private real estate projects can meet with investors who are willing to purchase shares in these projects and according to the company they give you the ability to make real estate investments in  simple steps sign up for a realtyshares account browse investments securely if you find one you’re interested in you’ll then be able to access a detailed page explaining the offering including “financials property information legal and financial documents and investment manager bios” finalize your investment directly through the realtyshares website the company even claims all documents can be signed electronically using docusign and funds can be transferred via balanced next each investment comes with a specific funding goal that must be met before you officially own a share while you’re waiting for this to occur your money will be held in an fdic insured escrow account and if this goal isn’t reached then  of your money will be refunded all realtyshares members have access to a personalized dashboard where you can monitor your investments and returns and manage your documents you’ll also receive quarterly updates about the project via email and tax documents are provided once per year you’ve worked diligently over the years to make smart investment decisions and this new breed of real estate crowdfunding websites has piqued your interest but you’re wondering if they’re ultimately worth your time or are just a passing fad after all you invest carefully and aren’t in the habit of losing your hardearned money but is realtyshares a company that you can count on to help you make wise investment decisions consider the following you have options when it comes to real estate investing first and foremost if you’re thinking about using a real estate crowdfunding website keep in mind that realtyshares isn’t your only option as other sites such as fundrise realty mogul crowdstreet collaperty and many more are vying for your business with this said according to realtyshares’ ceo the company differentiates itself from other real estate crowdfunding websites by offering lower fees complete transparency a seamless investment process and access to a wider range of investment opportunities how much risk are you willing to take on next like any other type of investment real estate projects come with a certain level of risk so you’re not guaranteed to make any money in fact in a worstcase scenario you could end up losing your entire investment also remember that real estate investments are not liquid which means that your money might be tied up for long periods of time as such you’ll need to thoroughly vet any investment you’re thinking about becoming involved with it realtyshares’ investor guidelines if you’re thinking about investing in a real estate project featured on realtyshares the most important thing you need to know is that you must be qualified as an accredited investor according to the realtyshares faq this means you must be “a natural person with  a net worth or joint net worth with the person’s spouse exceeding  million not including the value of the primary residence and  or  annual income of  in each of the two most recent years or joint income with a spouse exceeding  for those years and a reasonable expectation of the same income in the current year” on top of this you must have a minimum of  to contribute to a project although some investments may go as low as  there is no maximum investment amount and you can even qualify as a foreign investor realtyshares’ investment options if you qualify as an investor you’ll have two options debt investment and equity investment debt investment means that your contribution funds a loan for the company who’s responsible for the project and depending on your level of investment your portion of the money earned from monthly interest charges will be deposited into your account on the other hand an equity investment pays a percentage of cash flow from rent on a monthly basis or on the profits if the project is sold regardless of the type each investment will come with its own ‘hold period” which references the expected amount of time that will pass before investors recoup their money after a project has been paid off or sold this information will be available on the project’s investment overview page and can last anywhere from less than  months to more than  years realtyshares’ company guidelines according to the company’s website realtyshares only provides loans eg debt investments for  unit residential properties and some commercial properties such as apartment buildings specifically the website’s faq states projects must be cashflowingvalueadd equity investments in commercial and residential properties such as apartments retail office and pools of single family homes equity investments in fix  flips located in high demandlow supply markets loans secured by residential and commercial real estate on top of this borrowers must have a minimum  credit score a loan to purchase price of less than  and an “estimated loan to after repair value once the property is rehabbed less than ” as such the realtyshares will not work for construction or groundup development projects on top of this realtyshares claims to closely screen all new projects prior to being listed including background and credit checks comps projected returns geography property type and quality investment structure a knowledgeable team and a proven track record although realtyshares doesn’t guarantee successful funding the company claims that most projects listed are funded within  days however for any projects listed on realtyshares companies will not be able to advertise them elsewhere in order to remain in compliance with regulation d rule b finally realtyshares’ funding methods are claimed to help you focus on operating the investment instead of communicating with numerous investors since all funds are pooled into a single llc the difference between realtyshares  reits when compared to reits real estate investment trusts realtyshares claims to give investors the ability to choose the specific type of property or groups of properties they’d like to invest in whereas reits traditionally only allow you to invest in specific asset classes or projects based on geography in addition realtyshares claims to charge substantially lower fees than reits we’ll talk more about this in a moment what are other investors saying about realtyshares realtyshares inc has only been in business since late  and there were no individual reviews available online at the time of our research however most professional reviews from large websites such as forbes and techcrunch seem to be favorable not just for realtyshares but for the growth of the real estate crowdfunding industry in general realtyshares pricing realtyshares is free to sign up for an account whether you’re an individual looking to invest or a company looking for funding however according to the company’s faq they “will charge a fee to cover ongoing investor reporting and communications for the investment” although the specific fee for each investment can vary and will be outlined in the project’s operating agreement after a project has been funded the money is pooled and moved into an individual llc which is the entity that will actually provide the loan or hold equity in the investment as such you will be a shareholder in this llc compared to many other real estate crowdfunding websites realtyshares accepts bitcoin for investments either through coinbase or your bitcoin address although distributions will be paid in us dollars in order to ask questions about fees payments or anything else you can contact realtyshares’ customer service department at  can realtyshares help you wisely diversify your investment portfolio chopping to the point considering the fact that realtyshares has received a fair amount of positive media attention that the real estate crowdfunding industry is in a growth phase and that there aren’t any negative online reviews for the company they appear to be a solid choice for purchasing shares in real estate projects have you invested in any projects

helpful duping investors by nikhil katy tx nov   verified reviewer i invested two years ago in few offerings and so far everything is in deep red triwest who sponsored  blairwood dr   chalon rd investment and paragon who sponsored  gilbert road have stopped making payments they have given lame excuses for delays they are running a ponzi scheme to dupe investors and realtyshares did not do any due diligence before offering this deal and luring investors dont get caught in this poor dealings bottom line no i would not recommend this to a friend help others find the most helpful reviews was this review helpful yes no comments  view all  commentshide comments may   ted triwest certainly has been a disaster fortunately they managed to sell the property i had investments in and made some money but nothing like their claimed return even though the property sold for more than the original financial estimate i agree that realtyshares does minimal due diligence what is shocking is you cant get access to the agreement with the sponsor only the realtyshares llc you are investing in so the real terms and conditions arent available they are also easy to dupe they did an investment that claimed it would put no debt on the property and the sponsor secretly went to another website and got another big loan on the property while claiming it was unencumbered realtyshares has been almost completely unresponsive to emails about issues but they certainly keep sending out emails about new opportunities a strong buyer beware not only does realityshares do little to no due diligence but they make it impossible for you to do so either go ahead and ask if the sponsor has other projects at realityshares and they wont answer i went back to making my own hard money loans so i have access to the property the borrower and can track things closely do you have an account log in before commenting if you don’t have an account – don’t worry you can create it after  name email  your

people dont have much experience with this specific concept my experience has been very positive realtyshares has been very professional and responsible any real estate project has risks by default but i have had no issues after making more than  investments using the realtyshares platform realtyshares does a great job screening prospective deal sponsors because of that projects that might include underfunded developers crackpots slackers or sponsors who are challenged with planning and organization get screened out before any deal is offered on the platform the returnrisk equation has seemed promising to me on the vast majority of the deals offered i would  and have  recommended realtyshares to good friends bottom line yes i would recommend this to a friend help others find the
