nasdaqgalt the leading developer of therapeutics that target galectin proteins to treat fibrosis and cancer about galectin therapeutics nasdaq galt galectin therapeutics is a biotechnology company focused on discovery and development we apply our leadership in galectin science and drug development to create new therapies for fibrotic disease and cancer search search for the patent portfolio strategy behind grmd posted on   by dr peter traber  in article   comments by peter g traber md on march   we often talk about how galectin therapeutics’ proprietary compound grmd is protected by a strong intellectual property portfolio i thought it might be useful to drill a little more deeply into that statement our patent portfolio is an important asset for galectin therapeutics and it took hard and careful work to put it in place each patentpatent application is a strategic building block which reflects present and future business objectives and protects current core technology the galectin therapeutics’ patent portfolio covers the products or composition of matter ie active pharmaceutical ingredient or api formulations of the products use of the products and methods of manufacturing the most valuable patent in the galectin therapeutics’ portfolio is a composition of matter patent which covers the active pharmaceutical ingredient composition patents exclude others from making using selling or offering for sale the api  patenting complex carbohydrates can be more challenging than for a small molecule galectin therapeutics’ proprietary compound grmd is derived from the modification of a natural pectin pectins are widely used in the food industry as a thickening agent for making things such as jellies and jams there are a substantial number of patents on using pectin in pharmaceutical applications galectin therapeutics had to show that grmd was novel and nonobvious in view of the prior pectin art grmd is a complex carbohydrate molecule a small molecule with a small molecular weight eg  da in comparison can have a very specific structure and the us patent and trademark office uspto can then compare the molecule to a chemical database to assess if the compound is different than publically available compounds grmd on the other hand is a mixture of complex carbohydrates having an average molecular weight between  to  da these are big molecules this means that galectin therapeutics had to take a slightly different approach to characterizing the molecule in its patent applications grmd can be defined by its physical and chemical properties such as the average molecular weight the carbohydrate composition the ratio of critical carbohydrates from one to the other and a twodimensional nmr to establish a “fingerprint” of the molecule one of the most critical carbohydrates in grmd is galactose and grmd can be characterized by the ratio between galactose and arabinose grmd can be characterized by its degree of methoxylation — or the amount of methyl groups on the backbone of the molecule galectin therapeutics was awarded a composition of matter patent in the us on grmd us patent  entitled “compositions of novel carbohydrate drug for treatment of human diseases” the us patent issued on october   and will expire in  protecting not just the molecule but also its manufacture and its use beyond the composition of matter patent for grmd stands a portfolio of other patents that strengthen galectin therapeutics’ patent portfolio galectin therapeutics holds a process patent that covers the manufacture grmd from the pectin us patent no  presumably a similar process has to be used to manufacture a drug similar to grmd and having the process patented adds a second layer of protection to the compound as well galectin therapeutics also has  different patent families that cover the methods of use these support the various indications for grmd that galectin therapeutics plans to test method of use patents exclude others for using the api in specific indications galectin therapeutics has a method of use us patent for nash us patent no  galectin therapeutics has a method of use patent for kidney disease specifically diabetic nephropathy as well as other similar types of glomerulopathy that patients develop not necessarily related to diabetes us patent no  we also have a method of use patent application allowed for pulmonary fibrosis as well as method of use us patents covering liver fibrosis kidney fibrosis and heart fibrosis patents pending galectin therapeutics has more than  patent applications pending there are a number of method of use patents pending in both cancer immunotherapy and other disease states the method of use patents and applications strengthen the patent portfolio and protect galectin therapeutics for future business objectives foreign patents galectin therapeutics has filed for patent protection in  foreign countries which are viewed are significant market for the api or the manufacture of the api australia brazil canada china europe israel japan korea mexico and south africa  the us patent process generally moves more quickly than the rest of the world and issuance of patents in the us can be helpful to expedite prosecution in foreign countries these “ceo perspectives” are a regular feature of our communication activities and may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of   these statements relate to future events and use words such as “may” “might” “could” “expect” and others these statements include those regarding the hope that galectin therapeutic’ s development program for grmd will show that it can be both safe and effective when used in combination with other drugs for the treatment of patients with cancer for a discussion of additional factors impacting galectin’s business see the company’s annual report on form k for the year ended december   and

screen for antiviral inhibitors of the alphavirus rna capping enzyme   abstract intestinal epithelia cells express unique gene products which enable the intestine to perform specialized tasks including the absorption and processing of nutrients enterocyte function varies during development along the length of the intestinal tract horizontal axis along the cryptvillus unit vertical axis in response to physiological stimuli and in disease states this complex pattern of function is directly related in many cases to the pattern of expression of intestinespecific genes that encode proteins which perform those functions little is known about the molecular mechanisms which regulate patterns of intestine specific gene transcription or intestinal epithelial cell development and differentiation in this proposal sucraseisomaltase si will be used as a model gene to probe the molecular mechanisms which regulate enterocyte specific gene transcription si has been chosen because it is enterocyte specific expressed at moderately high levels has a complex pattern of developmental and adult expression is altered in physiological and disease states and is expressed in intestinal tumor cell lines which enables in vitro experimental approaches the reagents required for these studies have been developed including human and mouse si cdnas and genomic clones containing the flanking regions of both the human and mouse si genes transfection experiments have demonstrated that the human si gene contains elements capable of directing intestinespecific transcription an transgenic mice containing a human si gene construct have been made therefore the goals of this proposal are  to identify dna regulatory regions in the si gene and the corresponding sequencespecific nuclear binding proteins which are necessary to direct efficient enterocyte specific transcription and  to determine which dna regulatory regions are required to recapitulate the spatial horizontal and vertical and developmental patterns of si gene expression in adult tissues using transgenic mice the experiments outlined in this proposal use a multifaceted approach to provide detailed information on the regulation of si gene transcription elucidation of transcriptional mechanisms for tissuespecific genes in other tissues has led to identification of dna binding proteins which direct cellspecific transcription and are important for cellular differentiation and proliferation thus si dna elements andor nuclear binding proteins may participate in the regulation of multiple intestinal genes in the process of differentiation and development or serve to regulate proliferation the anticipated result of these studies will be a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms which regulate intestinal gene expression development and differentiation   funding agency agencynational institute of health nih institutenational institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney
