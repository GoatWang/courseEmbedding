reduce our concentration in atlanta georgia measured by dollars invested to not more than  of the portfolio        we plan to achieve our objectives by selling our oldest and least competitively located properties and we may also consider selling joint venture interests in some of our core properties or selectively converting some of these properties to forsale condominium housing we expect

reduced the number of markets where we operate from thirteen to nine and we may exit one or more additional markets in the future if we do not believe we can achieve critical mass within a reasonable period of time we may also consider entering new markets in the future s table of contents        key elements of our investment and acquisition strategy include instilling a disciplined team approach

receipts upon surrender of the depositary receipts held by such holder such number of whole shares of preferred stock as are represented by the depositary shares evidenced by such depositary receipts together with any other property held by such preferred stock depositary with respect to such depositary receipts post will agree that if a deposit agreement is terminated to preserve its status as a reit then post will use its best efforts to list the preferred stock issued upon surrender of the related depositary shares on a national securities exchange charges of depositary       post will pay all transfer and other taxes and governmental charges arising solely from the existence of the depositary arrangements post will pay associated charges of the depositary for the initial deposit of the preferred stock and any redemption of the preferred stock holders of depositary shares will pay transfer and other taxes and governmental charges and any other charges that are stated to be their responsibility in the deposit agreement resignation and removal of depositary       the depositary may resign at any time by delivering notice to us post may also remove the depositary at any time resignations or removals will take effect upon the appointment of a successor depositary and its acceptance of the appointment the successor depositary must be appointed within  days after delivery of the notice of resignation or removal and must be a bank or trust company having its principal office in the united states and having a combined capital and surplus of at least  million miscellaneous       post will forward to the holders of depositary shares all reports and communications that it must furnish to the holders of the preferred stock       neither the depositary nor post will be liable if the depositary is prevented or delayed by law or any circumstance beyond its control in performing its obligations under the deposit agreement posts obligations and the depositarys obligations under the deposit agreement will be limited to performance in good faith of duties set forth in the deposit agreement neither the depositary nor post will be obligated to prosecute or defend any legal proceeding connected with any depositary shares or preferred stock unless satisfactory indemnity is furnished to us andor the depositary post and the depositary may rely upon written advice of counsel or  table of contents accountants or information provided by persons presenting preferred stock for deposit holders of depositary shares or other persons believed to be competent and on documents believed to be genuine restrictions on ownership       as discussed above under description of common stock  restrictions on transfer for post to qualify as a reit under the code not more than  in value of its outstanding capital shares may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals as defined in the code to include certain entities during the last half of a taxable year to assist post in meeting this requirement post may take certain actions to limit the beneficial ownership directly or indirectly by a single person of posts outstanding equity securities including any preferred stock of post therefore the certificate of designations for each series of preferred stock underlying the depositary shares may contain provisions restricting the ownership and transfer of the preferred stock the deposit agreement may contain similar provisions the applicable prospectus supplement will specify any additional ownership limitation relating to a series of preferred stock and any depositary shares  table of contents federal income tax considerations introductory notes       this discussion summarizes the material federal income tax considerations under current law that may be relevant to a prospective holder of the securities it is not exhaustive of all possible tax considerations and does not give a detailed discussion of any state local or foreign tax considerations it also does not discuss all of the aspects of federal income taxation that may be relevant to a prospective holder of securities in light of his particular circumstances or to certain types of holders including insurance companies taxexempt entities financial institutions or brokerdealers foreign corporations and persons who are not citizens or residents of the united states who are subject to special treatment under the federal income tax laws as used in this section the term post refers solely to post properties inc       each prospective purchaser is advised to consult with his or her own tax advisor regarding the specific tax consequences to him or her of the purchase ownership and sale of securities in an entity electing to be taxed as a real estate investment trust including the federal state local foreign and other tax consequences of such purchase ownership sale and election and of potential changes in applicable tax laws qualification and taxation of post as a reit       post has made an election to be taxed as a reit under sections  through  of the code effective for its short taxable year ending on december   posts qualification and taxation as a reit depends upon posts ability to meet on a continuing basis through actual annual operating results distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership the various qualification tests and organizational requirements imposed under the code as discussed below post believes that it is organized and has operated in such a manner as to qualify under the code for taxation as a reit commencing with its  taxable year and post intends to continue to operate in such a manner no assurance however can be given that post will operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a reit see failure to qualify below       in the opinion of king  spalding post met the requirements for qualification and taxation as a reit for its taxable years ended december   through  and its current and proposed method of operation should enable it to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a reit this opinion is based on various assumptions relating to the organization and operation of post post apartment homes and the partnerships and limited liability companies in which post apartment homes owns or has owned an interest and is conditioned upon certain representations made by post as to certain relevant factual matters relating to the organization and expected manner of operation of post post apartment homes and their subsidiaries king  spalding is not aware of any facts or circumstances that are inconsistent with these assumptions and representations moreover such qualification and taxation as a reit will depend upon posts ability to meet on a continuing basis through actual annual operating results distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership the various qualification tests imposed under the code discussed below king  spalding will not review compliance with these tests on a continuing basis no assurance can be given that post will satisfy such tests on a continuing basis see failure to qualify below       the sections of the code relating to qualification and operation as a reit are highly technical and complex the following discussion sets forth certain material aspects of the code sections that govern the federal income tax treatment of a reit and its shareholders the discussion is qualified in its entirety by the applicable code provisions treasury regulations promulgated thereunder and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof all of which are subject to change prospectively or retroactively       so long as post continues to qualify for taxation as a reit it generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax on its net income that is distributed currently to its shareholders that treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation ie taxation at both the corporate and shareholder levels that generally results from investment in a corporation however post will be subject to federal income tax in the following circumstances first post will be taxed at regular corporate rates on any undistributed reit taxable  table of contents income including undistributed net capital gains second under certain circumstances post may be subject to the alternative minimum tax on items of tax preference if any third if post has  net income from the sale or other disposition of foreclosure property which is in general property acquired by foreclosure or otherwise on default of a loan or lease secured by the property that is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business or  other nonqualifying income from foreclosure property it will be subject to tax at the highest corporate rate on such income fourth if post has net income from prohibited transactions which are in general certain sales or other dispositions of property other than foreclosure property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business such income will be subject to a  tax fifth if post should fail to satisfy the  gross income test or the  gross income test as discussed below and nonetheless has maintained its qualification as a reit because certain other requirements have been met it will be subject to a  tax on the net income attributable to the greater of the amounts by which it fails the  or  gross income test or for taxable years beginning after december   a  test sixth if post should fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of      of its reit ordinary income for such year        of its reit capital gain net income for such year and       any undistributed taxable income from prior periods it would be subject to a  excise tax on the excess of such required distribution over the sum of the amounts actually distributed and amounts retained for which federal income tax was paid seventh post may be subject to a  excise tax with respect to certain redetermined rents redetermined deductions and excess interest to ensure arms length  pricing for certain services provided by taxable reit subsidiaries of post to posts tenants and  allocation of shared expenses between post and its taxable reit subsidiaries finally if post acquires any asset from a c corporation ie a corporation generally subject to full corporatelevel tax in a transaction in which the basis of the asset in posts hands is determined by reference to the basis of the asset or any other property in the hands of the corporation and post recognizes gain on the disposition of such asset during the tenyear period beginning on the date on which such asset was acquired by post then to the extent of such propertys builtin gain the excess of the fair market value of such property at the time of acquisition by post over the adjusted basis of such property at such time such gain will be subject to the highest corporate rate applicable provided an election is made by post to apply the principles of section  of the code to such gain a section  election       when columbus realty trust columbus which post acquired by merger in  was formed in  it acquired certain builtin gain assets from a c corporation in a carryover basis transaction post believes that the aggregate net builtin gain with respect to such assets as of the date hereof is approximately  million post has filed a timely section  election with respect to the builtin gain assets acquired from columbus accordingly post should be subject to a section  corporatelevel tax if post apartment homes sells a builtin gain asset in a taxable transaction during the tenyear period commencing on the date such assets were originally acquired by columbus although post has previously disposed of some of the builtin gain assets acquired from columbus post has no current intention to incur the builtin gain tax with respect to the remaining assets that were acquired from columbus requirements for qualification       the code defines a reit as a corporation trust or association          that is managed by one or more trustees or directors            the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by transferable shares or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest            that would be taxable as a domestic corporation but for sections  through  of the code            that is neither a financial institution nor an insurance company subject to certain provisions of the code  table of contents          the beneficial ownership of which is held by  or more persons            not more than  in value of the outstanding shares of which is owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals as defined in the code to include certain entities the  rule            that makes an election to be a reit or has made such election for a previous taxable year which has not been revoked or terminated and satisfies all relevant filing and other administrative requirements established by the irs that must be met in order to elect and maintain reit status            that uses a calendar year for federal income tax purposes and            that meets certain other tests described below regarding the nature of its income and assets       the code provides that conditions  to  inclusive must be met during the entire taxable year that condition  must be met during at least  days of a taxable year of  months or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than  months and that condition  must be met during the last half of the taxable year for purposes of determining stock ownership under the  rule a supplemental unemployment compensation benefits plan a private foundation or a portion of a trust permanently set aside or used exclusively for charitable purposes generally is considered an individual a trust that is a qualified trust under section a of the code however generally is not considered an individual and beneficiaries of such trust are treated as holding shares of a reit in proportion to their actuarial interests in such trust finally post will be treated as having met condition  above if it has complied with certain treasury regulations for ascertaining the ownership of its stock for such year and if it did not know or after the exercise of reasonable diligence would not have known that its stock was sufficiently closely held during such year to cause it to fail condition        posts articles of incorporation contain restrictions regarding the transfer of its shares that are intended to assist post in continuing to satisfy the share ownership requirements described in clauses  and  above see description of common stock  restrictions on transfer       section i of the code provides that a corporation that is a qualified reit subsidiary shall not be treated as a separate corporation for federal income tax purposes and all assets liabilities and items of income deduction and credit of a qualified reit subsidiary shall be treated as assets liabilities and items of income deduction and credit of the reit a qualified reit subsidiary is a corporation all of the capital stock of which is owned directly by the reit certain subsidiaries of post constitute qualified reit subsidiaries accordingly in applying the income and asset tests described below such subsidiaries will be ignored for federal income tax purposes and all assets liabilities and items of income deduction and credit of such subsidiaries will be treated as assets liabilities and items of income deduction and credit of post such subsidiaries therefore will not be subject to federal corporate income taxation although they may be subject to state and local taxation       in the case of a reit that is a partner in an entity that is classified for federal income tax purposes as a partnership treasury regulations provide that the reit will be deemed to own its proportionate share of the assets of the partnership based on the reits capital interest in the partnership and will be deemed to be entitled to the gross income of the partnership attributable to such share in addition the assets and gross income of the partnership will retain the same character in the hands of the reit for purposes of section  of the code including satisfying the gross income and asset tests described below the ownership of interests in post apartment homes by post will result in its proportionate share of the assets liabilities and items of income of post apartment homes being treated as assets liabilities and items of income of post for purposes of the asset and income tests described below       income tests in order for post to maintain its qualification as a reit two requirements relating to gross income must be satisfied annually first at least  of its gross income excluding gross income from prohibited transactions for each taxable year must consist of defined types of income derived directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property including rents from real property and in certain circumstances interest or temporary investment income second at least  of its  table of contents gross income excluding gross income from prohibited transactions for each taxable year must be derived from such real property or temporary investments and from dividends other types of interest and gain from the sale or disposition of stock or securities or from any combination of the foregoing       the rent received by post from its tenants will qualify as rents from real property in satisfying the gross income requirements for a reit described above only if several conditions are met first the amount of rent must not be based in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person however an amount received or accrued generally will not be excluded from the term rents from real property solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales second the code provides that rents received from a tenant of post will not qualify as rents from real property in satisfying the gross income tests if post or a direct or indirect owner of  or more of post directly or constructively owns  or more of such tenant a related party tenant unless such tenant is a taxable reit subsidiary of the reit and certain other conditions are satisfied third if rent attributable to personal property that is leased in connection with a lease of real property is greater than  of the total rent received under the lease then the portion of rent attributable to such personal property will not qualify as rents from real property finally for the rent to qualify as rents from real property post generally must not operate or manage its properties or furnish or render services to the tenants of such properties other than through an independent contractor who is adequately compensated and from whom post derives or receives no income the independent contractor requirement however does not apply to the extent the services provided by post are usually or customarily rendered in connection with the rental of space for occupancy only and are not otherwise considered rendered to the occupant in addition the independent contractor requirement will not apply to noncustomary services provided by post the annual value of which does not exceed  of the gross income derived from the property with respect to which the services are provided the  de minimis exception for this purpose such services may not be valued at less than  of posts direct cost of providing the services and any gross income deemed to have been derived by post from the performance of noncustomary services pursuant to the  de minimis exception will constitute nonqualifying gross income under the  and  gross income tests in addition in taxable years beginning after december   a taxable reit subsidiary of a reit may provide noncustomary services to the tenants of the reit without causing the rents paid by such tenants to be disqualified as rents from real property       post does not charge rent for any portion of any property that is based in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person in addition post does not receive any material rent from a related party tenant finally post intends to provide any noncustomary services through qualifying independent contractors or its taxable reit subsidiaries or in compliance with the  de minimis exception       post apartment homes receives fees in consideration of the performance of management landscaping and administrative services with respect to properties that are not wholly owned directly or indirectly by post apartment homes a portion of such fees corresponding to that portion of any such property owned by a third party generally will not qualify under the  or  gross income tests post will also receive certain other types of nonqualifying income including its allocable share of any dividends paid by post services to post apartment homes which will qualify under the  gross income test but not under the  gross income test post believes however that the aggregate amount of such fees and other nonqualifying income in any taxable year will not cause post to exceed the limits on nonqualifying income under the  and  gross income tests       if post fails to satisfy one or both of the  or  gross income tests for any taxable year it nevertheless may qualify as a reit for such year if it is entitled to relief under certain provisions of the code those relief provisions generally will be available if the failure to meet such tests is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect post attaches a schedule of the sources of its income to its return and any incorrect information on the schedule was not due to fraud with intent to evade tax it is not possible however to state whether in all circumstances post would be entitled to the benefit of those relief provisions as discussed above in  qualification and taxation of post as a reit even if those relief provisions apply a  tax would be  table of contents imposed on the net income attributable to the greater of the amount by which post fails the  and  gross income tests or a  test for taxable years beginning after december         asset tests at the close of each quarter of its taxable year post also must satisfy several tests relating to the nature of its assets first at least  of the value of posts total assets must be represented by real estate assets including its allocable share of real estate assets held by post apartment homes and any subsidiary partnerships or limited liability companies stock or debt instruments held for not more than one year that are purchased with the proceeds of a stock offering or longterm public debt offering of post cash cash items and government securities second of the investments not included in the  asset class the value of any one issuers debt and equity securities owned by post including its allocable share of such securities owned by post apartment homes may not exceed  of the value of posts total assets third post may not own more than  of any one issuers outstanding voting securities and with respect to taxable years beginning after december   more than  of the total value of any one issuers outstanding debt and equity securities debt of an issuer that is secured by real estate assets does not constitute a security for purposes of the  and  asset tests       for taxable years beginning after december   the  and  asset tests described above do not apply to the securities of a taxable reit subsidiary of the reit although the value of the debt and equity securities of all taxable reit subsidiaries owned by the reit cannot represent more than  of the value of the reits total assets any corporation in which a reit directly or indirectly owns stock other than another reit a corporation which directly or indirectly operates or manages a lodging facility or a health care facility and with certain exceptions a corporation which directly or indirectly provides to any other person under a franchise license or otherwise rights to any brand name under which any lodging facility or health care facility is operated may be treated as a taxable reit subsidiary if the reit and the corporation file a joint election with the internal revenue service for the corporation to be treated as a taxable reit subsidiary of the reit       post has filed joint elections with each of post services and addison circle access inc to have such corporations as well as the corporate subsidiaries of post services treated as taxable reit subsidiaries of post as of january   accordingly the debt and equity securities of post services and addison circle access that are held by post apartment homes are no longer subject to the  asset test or the  asset tests in addition because the  voting securities test does not apply to the securities of a taxable reit subsidiary post apartment homes intends to acquire the voting stock of post services and addison circle access which is currently held by executive officers of post       post believes that its pro rata share of the debt and equity securities of post services and addison circle access represents less than  of the value of posts total assets and with respect to taxable years ending on or before december   represented less than  of the value of posts total assets in addition post believes that it satisfies the  and  asset tests with respect to post apartment homes ownership of the stock of certain corporations that have not elected to become taxable reit subsidiaries of post no independent appraisals have been obtained however to support these conclusions and king  spalding in rendering its opinion as to posts qualification as a reit is relying on posts representation as to the value of posts assets although post plans to take steps to ensure that it continues to satisfy all of the applicable reit asset tests there can be no assurance that such steps will always be successful or will not require a reduction in post apartment homes overall interest in the taxable reit subsidiaries or its other investments       a number of constraints are imposed on reits and their taxable reit subsidiaries to ensure that reits cannot through taxable reit subsidiaries engage in substantial nonreal estate activities and also to ensure that taxable reit subsidiaries pay an appropriate corporatelevel tax on their income for example a taxable reit subsidiary will be subject to the earnings stripping rules of the code with respect to interest paid to the reit which could disallow a portion of the taxable reit subsidiarys interest deductions under certain circumstances in addition a  excise tax may be imposed on the reit with respect to certain redetermined rents redetermined deductions and excess interest to ensure arms length  pricing for services provided by the taxable reit subsidiary to reit tenants and  allocation of shared expenses between the reit and the taxable reit subsidiary  table of contents       distribution requirements in order to qualify as a reit post is required to distribute with respect to each taxable year dividends other than capital gain dividends to its shareholders in an aggregate amount at least equal to  the sum of a   beginning in  of its reit taxable income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and its net capital gain and b   beginning in  of the net income after tax if any from foreclosure property minus  the sum of certain items of noncash income such distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate or in the following taxable year if declared before post timely files its federal income tax return for such year and if paid on or before the first regular dividend payment date after such declaration to the extent that post does not distribute all of its net capital gain or distributes at least   beginning in  but less than  of its reit taxable income as adjusted it will be subject to tax thereon at regular ordinary and capital gains corporate tax rates furthermore if post should fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of      of its reit ordinary income for such year        of its reit capital gain income for such year and       any undistributed taxable income from prior periods it would be subject to a  nondeductible excise tax on the excess of such required distribution over the sum of the amounts actually distributed and amounts retained for which federal income tax was paid       post has made and intends to continue to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy the annual distribution requirements in this regard the partnership agreement of post apartment homes authorizes a qualified reit subsidiary of post as general partner to take such steps as may be necessary to cause post apartment homes to distribute to its partners an amount sufficient to permit post to meet these distribution requirements it is possible however that post from time to time may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the distribution requirements due to timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses and the inclusion of such income and deduction of such expenses in arriving at posts taxable income or if the amount of nondeductible expenses such as principal amortization or capital expenses exceeds the amount of noncash deductions in the event that such timing differences occur in order to meet the distribution requirements post may cause post apartment homes to arrange for shortterm or possibly longterm borrowing to permit the payment of required dividends if the amount of nondeductible expenses exceeds noncash deductions post apartment homes may refinance its indebtedness to reduce principal payments and borrow funds for capital expenditures       under certain circumstances post may be able to rectify a failure to meet the distribution requirements for a year by paying deficiency dividends to its shareholders in a later year which may be included in its deduction for dividends paid for the earlier year although post may be able to avoid being taxed on amounts distributed as deficiency dividends it will be required to pay to the irs interest based upon the amount of any deduction taken for deficiency dividends       recordkeeping requirements pursuant to applicable treasury regulations post must maintain certain records and request on an annual basis certain information from its shareholders designed to disclose the actual ownership of its outstanding shares post intends to comply with these requirements failure to qualify       if post fails to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year and the relief provisions do not apply it will be subject to tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates distributions to shareholders in any year in which post fails to qualify will not be deductible nor will they be required to be made in such event to the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits all distributions to shareholders will be taxable as ordinary income and subject to certain limitations of the code corporate distributees may be eligible for the dividends received deduction unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions post also will be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years  table of contents following the year during which it ceased to qualify as a reit it is not possible to predict whether in all circumstances post would be entitled to such statutory relief other tax considerations       tax status of post apartment homes and other passthrough entities all of posts investments have been made through post apartment homes which in turn holds an interest in a number of subsidiary partnerships in the opinion of king  spalding post apartment homes and the subsidiary partnerships other than any subsidiary partnerships that are  beneficially owned by post apartment homes and disregarded for federal income tax purposes qualify as partnerships for federal income tax purposes and not as associations taxable as corporations or as publicly traded partnerships taxable as corporations       a publicly traded partnership is a partnership whose interests are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent of a secondary market treasury regulations which are effective for taxable years beginning after december   the ptp regulations provide limited safe harbors which if satisfied will prevent a partnerships interests from being treated as readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof the private placement safe harbor applies if  all interests in the partnership were issued in a transaction or transactions that was not required to be registered under the securities act and  the partnership does not have more than  partners at any time during the partnerships taxable year post apartment homes does not currently meet the private placement safe harbor of the ptp regulations because it has more than  partners       under a special grandfather rule an existing partnership may continue to rely on safe harbors contained in irs notice  until its first taxable year beginning after december   unless the partnership adds a substantial new line of business after december   post believes that post apartment homes has satisfied and will continue to satisfy the private placement safe harbor under such notice because in part it has fewer than  direct and indirect partners in addition post believes that it has not added a substantial new line of business since december   upon expiration of the grandfather period if post apartment homes does not at that time satisfy the private placement safe harbor of the ptp regulations it is possible that post apartment homes could be classified as a publicly traded partnership in that event post apartment homes should satisfy a special passive income exception provided in section c of the code and therefore should not be subject to federal income tax at the corporate level however if post apartment homes were classified as a publicly traded partnership the partners of post apartment homes would nevertheless be subject to special passive loss limitation rules in section k of the code       if post apartment homes were treated as an association taxable as a corporation post would fail the  asset test further if the subsidiary partnerships were treated as taxable corporations then post would cease to qualify as a reit if posts ownership interest in such partnership exceeded  of the partnerships voting interests or the value of such interest exceeded  of the value of posts assets or beginning in   of the value of the outstanding interests in the partnership furthermore in such a situation distributions from the subsidiary partnerships to post would be treated as dividends which are not qualifying income under the  gross income test described above and which could therefore make it more difficult for post to meet such test see  failure to qualify above for a discussion of the effect of posts failure to meet such tests for a taxable year finally post would not be able to deduct its share of losses generated by any of the subsidiary partnerships in computing its taxable income       taxation of post services and operating subsidiaries post services and its existing subsidiaries file a corporate consolidated return for federal income tax purposes the consolidated taxable income of these companies is subject to tax at regular corporate rates to the extent such entities are required to pay federal state and local income taxes the cash available for distribution to shareholders will be correspondingly reduced       state and local taxes post post apartment homes and its subsidiaries may be subject to state or local taxation in various state or local jurisdictions including those in which it or they transact business or own property the state and local tax treatment of post post apartment homes and its subsidiaries may not  table of contents conform to the federal income tax consequences discussed above consequently prospective shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect of state and local tax laws on an investment in the securities taxation of taxable us shareholders       as long as post qualifies as a reit distributions made to taxable us shareholders as hereinafter defined out of current or accumulated earnings and profits and not designated as capital gain dividends will be taken into account by such us shareholders as hereinafter defined as ordinary income and will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction generally available to corporations as used herein the term us shareholder means a holder of posts shares that for united states federal income tax purposes is          a citizen or resident of the united states            a corporation partnership or other entity created or organized in or under the laws of the united states any state or the district of columbia            an estate the income of which is subject to united states federal income taxation regardless of its source or            a trust if a a court within the united states is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and b one or more united states persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust       distributions that are designated as capital gain dividends will be taxed as gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than one year to the extent they do not exceed posts actual net capital gain for the taxable year without regard to the period for which the us shareholder has held his or her shares the tax rates applicable to such capital gain are discussed below however corporate us shareholders may be required to treat up to  of certain capital gain dividends as ordinary income distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits will not be taxable to a us shareholder to the extent that they do not exceed the adjusted basis of the us shareholders shares but will reduce the adjusted basis of such shares to the extent that such distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits exceed the adjusted basis of a us shareholders shares such distributions will be included in income as capital gain assuming that such shares are capital assets in the hands of the us shareholder the tax rate to which such capital gain will be subject will depend on the us shareholders holding period for his shares in addition any distribution declared by post in october november or december of any year and payable to a us shareholder of record on a specified date in any such month shall be treated as both paid by post and received by the us shareholder on december  of such year provided that the distribution is actually paid by post during january of the following calendar year       post may make an election to treat all or part of its undistributed net capital gain as if it had been distributed to its shareholders as described above these undistributed amounts would be subject to corporate level tax payable by post if post should make such an election its shareholders would be required to include in their income as longterm capital gain their proportionate share of posts undistributed net capital gain as designated by post each such shareholder would be deemed to have paid his proportionate share of the income tax imposed on post with respect to such undistributed net capital gain and this amount would be credited or refunded to the shareholder in addition the tax basis of the shareholders stock would be increased by his proportionate share of undistributed net capital gains included in his income less his proportionate share of the income tax imposed on post with respect to such gains       us shareholders may not include in their individual income tax returns any net operating losses or capital losses of post instead such losses would be carried over by post for potential offset against its future income subject to certain limitations taxable distributions from post and gain from the disposition of its shares will not be treated as passive activity income and therefore us shareholders generally will not be able to apply any passive activity losses such as losses from certain types of limited partnerships in which a shareholder is a limited partner against such income in addition taxable distributions from post generally will be treated as  table of contents investment income for purposes of the investment interest limitations capital gains from the disposition of posts shares or distributions treated as such however will be treated as investment income only if the us shareholder so elects in which case such capital gains will be taxed at ordinary income rates post will notify shareholders after the close of posts taxable year as to the portions of the distributions attributable to that year that constitute ordinary income return of capital and capital gain       in general any gain or loss realized upon a taxable disposition of posts shares by a us shareholder who is not a dealer in securities will be treated as a capital gain or loss lower marginal tax rates for individuals may apply in the case of capital gains depending on the holding period of posts shares that are sold however any loss upon a sale or exchange by a us shareholder who has held such shares for six months or less after applying certain holding period rules will be treated as a longterm capital loss to the extent of distributions from post required to be treated by such us shareholder as longterm capital gain all or a portion of any loss realized upon a taxable disposition of posts shares may be disallowed if other post shares are purchased within  days before or after the disposition       for noncorporate taxpayers the tax rate differential between capital gain and ordinary income may be significant the highest marginal noncorporate income tax rate applicable to ordinary income is  but any capital gain generally will be taxed to a noncorporate taxpayer at a maximum rate of  with respect to capital assets held for more than one year the tax rates applicable to ordinary income apply to gain from the sale or exchange of capital assets held for one year or less in the case of capital gain attributable to the sale or exchange of certain real property held for more than one year an amount of such gain equal to the amount of all prior depreciation deductions not otherwise required to be taxed as ordinary depreciation recapture income will be taxed at a maximum rate of  with respect to distributions designated by a reit as capital gain dividends including any deemed distributions of retained capital gains the reit also may designate and will notify shareholders subject to certain limits whether

post will report to its us shareholders and to the irs the amount of distributions paid during each calendar year and the amount of tax withheld if any under the backup withholding rules a us shareholder may be subject to backup withholding at the rate of  with respect to distributions paid unless such holder  is a corporation or comes within certain other exempt categories and when required demonstrates this fact or  provides a taxpayer identification number certifies as to no loss of exemption from backup withholding and otherwise complies with the applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules a us shareholder who does not provide post with his correct taxpayer identification number also may be subject to penalties imposed by the irs any amount paid as backup withholding will be creditable against the us shareholders income tax liability in addition post may be required to withhold a portion of capital gain distributions to any us shareholders who fail to certify their nonforeign status to post see  taxation of nonus shareholders taxation of taxexempt shareholders       taxexempt entities including qualified employee pension and profit sharing trusts and individual retirement accounts exempt organizations generally are exempt from federal income taxation however they are subject to taxation on their unrelated business taxable income ubti while many investments in real estate generate ubti the irs has issued a published ruling that dividend distributions from a reit to an exempt  table of contents employee pension trust do not constitute ubti provided that the shares of the reit are not otherwise used in an unrelated trade or business of the exempt employee pension trust based on that ruling amounts distributed by post to exempt organizations generally should not constitute ubti however if an exempt organization finances its acquisition of shares with acquisition indebtedness a portion of its income from distributions on such shares will constitute ubti pursuant to the debtfinanced property rules furthermore social clubs voluntary employee benefit associations supplemental unemployment benefit trusts and qualified group legal service plans that are exempt from taxation under paragraphs    and  respectively of code section c are subject to different ubti rules which generally will require them to characterize distributions from post as ubti in addition in certain circumstances a pension trust that owns more than  by value of the shares of a reit would be required to treat a percentage of the dividends on its shares as ubti the ubti percentage the ubti percentage is the gross income less related direct expenses derived by post from an unrelated trade or business determined as if post were a pension trust divided by the gross income less related direct expenses of post for the year in which the dividends are paid the ubti rule applies to a pension trust holding more than  of the common stock only if  the ubti percentage is at least   post qualifies as a reit by reason of the modification of the  rule that allows the beneficiaries of the pension trust to be treated as holding shares of post in proportion to their actuarial interests in the pension trust and  either a one pension trust owns more than  of the value of such shares or b a group of pension trusts individually holding more than  of the value of shares collectively owns more than  of the value of the shares taxation of nonus shareholders       the rules governing united states federal income taxation of nonresident alien individuals and foreign corporations foreign partnerships and other foreign holders of posts shares that are not us shareholders as defined above collectively nonus shareholders are complex and no attempt will be made herein to provide more than a summary of such rules nonus shareholders should consult with their own tax advisors to determine the impact of federal state and local income tax laws with regard to an investment in the securities including any reporting requirements       distributions to nonus shareholders that are not attributable to gain from sales or exchanges by post of united states real property interests and are not designated by post as capital gain dividends will be treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent that they are made out of posts current or accumulated earnings and profits such distributions ordinarily will be subject to a withholding tax equal to  of the gross amount of the distribution unless an applicable tax treaty reduces or eliminates that tax however if income from the investment in shares is treated as effectively connected with the nonus shareholders conduct of a united states trade or business the nonus shareholder generally will be subject to federal income tax at graduated rates in the same manner as us shareholders are taxed with respect to such distributions subject to applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals in addition a foreign corporation receiving income that is treated as effectively connected income may be subject to an additional  branch profits tax unless an applicable tax treaty reduces or eliminates that tax post expects to withhold united states income tax at the rate of  on the gross amount of any such distributions made to a nonus shareholder unless  a lower treaty rate applies and any required form eg irs form wen evidencing eligibility for that reduced rate is filed with post or  the nonus shareholder files an irs form weci with post       distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits of post will not be taxable to a shareholder to the extent that such distributions do not exceed the adjusted basis of the shareholders shares but rather will reduce the adjusted basis of such shares to the extent that distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits exceed the adjusted basis of a nonus shareholders shares such distributions will give rise to tax liability if the nonus shareholder otherwise would be subject to tax on any gain from the sale or disposition of his shares as described below because it generally cannot be determined at the time a distribution is made whether or not such distribution will be in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits the entire amount of any distribution normally will be subject to withholding at the same  table of contents rate as a dividend however amounts so withheld are refundable to the extent it is determined subsequently that such distribution was in fact in excess of the payors current and accumulated earnings and profits       post is required to withhold  of any distribution in excess of its current and accumulated earnings and profits to the extent that its shares constitute us real property interests under section c of the code consequently although post intends to withhold at a rate of  on the entire amount of any distribution to a nonus shareholder to the extent that post does not do so any portion of a distribution not subject to  withholding may be subject to  withholding under certain circumstances       for any year in which post qualifies as a reit distributions that are attributable to gain from sales or exchanges of us real property interests will be taxed to a nonus shareholder under the provisions of the foreign investment in real property tax act of  firpta under firpta distributions attributable to gain from sales of united states real property interests are taxed to a nonus shareholder as if such gain were effectively connected with a united states business nonus shareholders thus would be taxed at the normal capital gain rates applicable to us shareholders subject to applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals distributions subject to firpta also may be subject to the  branch profits tax in the hands of a corporate nonus shareholder not entitled to treaty relief or exemption post is required to withhold  of any distribution that is designated by it as a capital gains dividend the amount withheld is creditable against the nonus shareholders us tax liability       gain recognized by a nonus shareholder upon a sale of shares generally will not be taxed under firpta if post is a domestically controlled reit defined generally as a reit in which at all times during a specified testing period less than  in value of the stock was held directly or indirectly by foreign persons post believes that it is currently a domesticallycontrolled reit and therefore the sale of common stock will not be subject to taxation under firpta however because posts shares are publicly traded no assurance can be given that post is or will continue to be a domesticallycontrolled reit in addition a nonus shareholder that owned actually or constructively under certain constructive ownership rules  or less of posts outstanding shares at all times during a specified testing period will not be subject to tax under firpta if such shares are regularly traded on an established securities market eg the nyse on which the shares are currently traded furthermore gain not subject to firpta will be taxable to a nonus shareholder if  investment in shares is effectively connected with the nonus shareholders united states trade or business in which case the nonus shareholder will be subject to the same treatment as us shareholders with respect to such gain or  the nonus shareholder is a nonresident alien individual who was present in the united states for  days or more during the taxable year and certain other conditions apply in which case the nonresident alien individual will be subject to a  tax on the individuals capital gains if the gain on the sale of shares were to be subject to taxation under firpta the nonus shareholder would be subject to the same treatment as us shareholders with respect to such gain subject to a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals other tax consequences       posts shareholders may be subject to state or local taxation in various state or local jurisdictions including those in which they own property transact business or reside the state and local tax treatment of posts shareholders may not conform to the federal income tax consequences discussed above although shareholders who are individuals generally should not be required to file state income tax returns outside of their state of residence with respect to posts operations and distributions taxation of holders of preferred
