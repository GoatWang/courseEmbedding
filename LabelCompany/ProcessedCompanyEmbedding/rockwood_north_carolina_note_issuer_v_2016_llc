moodys assigns ratings to notes issued by rockwood north carolina note issuer v  llc global credit research   oct  new york october    moodys investors service moodys announced that it has assigned the following rating to notes issued by rockwood north carolina note issuer v  llc the issuer us   senior notes due  the notes assigned a moodys rating of the notes addresses the ultimate receipt of regularly scheduled interest in the form of tax credits and principal payments in the form of cash as provided by the notes governing documents the tax credits are made available by the state of north carolina under a north carolina statutory renewable energy property program the north carolina program the issuer is able to make the benefit available to its noteholders of tax credits generated under the north carolina program through the issuers affiliation with rockwood north carolina spe v  which has invested in entities that own each of the projects in the portfolio and is thus eligible for the north carolina tax credits the tax credits will be available so long as the project is in service has not been moved out of the state and has not been sold or disposed of each an expiration event rockwood asset management llc rockwood will be the manager for this transaction the rating does not address the payment of compensatory amounts or any other payments of the issuer referred to in the notes governing documents ratings rationale we base our rating for the notes primarily on  evidence that rockwood is capable of operating the issuer and other related affiliates in accordance with their contractual obligations and the statutory requirements of the north carolina program such that tax credits will be available to the holders of the notes for scheduled interest and  legal assurance that investments in the renewable energy projects have already been made that will entitle the noteholders to claim the tax credits the principal is separately supported by deposits of cash collateral made by the issuer and invested in us treasury bills and certain highlyrated investments permitted by the transaction documents in an amount sufficient to cover all payments of principal key to our assumptions in reaching the rating is that rockwood will take all actions necessary to monitor compliance with the contractual requirements under the north carolina program and that there will be annual agreedupon procedures reports to confirm that no expiration event has occurred moodys has also considered contractual terms in a the notes governing documents and b the operating agreements of relevant affiliates that will operate to cause compliance with the requirements of the north carolina program methodology underlying the rating action the principal methodology used in this rating was moodys methodology for rating debt issuance under certified capital company new markets tax credit and similar programs published in september  please see the rating methodologies page on wwwmoodyscom for a copy of this methodology factors that would lead to an upgrade or downgrade of the rating see the section of the principal methodology entitled monitoring of ratings on capco
