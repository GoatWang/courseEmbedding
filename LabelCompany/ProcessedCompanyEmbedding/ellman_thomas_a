dtnb reacts with sulfhydryl groups to yield a colored product providing a reliable method to measure reduced cysteines and other free sulfhydryls in solution ellmans reagent dithiobisnitrobenzoic acid is used to estimate sulfhydryl groups in a sample by comparing to a standard curve of a sulfhydrylcontaining compound such as cysteine alternatively sulfhydryl groups can be assayed using the extinction coefficient of tnb m cm at nm ellmans reagent has been used for applications other than sulfhydryl estimation such as for determining alkylthiols by hplc using a precolumn derivatization procedure and to study thiols in the active site of several enzymes features of ellmans reagent • sulfhydryl assay—reacts quantitatively with free reduced sulfhydryl groups —sh to yield detectable tnb product • colorimetric detection—colored product enables spectrophotometric measurement in cuvettes or microplates λmax  nm ε  m·cm • proven method—wellcharacterized chemistry provides quantitation of peptide or protein sulfhydryl groups using extinction coefficient calculation or by comparison to a cysteine standard reagent properties • alternative names dtnb ellmans reagent • chemical name dithiobisnitrobenzoic acid • reactive toward sulfhydryl groups —sh • chemical formula chnos • cas number  • molecular weight  • form yellow crystalline powder dtnb reacts with a free sulfhydryl group to yield a mixed disulfide and nitrothiobenzoic acid tnb the target of dtnb in this reaction is the conjugate base r—s of a free sulfhydryl group therefore the rate of this reaction is dependent on several factors  the reaction ph  the pka of the sulfhydryl and  steric and electrostatic effects tnb is the colored species produced in this reaction and has a high molar extinction coefficient in the visible range the molar extinction coefficient of tnb was originally reported by ellman  to be m cm at  nm and ph  consequently this value has been cited frequently in the literature later studies have shown however that the molar extinction coefficient is more accurately reflected by a value of m cm at  nm the extinction of tnb is not affected by changes in ph between  and  however the extinction of tnb is different in other solvents for research use only not for use in diagnostic procedures figures dtnb reacts with sulfhydryl groups such as peptide cysteines to form mixed disulfides and tnb whose color can be measured at nm with a plate reader or spectrophotometer specifications chemical reactivity thiol product size  g contents  storage store protected from moisture
