highvoltage hype set to shortcircuitmay   about pulse biosciences plse kerrisdale capital management hedge fund manager longshort equity value special situationskerrisdale capital management summarypulse claims its technology can eliminate tumors and trigger immune responses but clinical evidence demonstrates worstinclass efficacyresearch sponsored by pulse confirms that its technology cannot even reliably kill cancer cells in vitroa nearidentical device that has been fdaapproved for more than  years generates paltry revenue editors note references are noted by parentheticals    and end notes by superscript   we are short shares of pulse biosciences nasdaqplse a  million medical device company with  employees zero revenue and one focus developing and commercializing a technology it calls nanopulse stimulation nps in which cells are exposed to very strong electrical fields for very brief periods of time in hopes of killing them pulse claims that this method of killing cells constitutes a novel therapeutic tissue treatment platform with the potential not only to destroy tumors directly but also in the words of the companys chief scientific officer to essentially transform them into vaccines to direct the immune system to destroy them on the basis of this high concept as opposed to any significant commercial or technical progress the stock price has increased sixfold since the companys may  ipo this runup is senseless contrary to pulses highly selective narrative even if nps one day performed as advertised it would still have little value for one thing an existing ablation device called the nanoknife which has been on the market for a decade also kills cells by exposing them to very strong electrical fields for very brief periods of time while pulse insists that its technology by using somewhat stronger fields for somewhat briefer periods generates wildly different effects the scientific literature argues otherwise many allegedly unique benefits of nps like the induction of apoptosis a form of programmed cell suicide and the stimulation of the immune system apply not just to nanoknife but to a wide range of other runofthemill treatments from a clinical perspective pulses nps is nothing special especially relative to nanoknife  which in turn is a perennial flop with less than  million in annual revenue worse still our review of published nps results reveals that the technology doesnt perform as advertised to the contrary its often appallingly ineffective for instance in the only formal nps clinical trial published to date pulse researchers treated three patients with skin cancer and  in an outcome far worse than standard surgery  left two with residual cancer and a third with discolored and anomalouslooking but supposedly for the time being benign lesions very recently new research funded by pulse itself concluded that even after the most intense treatments a sizable fraction of human cancer cells across a range of cancer types simply cannot be killed by nps  an alarming phenomenon whose cause remains a complete mystery the unexpected discovery of this residual resistivity or tolerance  published online in december headed for print in may yet to our knowledge never mentioned by pulse management  may by itself wipe out what little commercial value nps might have had whats the point of a method for killing cancer that cant kill cancer pulses technology has barely made it off the drawing board yet its already proven itself to be weak unreliable and undifferentiated investors with high expectations are in for a shock i investment highlights pulses nps technology is far less special than it claims the company contends that nps will provide unique benefits to patients in a wide variety of medical applications asserting that while other ablation modalities using extreme heat or cold to destroy tumors generally lead to cellular necrosis uncontrolled cell death driven by physical injury nps offers a nonthermal and nonionizing ablative technology that can be selectively tuned to induce apoptosis or programmed cell death this less destructive approach according to pulse lends itself to a number of applications including tumors which would otherwise be inoperable because of proximity to critical structures emphasis added however irreversible electroporation ire  a technology very similar to nps and already commercialized for years under the brand name nanoknife  has been pitched in almost exactly the same way as this selection from a  marketing presentation demonstrates selection from nanoknife marketing presentation february  source angiodynamics red highlights added by kerrisdale furthermore while pulse uses limited evidence from animal models to suggest that nps can prevent cancer recurrence irreversible electroporation produced similar results four years ago when a team of researchers found that after using ire to destroy tumors in mice and then injecting the mice with a second batch of cancer cells growth of the second tumors was significantly reduced or prevented entirely  indeed more broadly what pulse claims to be npss most important benefit  its purported ability to cause cell death in a way that stimulates the immune system  is shared by a wide range of therapies including cryoablation photodynamic therapy radiation therapy focused ultrasound ablation radiofrequency ablation and more if nps cant provide unique benefits like pulse says then it makes no sense for such an earlystage technology  years away from generating meaningful revenue and supported by published data from only four human patients  to command such a high valuation similar technologies have repeatedly fallen short of expectations while pulses marketing message closely resembles that of nanoknife manufactured by angiodynamics nasdaqango which acquired the technology in  for just  million that should come as no comfort to pulse shareholders since nanoknife has proven to be a serial disappointment both clinically and commercially for instance in a surprising failure a clinical trial testing the use of nanoknife in lung cancer ended early when it became clear that the treatment failed to eradicate many tumors   notwithstanding preclinical evidence like pulses of positive immune effects a decade after launching nanoknife still produces less than  million of annual revenue  a small part of a relatively small yet crowded market for nonsurgical tumor ablation similarly while some animal models have suggested that radiofrequency ablation stimulates significant immune benefits a randomized controlled trial in humans with liver cancer proved that the therapy delivered results that were significantly worse than those of conventional surgical resection  another technology highintensity focused ultrasound hifu has likewise shown signs of enhancing immune responses to cancer yet its results in humans were so weak that it struggled to achieve fda approval and the technologys leading manufacturer a french company called edap earns almost zero profit from it in general tantalizing hints that new ablation modalities might confer meaningful anticancer immunity have failed to translate into realworld success an outcome that we fully expect to repeat for pulse theres no room in the marketplace for a nanoknife me too when the original nanoknife has failed to gain much traction even if pulses technology did what it was supposed to do it would have no realistic value proposition pulses data indicate that nps is impotent and unreliable in the only formal study of nps in humans yet completed and published pulse researchers treated ten small tumors caused by basalcell carcinoma a type of skin cancer across three patients while the company has spun this study as an early win three out of the ten tumors remained cancerous  weeks after treatment by contrast the most effective treatment for this cancer a technique called mohs surgery almost always succeeds with recurrence very rare even five years later not only did nps fail to eliminate  of the tumors it failed on two out of three patients the third while judged cancerfree on the basis of histological data was likely unhappy with the improvement of her two lesions which in our view look even more troubling after treatment last row of photos than before treatment first row of photos pulses results in one patients basalcell carcinoma source nuccitelli et al  kerrisdale analysis images depict two different tumors on a single patient before treatment and two seven and eleven weeks after treatment from top to bottom for one of the other two patients not only did nps fail to rid him of cancer it also appeared to give rise to two instances of seborrheic keratosis a benign skin growth that looks like skin cancer  an unpleasant result not just for the patient but for pulse which hopes to some day treat this condition yet may somehow cause it these startlingly bad results are consistent with a longer track record of weak and inconsistent nps data the latest and perhaps the most worrisome example is a study paid for by pulse itself that shows for the first time that across a variety of healthy and cancerous human cell lines sizable  fractions of cell populations exposed to nps boast an unusual level of tolerance and simply dont die no matter how many times theyre zapped  disturbingly while the authors of the study tried to take the sting out of this discovery by blaming it on some artifact of the experimental methodology they concluded that the phenomenon of nps resistance or tolerance is quite real  yet its cause remains a mystery when nps failed to completely kill tumors or prevent their recurrence in previous studies as it often did researchers could always fall back on the excuse that they just hadnt used enough pulses the new study however exposes that excuse as hollow and underscores just how poorly the effects of nps are still understood since cancer is by definition a disease of aberrant growth and other existing ablation modalities can in fact reliably kill cells a treatment like pulses nps that unaccountably only kills some parts of tumors some of the time is worthless if pulses technology were as good as it claimed to be it would still falter in a market already full of technologies with similar stories but with so much evidence quickly stacking up against nps we believe its dead on arrival ii company overview pulse biosciences capitalization and financial results pro forma for pulses february  equity issuance at a price of  per share † values represent kerrisdale projections pulse management indicated on the companys may   earnings call that cash use in  would be  million source company filings kerrisdale analysis though technically founded in may  pulse biosciences grew out of an entity formed in  initially called rpn enterprises and later renamed bioelectromed created by richard nuccitelli a former uc davis professor and now chief scientific officer of pulse who retired from academia to pursue his fortune in the early s nuccitelli grew excited about early animal studies showing that strong but brief electrical pulses on the order of  nanoseconds in duration could eliminate tumors while research findings in this area many of them coauthored by nuccitelli and funded by government grants trickled in over the years the field remained obscure with only a handful of groups involved and no apparent outside commercial interest by  nuccitellis bioelectromed entity seemed to be more focused on an unrelated technology called the dermacorder designed to assess wound healing and even diagnose cancer by measuring electric fields an old version of bioelectromeds web site boasts that the device was featured on star trek tech on the history channel but the dermacorder apparently amounted to little and by  bioelectromed returned its focus to what it then called nanosecond pulse ablation a partnering page on its site noted we seek corporate partners to inquire about partnering opportunities please contact us but no partners emerged ultimately the small investment bank mdb capital  a firm with a checkered past that includes packaging and taking public many companies that proved disastrous for longterm shareholders  helped bioelectromed roll up a number of patents related to nanosecond pulsed electric fields some of which were previously held by a handful of universities including old dominion and eastern virginia medical school a november  private placement infused the new rollup entity with  million in cash and valued it at  million in total or  per share  lower than the current price finally what is now called pulse went public in may  at a price of  per share little happened in its first several months as a public company and the stock price ranged between  and  on february  however pulse issued a press release announcing that robert duggan a serial entrepreneur who became a billionaire after selling the drug company pharmacyclics to abbvie nyseabbv and maky zanganeh a former dentist and duggans coo at pharmacyclics bought significant stakes in the company including purchasing  million of newly issued shares directly from the company at a price of  investors acting as if this shift in ownership somehow altered the value of pulses underlying technology drove the stock dramatically higher from there indeed the price has become so frothy that pulse recently announced mdb capital had waived lockup provisions a month early for preipo holders of  of the companys shares apparently these holders were so eager to sell at current prices that they didnt want to risk waiting even one more month despite the ugly optics while the past successes of pulses new minority shareholders deserve respect they cant change what the technology is or how well it works to be sure nps is still very early in its development having been used on only a handful of human patients to date but with no meaningful edge over alternative ablation modalities and an accumulating body of evidence highlighting its weakness and inconsistency the company cannot in our view justify anything close to its current valuation  no matter who owns its shares iii pulses technology is nothing special out of context pulses story sounds good the first page of the companys ipo prospectus sets out the official line for the treatment of cancer we believe that we can trigger a signaling cascade within the tumor cells that ends in immunogenic apoptosis immunogenic apoptosis is a process in which cells are induced to die in a natural way initiating their own programmed cell death engaging the immune system to clear damaged diseased or aged cells and enrolling cytotoxic t cells to recognize and eliminate cells of the same tumor type we believe we are the only medical device company with the intellectual property technology and knowhow to be able to produce this natural cell death using npes to initiate cell signaling that induces the targeted adaptive immune response not only can its device kill cells but the story goes it can also kill them in a unique way that recruits the patients own immune system to join the fight but is pulse truly the only medical device company with these abilities it is at pains to distinguish its nanosecond pulses which in clinical applications have actually been nanosecond pulses using electric field strengths of tens of thousands of volts per centimeter from the characteristics of another technology irreversible electroporation which uses pulses x longer at electric field strengths x weaker according to pulse irreversible electroporation  marketed by the publicly traded medical device company angiodynamics under the name nanoknife  causes cell membranes to irreversibly permeabilize resulting in necrosis death of the tumor cells while pulses technology by contrast transiently permeabilizes internal organelles which can lead to a signaling cascade ending in immunogenic apoptosis rather than necrosis the scientific literature however paints a different picture irreversible electroporation is generally regarded as causing apoptosis consider the following passage from a study of ire in human prostate cancer emphasis added  unlike other focal therapy modalities ire relies on a nonthermal mechanism to induce cell death ire uses needle electrodes placed in or around a targeted volume of tissue to deliver a series of brief directcurrent electrical pulses with the intention of inducing a permanently porous cell membrane this disrupts cellular homoeostasis resulting in apoptosis this summary is not meant to be controversial rather it merely states the consensus another recent ire study used similar language  unlike rfa radiofrequency ablation and mwa microwave ablation ire induces apoptotic cell death in the relative absence of thermal damage ire thus offers the advantage of preserving underlying structural integrity and architecture due to the absence of necrotic cell death moreover while pulse harps on npss ability to induce apoptosis this emphasis is overblown what exactly nps does to cells remains murky as one  paper explained emphasis added  with the complexity of the cellular response to nspef nanosecond pulsed electric fields the mechanisms and specific pathways leading to cell death have only been partially understood the early studies focused on the apoptotic response and only recently early necrosis was reported by several groups as a separate or even a predominant mode of nspefinduced cell death in short angiodynamics nanoknife ire technology causes apoptosis not just necrosis while pulses nps technology causes necrosis not just apoptosis to depict itself as unique pulse has no choice but to gloss over the deep similarities between ire and nps but these efforts are misleading however interesting the different effects engendered by variations in pulse duration and field strength may be from a scientific perspective their practical impact on cancer cells appears to be small indeed more broadly there is nothing unusual about nonsurgical ablation modalities or other cancer treatments causing cell death by apoptosis as one  review put it induction of apoptotic programmed cell death is one of the underlying principles of most current cancer therapies including radiation and chemotherapy emphasis added  while cells directly exposed to intense heat may die in an uncontrolled necrotic manner thats not the whole story in the words of another recent review emphasis added  heatablated lesions can be thought of as having three zones the central zone which is immediately beyond the application tip and which undergoes ablationinduced coagulative necrosis a peripheral or transitional zone of sublethal hyperthermia which mostly occurs from thermal conduction of the central area that is either undergoing apoptosis or recovering from reversible injury and the surrounding tissue that is unaffected by ablation as the same review also points out a similar pattern results from cryoablation which kills cells via intense cold direct coldinduced coagulative necrosis occurs at the centre of cryoablative lesions whereas apoptosis has been observed at their periphery thus what pulse cites as a key point of differentiation  npss ability to induce apoptosis  is anything but different a company with an undistinguished hypothetical product that has barely taken the first steps toward commercialization in a crowded market doesnt deserve a  million valuation many other cancer treatments stimulate the immune system ironically pulses rhetorical focus on apoptosis runs counter to its other focus the potential immunological benefits of nps in general apoptosis is thought to stimulate immune responses far less than necrosis  or even to suppress immune responses a  review of immune responses to cryoablation summarized the traditional view  necrosis occurs with mechanical tissue damage such as cryoablation and is characterized by cellular breakdown and release of intracellular contents many of these intracellular contents can be immunostimulatory apoptosis or programmed cell death results in several steps that allow the uptake of cellular debris by both macrophages and dendritic cells but without causing inflammation and thus stimulating an immune response apoptotic cells do not release their contents as do necrotic cells in fact several studies have shown that apoptosis not only does not stimulate immune recognition but quite the opposite to be fair over time further research has demonstrated that in some cases apoptosis can give rise to socalled immunogenic cell death icd however it would be bizarre to suggest that pulses nps has a monopoly on stimulating the immune system to the contrary decades of research show that a wide range of ablation modalities and other treatments can lead to icd this is not some special new power that makes the companys technology superior to the status quo  its already widespread a recent review by researchers from university college london entitled harnessing the immunomodulatory effect of thermal and nonthermal ablative therapies for cancer treatment gives a sense of how many such therapies appear to enhance immune responses select ablative therapies found to stimulate the immune system source bastianpillai et al  table  note pdt  photodynamic therapy hifu  highintensity focused ultrasound lofu  lowintensity focused ultrasound note that the treatment with the strongest evidence of immuneresponse generation is cryotherapy the ablation of tumors using extreme cold by contrast electroporation  the treatment most similar to pulses nps  has produced more limited evidence beyond this list chemotherapeutic agents including doxorubicin mitoxantrone oxaliplatin and bortezomib along with the simple physical intervention of applying high hydrostatic pressure ex vivo have also been shown to elicit icd  pulses technology is more of the same consider for instance radiofrequency ablation  a method of killing cancer cells with intense heat japanese researchers showed in  that radiofrequency ablation of a tumor on one side of a mouses body could significantly reduce the growth rate of an untreated tumor on the other side accompanied by massive tcell infiltration  evidence of a strengthened immune response sparked by the ablation  another group showed in  that radiofrequency ablation of colorectal cancer in mice caused a marked increase in intratumoral cd t lymphocyte infiltration especially t cells specific for tumor antigens in addition ablation of a primary tumor retarded the growth of separately induced secondary tumors on other parts of the body and this effect required the presence of t cells to work  in short radiofrequency ablation doesnt just kill the cancer cells it directly affects it also triggers the immune system to attack similar cells likewise consider highintensity focused ultrasound mouse studies as far back as  suggested that hifu led to stimulation of host tumor immunity  further studies revealed that vaccinating mice with hifutreated tumor cells inhibited growth of subsequently introduced tumors while t cells extracted from tumorbearing mice treated with hifu when transferred to other such mice not treated with hifu could extend survival and even induce tumor regression  irreversible electroporation also appears to confer a degree of antitumor immunity in  researchers found that after only partially ablating mouse tumors using ire mice with functional immune systems survived much longer than immunodeficient mice  suggesting that even when ire didnt eliminate every cancer cell it still sparked enough of an immune response in mice capable of it to enhance health furthermore in tumorbearing mice treated with ire and then subsequently rechallenged with the same type of tumors growth of the second tumors was shown to be significantly reduced or prevented entirely  a phenomenon accompanied by robust tcell infiltration in some mice  in  another mouse model demonstrated that ire ablation of the liver could inhibit the growth of a related tumor on the skin again accompanied by an influx of t cells  such effects observed across a wide array of ablation modalities including nanoknifes ire put pulses overblown claims in perspective the best evidence the company has marshaled shows that in some cases in certain animal models nps treatment can do more than kill the cells it directly affects it can also stimulate the immune system to target tumors itself but the same can be said for radiofrequency ablation cryoablation highintensity focused ultrasound irreversible electroporation and more pulses findings do nothing to distinguish nps from the many more established and better understood competitors observed immune effects have not translated to clinical benefits despite intriguing suggestions of positive immunological side effects however nonsurgical ablation modalities have often performed poorly in real patients in the words of one  review emphasis added  in addition to lowering the general tumor burden ablation releases tumor antigens and multiple bioactive molecules such as damageassociated molecular patterns damps combined with general inflammation and immuneregulatory processes of the wound healing response following ablation this will result in different innate and adaptive immune effects however… responses generally remain weak potent antitumor immunity therefore is rarely generated as also evidenced by scarce reports of spontaneous regression following ablation irreversible electroporation for example  the modality most similar to pulses nps  performed surprisingly poorly in a key lung cancer trial published in  forcing the trial to be cut short prematurely lest more patients receive such ineffective treatment  in another recent clinical trial dubbed the nanoknife electroporation ablation trial neat researchers were again clearly disappointed by the results noting that while nanoknife treatment appeared to be safe the ablation results were less satisfactory with onethird of patients harbouring clinically significant disease following treatment  a far cry from a consistent cure thus whatever the modest potential immune benefits of ire they were not enough to overcome its other limitations like the difficulty of assessing whether a targeted tumor has been fully ablated in the first place these weak results are not unique to ire other modalities have produced similar disappointments in the clinic for instance in a large randomized trial comparing liver cancer patients treated with radiofrequency ablation to those treated with conventional surgery rfa led to substantially worse overall survival and recurrencefree survival with rfa patients almost  more likely than surgery patients to experience a recurrence of their cancer within five years after treatment  again regardless of whether rfa induced any immune response in these patients it didnt matter overall they still would have been better off with surgery ultrasound ablation has yielded further disappointments an unfinished trial using a device called ablatherm produced by the publicly traded company edap found that almost a third of prostate cancer patients tested positive for prostate cancer within two years of ablation  results so poor that an fda expert panel voted unanimously in  that there was no reasonable assurance the treatment was effective once more immunological data generated in animal models failed to translate to a net clinical benefit in real patients indeed the evidence in favor of nonsurgical ablation is generally weak as one recent review pointed out  common disadvantages include incomplete ablation disease recurrence and inferior outcomes there is a noticeable lack of randomized controlled clinical trials in patients which is mostly because it is unethical to conduct headtohead comparisons between ablation and surgical excision when the tumour is resectable over time the same pattern of disillusionment has repeated again and again tantalizing hints that killing cells in some novel way will have meaningfully positive knockon effects juxtaposed with unimpressive clinical outcomes that relegate the treatment to the small market of patients with no better alternatives at best pulses nps technology will fizzle out in the same way technologies like pulses have been commercial flops with only weak and equivocal clinical data to support them novel ablation modalities akin to pulses havent gained significant market share the most relevant example is the nanoknife ire technology purchased by angiodynamics in  for just  million a small fraction of pulses current market cap the nanoknife pitch is almost identical to pulses as befits a technology so similar both purport to use strong but short electrical pulses not extreme temperatures to induce apoptosis both can point to limited preclinical evidence that this approach triggers an immune response and both claim they can protect important structures like blood vessels and bile ducts that may be close to targeted tumors pulses nps however remains far from commercialization while nanoknife has benefited from a decade of marketing and a large body of clinical research after all those years though nanoknife has gained little traction across the world virtually no insurance company or government payor covers nanoknife ablation regarding it as experimental and investigational not proven or medically necessary while the fda has cleared it for the generic indication of soft tissue ablation it lacks approval for the treatment of any specific condition as a result in the words of a recent sellside initiation piece nanoknife market adoption has been slow to our knowledge the last time angiodynamics disclosed nanoknife revenue in october  it had fallen from an annualized run rate of  million to just  million driven by a decline in the sale of new nanoknife systems as opposed to disposables used during procedures while angiodynamics then stopped providing specific figures management signaled that the devices market growth continued to be weak january   gaining new capital placements has been a challenge for nanoknife as we look to the second half of the fiscal year we have revised our nanoknife capital outlook to reflect this view until we achieve our reimbursement goals april   capital sales of nanoknife continued to be a challenge this quarter the revised guidance contemplates nearterm nanoknife capital sales to be below historical run rate levels january   the oncologysurgery franchise generated revenue that was down  yearoveryear and was driven by lower sales in ablation products and nanoknife capital it thus appears that nanoknife has made little progress beyond the installed base of just  units that it had achieved by  if thats all it could accomplish in over a decade what hope is there for pulse  with an extraordinarily similar product backed up by far less research and experience  to build a real business while angiodynamics continues to hold out hope that nanoknife will flourish one day its clear that the market has more sober expectations the device accounts for roughly  of angiodynamics revenue and the entire firm has an enterprise value of only  million the vast majority of which is obviously attributable to other products simply applying angiodynamics overall evtosales multiple to an estimate of nanoknifes sales we estimate that the market is valuing nanoknife at just  million implied market valuation of nanoknife source company filings capital iq kerrisdale analysis if pulse somehow merited the same valuation as nanoknife its shares would have  downside of course such a valuation is absurdly generous pulse has  employees and no commercial products it is years from earning significant revenue nanoknife by contrast is actually in use today there is simply nothing about pulses prototype technology that deserves a  premium to its closest comparable if a healthcare provider or payor wasnt swayed by nanoknifes selling points then pulses pitch will also fall on deaf ears though less similar to pulses nps edaps hifu product ablatherm also furnishes an example of a novel ablation tool that has fallen short commercially while ablatherm does use heat generated indirectly by sound waves to kill cancer cells and thus differs from the purportedly nonthermal approaches of ire and nps it has its own unique selling point its completely noninvasive deployed either outside the body or from within a cavity as discussed above hifu has also been found to trigger immune responses in early  edap was a hot stock quadrupling from  to  per share on the back of the companys initiation of clinical trials in the us but investor enthusiasm was shortlived ablatherms weak results described above forced edap to abandon its plan to seek approval for the devices use in prostate cancer treatment and instead pursue a narrower and far less meaningful regulatory clearance to ablate prostate tissue with no claim made as to treatment efficacy as a result ablatherm like nanoknife still suffers from a lack of insurance coverage today edap shares trade at   off some  from their peak  and the companys hifu products generated just  million of operating income in  much of edaps small market cap stems not from hifu but from its kidney stone treatment business which accounted for  of its  net sales even if we allocate half of the companys enterprise value to hifu the valuation is still just  million  very close to our estimate of what nanoknife is worth and again a tiny fraction of pulses valuation even though edap for all its flaws can at least claim to have a finished product to sell approached from any angle pulse is massively overvalued even if nps technology is all its cracked up to be at best nps is a close cousin to nanoknife an obscure poorselling product frowned up by insurers and unable to gain a commercial foothold beyond a handful of users the features that the company claims distinguish nps from all other cancer treatments and ablation modalities  its ability to foster apoptosis and spark an immune response  are in fact commonplace yet have done little to drum up sales beyond the bluster pulses technology is nothing special iv pulses technology is impotent and unreliable even if pulses nps lived up to its billing it would have little value in a world where nanoknife and other novel ablation modalities have faltered however a detailed review of the available published data shows that nps is disturbingly inconsistent and ineffective thus its overvaluation is even more extreme pulses basalcell carcinoma trial was a failure nps has almost never been used on humans the first reported case was published in  when a researcher selfadministered  nslong electrical pulses at a field strength of  kvcm to attempt to ablate a small basalcell carcinoma bcc within six weeks the bcc was replaced by a scar and surgical excision later showed that the cancer was gone  but this informal unblinded selfstudy described in only a few sentences in an old paper hardly constitutes a formal trial the first and only such trial to date was published in  in a paper whose lead author is now pulses chief scientific officer  taken at face value the trial was a success as the company later said we believe the study demonstrated npes is safe and can offer a fast and scarless alternative to current standard of care pulse has also highlighted two sets of photos of lesions treated in the trial cherrypicking the most attractive results and omitting more disturbing images notwithstanding the selective presentation its clear that this trial was in reality a failure pulse only treated three patients each of whom had multiple bcc lesions  ten in total fourteen to fifteen weeks after nps treatment based on histological analysis three of the lesions still harbored cancer the other seven did not its important to note the distribution of these failures two out of the three patients still had at least one cancerous lesion indicating that even for a single patient the effects of nps are unpredictable and inconsistent the third patient though determined by the authors to be cancerfree continued to have anomalouslooking lesions in the same locations the likes of which would send anyone to the dermatologist before and after images of basalcell carcinomas treated by nps in a successful patient source nuccitelli et al  while the published writeup of this trial claims that nps was sufficient to cause most of these lesions to disappear during the ensuing several weeks disappear hardly seems the right word for what happened every lesion in every patient developed a black scablike covering described in the paper as a crust many weeks after the crust fell off the results were still unsettlingly poor two lesions were still visibly malignant c and c one appeared relatively normal but remained cancerous d two developed seborrheic keratosis a skin condition that resembles cancer d and e two developed what the authors described as hyperpigmentation a and b shown above as well as dermal scars two looked relatively normal but suffered from dermal scars a and e one looked relatively normal b relative to pulses spin about offering a scarless alternative  as well as its longterm ambition to pursue other cosmetically sensitive dermatological indications  these outcomes are abysmal only one out of ten lesions treated can honestly be described as fixed nor is curing  of the lesions as measured just  weeks after treatment an impressive accomplishment the gold standard for the treatment of basalcell carcinoma a technique called mohs surgery is extremely effective among patients with primary bcc ie those who have never had the cancer before  are still cancerfree five years after treatment  in the nps trial by contrast just one out of three patients was cancerfree within a matter of months well likely never know the longerterm recurrence rate but it can only get worse while other treatments are less effective than mohs surgery none is nearly as bad as pulses nps nanopulse stimulation appears to be the worst known treatment for basalcell carcinoma treatment method year recurrence rate for primary bcc mohs surgery  standard surgical excision  curettage and electrodessication  radiation  cryotherapy  pulses nps  source kauvar et al   nuccitelli et al   kerrisdale analysis while pulse then bioelectromed didnt acknowledge the inferiority of its results  the efficacy of this treatment modality was good the company bizarrely insisted  it did make excuses some of the lesions could only be partially ablated the authors claimed because they were larger than the nps systems electrodes but these lesions were still quite small the largest was just  cm x  cm  in x  in moreover the researchers did attempt to cover the entirety of the lesions splitting them into multiple regions and applying many pulses to each region according to them they simply failed to do a good enough job but if implementing nps is so difficult and impractical that even small skin lesions can overwhelm it how can it possibly succeed in the real world furthermore what happened to the much vaunted immune response that nps is supposed to trigger as pulse tells the tale the technology is so powerful and immunogenic that ablating a tumor in one part of the body will prevent tumor growth in other parts in the bcc trial however improved lesions and cancerous lesions coexisted there was no sign that the former conferred any benefit upon the latter in short in its clinical debut and only published trial to date pulses nps technology badly underperformed all standard treatments for basalcell carcinoma in terms of eradicating cancer while also producing multiple unexpected and unexplained skin anomalies  and singularly failing to give any indication of positive immune benefit its no wonder that it has remained obscure nps fails to kill many cancer cells in the wake of npss abysmal debut trial researchers directly funded by pulse have very recently published another disturbing set of results to gauge the sensitivity of different human cell types both cancerous and healthy to nps the researchers applied standardized treatment regimens in vitro what they found was that the number of pulses it took to kill half the cells treated the ld varied massively and for no discernible reason across different cell types with a factor of  separating the relevant dose for the most and least sensitive categories moreover cancer cells were generally less sensitive to nps  better able to survive it  than healthy cells an obviously undesirable pattern for a putative cancer treatment while the unpredictability and inconsistency of nps is itself problematic the most alarming finding  what the authors called yet another unexpected characteristic of the survival curves  was the phenomenon of residual resistivity even after thousands of pulses a meaningful fraction  of populations of every type of cell tested continued to survive while similar examples of incomplete killing had been reported before the authors had chalked them up to methodological flaws here however they took great pains to remove all sources of doubt yet upheld their initial conclusion emphasis added we were able to find isolated live cells even after the most intense treatments residual resistivity was not an artifact but reflected an unusual level of nspef tolerance in a limited subpopulation of cells understanding the mechanism underlying this tolerance as well as methods to overcome it is essential for efficient tumor ablation by nspef and remains an area for future investigation  the data provided evidence for the highly diverse nspef sensitivity not only between cell lines but also between individual cells within each cell line the presence of these resistant cells could have a major impact on the successful ablation of tumors thus stressing the need toidentify the physiological characteristics responsible fornspef tolerance though couched in staid academic language these words mark a crisis in the companys research agenda when  of neuroblastoma cells liver cancer cells fibrosarcoma cells and pancreatic cancer cells survive even after the most intense nps exposure the notion of nps as a universal cancer treatment platform becomes absurd zapping away a fraction of a tumor wont do much good when the resistant remainder can rapidly grow back nor is there good reason to expect that pulse researchers can quickly solve this problem after all as described in the paper they already tested many possible explanations but failed to find one that fit the facts stepping back it should come as no surprise that a tumor ablation modality that purportedly relies on apoptosis would falter after all in order to become cancerous in the first place cells must be able to overcome natural checks on aberrant growth including apoptosis as tumors grow proapoptotic mechanisms tend to weaken and fail  by contrast its difficult for cells to resist physical interventions like freezing temperatures or scalpels there is thus good reason to believe that the latest finding of pulses own research  that many cells both healthy and cancerous cannot be killed by nps  will stand the test of time and render its technology worthless v conclusion pulse is a tiny company that has made virtually no progress toward commercializing a technology that barely seems to work in the first place  yet the market is pricing it as if it were already x more valuable than its closest peer in the years to come the company will need to repeatedly raise capital to cover its cash outflows as it attempts to inch closer to becoming a real business but we believe this money will be wasted pulses nps technology is simply too similar to nanoknifes irreversible electroporation to gain much traction especially when the best available

pulse biosciences pulse biosciences pulse biosciences is a developmentstage medical device company using a novel and proprietary platform technology called nanopulse stimulation or nps   nps is a local and drugfree technology that utilizes nanosecond pulsed electric fields to induce cell signaling and the activation of cellular pathways in tissue we believe that nps can induce a variety of cellular responses including secretion apoptosis and necrosis by modulating the nps pulses making it applicable to a wide variety of cell types and therapeutic applications one of the more promising applications of nps is the treatment of solid tumors where preclinical data have shown that nps provides effective local tumor control and initiates an adaptive immune response with a vaccinelike effect by inducing immunogenic apoptosis of the cells we believe we will establish nps as a new treatment modality across a variety of applications including oncology dermatology and other minimally invasive applications where current ablation modalities do not provide the benefits of nps       one of the more promising applications of nps is the treatment of solid tumors where preclinical data have shown that nps provides effective local tumor control and initiates an adaptive immune response code of business conduct and ethics  pulse biosciences code of business conduct and ethics introduction pulse biosciences inc “pulse” is committed to maintaining the highest standards of business conduct and ethics this code of business conduct and ethics “code” reflects the business practices and principles of behavior that support this commitment and is designed to deter wrongdoing and promote the standards set forth within this code does not address every issue that may arise in the course of your work but it sets out basic principles and standards applicable to all pulse employees officers directors temporary agency personnel and contract personnel on a worldwide basis “pulse personnel” who must conduct themselves in accordance with this code and seek to avoid even the appearance of improper behavior and is designed to deter wrongdoing and promote the standards set forth within we expect all pulse personnel to read and understand the code and its application to the performance of his or her business responsibilities officers managers and other supervisors are expected to develop in employees a sense of commitment to the letter and spirit of the code supervisors are also expected to ensure that all agents and contractors conform to code standards when working for or on behalf of pulse the compliance environment within each supervisor’s assigned area of responsibility will be a factor in evaluating the quality of that individual’s performance in addition any pulse personnel who makes an exemplary effort to implement and uphold our legal and ethical standards will be recognized for that effort in his or her performance review this code covers a wide range of business practices and procedures and is designed to encourage good behavior and promote the standards set forth below it is intended to advise pulse personnel of situations that could possibly result in noncompliance with applicable laws rules or regulations while strict compliance by pulse personnel with applicable legal requirements is not a new policy this code is intended to establish a framework for compliance this code does not include all of pulse’s practices that are designed to achieve compliance with legal and ethical requirements as pulse maintains and implements other policies and procedures that are intended to supplement the code pulse personnel are also subject to other agreements such as confidentiality and noncompetition agreements and agreements to protect our intellectual property from time to time we may adopt additional policies and procedures with which pulse personnel are expected to comply if applicable to them however it is the responsibility of each person to apply common sense together with his or her own highest personal ethical standards in making business decisions where there is no stated guideline in the code if a pulse personnel is uncertain about a course of action he or she should consult the compliance officer or pulse’s outside legal counsel “counsel” to the extent that there is any conflict between a national state or local law rule or regulation and a policy in this code you must comply with the applicable law or regulation however if a local custom or policy conflicts with this code you must comply with this code if you have any questions about these conflicts you should ask pulse’s compliance officer or the counsel action by members of your immediate family significant others or other persons who live in your household or are dependent on you for their wellbeing referred to in the code as “family members” also may potentially result in ethical issues to the extent that they involve pulse’s business for example acceptance of inappropriate payments or gifts by a family member from one of our suppliers could create a conflict of interest and result in a code violation attributable to you consequently in complying with the code you should consider not only your own conduct but also that of your immediate family members significant others and other persons who live in your household you should not hesitate to ask questions about whether any conduct may violate the code voice concerns or clarify gray areas section xx below details the compliance resources available to you in addition you must be alert to possible violations of the code by others and report suspected violations without fear of any form of retaliation as further described in section  corporate integrity it is the policy of pulse to promote high standards of integrity by conducting our affairs in an honest and ethical manner the integrity and reputation of pulse depends on the honesty fairness and integrity brought to the job by each person associated with us unyielding personal integrity is the foundation of corporate integrity this responsibility cannot be delegated or assumed by pulse or any supervisor  conflicts of interest your decisions and actions during your employment with pulse should be based on the best interests of pulse and not personal relationships or benefits a “conflict of interest” exists when a person’s private interests interfere or appear to interfere with the interests of pulse you must avoid any private interest that may influence your ability to act in the interests of pulse or that may make it difficult for you to perform your work objectively there are many types of conflicts of interest—the following are some common examples • outside employment pulse strongly discourages outside employment  you may not have outside employment or business dealings with any of the following i any organization that prepares audits or certifies statements or documents pertinent to our business and financial accounts and ii our current and potential clients competitors vendors and suppliers • financial interests no pulse personnel may obtain improper benefits or favors because of his or her position with pulse  further no pulse personnel may have a financial interest either directly or through a family member in a business enterprise if that interest affects the performance of their duties or conflicts with the interests of pulse • corporate opportunity no person may use pulse property or information or his or her position with pulse to secure a personal business opportunity or a business opportunity for a family member if you discover a business opportunity through the use of pulse property information or through your position at pulse you must first present the opportunity to pulse before pursuing the opportunity in your individual capacity • service on boards or committees no pulse personnel may serve on a board of directors or trustees or on a committee of any entity whose interests could be expected to conflict with those of pulse pulse personnel must obtain approval from the compliance officer before accepting any such position community participation by pulse personnel is considered important however pulse also encourages those planning on participating in a charitable or other community organization to consult with the compliance officer before taking a service or board position with those types of entities • fees and honorariums with prior approval pulse personnel acting in their capacity as a representative of pulse may give lectures conduct seminars publish articles in books or engage in any other similar activity for which he or she may be paid a fee or honorarium however any fees honorariums or reimbursements must be transferred to pulse unless written approval is given to retain them a conflict of interest will sometimes develop accidentally and is not always easy to identify if you feel you have a conflict you must disclose it to the compliance officer further any potential conflicts must be identified in connection with your annual review of this code finally if you observe a situation that you believe to be a conflict you must report that as well  insider trading pulse personnel with access to confidential nonpublic information are not permitted to use or share that information for stock trading purposes pulse personnel and their family members may not a trade in stock or other securities while in possession of material nonpublic information or b pass on material nonpublic information to others without express authorization by pulse or recommend to others that they trade in stock or other securities based on material nonpublic information violation of this section of the code and other policies about insider trading may result in a violation of securities laws and potentially exposes pulse personnel and pulse to significant legal fines and imprisonment all pulse personnel should consult the insider trading policy of pulse and discuss all proposed transactions in pulse securities with the compliance officer or counsel before they are undertaken  competition and fair dealing pulse seeks to compete fairly and honestly  pulse personnel should endeavor to respect the rights of and deal fairly with our customers suppliers competitors and employees  no pulse personnel should take unfair advantage of anyone through manipulation concealment abuse of privileged information misrepresentation of material facts or any other intentional unfairdealing practice the purpose of business entertainment and gifts in a commercial setting is to create good will and sound working relationships not to gain unfair advantage with customers the basic principal is that no gift or entertainment may be accepted or provided if it obligates you or appears to obligate you to the individual receiving or giving the gift or entertainment unless approved in advance by the compliance officer government officials of the united states the states and municipalities and officials of foreign governments at all levels should not be entertained in any special manner or given any gifts no gift or entertainment should ever be offered given provided or accepted by any pulse personnel family member or agent unless it  is not a cash gift  is consistent with customary business practices  is not excessive in value  cannot be construed as a bribe or payoff and  does not violate any laws or regulations  please discuss with the compliance officer any gifts or proposed gifts which you are not certain are appropriate to give or receive pulse also has strict rules concerning contractual agreements all terms of our business agreements must be expressed in an approved form of contract or purchase orderinformal commitments to customers are strictly prohibited these kinds of commitments might be made in a face to face conversation a telephone call or an email  therefore persons must be careful to use only our approved forms of contracting and not to unintentionally modify a written and approved contract purchase order or other agreement    respecting others pulse is committed to fostering an inclusive workplace where talented people want to stay and develop their careers and advance the scientific area in which we operate  supporting a diverse engaged workforce allows us to be successful in building trust empowering teams and outperforming our peers and competitors pulse requires the pulse personnel to act with mutual respect and give professional treatment to others in our workplace teamwork is essential to our future and nothing damages a team more quickly than a lack of mutual respect pulse personnel share a mutual responsibility to keep one another informed of any information that may be important to everyone’s job performance and understanding our business and goals pulse recognizes your right to form personal relationships with those you meet in the workplace however you are expected to use good judgment to ensure your personal relationships do not negatively affect your job performance or interfere with your or our ability to supervise pulse personnel favoritism open displays of affection and making business decisions based on emotions or personal relationships are inappropriate situations that involve borrowing money or making loans between pulse personnel or involving family members must be avoided unless it is a minimal amount similarly exceptional gifts and entertainment between and among pulse personnel can create conflicts and such situations should be avoided use your good judgment to act respectfully to one another  discrimination and harassment the diversity of the pulse’s personnel is a tremendous asset  pulse is firmly committed to providing equal opportunity in all aspects of employment and strictly prohibits any form of harassment in the workplace on the basis of a protected characteristic such as race religion creed color sex age marital status national origin sexual orientation citizenship status vietnamera or disabled veteran status medical condition or physical or mental disability we will promptly take appropriate action to prevent and discipline behavior that violates this policy pulse will not tolerate any form of harassment harassment can be verbal physical or include visual images or behaviors that have the effect of creating an offensive atmosphere it can take many forms and includes pictures drawings cartoons jokes slurs and offensive remarks whether delivered verbally graphically or in electronic media including email  offensive behavior and remarks may involve inappropriate remarks about a person’s race color sex age sexual orientation gender identity religion disability national origin and other legally protected status  sexual harassment may include intentional or unintentional unwelcome sexual advances with or without touching coerced sexual acts requests or demands for sexual favors or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature our policy against harassment applies in all workrelated settings and activities whether on or off company premises it also extends to pulse personnel interactions with our supplies vendors clinical participants and other with which pulse acts therefore think before you speak or act be careful about what you say and do where you say or do something when you say or do something and your objective in something you say or your actions which might be received as inappropriate or as harassment  health and safety pulse strives to provide a safe and healthy work environment  each employee has responsibility for maintaining a safe and healthy workplace for all pulse personnel by following safety and health rules and practices and reporting accidents injuries and unsafe equipment practices or conditions violence and threatening behavior are not permitted pulse personnel should report to work in condition to perform their duties free from the influence of illegal drugs or alcohol  the use of illegal drugs and alcohol in the workplace will not be tolerated pulse personnel many not bring weapons onto pulse property or to pulse sponsored events this includes weapons used for sporting purposes or otherwise whether or not you have a license to carry or use the weapons weapons of any kind have no place in the work environment pulse personnel should be alert to individuals who are on pulse property without proper authorization make sure you observe all physical access rules in your location and report incidents of unauthorized entry to your manager or to security personnel  financial integrity accurate and reliable financial and business records are of critical importance in meeting pulse’s financial legal and business obligations you must complete all pulse documents accurately truthfully and in a timely manner including all travel and expense reports the making of false or misleading entries records reports or documentation is strictly prohibited we are required to disclose accurate and complete information regarding pulse and the results of our operations it is pulse policy to make full fair accurate timely and understandable disclosure in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations in all documents that pulse provides to investors government agencies and in all other public communications made by pulse dishonest or inaccurate reporting can lead to civil or even criminal liability for you and pulse and can lead to a loss of public faith in pulse anyone who believes that a violation of law or a failure of compliance has occurred or is occurring has a duty to report such information to the general counsel or to the audit committee of the board of directors  confidentiality pulse personnel must maintain the confidentiality of confidential information entrusted to them by pulse  confidential information includes all nonpublic information regarding pulse such as our research activities and results of our research and development our past current and intended technologies our patents our knowhow and the conduct and results of any clinical trials as well as in the case of human subjects the particulars about participants in those trials confidential information also includes information about our licensors and licensees our suppliers and our customers additionally you should not discuss the private affairs of your coworkers and their work histories our employees are subject to noncompetition confidentiality inventions and secrets provisions in separate agreements which must be strictly followed  the obligation to preserve confidential information continues even after employment ends  protection and proper use of pulse assets pulse personnel should endeavor to protect all of our assets and ensure their efficient use theft carelessness and waste have a direct impact on pulse’s profitability  pulse equipment should not be used for noncompany business though incidental personal use may be permitted the obligation of pulse personnel to protect our assets includes protecting its proprietary information proprietary information includes intellectual property such as trade secrets patents trademarks and copyrights as well as business marketing and service plans engineering and manufacturing ideas designs databases records salary information and any unpublished financial data and reports unauthorized use or distribution of this information would violate this code and other policies of pulse as well as employment related agreements it could also be illegal this behavior may result in dismissal and result in civil or criminal penalties  working with government personnel pulse from time to time may work with government agencies in different capacities such as the approval process for our technologies licensing of our technologies patent prosecutions and government grants while you must follow the standards of doing what is right with any party with which pulse has concourse there are special rules with doing business with a government and its officials the us foreign corrupt practices act prohibits giving anything of value including gifts meals entertainments or other benefits directly or indirectly to officials and their family members of foreign governments or foreign political candidates in order to obtain or retain business  pulse personnel are strictly prohibited from making illegal payments to government officials of any country in addition the us government has a number of laws and regulations regarding business gratuities which may be accepted by us government personnel the promise offer or delivery to an official or employee of the us government of a gift favor which can include a promise to do something or other gratuity in violation of these rules would not only violate pulse policy but could also be a criminal offense  state and local governments as well as foreign governments may have similar rules pulse’s counsel can provide guidance to you in this area you also must not accept or present anything if it obligates you or appears to obligate you to do something for any government official or other person don’t attempt to avoid laws by making payments to or through third parties be cautious when selecting or dealing with agents and thirdparty providers never make any payment that you do not record on the pulse books and records never issue invoices or charges that are inaccurate incorrect or unauthorized pulse personnel are expected to cooperate with government officials in investigations and audits do not avoid contravene or otherwise interfere with any government investigation or audit and do not destroy or alter any pulse documents whether electronic or paper in anticipation of a request for those documents from a government body   waivers of the code of business conduct and ethics waivers of this code will be made only in rare situations the waiver will ordinarily require the agreement of the board of directors of pulse and may have to be disclosed to the shareholders some waivers may only be permitted with the additional compliance of an applicable law  reporting any illegal or unethical behavior pulse personnel are strongly encouraged bring questions or concerns about what to do in a certain situation or if you believe someone is doing or is about to do something that violates the law pulse policies or this code pulse personnel should discuss observed illegal or unethical behavior with supervisors managers or other appropriate personnel such as the compliance officer pulse personnel may report a concern or report misconduct in good faith pulse has zero tolerance for acts of retaliation by pulse personnel against one another zero means zero – no one has the authority to justify any act of retaliation any pulse personnel who engages in retaliation will be subject to disciplinary action which may include dismissal  compliance procedures we must all work to ensure prompt and consistent action against violations of the code however in some situations it is difficult to know if a violation has occurred  since we cannot anticipate every situation that will arise it is important that we have a way to approach a new question or problem these are the steps to keep in mind • make sure you have all the facts in order to reach the right solutions we must be as fully informed as possible • ask yourself  what specifically am i being asked to do  does it seem unethical or improper this will enable you to focus on the specific question you are faced with and the alternatives you have use your judgment and common sense if something seems unethical or improper it probably is • clarify your responsibility and role in most situations there is shared responsibility are your colleagues informed it may help to get others involved and discuss the problem • discuss the problem with your supervisor this is the basic guidance for all situations in many cases your supervisor will be more knowledgeable about the question and will appreciate being brought into the decisionmaking process remember that it is your supervisor’s responsibility to help solve problems • seek help from pulse resources in the rare case where it may not be appropriate to discuss an issue with your supervisor or where you do not feel comfortable approaching your supervisor with your question you may discuss the situation with either the

company’s website at wwwpulsebiosciencescom about pulse biosciences pulse biosciences is a medical technology company developing a therapeutic tissue treatment platform based on nanopulse stimulation a proprietary cell signaling technology nanopulse stimulation is a nonthermal precise focal drugfree tissue treatment technology that directly affects the cell membrane and intracellular structures to stimulate unique behaviors in cells nps can initiate a cell death process that allows for the treatment of tissue cells with minimal inflammatory response which improves healing outcomes and supports the replacement of treated tissue cells with healthy tissue cells in cancerous lesions nps has been shown in preclinical models to induce immunogenic cell death icd exposing the unique antigens of the treated cells to the immune system resulting in the generation of cytotoxic tcells and the mounting of an adaptive immune response targeted against those cells pulse biosciences is investigating a variety of applications for its technology that exploits the technology’s unique biologic effect including immunooncology dermatology and veterinary medicine more information is available at

biosciences inc nasdaqplse “pulse” submitted k to the fda for its pulsetx™ system the market expects that this company will make a lot of money if the product is successful since the share price has not stopped climbing from the ipo we also believe that if the fda does not accept the pulsetx™ system we will see a big correction take place in plse take a look at the chart it’s been nothing but vertical for the stock this year in this article we will try to throw some light on pulse biosciences we will provide you some information about the technology as well as information about what the insiders are doing once you read this information it is up to you to decide the technology pulsetx™ system uses a “therapeutic tissue treatment platform based on nanopulse stimulation nps“ the company explained the “nanopulse stimulation” concept in the following terms “nps is a nonthermal drugfree tissue treatment technology that can stimulate unique behaviors in cells by applying ultrashort nanosecond duration electrical pulses that affect the cell membrane and intracellular structures nps can be used for tissue removal by inducing cell death in tissue cells with minimal inflammatory response which improves healing and supports the replacement of treated tissue cells with healthy tissue cells in preclinical cancer studies nps has been shown to induce immunogenic cell death a cell death process that destroys the treated cells and exposes the tumor cell antigens to the immune system resulting in the generation of cytotoxic tcells and the mounting of an adaptive immune response targeted against the tumor cells” source i also found an explanatory video about this concept filmed by richard nuccitelli professor in the uc davis college of biological sciences source the following is the poster that the research group of pulse biosciences presented to the society of immunotherapy of cancer annual scientific meeting in november  this technology may be useful for the “treatment of tumor cell lines” source in the following poster the company shows that the nanopulse stimulation may be also useful for the treatment of “murine melanomas that initiates an immune response and inhibits metastasis” source finally the company also presented a poster explaining “adaptive immune response to nps” source past developments of the company the company is quite young which is something that investors need to take into account investing in new share issues is in most cases riskier than investing in matured companies the ipo happened in may  the company offered  shares to the public at a price of just  per share in addition to this offering the company granted the underwriters  shares the book runners included mdb capital group and feltl and company the company did not issue a lot of information in the first part of  apart from the appointment of mr edward ebbers as vice president and general manager of its dermatology products and  holly hartman phd jd as its vice president business development and corporate strategy however in october and november  pulse presented new data and uses of the technology to the scientific community and it was from that time the stock commenced to climb pulse biosciences announces new data that reinforce potential immunooncology benefits of nanopulse stimulation technology pulse biosciences to present new data at the society for immunotherapy in cancer annual meeting pulse biosciences announces first clinical use of the proprietary pulsetx platform in a pilot study in dermatology the most relevant press release that we found in  was the application to the fda which we have already mentioned and the fact that two executives of the firm robert duggan and dr maky zanganeh had acquired a large shareholder interest in the company conclusion readers need to understand that this is a new technology and the fda still needs to approve it the stock returns are exceptional but the company is in an early stage therefore it is very difficult to predict what will happen in the future plse is one that we are monitoring closely we will be updating our subscribers as soon as we know more for the latest updates on plse

comments mark lintner march   at  pm chris only covers under  stocks well i’m glad you wrote the article jarrod i think we got  in the bag here down the road on plse there is one puzzling thing though i’ve never seen a stock run this much that was not at least  institutional owned we got some texas boys with a d some insider stuff but no retail who is buying this the street traders only burned shorts in my now rd year of playing stocks maybe i have seen  others like this that ran up mega huge and actually held with less than  institutional ownership putting that aside though this nano volt technology to destroy tumors could be the way of the future in cancer therapy long term investors could see  there is one thing to note though they got some shares that will unlock in may stock could get shaky then time will tell they burn through roughly  mil every  quarters or so seeking alpha writers have been dogging this stock for awhile saying short it since it was  that advice turned out to be pretty stupid and painful  reply jarrod wesson march   at  am thanks mark the stock returns are exceptional there is a lot of people making money here let’s see what happens reply mark lintner march   at  am see if you get them angry enough they start whaling away grant it saying short plse above  would of been an a move however sa said short plse at  so you still get an f for that call guys those shorts at  got forced out over  and got wiped out for  losses isn’t it obvious now they were the buyers above  now it’s going to  i give myself an f for saying  but an a for the long trade from  reply mark lintner april   at  pm if plse wants their stock back to  it’s real simple it doesn’t matter if the stock gets diluted we are talking about destroying tumors put the data out showing those tumors are gone and this stock will run up so much shorts will be jumping out windows think that short from  to  was painful you will see real pain later anything below  this stock is a strong buy again let them shake out this unlocking stuff we may get as low as  so buy in little bits on way down the one downside is for now you cannot hedge with put options normally i buy the stock long and buy some long puts if the stock drops more sell those long puts and take that profit to buy more of the stock long at lower prices some will short sell to open calls for a hedge it’s possible if your a whale you could write options for plse but most folks can’t do that here so you gotta play it this way say you want  shares buy  share lots as it goes down  times for a total of  gets your average cost down this stock is like gasoline as far as volatility it could drop to  or sky rocket to  over the next  months this is no joke totally serious folks one or the other it will not chart flatline between  for long i guarantee it don’t be an idiot either and short it anymore if you shorted it between  start covering don’t be a moron good luck all reply leave a reply cancel reply your

public offering price of  per share after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses of  will be approximately  million or  million if the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares is exercised in full we intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to fund •  million to  million of ongoing research and development of our products and npes technology including but not limited to • clinical and preclinical research and development with respect to applications of our npes technology including labor and • product development including labor costs equipment prototype and clinical instruments and third party development costs •  million to  million of general corporate purposes including working capital business development commercialization activities administrative support services hiring of additional personnel and the costs of operating as a public company we also may use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire complementary products services technologies or businesses however we have no understandings agreements or commitments with respect to any such acquisition at this time you will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of the net proceeds we anticipate using a portion of the proceeds of this offering to pay mdb capital group llc for services rendered related to patent related matters currently the company has accrued fees in the amount of  related to patents and it will continue to incur amounts due for future fees which cannot be estimated at this time we also will use a portion of the proceeds to pay the employment obligations of the company to dr richard nuccitelli under his written employment agreement which has an annual salary amount of  if we engage the frank reidy center at old dominion university for additional research as the company engaged them in the past under a research funding agreement then the company will use a portion of the proceeds of this offering for that purpose however at this time there are no specific plans in place to engage the center for these services pending their use we plan to invest our net proceeds from this offering in shortterm interestbearing obligations investmentgrade instruments certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the united states government we believe that the net proceeds from this offering combined with our existing cash resources will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements for at least  months subsequent to the closing of the offering until we are able to generate sustainable revenues that generate a profit we expect to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings debt financings or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements such additional funds may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all particularly in light of recent market conditions if we raise funds by issuing equity securities the ownership of our stockholders will be diluted and the new equity securities may have priority rights over our existing stockholders the applications we intend to target are subject to intense competition from rapidly evolving companies and new scientific discoveries we compete against wellestablished incumbent technologies offering products in oncology dermatology and aesthetics minimally invasive treatments and veterinary applications given the broad scope of pulse biosciences’ technology we face competition ranging from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to small manufacturers with focused products as well as providers of other medical therapies and therapeutics for conditions that we intend to treat our future success will depend on our ability to establish and maintain a competitive position in current and future technologies we compete with multiple new technologies stimulating the immune system to target cancer better understanding of the multiple mechanisms by which cancer or precancerous cells can evade the immune system has helped researchers develop drugs targeting immune inhibitors or stimulating t cells currently approved treatments focus on stimulating the immune system in a global way which leads to significant side effects including autoimmune diseases companies with approved checkpoint inhibitors include bristol meyers squibb and merck cart cell therapy has gained attention recently which refers to a therapy where t cells are removed from a patient and modified to express receptors on its surface that is specific to a cancer type these cells are then cultured and infused back into the body companies developing cart therapies include juno therapeutics and kite pharma we compete with multiple tissue eradication technologies these technologies cause immediate cell necrosis killing cells within seconds to hours following exposure and triggering inflammation pulse biosciences’ technology is unique and differentiated in that npes cause cell death over a period of days by a process of cell signaling that leads to immunogenic apoptosis this allows for immune activation and decreases scarring or collateral damage to surrounding tissues tissue ablating technologies include radiofrequency microwave cryoablation laser and irreversible electroporation irreversible electroporation uses pulsed electric fields at a high voltage in millisecond or microsecond pulse widths these pulses cause cell membranes to irreversibly permeabilize resulting in necrosis death of the tumor cells ire destroys cells without excessive heat or cold thus making it a good option in places where normal adjacent tissues such as blood vessels should not be damaged however this technology stimulates nerves and muscles making it necessary to use general anesthesia and muscle blockade during treatment in contrast the  times shorter npes pulses do not require the use of muscle blockade moreover pulse biosciences’ technology transiently permeabilizes internal organelles which can lead to a signaling cascade ending in immunogenic apoptosis rather than necrosis tissue ablation companies for therapeutic applications include medtronic boston scientific and st jude medical ablation companies for dermatologic and aesthetic applications include alma lasers cutera and syneron medical company description we are a developmentstage medical device company using a novel and proprietary platform technology called nanopulse electrosignaling or npes npes is a local and drugfree technology that utilizes ultrashort nanosecond pulsed electric fields to induce cell signaling and the activation of cellular pathways in tissue we believe that npes can induce a variety of cellular responses including secretion apoptosis and necrosis by modulating the npes pulses making it applicable to a wide variety of cell types and therapeutic applications one of the more promising applications of npes is the treatment of solid tumors where preclinical data developed by pulse biosciences and others have shown that npes provides effective local tumor control and initiates an adaptive immune response with a vaccinelike effect by inducing immunogenic apoptosis of the treated cells we believe we will establish npes as a new treatment modality across a variety of applications including both veterinary and human oncology dermatology aesthetics and other minimally invasive applications where current ablation modalities do not provide the benefits of npes we are developing a proprietary system for the delivery of npes treatments currently identified as the pulsetxtm system or “pulsetx” the pulsetx system delivers npes pulses through its proprietary tunable pulse generator and its planned suite of electrodes the pulsetx system pulses are applied directly to tissue through electrodes creating transient nanometer pores in cell and organelle membranes for the treatment of cancer we believe that we can trigger a signaling cascade within the tumor cells that ends in immunogenic apoptosis immunogenic apoptosis is a process in which cells are induced to die in a natural way initiating their own programmed cell death engaging the immune system to clear damaged diseased or aged cells and enrolling cytotoxic t cells to recognize and eliminate cells of the same tumor type we believe we are the only medical device company with the intellectual property technology and knowhow to be able to produce this natural cell death using npes to initiate cell signaling that induces the targeted adaptive immune response many other medical device companies produce products for ablating tumors using a number of different modalities including the use of extreme heat radiofrequency microwave or electrocauterization or cold cryoablation or electric fields with much longer pulses irreversible electroporation and high energy radiation the use of these modalities generally leads to cellular necrosis we believe npes differs significantly as it offers a nonthermal and nonionizing ablative technology that can be selectively tuned to induce apoptosis reducing the potential for inflammation and collateral damage to surrounding tissue we believe that this less destructive approach lends itself to a number of applications including tumors which would otherwise be inoperable because of proximity to critical structures to date we believe there have been few observed disadvantages in the use of npes in animal studies in over  rats and mice our predecessors and others have treated tumors with npes with no consistent side effects observed the few problems observed in the animal studies to date resulted from improper placement of the electrodes and some pain was observed unless anesthetized during treatment no side effects have been detected to date from the human clinical trials although our trials have been limited to preclinical animal trials and data from a limited number of subjects in clinical trials we believe results to date will be representative of larger subject populations the discovery of npes was first documented in  at old dominion university during the  years since that discovery many scientists have studied this technology at universities and research institutes around the world and over  publications have appeared to date elucidating the effectiveness of npes in cancer treatment on a wide variety of cancer cell lines and animal tumor models the research at these institutions has been funded by grants from the national institutes of health nih small business innovation research sbir department of defense dod commonwealth of virginia air force of scientific research and the army research office and multidisciplinary university research initiative muri pulse biosciences has licensed or acquired the intellectual property pertaining to npes from the leading npes research centers old dominion university the university of southern california and bioelectromed corp this concentration of npes intellectual property we believe puts pulse biosciences in a unique position to commercialize this platform technology  schoenbach
