visuals for  songs in under  weeks with all elements of the show being hand drawn there was initially a huge quantity of elements that needed to be drawn before they could be turned into looping animations and eventually videos once an extensive spread sheet of all the elements that needed to be created was made a very small team of illustrators spent two weeks drawing the  odd images required to make up s of loops with such time pressures the illustrators drew directly into photoshop using waacom graphic tablets all drawings were done with the same photoshop brush and line weight with careful attention being paid to attempt to make each illustrators work look like they have all been drawn by the same hand anna worked specifically on certain loops the required more designing like the loops in feel and how can you swallow so much sleep the actual animation process was completed by an even smaller team the entire show was created in adobe after effects and unlike many other projects it was nearly plugin free this was an intentional decision to prevent the show looking effecty this would have taken away from the hand drawn organic feeling over the show a lot of time went

in our online store introduction when did adam come into existence evolutionists say homo sapiens came into existence  to  years ago depending on which evolutionist you consult because they do not all agree on what a homo sapiens is can we harmonize that with the teaching of god’s word today many christians including many leaders and scholars think they can from my reading and interaction with oldearth creationists of all varieties in  countries over the last  years i think one reason many of them think they can harmonize the two is that they have not paid very careful attention to the relevant biblical texts they have just assumed that the scientists have proven the age of the creation to be billions of years and the age of mankind to be many tens or hundreds of thousands of years they often recite the mantra that “the bible is not a science textbook” thereby confusing the vital difference between origin science and operation science as discussed in this book’s introduction therefore it is claimed the bible does not deal with the issue of the age of mankind or even how man came into existence another reason that a great many christians think that the age of man and the universe does not matter and that the scientific establishment’s view does not conflict with scripture is because they or their teachers have been influenced by william henry green the famous old testament professor at princeton theological seminary wrote an article in  in which he argued that “the genealogies in genesis  and  were not intended to be used and cannot properly be used for the construction of a chronology” he concluded that “the scriptures furnish no data for a chronological computation prior to the life of abraham and that the mosaic records do not fix and were not intended to fix the precise date either of the flood or of the creation of the world” in other words green contended the bible is silent about the age of man and also the age of the earth and universe so scientists are free to determine these ages according to the scientific evidence and christians need not reject or fear any date so determined of course green was not the first to reject the biblical chronology prior to abraham most of the church had accepted the millions of years at the beginning of the th century christian leaders proposed the gap theory or the dayage view of genesis  to accommodate all those years other reinterpretations were developed in the th century such as the revelatory day view the framework view the promised land view the analogical day view the daygapdaygapday view and the cosmic templefunctionality view to name a few most advocates of these views have also reinterpreted the account of noah’s flood to be a large but localized flood in the mesopotamian valley modernday iraq or a myth which in either case has no bearing on the geological record which supposedly reveals the millions of years nevertheless green had a significant influence on a great many scholars who have taught christians that we all need to simply “agree to disagree” about the time before abraham they insist that the age question is an unimportant and divisive side issue that we can leave to the scientists to determine these influential evangelical scholars who followed green directly or indirectly include bb warfield who in turn many recent evangelical theologians and others cite in support of their oldearth views being consistent with scripture francis schaeffer wayne grudem millard erickson walter kaiser robert newman c john collins norman geisler and ronald youngblood in this chapter i will present some of the reasons for concluding that these great scholars were wrong on this important point and have thereby misled many pastors and lay people genesis – is history before attempting to determine the date of adam’s creation i want to make a few more comments about the historicity of genesis to supplement and complement the arguments in previous chapters the early chapters of genesis are not poetry a series of parables or prophetic visions or mythology the chapters recount god’s acts in timespace history acts of creation providence and redemption when we insist that genesis – is history we are not saying that this section of the bible is only history ie that it was only inspired to satisfy some of our curiosity about origins it is far more than history for it teaches theology morality and redemption and those truths are vitally important but genesis – is not less than history and what it teaches on the latter themes is rooted in that history if the history is not true then the theology morality and gospel based on that history is seriously called into question if not rejected several lines of evidence demonstrate that this introductory section of scripture is to be understood as history first the hebrew wawconsecutive verb forms used in genesis  and continuing through the rest of the book are characteristic of hebrew narrative but not of hebrew poetry second genesis  does not have the dominant characteristic of hebrew poetry namely parallelism where the truth in the first part of a verse is repeated in different ways in the second part eg ps      but those who hold to the framework view claim there is a different kind of parallelism in genesis  that should lead us to conclude that genesis  is not straightforward history they say that days – describe the created space and days – discuss the creatures that fill those spaces where day  is linked to day  day  to day  and day  to day  but this claimed parallelism only works if one overlooks the details of the text the heavenly bodies made on day  were placed in the expanse which was made on day  not day  the sea creatures made on day  filled the water which was made on day  of the seas which was formed on day  not day  and nothing was made on day  to fill the seas which were made on day  there are many more serious exegetical problems with the framework view third genesis – has the same characteristics of historical narrative as genesis – most of exodus much of numbers joshua  and  kings etc genesis – describes real people by name real events in their lives real places and geographical areas by name real times days months years etc fourth the eleven toledoths “these are the generations of ” sprinkled through genesis tie the whole book together as a unit and no truly evangelical bible scholar doubts that genesis – is history fifth in every case that jesus new testament authors and old testament authors referred to the events in genesis – they always treated the text as straightforward literal history and they all knew the difference between truth and myth jesus referred to genesis more than any other book and the gospels record him saying “it is written”  times and “have you not read”  times in reference to all three divisions of the ot the law pentateuch prophets and psalms eg luke  this shows that jesus’ default hermeneutic was just read it it means what it says even most oldearth proponents recognize that genesis – is history and virtually all christians prior to the th century read it that way so there are many good biblical and historical reasons for taking genesis – as literal history in which all the details matter and are inerrant given that fact we need to look carefully at those details from the beginning of creation to adam how long how long was it from the first moment of creation to the creation of adam according to evolutionists the big bang when they say nothing suddenly became something was about  billion years ago and the first true man appeared  billion years after the beginning or about  years ago in contrast to the evolutionary view youngearth creationists believe the whole creation is only a few thousand years old but it should be noted that while they do all agree that there were only five literal days of history before adam they do not all agree about the age of the earth and therefore about how long ago adam was created some argue that there may be missing names in the genealogies of genesis  and  and therefore up to a few thousand years could be added between adam and abraham so that the first day of creation was perhaps  to  years ago on the other hand three of the world’s leading youngearth creationist organizations answers in genesis institute for creation research and creation ministries international argue that there are no gaps and that therefore the beginning gen  was a little more than  years ago though open to gaps in the s by  henry morris the most influential youngearth proponent of the th century also took genesis  and  as strict chronologies the evidence that the evolutionary dates are utterly false and that there were only five literal days before adam was created is discussed briefly as follows for more depth consult the footnoted sources the meaning of “day” hebrew yom in genesis  the very dominant meaning of yom in the old testament is a literal day and the context of genesis  confirms that meaning there yom is defined in its two literal or normal senses in verse  the light portion of the dark light cycle and the whole darklight cycle it is repeatedly modified by a number one day second day etc which elsewhere in the old testament always means a literal normal hour day each of the six days ends with the refrain “evening was and morning was” and everywhere in the ot where ‘ereb “evening” boqer “morning” and layalah “night” are used they always mean a literal part of a literal day yom is defined again literally in verse  in relation to the movement of the heavenly bodies and the sun moon and stars do enable us to measure literal days literal years and literal seasons the numbering of the days and the repeated refrain along with the repetition of “and it was so” x “god saw” x and “it was good” x coupled with exodus – see below emphatically indicate that these creation days were sequential and nonoverlapping the creative acts of one day were complete before the next day began we also should note that if god indeed created over long ages of time there are various ways in hebrew that he could have said that he could have used dor translated as time period or generation in genesis  exodus   deuteronomy  or he could have used a phrase such as “after many days” josh  or “thousands of ten thousands” of years cf gen  or “myriad thousands” of years cf num  or “years of many generations” joel  he could have borrowed a word from a neighboring language as many languages do today and as god did with the aramaic time words zeman or iddan in the books of nehemiah and daniel instead god chose to use the only hebrew word yom that means a literal hour day the order in which god created not only does the time period of creation in genesis  contradict the time claimed for the evolution of all these things but the order of creation in genesis  also contradicts the order of events in the evolutionary story in at least  points for example the bible says the earth was created before light and before the sun and stars just the opposite of the bigbang theory the bible says that fruit trees were created before any sea creatures and that birds were created before dinosaurs which were made on day  since they are land animals exactly the opposite of the evolutionary story evolution says that initially the earth was a hot molten ball that cooled to develop a hard crust and then evolved an atmosphere that produced rain and then with the help of melted asteroids produced oceans but genesis says the earth was completely covered with water for two days and then dry land appeared according to evolution the earth has never been covered with a global ocean but according to the bible the earth has been completely covered with water twice the first two days of creation and noah’s flood it is impossible to harmonize genesis  with bigbang cosmology or the evolutionary story of earth’s development in addition to these contradictions another obstacle to adding millions of years to the days or between the days relates to the order if the “days” are figurative of long ages then so are the “evenings” and the “mornings” but how could plants survive millions of years of darkness or how could they reproduce if they had to wait hundreds of millions of years before insects and animals were created that would pollinate the plants how did god create many oldearth advocates say “genesis  tells us that and why god created not how and when he created” actually the chapter does not tell us why god created but certainly does tell us when and how he created the first animate and inanimate things supernaturally and virtually instantly on the day that they were created they were fully formed and fully functioning for example plants animals and people were created as mature adult forms not as seeds or fertilized eggs or infants these statements are very clearly contrasted with how all the subsequent plants animals and people would come into existence reproduction by natural procreation “after their kinds” when god said “let there be” he did not need to wait millions of years for things to come into existence he spoke and creatures came into existence immediately as psalm – emphasizes to postulate millions of years between these supernatural acts of creation is an insult to the wisdom of god why would god create the earth and leave it covered with water for millions of years when he says he created it to be inhabited isa  why would he create plants and then wait millions of years before creating animals and people who would eat plants for food why would he create sea creatures and birds and wait millions of years before creating land animals and people objections to literal days many objections have been raised against the literal hour days interpretation such as   hours would be insufficient to accomplish all the events attributed to the sixth day  genesis  uses yom in a nonliteral sense showing that the days of genesis  were not literal  the seventh day does not conclude with the refrain of the other days implying that it was not literal  days – cannot be literal if the sun was not created until day  and  hebrews – says that the seventh day continues and therefore is at least  years long all of these and other objections have been refuted for years in creationist literature but i conclude from their published writings that oldearth advocates seem to pay little or no attention to creationist literature and so they keep raising the same objections without responding to youngearth refutations god’s commentary on genesis  exodus – exodus – stands as an insurmountable stone wall against any attempts to add extra time months years millennia or millions of years anywhere in genesis  or before genesis  the fourth commandment says that god created everything in six days just as the israelites were to work six days and rest on the seventh verse  rules out the dayage view and the daygapdaygapday view because it says “for in six days” god made everything and he used the plural yamim just as he did in the first part of the commandment so the days of the jewish workweek are the same length as the days of creation week as noted above god could have used several other words or phrases here or in genesis  if he meant to say “work six days because i created over six long indefinite periods” but he didn’t these verses also rule out the gap theory or any attempt to add millions of years before genesis  because god says he created the heavens the earth the sea and all that is in them during the six days described in genesis  exodus  also proves that the first day of creation begins in genesis  when the earth was created not  when god made light he made nothing before those six days it should be noted that the fourth commandment is one of only four of the ten commandments that contains a reason for the commandment if god created over millions of years he could have commanded sabbathkeeping without giving a reason or he could have given a theological or redemptive reason as he did elsewhere most oldearth proponents ignore this vital passage a few have tried to reinterpret the verse to open the door for accepting millions of years for example grudem says that in the very next verse exod  “‘day’ means ‘a period of time’” implying a nonliteral meaning of course a literal day is a period of time though obviously by this statement grudem wants to make room for millions of years more importantly however the verse does not use the singular yom day as grudem’s statement implies but rather the plural yamim days the nonliteral word in the verse is “prolonged” not “days” in other words god is saying that if the jews honor him by faithfully keeping the sabbath the total number of days that they dwell in the land will be long ie many not that their days will be lengthened to be more than  hours exodus  does not show that the days in – are not literal collins and lennox assert that exodus  teaches the difference between man’s work and rest and god’s work and rest ie that man’s work and rest are “like” but not identical to god’s creation work and rest but the fourth commandment is not contrasting the work of man and the work of god at all rather it is equating the human week with god’s creation week to these previous considerations we can add the following biblical arguments against the billions of years of cosmic and geologic history before adam purpose of the heavenly bodies genesis  god tells us why he created the sun moon and stars so man could tell time this is a ridiculous purpose if the evolutionary story of  billion years is true in that case for most of the years of existence of those heavenly bodies they did not accomplish the purpose for which they were made adam and eve were to rule over the animals genesis – if millions of years of history really happened before adam and eve most of the creatures that ever lived also died and many kinds of creatures became extinct before adam and eve could ever rule over them what kind of a god would make such a ridiculous assignment jesus and the biblical authors several passages show that jesus believed that man was created at the beginning of creation not billions of years after the beginning as all oldearth views imply which confirms the youngearth creationist view mark   luke – his miracles also confirm the youngearth view from his first miracle in his earthly ministry of turning water into wine which revealed his glory as the creator cf john  and – to all his other miracles eg matthew – mark – his spoken word brought an immediate instantaneous result just as his word did in creation week paul also made it clear that he was a youngearth creationist in romans  he says that god’s existence and at least some of his attributes have been clearly understood by people “since the creation of the world” so that they are without excuse for not honoring him as god surely this great student of scripture would have had in mind what david said  years earlier ps  cf ps  and what job said  years before that job – the creation has always revealed the creator to man from the beginning paul’s language like jesus’ language is inaccurate and misleading if man was created billions of years after the creation of the world similarly isaiah  shows that the prophet was a youngearth creationist the parallelism of the verse shows that “from the beginning” and “from the foundations of the earth” refer to the same point in time what the people of isaiah’s day knew about god is what people adam and eve and cain and abel etc knew right at the foundation of the earth the beginning of creation which is also what all idolaters in paul’s day knew and what atheists throughout history and today have known he is a fool who says there is no creator for his glory is seen in his creation ps   if the evolutionary view of  billion years is true then jesus paul and isaiah were badly mistaken and cannot be completely trusted in other things they teach no death before the fall a critically important theological reason that we cannot add long ages of time before adam is that it would mean millions of years of animal death disease carnivorous behavior and extinction as well as thorns and thistles earthquakes tsunamis asteroid impacts etc in god’s “very good” vegetarian creation gen – the fossil record in the sedimentary rock layers of the earth is where the evolutionary geologists and paleontologists supposedly got their evidence for millions of years of history before man radiometric dating was not invented until the early th century almost  years after millions of years was locked into the minds of most geologists and other scientists but in that fossil record we find evidence of carnivores eating other animals cancer arthritis and brain tumors in dinosaurs diseases and cannibalism in supposedly prehuman hominids thorns and thistles and at least five mass extinction events when anywhere from  to  percent of the species living at the time went extinct due to some kind of natural evil such as the supposed asteroid that wiped out all the dinosaurs and most other life “ million years ago” not only does this evolutionary reconstruction of history contradict the picture of a “very good” creation in genesis  it destroys the bible’s teaching in genesis –  and romans – about the cosmic impact of the fall furthermore it undermines what the bible teaches about the final redemptive work of christ in the whole cosmos acts  col – rev –  it also assaults the character of god as revealed in scripture what kind of god would create over millions of years using all that natural evil and call it all “very good” belief in the impact of the fall on the whole creation not just man was christian orthodoxy until the early th century today however from my experience and reading it is clear that most oldearth proponents have never even thought about these issues many theologians believe that the fall affected the whole creation just as they believe that after the second coming of jesus christ in the new heavens and new earth there will be no more human death and suffering for the redeemed but also no more natural evils animal predation death disease extinctions earthquakes tornadoes etc but these theologians fail to see the inconsistency between these biblically and historically orthodox beliefs and their acceptance of millions of years elsewhere i have given a thorough documented discussion of the fall and millions of years and responded to oldearth objections and i urge readers to carefully consider this vital point christians who accept the evolutionary date for the first homo sapiens – years ago and for the age of the cosmos do not impress nonchristians or motivate them to believe the bible and the gospel the late atheist christopher hitchens remarked about such oldearth thinking let’s say that the consensus is that our species being the higher primates homo sapiens has been on the planet for at least  years maybe more    in order to be a christian you have to believe that for  years our species suffered and died most of its children dying in childbirth most other people having a life expectancy of about  years    famine struggle bitterness war suffering misery all of that for  years heaven watches this with complete indifference and then  years ago thinks “that’s enough of that it’s time to intervene” and the best way to do this would be by condemning someone to a human sacrifice somewhere in the less literate parts of the middle east    this is nonsense it can’t be believed by a thinking person without a literal adam and a literal fall the gospel is nonsense but you cannot with any exegetical consistency believe in a literal fall and simultaneously deny the literal sixday creation of a “very good” world devoid of death and suffering and natural evil the evolutionary view of death and other natural evils is diametrically opposed to the biblical view for all these reasons the only biblically possible view is that adam and eve were created on the sixth literal normal hour day after the beginning of time so now we turn to the time between adam and us from adam to us today how long as noted earlier due in part to the influence of william henry green the majority of evangelical scholars and leaders today say or think that genesis  and  provide no chronological information about the time from the beginning of creation to abraham but every sincere bible reader before the th century strongly believed that genesis was telling us when god created the world even nonchristians had chronologies presenting an age of the world very similar to what is derived from a literal interpretation of genesis furthermore conservative jews take the text that way for their calendars today but this is no great wonder genesis sure looks like god wants to convey a chronology he gives the age of each patriarch when he dies and when the next man in the genealogy was born when instead he could have just listed names as he did in  chronicles – matthew – and luke – he also numbers the days of creation week gives time markers for events during the flood tells us how old abraham isaac and jacob were at key events in their lives and tells the jews to pay attention to the calendar for religious festivals he tells us how long the israelites were in egypt how long they wandered in the wilderness and how long it was from the exodus to the building of solomon’s temple he gives us chronological information about the reigns of the prekingdom judges and the kings of israel and judah and some neighboring kingdoms he tells us how long the babylonian captivity would last and gives us plenty of chronological information in the gospels and acts to follow the ministry of jesus and the apostles god has given a history in scripture and he evidently wants us to know when things happened if god doesn’t want us to glean chronological information from genesis  and  then why did he put it there does that mean that none of the dates in genesis – has chronological information either in which case we have no idea how long it rained and how long the flood lasted without even looking at the biblical details to think that genesis  and  give no chronological information relevant to determining the age of mankind or of the universe seems extremely doubtful as i explained earlier among youngearth creationists who do think the genesis genealogies give us some chronological information there are two views some say that there very likely are missing names and therefore gaps of time in which case adam was created perhaps – years ago others clearly the majority of leading creationists today think there are good reasons to conclude that genesis  and  are strict chronologies with no missing names or years hence adam and eve along with the whole universe were created a little over  years ago i will present some of the reasons for concluding the latter and encourage the reader to dig deeper in the resources in the footnotes arguments for gapless genealogies and no missing years in genesis  and  unlike other genealogies in the bible that simply list names eg  chron – ruth – matt – luke – in genesis  and  we are given the age of each “father” when the “son” was born and how many years the father lived after that birth genesis  and  are in fact the only genealogies in the bible and in ancient near eastern literature that do this which draws our attention to this information even more furthermore we know there are missing names in matthew  not only because we might suspect it from the arrangement of three groups of  names but also because we can check the genealogy against other texts in the old testament to find the omitted people but we have no texts that would fill in the supposed missing names in genesis  and  the extra cainan in luke  is almost certainly due to scribal error in copying manuscripts for that cainan is not in the oldest manuscripts of luke and the septuagint another evidence that matthew has omitted some names is that if his list was complete the average generation time between david and jesus would be  years which seems too long but luke’s genealogy from jesus all the way to adam has  generations between david and jesus averaging a very reasonable  years for each luke also expressly states that in writing his gospel he “investigated everything carefully” to present the “exact truth” concerning jesus luke – giving us reason to think that luke was giving us a complete genealogy from jesus back to adam but what about the highly influential article by green in  mentioned earlier sexton has carefully examined green’s argument and exposes his logical fallacies sexton affirms that green was correct in the two examples he cited to show that the hebrew verb יּ֖וֹלֶד yoled the hiphil form of yalad “beget” which is used in genesis  and  does not always mean a literal parentchild relationship in scripture a fact which corrects what i have written elsewhere but tanner notes that yoled is used  times in genesis and in all other cases outside of chapters  and  the context makes clear that a literal parentchild relationship is in view additionally because of nonchronological details given about six of these relationships we know they are literal fatherson links but since in both chapters it says that each of these six patriarchs had “many other sons and daughters” which surely is referring to immediate family members this is strong evidence that all the links in genesis  and  are literally fatherson sexton also shows from various scriptures and comments by modern hebrew scholars that green was right that yoled describes the birthing process or actual delivery of the child but green’s argument collapses when he assumes that since yoled indeed may refer to a distant relative there must be genealogical gaps in genesis  and  more importantly as sexton demonstrates green erred in assuming without explicit argument that genealogical gaps necessarily imply chronological gaps in other words even if names ie generations are missing that does not mean that there must be missing time too it does not matter for example if kenan was the son or grandson or great grandson etc of enosh in any case kenan was born when enosh was  years old so again while theoretically the hebrew verb yoled could allow for missing names there is no basis for imagining missing years genesis  and  provide us with a strict chronology from abraham back to adam and thereby back to the very beginning of creation sexton tanner and freeman cited in the notes present other strong arguments to show that green was mistaken and thereby has misled many other good scholars and that the position taken in this chapter is strong but i will discuss a few more arguments here many have argued that genesis  and  each contain two lists of  names but this is simply not correct in genesis  if we count from adam to shem in the segmented genealogy of noah we have  names in genesis  if we start with shem and count to abraham in the segmented genealogy of terah we have  names if we leave off the three sons of noah then we have  names in genesis  but then to make a fair comparison we must leave off the three sons of terah giving us  names we can count noah in genesis  to get  names to terah but noah is not listed in the genealogy of genesis  even if both genealogies did contain  names this would not nullify the conclusion that we have here a strict chronology some have denied that genesis  and  have chronological value because these chapters do not total up the years as other scriptures give total years between two events in support of this argument youngblood cites exodus  giving the years the jews were in egypt and  kings  giving the time from the exodus to the building of solomon’s temple but surely moses and god would expect the jews to do the simple addition of the obvious numbers in genesis  and  by contrast it would take considerable effort and detective work to arrive at the total years in the two cases youngblood cites some have argued that the drop in ages after the flood is evidence of missing names and missing time in genesis  in particular there is a year drop in lifespan between shem and arpachshad and a year drop in lifespan between eber and peleg but there is a difference of  years between the lifespans of noah and shem so this indicates missing names and years it is argued however when the ages in genesis  are analyzed mathematically the drop in ages nicely fits an exponential decay curve just as we would expect in the aftermath of the worldchanging flood formerly some creationists attributed the drop in lifespans in genesis  to significant environmental changes resulting from the collapse of a vapor canopy during the flood not only is the idea of vapor canopy in the preflood world no longer widely accepted by leading creationists but also today creationist experts think that genetics is the primary factor influencing lifespan which will be addressed in the later chapter by jeanson and tomkins some have suggested that the ages of the preflood patriarchs are inflated tenfold but in that case enoch and mahalalel had kids at the unbelievable age of  years old kenan at age  and enosh at age  christensen has argued that these ages cannot be literal because each age is the product of s and s he correctly observed that the age of each patriarch in genesis  is the product either of s or of s plus one  or in the case of methuselah s plus two s however he never stated what the theological significance of these multiples of s and s is and the pattern is different in genesis  where the ages are made up of the multiples of  and either four or seven s besides this we should note that every number above  except for       and  is a multiple of s s or a combination thereof so this numerical analysis reveals nothing furthermore even if genesis  and  are open genealogies with gaps we cannot add enough years to harmonize genesis with the evolutionary timescale for homo sapiens without making the genealogies absurd since as noted  of the genealogical links are clearly literal fatherson relationships that leaves  links where there could possibly be missing time however if we add  years between each of those men which would be equivalent to the time gap implied by the genealogical link “jesus the son of david” this still would not harmonize with the evolutionary dating of man but adding even this much time between these patriarchs most of whom we know nothing about seems unreasonable in the extreme and would call into question why any genealogy was given to match the evolutionary timescale we would need to add tens or hundreds of thousands of years to genesis  and  which creates even more problems as illustrated next in  in who was adam rana and ross said that god created adam and eve “– years ago” but ten years later in their  updated and expanded second edition they said “in  we predicted that god created human beings between  and  years ago” if the evolutionist dating methods are so reliable as rana and ross believe why this difference in ages the  statement had no footnote to the page in the  book so without searching in the  book readers would never know  that rana and ross did not accurately report what their own  book said and  that they backed off from their  relatively close range of ages to a less precise and wider range of dates but rana and ross continued in the very next sentence of their  book the latest results from molecular anthropology place humanity’s origin between  and  years ago we were wrong in  however the new dates line up with estimates of humanities’ origin from the fossil record between  and  years ago though these dates are older than those reported in the first  edition of who was adam we argue that they still harmonize with scripture how can any thoughtful christian accept this adam was – years ago then – years ago or – years ago or even – years ago and this all harmonizes with scripture really in the very next sentence in  they continue after carefully reconsidering our interpretation of the genealogies in genesis  and  we now take the position that the biblical text implies that adam and eve were created while an ice age probably the most recent one was in effect but when was that last ice age according to rana and ross they don’t tell the reader instead they have an endnote after this sentence pointing the reader to several pages in ross’s  book navigating genesis of course unless the reader has that  book he cannot check and see that ross says there p – that the last ice age when adam was supposedly created was – years ago and the reader won’t know that in the same book p  ross says that “noah would have been alive roughly  years ago and adam and eve anywhere from  to  years ago” this says ross in  on the same page shows that “the biblical account of creation retains its credibility in light of advancing scientific research” but this statement about biblical credibility will seem reassuring to readers only if they think that genesis  and  have no chronological value and if they don’t examine the conflicting numbers rana and ross are presenting in several books or on even different pages of the same book to make matters worse in who was adam  rana and ross said p  that the flood was “roughly  to  years ago” but going off the dates in ross’s  book that puts the flood – years after noah existed the vast majority of rana and ross’s readers will never see this confusing and contradictory collection of dates sadly their books have been warmly endorsed by many leading theologians and apologists who apparently never bothered to do some simple math so let’s do some given that as all agree abraham was born about  bc the timeframe of adam being – years ago rana and ross’s  range would put – years between adam and abraham after taking out the  years covered by the  demonstrably literal fatherson links rana and ross would need to account for another – years this means that they would need to add an average of  to  years between each pair of names in the  supposedly nonliteral links if we consider that apart from noah’s age of  when shem was born all the other begetting ages were less than  years and most were below  years then even  years for the ages of all the other patriarchs when the next man was born is ridiculous using rana and ross’s  range of  to  years would put adam – years before abraham or an average of  to  years between each pair of names in the supposedly nonliteral links from adam to abraham as sarfati has shown and documented these errors and “harmonizations” of scripture and “science” made by ross and rana are just the tip of the iceberg of the biblical and scientific errors that they and reasons to believe have been presenting to the christian public for several decades with strong endorsements by some very prominent evangelical theologians apologists and other christian leaders this cavalier dating of adam following the constantly changing claims of evolutionists certainly raises serious questions about ross and rana’s claims to believe in the inspiration and inerrancy of scripture where are all the human bones and all the living people where are all the fossilized and unfossilized bones if mankind is  or  or even more years old the earth should be overflowing with skeletal remains and human artifacts but we find very little and why isn’t the human population today much larger and written records and other evidences of civilization much older than about – years by secular dating of civilizations if homo sapiens came into existence  to  years ago from the eight people coming off the ark about  years ago the present world’s population can be easily explained but if mankind is as old as the evolutionists claim the world’s population today is far far too small reality confirms the bible not evolutionary dates what about the scientific dating methods all scientific dating methods are based on naturalistic uniformitarian assumptions see chapter  for discussion of these critically important assumptions many physical processes could theoretically be used to date the earth or any object in the earth eg radioactive decay or the erosion of the continents or the increase in the salinity of the oceans or the buildup of helium in the atmosphere but every such dating method involves making assumptions about the initial conditions when the process started the rate of change since then and whether the physical process was changed in any other way prior to human observations because scientists have no way to verify the accuracy of their assumptions about the unobserved and unrepeatable past no scientific method can confidently determine the age of the earth the universe or a fossil with respect to human history archeological dates based on carbon are most untrustworthy the research that the bbc summarized and reported in  is still true a complete rewrite of the history of modern humans could be needed after a breakthrough in archaeological dating techniques british and american scientists have found radiocarbon dating used to give a rough guide to the age of an object can be wrong by thousands of years    they found that the carbon dates were wrong by thousands of years and that the further back in time they went the more outofdate they were creation scientists contend that the flood is very important in explaining why prior to about the time of christ the c dates become less and less reliable archeology is dominated by the same naturalistic philosophical presuppositions that control biology geology and astronomy and most archeologists judge the bible’s history based on the standard of egyptian chronology but in addition to the fact that the bible is god’s inspired inerrant word and egyptian writings are not there are strong reasons to reject this reverence for egypt’s historians the antibiblical assumptions controlling archeology and thereby discrediting the history of the bible especially in genesis and exodus are clearly revealed in the recent excellent documentary film patterns of evidence the only way we can know with certainty the age of the creation or the age of mankind is if there was an absolutely trustworthy eyewitness of those creation events we have one the only one in god himself he observed everything described in genesis – which is his inspired inerrant eyewitness testimony about those people and events conclusion it is simply impossible to apply sound hermeneutical principles to the biblical text and harmonize genesis – with the evolutionary claims about the antiquity of man or the earth and universe it is exegetically impossible to put more than six days between adam and the first moment of creation even if names are missing in genesis  and  i think this is highly unlikely there are no missing years because the age of the patriarch is given when the next man is born william h green like charles hodge aa hodge bb warfield and likely the rest of the faculty at princeton at the time were wrong about the age of the earth and man and unintentionally misled many others but we cannot be dogmatic about the precise date of adam’s creation johnson helpfully suggests that it is highly unlikely that each son was born on the birthday of his father this requires a “fudge factor” of a partial year for the time between the father’s birthday and the son’s birth nevertheless given the ages in genesis  and  in the masoretic hebrew bible and reflected in our modern translations adam along with the rest of the universe was created a little before  bc and noah’s flood was a little before  bc even if the septuagint were shown to be more correct on all the begetting ages of the patriarchs that would push the date of the flood back only  years and the date of adam’s creation back another  making the age of the creation only around  years ago the approximate date of adam’s creation and therefore the creation of the universe must be determined from the inerrant word of god not on the basis of fallible ancient pagan chronologies or equally fallible modern scientific dating methods that are controlled by equally pagan naturalistic philosophical assumptions but does it matter yes it matters because god has given us many chronological details in his inerrant word he could have easily inspired moses and the other biblical writers to speak in vague terms of “thousands of years” or “long ago” the details matter because every word of god matters it also matters because jesus and the apostles all clearly took genesis as literal history there is no reason to suppose that they thought any differently about the genealogies of genesis  and  if their word cannot be trusted on this matter then their truthfulness and authority are undermined on all other matters furthermore it bears repeating that if we accept the evolutionary dates and view of history then we must insert death disease and other natural evils long before the fall which contradicts the bible’s teaching on that subject and thereby undermines the truth of the gospel so the only real question regarding the dating of adam’s creation is whether or not we will believe god’s word or will we instead make secular archeology paleontology geology and astronomy and their dating methods as well as ancient pagan chronologies our final authority on this matter put more simply whose word do we supremely trust god’s or man’s next chapter adam morality the gospel and the authority of scripture searching for adam you can believe what the bible says about adam and mans origin and with intellectual integrity reject

historical narrative but a literary framework to teach theology developed by john sailhamer in genesis unbound it says everything but man was created in genesis  and then from verse two onward the text is referring to the preparation of the promised land which he equates with the garden of eden advocated by c john collins in science and faith friends or foes this is similar to the dayage view

each of the six literal days but lennox also believes day  starts at genesis  with an indeterminate amount of time before that john walton is the leading proponent and insists in lost world of genesis  that god did not create anything in genesis  but only gave function to preexisting things so as to change a disordered creation into a cosmic temple for the lord he insists that the bible says nothing about when or how god created things including adam so whatever the scientific majority says is true is acceptable for christians mark a noll and david n livingstone eds evolution science and scripture selected writings grand rapids mi baker  p – warfield was heavily influenced by green and concluded “it is precarious in the extreme to draw chronological inferences from these genealogies”     because they are “so elastic that they may be commodiously stretched to fit any reasonable demand on time” he thought “the period from the creation of adam to abraham may have been nearer two hundred thousand years than two thousand years”  francis schaeffer no final conflict  p – and genesis in space and time downers grove il ivp  p   grudem did not cite green but cited schaeffer who

christian apologetics grand rapids mi baker  p – geisler cites green warfield schaeffer and newman as sources for his view that genesis  and  do not contribute anything to “satisfy our curiosity about the date of human creation” ronald youngblood the book of genesis nd ed grand rapids mi baker  p – the fact that genesis records adam’s poetic and romantic statement in genesis  and the words of jacob’s poetic prophecy given to his sons in genesis – does not negate the fact that genesis is history it accurately records what those men poetically said on those occasions see the indepth analysis of steven boyd “the genre of genesis – what means this text” in coming to grips with genesis eds terry mortenson and thane h ury green forest ar master books  p – a layman’s summary of boyd’s research is in donald deyoung thousands not billions challenging an icon of evolution green forest ar master books  p – a fuller technical discussion is steven boyd “statistical determination of genre in biblical hebrew evidence for a historical reading of genesis –” in radioisotopes and the age of the earth vol  eds larry vardiman et al el cajon ca icr  p – httpwwwicrorgi pdftechnicalstatisticaldeterminationofgenreinbiblicalhebrewpdf for a thorough refutation of the framework view see robert mccabe “a critique of the framework interpretation of the creation week” in coming to grips with genesis eds mortenson and ury p – the reason oldearth bible scholars can’t find the garden of eden and the location of cain’s city in our present middle east geography is because those places no longer exist having been destroyed in the global flood that radically rearranged the surface of the earth and buried the preflood land under thousands of feet of sediments the account of noah’s flood reads almost like a very simplified ship’s log or diary see for example mark – luke – – matt – rom   cor –  pet   pet – ezek – and isa  jesus since he is the truth knew the difference between truth and myth and would never use myth as a basis for teaching truth likewise the apostles clearly knew the difference between truth and myth  tim    tim   pet  of course jesus himself used figurative language “i am the light of the world” or “i am the door” and would not have “taken everything literally” in a woodenly literal manner but he clearly implied that we should assume a literal interpretation unless of course there are clear contextual reasons for not taking the text literally see for example the arguments by walter kaiser the old testament documents are they reliable and relevant downers grove il ivp  p – and edward j young studies in genesis one phillipsburg nj pr publ  p – for example whitcomb concluded that the two genealogies “have nothing to do with the actual length of the overall period” and therefore “it is unnecessary to press them into a rigid chronological system” see john c whitcomb jr and henry m morris the genesis flood grand rapids mi baker  reprint of  p – quotes on p  also arguing for possible missing names and gaps of time is mark snoeberger “why a commitment to inerrancy does not demand a strictly yearold earth one youngearther’s plea

of jesus’ words and oldearth attempts to reinterpret them see terry mortenson “jesus evangelical scholars and the age of the earth” coming to grips with genesis p – a short layman’s discussion is terry mortenson “but from the beginning of    the institution of marriage” wwwanswersingenesisorgdocsankerbergresponseasp which is a response to a web article by john ankerberg and norman geisler on mark  this is true even of the twostage healing of the blind man mark – each stage of the healing was instantaneous jesus apparently did this miracle in stages for a pedagogical purpose so read the nasb esv nkjv niv nlt and nrsv the kjv kj and hcsb render apo ktiseos kosmou as “from the creation of the world” but apo “from” here surely means “since” for reasons behind this conclusion see ron

literal son but can refer to a distant descendant eg jesus son of david in the cases of genesis  and  it surely refers to literal sons and daughters in  cases and it therefore seems inexplicable why

oldearth creation model for the origin of humanity find reasons who was adam an oldearth creation model for the origin of humanity february   by dr fazale rana what is it to be human this is an important question perhaps it is the most important question we could ever ask the answer has profound and wideranging implications in many respects this question can’t be adequately addressed unless we examine a more fundamental question “where do humans come from” in the west influenced by a judeochristian worldview the response to this question was largely based on the first two chapters of genesis namely human beings were created as a primordial pair made in god’s image and all humanity ultimately descended from a literal historical adam and eve this view of humanity prevailed in the judeochristian world until the early s with the publication of charles darwin’s detailed work on human origins the descent of man and selection in relation to sex darwin proposed that humanity evolved through a process of descent with modification from an ancestor shared with apes as he put it “in a series of forms graduating insensibly from some apelike creature to man as he now exists it would be impossible to fix on any definite point when the term ‘man’ ought to be used” darwin saw evidence that human beings are nothing more than animals—certainly not the direct product of divine activity he believed humankind differs only in degree and not in kind from apes for many christians charles darwin did the unthinkable he interpreted humanity in a fully mechanistic and materialistic fashion according to this view all of human nature not just humanity’s physical makeup emerged under the auspices of natural selection darwin regarded humanity’s mental powers and intellectual capacity as well as moral sense and religious beliefs as evolution’s invention the scientific community claims support for human evolution from the fossil record paleontologists have unearthed many hominid fossils and accompanying archeological remains throughout east central and south africa asia the middle east and europe these specimens encompass a widerange of species according to evolutionary biologists these hominids fill in the evolutionary tree and clarify the pathway human evolution took over the last  million years molecular geneticists claim another type of fossil evidence in support of human evolution namely the molecular fossils recently found in the genomes of humans neanderthals denisovans and the great apes these “fossils” take on the form of structural features of genomes and dna sequences shared among related organisms similarities and differences in genomic architecture and dna sequences presumably reveal the evolutionary relatedness of humans and apes in fact all life and provide details about their evolutionary history particularly compelling are the shared dna sequences that appear to be nonfunctional now but possess features that indicate that they at one time had utility presumably random physical chemical andor biochemical events rendered these functional components of the genome into useless artifacts these features were then retained as the various lineages diverged from a common ancestor on the weight of these two lines of evidence some christians feel that overwhelming proof for human evolution exists and that it is now necessary to abandon the historic christian view of human origins instead they propose the church adopt the view that god used evolutionary mechanisms to create theistic evolution or evolutionary creation however many evangelicals and conservative believers remain reluctant to embrace this proposal first they feel that abandoning the historic christian view of human origins in favor of evolutionary creationism undermines key christian ideas and doctrines and yields a narrative that doesn’t square with the biblical creation accounts also a significant amount of skepticism exists within these circles about the capacity of evolutionary mechanisms to account exclusively for life’s origin and the entirety of life’s history including the origin of humanity does another option exist is it possible to develop a human origins model that incorporates the latest scientific advances while retaining the historic christian view of humanity’s creation over the past decade or so i have been working on this very question and proposed along with astronomer hugh ross a creation model for human origins that seeks to integrate both the scientific data and the biblical creation texts into a single framework this approach gives biblical information equivalent weight to the results of scientific studies and aims to include both sources of information in a single coherent model that accounts for all the available data our approach also departs from the strict methodological naturalism that undergirds the modern scientific enterprise but does not abandon the scientific method that is central to science this approach is also willing to depart from the strict adherence to the evolutionary paradigm that too is a common stalwart of modern science the process of building our model begins with identification of all relevant bible passages that describe god’s creative work in bringing humans into existence as well as those passages that recount early human history once all relevant scripture is collated application of sound exegetical techniques helps form the most plausible interpretations admittedly for some passages several plausible interpretations exist using the historicalgrammatical method the origins passages are examined side by side with other relevant texts all scriptures that deal with humanity’s creation can then be integrated to form a comprehensive picture the biblical scenario for humanity’s origin and spread is then recast in scientific terms as a result it is possible to develop a set of predictions that logically flow from the model rendering the model testable it is also dynamic considerable freedom exists within the creation model’s framework for adjustments and finetuning as scientists and theologians make new discoveries and gain fresh insight key human origins passages  the key biblical passages that establish the historic christian view of humanity’s origin and also provide the framework for our creation model include genesis –  – these passages teach that god directly intervened to create de novo the first humans—as an original pair—uniquely made in his image   genesis  acts – according to these passages all humanity descended from a single primordial pair   genesis  luke – mark   romans –  corinthians – these passages treat adam and consequently eve as a real historical person not only is adam mentioned in the genealogy of genesis  but also in luke’s genealogy of jesus christ mark  indicates that jesus thought of adam and eve as real people likewise paul viewed adam as a real person as well an oldearth creationist model for the origin of humanity the key tenets of our model are derived from the above passages and include the following ideas humanity is traceable back to one woman and one man humanity’s early population size was relatively small humanity originated in a single location in or near the middle east the garden of eden humanity’s origin occurred recently humanity spread around the world from in or near the middle east human culture which reflects the image of god appears and expands explosively in the archeological record from the time of humanity’s origin humans share anatomical physical biochemical and genetic similarities with the extinct hominids also with great apes and other animals humans are behaviorally distinct in ways that reflect god’s image from the earlier hominids the great apes and other animals the central question for our project is it possible to square these ideas with the latest scientific insight into the origin of humanity scientific insights in human origins molecular anthropology one of the most exciting advances in human origins research has been the use of dna sequence data to gain insight into the origin and early history of humanity a number of genetic markers have been employed toward this end including genetic heterogeneity mt dna ychromosomal dna pseudogenes hervs sine dna microsatellite dna and minisatellite dna linkage disequilibrium has also been used to develop an understanding of human origins another rather inventive approach has been the use of the genetic variability of human parasites such as the malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum the jc virus and the bacterium helicobacter pylori as a proxy for human genetic diversity each parasite studied represents an opportunity to corroborate independently the studies based on human genetic markers collectively these studies indicate that humanity originated recently around  years ago though there is significant uncertainty in the date from a relatively small population perhaps as small as a few hundred from a single location east africa of particular interest are the results of mt dna and ychromosomal studies that trace humanity’s origin through the maternal and paternal lineages respectively to single ancestral sequences referred to as “mitochondrial eve” and “ychromosomal adam” these results have helped establish the outofafrica model as the most prevalent explanation for the origin of humanity largely supplanting multiregionalism evolutionary biologists interpret these results to indicate that a relatively large population of humans suffered a catastrophic collapse when this occurred genetic diversity was lost and the first humans went through a genetic bottleneck after suffering the population collapse the humans who survived are thought to have experienced rapid population growth and expansion as they migrated around the planet accordingly the genetic markers of the population collapse remain imprinted on today’s human population groups in the form of limited genetic variation they theorize that the passage of humanity through the genetic bottleneck perhaps as recently as  years ago creates the appearance that humanity arose from a small original population along the same lines evolutionary biologists are quick to assert that mitochondrial eve and ychromosomal adam were not the first humans rather according to them many ‘eves’ and ‘adams’ existed mitochondrial eve and ychromosomal adam consisted of a number of individuals who shared a common haplotype these two haplotypes were the lucky ones that just happened to survive the genetic lines of the other first humans were lost over time still as an oldearth creationist i find the concept of mitochondrial eve and ychromosomal adam intriguing is it possible to reconcile the data interpreted in the context of the outofafrica model to the view of humanity’s origin espoused by the historic christian faith some might conclude that reconciliation isn’t possible but when the scientific and biblical data are carefully considered there is a close congruence between the biblical and scientific account of human origins as i discuss in who was adam a date for humanity’s origin around  years ago is not necessarily incompatible with the biblical account of human origins some bible interpreters treat the genealogies in genesis  adam to noah and genesis  noah to abraham as exhaustively complete chronologies and have attempted to determine the date for adam and eve’s creation from them this approach however is questionable for several reasons the genesis  and genesis  genealogies were not intended as chronometers but like all genealogies found in scripture were meant to communicate theological truths the range of meaning for the hebrew words translated as “father” ’āb and “son” bēn can include “ancestor” and “descendant” respectively similarly the hebrew word translated as “begot” or “become the father of” can mean to father an individual or to bring forth a lineage in hebrew thought a father is not only the parent of his child but also the parent of all his child’s descendants according to k a kitchen the genealogies of genesis  and  could be read as “a fathered p who fathered q who fathered r who fathered s who fathered t who fathered    b” genesis  and  could then be read as “a fathered the lineage culminating in b and after fathering the line lived x years” it is also important to keep in mind that dates for humanity’s origin derived from coalescence analysis and molecular clocks are notoriously imprecise calibration of molecular clocks is extremely difficult if not impossible to accomplish researchers simply cannot determine with any real accuracy mutation rates and changes in these rates over time scientists typically must estimate the likely high and low values for mutation rates the dates for humanity’s origin extracted from genetic data of human population groups must be regarded as crude estimates not ironclad conclusions one researcher noted that molecular clocks are best thought of as “sun dials” not “stopwatches” the bottom line there is no reason to regard the scientific dates for the origin of humanity to be in conflict with the biblical account what about the location of humanity’s origin does an african origin of humanity conflict with the biblical account not necessarily the garden of eden’s location has been the subject of endless debate throughout church history while the debate still is not fully resolved most theologians agree the garden was located in one of two adjacent regions with the land later called israel as the frame of reference genesis  describes the garden’s location as “east in eden” this implies that the garden was contained within a larger region called eden the mention of the tigris and euphrates rivers indicates the garden’s location within mesopotamia genesis  however the pishon and gihon rivers also noted are unknown they may have been smaller river channels part of the tigris and euphrates systems or they may have disappeared becoming dry river beds along these lines k a kitchen argues that these four rivers came together in mesopotamia to form a single stream that ran into the garden of eden based on kitchen’s analysis the rivers are listed starting with the pishon a driedup river located in a southwesterly direction proceed in a counterclockwise fashion across the east to the gihon also driedup north to the tigris and finally northwest to the euphrates kitchen proposes that the garden of eden locates to the north end of the persian gulf and is now submerged under water alternatively the pishon and gihon may be references to the blue and white nile part of the support for this view comes from genesis  which states that the gihon “winds through the entire land of cush” in the old testament cush the land equates to ethiopia but it can also refer to kassites descendants of the patriarch cush the kassites lived in mesopotamia some biblical scholars hold that the garden of eden was most probably somewhere within mesopotamia but its boundaries may have extended into north and east africa considering this interpretation cush may well have been ethiopia if this identification is accurate then the scientific and biblical data harmonize what if the garden of eden is confined exclusively to mesopotamia the data that locates humanity’s origin to africa still need not be seen as problematic for a biblical model without question african populations are humanity’s oldest not only because of genetic diversity but also because african dna sequences encompass dna sequences from all other human population groups this inclusion however does not mean these groups originated in africa when molecular anthropologists use genetic data to locate humanity’s origin and spread they assume that the contemporary location of population groups represents their location throughout human history this supposition remains open to question particularly because many human population groups have migrated as much as thousands of miles throughout their history did humanity originate from two individuals a primordial pair from my perspective i think that the data from molecular anthropology squares with the traditional christian view of human origins on this point as already discussed from an evolutionary perspective it looks as if humanity passed through a genetic bottleneck as i argue in who was adam however the genetic bottleneck is a concept embedded within the evolutionary paradigm from a creation model standpoint the limited genetic diversity of humanity doesn’t reflect population collapse but is viewed as a signature for a creation event i also argue in who was adam the fact that all humans can trace their ancestry to a single mitochondrial dna sequence indicates that humanity originated from a single woman that is mitochondrial eve was the biblical eve the corresponding reasoning would also apply to ychromosomal adam others have challenged this interpretation however arguing that the genetic data indicates that humanity arose from thousands of individuals not two the chief basis for this claim comes from estimates of the ancestral population size of humans based on genetic diversity it is possible to estimate the effective population size of any ancestral group from genetic diversity of presentday populations if the mutation rate is known as discussed in who was adam a number of these types of studies do indeed indicate that humans stem from a small population on the order of a few hundred to a few thousand skeptics of the traditional reading of the biblical account of human origins accept these results uncritically again they argue that the data indicate that humanity experienced a genetic bottleneck consequently humanity arose from the thousands of survivors not a primeval pair skeptics also point to other methods for modeling the ancestral population size that do not depend on mutations but on other processes to generate genetic diversity studies employing these techniques too seem to indicate that humanity arose from population sizes that were on the order of a few thousand individuals a number of recent studies however show that these methods are not good predictors of population size in fact in two instances—one involving mouflon sheep and the other przewalski’s horses—when the original population size was known the genetic diversity measured generations later was much greater than expected based on the models in the face of this challenge it is important to recognize that the population sizes generated by these methods are merely estimates not hard and fast values the reason the mathematical models are highly idealized generating differing estimates based on a number of factors as a case in point consider two studies discussed in who was adam one reported in  by a russian and us research team examined dna sequence elements called short tandem repeats at  locations in the human genome for  individuals that represented  population groups on the basis of this analysis they concluded that humanity originated from a single point of origin apparently africa from a small population  or less between  and  years ago although this conclusion was in line with that of an earlier study of short tandem repeats the population size estimate from the earlier study was around  individuals the reason for the difference was in part the differing sample sizes and number of locations in the human genome that were studied did humanity originate from a single pair even though population estimates indicate that humanity originated from several hundred to several thousand individuals based on mathematical models it could well be that these numbers overestimate the original numbers for the first humans given how poorly these population size models perform and noting that humanity can trace its origin to a single ancestral mitochondrial dna sequence which again i interpret as a single individual it is hard to argue that science has falsified the notion that humanity descended from a primordial pair and it is important to note that human origination from a small population is consistent with the existence of a historical adam and eve who gave rise to all of humanity after their creation the biblical text teaches that they produced many sons and daughters genesis  given the limitations of the methods could it be that the population estimates are reporting on the population structure of humans some time after their creation when the population would have been small on the order of a few thousand scientific insights in human origins comparative genomics one of the biggest challenges to the historic christian faith are the shared molecular fossils found in corresponding locations within the genomes of humans and the great apes for many people the only way to make sense of these molecular fossils is in the context of the evolutionary paradigm accordingly these shared features were found in the genomes of common ancestors and were retained after the evolutionary lineages diverged but humans’ and great apes’ shared molecular fossils point to common descent only if certain assumptions are true first the shared structures and sequences of genomes are not functional and second the events that created these features are rare random and nonrepeatable another assumption in play is that no mechanisms other than common descent vertical gene transfer exist that can generate shared features in genomes as it turns out a number of recent studies raise questions about the validity of these assumptions for example evolutionary biologists claim that synteny the ordering of genes along a chromosome reflects the degree of evolutionary relatedness but there are examples where this relationship doesn’t hold other studies have shown that the location of genes along the length of the chromosome has functional significance and therefore could be understood as intentionally designed over the course of the last decade or so molecular biologists and molecular geneticists have come to discover that most classes of “junk dna” have function it is beyond the scope of this paper to describe these discoveries i refer interested readers to my books who was adam and the cell’s design it turns out that many of the events that alter genomes’ structures and dna sequences are not rare and random necessarily for example biochemists have known for quite some time that mutations occur in hotspots and that transitions happen at a higher frequency than transversions recent work also indicates that transposon insertion and intron insertion occur at hotspots and gene loss is repeatable new studies also reveal that horizontal gene transfer can mimic common descent as it turns out this phenomenon is not confined to bacteria and archaea but has been observed in higher plants and animals as well via a vector mediated pathway or organelle capture in light of these discoveries is it possible to make sense of the shared genomic architecture and dna sequences within the framework of a creation model i think it is with both the biblical text and the views of the eminent biologist sir richard owen as a guide genesis  describes the creation of adam and states that god “formed the man from the dust of the ground” the verb “formed” is translated from the original hebrew verb yāṣar which means “to form” “to fashion” or “to produce” genesis  uses yāṣar to describe god’s work to form “out of the ground all the beasts of the field and all the birds of the air” together these verses indicate that both man and animals were fashioned by the creator from the same substance and design template it follows then that anatomical physiological biochemical and genetic similarities should exist between humans and other animals including the “ genetic similarity” between humans and chimpanzees in other words shared features reflect common design not common descent and yet according to genesis  only adam was animated with the divine breath implying that there is something distinct about humans genesis – and  teaches that human beings alone were made in god’s image as a result humans display unique nonphysical characteristics that reflect that image it stands to reason that significant physical differences will also exist between humans and other animals—variations that provide the biological support for humanity’s likeness to god in light of this discussion it is interesting to note that prior to darwin eminent biologist sir richard owen interpreted homologous structures and consequently related organisms as manifestations of an archetype not the products of descent with modification darwin later replaced owen’s hypothetical archetype with a common ancestor but the key point is that it is possible to conceive of an alternative interpretation of shared biological features if one is willing to allow for the operation of a creator within the history of life i see the notion of a creator producing lifeforms that adhere to a common blueprint—an archetype—to be consistent with the creation of humanity and the animals described in genesis  that is it is possible to propose a model that accounts for the shared features of genomes from a creation perspective what follows is the framework for such a model the assumption that undergirds this model is that a creator is responsible for life’s origin and history as such the genomes of organisms have been created via god’s direct intervention but once created genomes are subjected to physical chemical and biochemical events that can induce changes in their structure this model explains the similarities among organisms’ genomes in one of two ways reflecting the work of a creator who deliberately designed similar features in genomes according to  a common function or  a common blueprint reflecting the outworking of physical chemical or biochemical processes that  occur frequently  are nonrandom and  are reproducible these processes cause the independent origin of the same features in the genomes of different organisms along these lines it is also interesting to note that researchers have discovered that horizontal gene transfer mimics the genomics signature for common ancestry our model also explains genomes’ differences in one of two ways reflecting the work of a creator who deliberately designed differences in genomes with distinct functions reflecting the outworking of physical chemical or biochemical processes in other words our model can account for similarities and differences in the genomes of organisms as either the deliberate work of a creator or via naturalprocess mechanisms that alter the genomes after creation scientific insights in human origins archeological studies one of the key ideas of the historic christian faith and a key aspect of our model is the notion that human beings are made in god’s image scripture doesn’t explicitly state what the image of god is over the centuries theologians have discussed and debated this concept some take the image of god to describe humanity’s resemblance to god others take it to refer to humanity’s relational capacity while some theologians think that the image of god allows humans to function as god’s representatives or viceroys on earth a consensus of these three approaches identifies four characteristics  human beings possess a moral component they inherently understand right and wrong and have a strong innate sense of justice humans are spiritual beings who recognize a reality beyond this universe and physical life mankind intuitively acknowledges the existence of god and has a propensity towards worship and prayer human beings relate to god to themselves to other people and to other creatures there is a relational aspect to god’s image humanity’s mental capacity reflects god’s image human beings possess the ability to reason and think logically they can engage in symbolic thought people express themselves with complex abstract language they are aware of the past present and future human beings display intense creativity through art music literature science and technical inventions according to the historic christian faith much of human behavior ultimately stems from the image of god because the archeological record is the product of behavior and activity it supplies the means to probe for the image of god artifacts that result from reason symbolic thought technical inventiveness and artistic musical and religious expression will reflect the image of god because our model views the hominids as animals see below it predicts that such imageofgod artifacts will make their first and only appearance in the archeological record alongside human remains while artifacts are found with hominids that precede human beings in the fossil record our model maintains that they will differ fundamentally from those associated with the first true humans the archeological remains that coincide with hominids should indicate the absence of imageofgod behavior without question hominids living as long ago as  million years employed tools and possessed a “culture” of sorts still their crude technology and simple lifestyle remained static for hundreds of thousands of years at a time when new modes of technology and culture appear in the archeological record the advances generally represent relatively small steps upward followed by long periods of stasis even as recently as  years ago the hominids used remarkably unsophisticated technology but at  years ago based on the archeological record in europe something quite amazing happened according to paleoanthropologist christopher stringer for millennia upon millennia we hominids had been churning out the same forms of stone utensils for example but about  years ago a perceptible shift in our handiwork took place throughout the old world tool kits leapt in sophistication with the appearance of upper paleolithic style implements signs of use of ropes bone spear points fishhooks and harpoons emerge along with sudden manifestations of sculptures paintings and musical instruments    we also find evidence of the first longdistance exchange of stones and beads objects made of mammal bones and ivory antlers marine and freshwater shells fossil coral limestone schist steatite jet lignite hematite and pyrite were manufactured materials were chosen with extraordinary care some originated hundreds of miles from their point of manufacture    it is an extraordinary catalogue of achievements that seem to have come about virtually from nowhere—though obviously they did have a source the question is what was it though stringer sees an evolutionary connection between modern humans and the hominids that predate them in the fossil record the archeological record displays something other than a gradual evolutionary emergence of human culture rather the record’s defining characteristic is a veritable explosion of civilization this eruption is considered anthropology’s “big bang” i see the sociocultural big bang as a signature for god’s intervention denoting the creation of the first humans creatures that uniquely bear god’s image our model predicts that evidence for behavior reflecting god’s image should appear abruptly in the archeological record and should correlate exclusively with the appearance of humankind the archeological and fossil records reveal this exact pattern while the case for the sociocultural big bang is based primarily on the archeological record in europe it is gratifying to see that other archeological sites around the world also reveal sophisticated behavior associated with modern humans with dates closer to the time when modern humans are thought to have first appeared on the scene who were the hominids since i am skeptical of aspects of the evolutionary paradigm and human evolution specifically how then do i account for the hominids that precede modern humans and in some instance coexisted with them the biblical creation model that hugh ross and i proposed considers the hominids found in the fossil record to be animals created for god’s purposes by his direct intervention they existed for a time and then went extinct these were remarkable creatures that walked erect and possessed some level of limited intelligence and emotional capacity such characteristics allowed hominids to employ crude tools and even adopt a low level of “culture” much like baboons gorillas and chimpanzees while the creation model asserts that the hominids were created by god’s divine command they were not spiritual beings made in his image this status was reserved exclusively for human beings our model treats hominids as analogous to yet distinct from the great apes for this reason the model predicts that anatomical physiological biochemical and genetic similarities existed among hominids and human beings to varying degrees but because the hominids were not made in god’s image they are expected to be noticeably different from humans as reflected by their cognitive and communicative capacities behavior “technology” and “culture” our model maintains that while human beings reflect god’s image in their activities hominids did not the model asserts that humans are uniquely spiritual and hominids were not the archeological record associated with hominid fossils supplies key data to evaluate this prediction in who was adam i provide an extensive discussion of the archeological record associated with the hominids and how the features of the record comport with the predictions of our model how do i justify my skepticism of human evolution from a scientific perspective a sufficient response to this question is beyond the scope of this paper i refer the interested reader to who was adam for an extensive critique of human evolution still a few points are worth consideration when most people think of hominid fossils they picture nearly complete skeletal remains popular presentations almost always feature the greaterthanpercent complete “turkana boy” specimen—or “lucy” which consists of a nearly  percent complete postcranial skeleton yet these specimens are unique most hominid fossil discoveries consist of partial crania partial jaws isolated teeth and occasionally isolated limb fragments paleoanthropologists rarely find a complete cranium let alone an entire skeleton moreover very few hominid species have extensive representation in the fossil record in most cases a limited number of fragmentary fossil finds and a handful of specimens define a species without a large number of specimens paleoanthropologists can’t accurately decipher the range of morphological variation that occurs within a population or across geography and time and without this knowledge it’s uncertain if hominids with morphological differences from two time periods in the geological column represent two distinct species with an evolutionary connection or the range of variation within a particular species often the hominid remains are crushed or shattered prior to fossilization and further deformed by geological processes these limitations make proper analysis of the hominid fossil record very difficult distortions and deformations of hominid fossils obscure paleoanthropologists’ ability to construct accurate evolutionary trees the implications are enormous for human evolutionary scenarios given all the difficulties associated with the hominid fossil record it’s not surprising that paleoanthropologists disagree on the evolutionary relationships among the hominids specifically on the progression pathway that led to modern humans examination of any textbook or treatise on human evolution attests to this conflict in the midst of these controversies work published by mark collard and bernard wood raises serious and fundamental questions about the capability of paleoanthropologists to ever establish evolutionary relationships among hominids in their view any evolutionary tree paleoanthropologists construct for hominids will always be hopelessly uncertain paleoanthropologists typically use comparisons of hominid cranial and dental anatomical features to build evolutionary trees since these fossils supply the chief data available however as collard and wood point out the use of hominid craniodental features to discern evolutionary relationships has never been validated to make their point these two paleoanthropologists compared evolutionary trees constructed from craniodental data with those built from dna and protein sequences for two currently existing groups of primates one group included humans chimpanzees and gorillas the other consisted of baboons macaques and mangabys for both sets of primates the evolutionary trees built from dna and protein sequences differed significantly from those constructed from craniodental data evolutionary biologists now consider evolutionary trees produced with molecular data inherently more robust than those derived from anatomical features this development has forced paleoanthropologists to conclude that “little confidence can be placed in phylogenies evolutionary trees generated solely from higher primate craniodental evidence the corollary of this is that existing phylogenetic hypotheses about human evolution are unlikely to be reliable” in light of these results “that human evolution occurred” becomes a scientifically untenable statement in order to demonstrate that humanity originated through biological evolution robust evolutionary trees must be established collard and wood have shown that such determinations may never be possible for hominids as long as craniodental data is all they have to work with in fact more recent work indicates that this problem extends beyond the hominid fossil record evolution biologists from the university of helenski finland question the reliability of any evolutionary tree generated from dental data these scientists are not the only paleoanthropologists to demonstrate problems with hominid evolutionary trees others have rigorously detailed additional difficulties with the methods and data used to build the trees any evolutionary relationships set forth are highly tentative little more than sheer speculation it’s no wonder each new hominid discovery throws the field of paleoanthropology into chaos and forces researchers to redraw the trees final thoughts many key doctrines of the historic christian faith rest on the historicity of adam and eve while i understand the draw of theistic evolution evolutionary creationism this position also wreaks havoc on the traditional christian view of human origins by casting doubt on the historicity of adam and eve i think it is important for the christian community to look for alternative paradigms that accommodate the advances coming from science without necessarily embracing an evolutionary interpretation of those advances while retaining the traditional interpretations of human origins from the first chapters of genesis the model that hugh ross and i proposed in who was adam seeks to accomplish that very goal i believe that the model performs quite well and has successfully accounted for a number of discoveries that have been made since the book’s publication admittedly there is much more work to be done to develop our human origins model and there are a number of outstanding questions and challenges for the model as well new advances such as those in comparative genomics propel our project forward prompting us to propose an accompanying genomics model i am hopeful that our approach represents a viable alternative to theistic evolution and will hopefully attract more participants to the project subjects adam and eve biblical evidence for an old earth dr fazale rana in  i left my position in rd at a fortune  company to join reasons to
