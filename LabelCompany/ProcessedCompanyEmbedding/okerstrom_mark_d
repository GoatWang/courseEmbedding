the companys ir website at irexpediainccom i encourage you to periodically visit our investor relations site for important content including todays earnings release i would like to note that beginning here in q  we are including homeaway onplatform gross bookings and property nights in our operational metrics weve disclosed the quarterly balances for  via an k filing for comparative purposes finally unless otherwise stated all references to cost of revenue selling and marketing expense general and administrative expense and technology and content expense also exclude stockbased compensation and depreciation expense and all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of  with that let me turn the call over to dara dara khosrowshahi  expedia inc thanks alan expedia is off to a good start this year with first quarter gross bookings up  revenue up  and adjusted ebitda up  yearoveryear stayed room nights grew  negatively impacted by the easter shift while booked room nights grew  yearoveryear the core ota segment continue to gain momentum with the global brands delivering healthy room night growth through solid execution and product technology marketing and operations we continue tuning our regional brand operating formula with an eye towards optimizing profitability and with some tradeoffs against topline growth note that the travel markets are quite dynamic and its been less than a year since we fully optimized orbitz integrated orbitz into the fold were early here in our learnings our ota lodging supply portfolio now stands at about  properties up  yearoveryear the homeaway transition continues to go well were investing in growing our team of toptier product and technology talent and we shifted to a true test and learn culture to drive significant improvements in the overall user homeowner and property manager experience were still relatively early in developing our muscles in the variable marketing channels but were beginning to ramp them up in addition to making aggressive investments in offline and online brand marketing to bring more demand to our growing supply base we now have nearly  million online bookable listings representing over  million bookable units and an increasing percentage of instantly bookable properties egencia delivered impressive adjusted ebitda of  million in q up  yearoveryear helped in part by lapping over the orbitz for business integration last year we believe the business has reached an operational and technological inflection point and can now begin to scale at a more aggressive pace around the world were ramping up egencias sales organization to accelerate organic bookings and revenue growth while this will be a headwind to nearterm margins as we bring in salespeople and train them up to egencia standards we believe we can balance this investment through the natural pl leverage in the business at its current and goforward scale lastly trivago continued its very strong pace of growth with standalone revenue growth of  and  million of adjusted ebitda for the quarter growth was strong across all regions with the highest rate of growth in apac along with solid growth in europe and north america the trivago team plans to continue to invest into growth and well share more details on their earnings call in midmay were happy to have begun the year from a position of strength our core ota and egencia businesses are posting attractive top line growth rates investing aggressively in selling and marketing while leveraging their fixed cost base after that the impressive growth of homeaway and trivago and smart capital allocation and you get an effective formula for longterm value creation its early in the year with plenty of competition in the field but we like where we stand now mark mark d okerstrom  expedia inc thanks dara with both feet firmly back into business as usual mode were happy to have kicked off  with a strong set of results total lodging revenue including both hotel revenue and all of the homeaway revenue grew  for the first quarter driven by stayed room night growth at the same rate normalized for easter and last years leap day we estimate room night growth would have been approximately  basis points higher our global brands hotelscom brand expedia ean and egencia collectively delivered room night growth of  a growth rate that would have been nicely higher if normalized for easter homeaway revenue grew  to  million driven by property night growth and increased revenue per property night homeaway property nights grew  yearoveryear on a booked basis while homeaway stayed property night growth of  was particularly impacted by seasonality and the easter shift property night revenue has improved as a result of our service fees partially offset by decreased subscription revenue as we continue to lap over the elimination of tiered subscription sales in july of  and as we transition more of our listings to the paper booking model and to our lower online bookable subscription rates as expected homeaways ebitda was down yearoveryear as a result of seasonal impacts to revenue coupled with aggressive investments in selling and marketing and technology and content we currently expect homeaways  revenue growth to peak in q a quarter in which homeaway will deliver the significant majority of its adjusted ebitda dollar growth lastly as a reminder we will also start to see somewhat easier expense comps for homeaway in the back half of the year as we begin to lap the rampup of certain selling and marketing and technology and content spend late last year advertising and media revenue of  million is up  yearoveryear a nice acceleration from the  growth we saw in q on a standalone basis trivago revenue grew  yearoveryear and delivered  million in adjusted ebitda for the quarter a bit ahead of our expectations the trivago formula is working and the team plans to reinvest some of the upside todate in selling and marketing to drive continued impressive qualified referral growth around the world trivago continues to nicely outpace other scale customer acquisition channels in travel our adjusted expenses trended in the right direction and were in line with our target pl something we also expect to see for the full year were driving leverage on our fixed costs which allows us to make aggressive investments in selling and marketing cost of revenue grew just  yearoveryear in q leveraging nicely on efficiency in our credit card and fraud costs and our global customer operations platform partially offset by growth in our cloud spending while we continue to expect to see leverage in cost of revenue we are forecasting somewhat higher growth rates for the rest of the year direct selling and marketing expenses grew  as we continued to push for global growth primarily led by aggressive spending at trivago and homeaway along with continued growth for brand expedia and hotelscom indirect selling and marketing which represents people costs grew  yearoveryear we currently expect total selling and marketing cost to grow faster than revenue for the balance of the year ga expenses grew  in q leveraging nicely which we expect to see for the full year as well technology and content were just  yearoveryear as we are lapping over the accelerated pace of hiring and the orbitz integrationrelated head count we carried in the first half of  as expected continued growth of the homeaway team led to faster technology content expense growth for that business in total though we expect technology and content expenses to grow faster next quarter and accelerate further in the back half on a full year basis we currently expect to be able to deliver slight leverage on this line item fully inclusive of the planned cloud spend on that note im pleased to say that our cloud migration efforts are going well total cloud spending for the quarter was  million up from  million last year with nearly  of that spend in cost of revenue and about  of it in technology and content we remain comfortable with our estimate of total cloud costs of  million in  and though difficult to predict with certainty we expect the full year mix to be roughly even between cost of revenue and technology and content from a capital deployment standpoint we have repurchased nearly  shares so far in  for a total of  million our longstanding approach to capital deployment has not changed and we continue to balance share repurchases our quarterly dividend and opportunistic ma turning to our financial expectations for full year  on a consolidated basis including the rampup in cloud spending we continue to expect adjusted ebitda growth of  to  excluding cloud expenses growth would be  to  separately we have trimmed our capex forecast a bit and now expect capex excluding cost related to our headquarters project to be down yearoveryear for the full year we are expecting depreciation expense to grow in the mid range with the pace of growth decelerating from q through the end of the year with that lets turn to questions questionandanswer session operator well go first to naved khan with cantor fitzgerald naved khan  cantor fitzgerald securities yes hi thank you very much just on – two quick questions so first on homeaway dara can you talk about the conversion rates on the instantly bookable properties what kind of trend you have seen to date and what should we expect going forward given that you are willing to spend so much on the variable channels and then i have a followup dara khosrowshahi  expedia inc sure in general we are seeing overall conversion rates at homeaway continue to increase on a yearonyear basis and continuing to increase at healthy rates so when you look at the booking trends which are strong and positive its a combination of traffic to homeaway increasing on a yearonyear basis its double digits were being hurt by seo but certainly being helped by other traffic sources including the investment that were making in the variable channels and then the team is optimizing around booking conversion and booking conversion is up at healthy rates on a yearonyear basis although we feel that we have a long way to go in general the move towards what were trying to make are two moves one is from offline to online bookable and we have over  of our properties now online bookable and then were also making the transition over from online bookable to instant bookable thats still earlier and we think that the move to instant booking will continue to be a tailwind as it relates to overall conversion rates naved khan  cantor fitzgerald securities okay and then just sort of drilling a little bit into the – into your response so what should we expect about your ability to tweak the best sort for the remain as we look into the remainder of the year so i guess with the ungrandfathering of the subscriptions you would probably have more flexibility to do that what would be the cadence of your tweak to the thing dara khosrowshahi  expedia inc yeah id say the cadence is unpredictable these are – were putting in sort changes on a daily weekly basis you are right to conclude that as the paid tier subscription or the higher tier subscriptions roll off we have greater room for optimization and we think were very very early in the overall optimization so the sort teams continue to roll out new algorithms and in general the algorithms are getting better and better and this is really before we put machine learning into play as well these are call it more static algorithms that are being optimized and i think machine learning can take this to a different level and were really one year in here so we got a long long way to go mark d okerstrom  expedia inc and naved as a reminder that tiered subscriptions will completely become a nonissue starting in july of this year so at that point weve got complete freedom but as dara said theres lots of tests already going on operator well go next to peter stabler with wells fargo securities peter c stabler  wells fargo securities llc thanks very much for the question a couple if i could last quarter you talked about improving the homeowner dashboard control to help property owners better understand the algorithms wondering if any of those improvements have rolled out yet and if so what the feedback has been and then secondly wondering if you could give us any color on orbitz thanks so much dara khosrowshahi  expedia inc sure as far as the owner dashboard we have – theres been a significant amount of development going into the owner dashboard in general we want to arm up the owners with significantly more data both in terms of their earning power in terms of the kinds of folks looking at their properties and really how they can capture more share within our marketplace i would expect some pretty significant releases over the year i think were pretty early weve introduced some better calendar management for example weve optimized the traveler app for the checkout experiences weve launched house rules that inform travelers of whats expected of them before they book but i think these are really the basics and were just getting started here i do think we can do a better job in general in explaining to owners what they can and should be doing to improve their sorts one of the significant factors is content the quality of content as far as pictures goes the quality of content as far as what to expect when you get into the home and obviously reviews and i do think that this is an area that when we talk to our owners we get some feedback that we can be doing better and the homeaway team is certainly focused on making sure owners understand exactly why they are getting the demand that theyre getting and how they can optimize and improve their demand inside the marketplace mark d okerstrom  expedia inc and then peter in terms of orbitz id say generally were pretty pleased with the way that the – what was the old orbitz and is now part of expedia inc is performing in terms of just some specifics on that from a topline perspective the business is still declining and call it the midteens range as a reminder the reason for this is theres a number of formerly orbitz partner network customers that we didnt migrate over a number of points of sale for eworkers that we didnt migrate over some orbitz for business customers that we didnt migrate over but if you back out the impact of that the core of the business looks good the conversion rates were seeing on hotel looks solid and of course the cost synergies that we really brought in to fruition through  are there in full force so were happy with what we see we are still optimizing the orbitz businesses and getting that right marketing formula in place to optimize for profit margin and of course profit margin in these businesses looks absolutely excellent next question please operator well go next to jed kelly with oppenheimer jed kelly  oppenheimer  co inc great thanks for taking my question should we expect homeaway online gross bookings to follow similar seasonal trends as last year or as you are able to pivot the business to a more transactional model should we expect a more smooth seasonal pattern and then additionally for homeaway can you provide a breakdown between traveler fee or transactional revenue versus subscription and other dara khosrowshahi  expedia inc sure ill answer the first jed we are getting used to homeaway booking patterns and stay patterns at this point so we cant answer your question with absolute certainty it actually looks to us like the seasonal stay patterns are going to become more pronounced what were seeing is that the early entrants into the homeaway marketplace or property managers who might have had more apartments kind of the professionally managed concept apartments were seeing the average dollar value per property booking with homeaway move up which means that the bigger homes are coming online and the demand is moving over to the bigger homes those larger homes tend to be more seasonal in nature so we would actually expect to see a higher percentage of dollar stays if for homeaway concentrated in q than what you saw last year mark you want to answer the homeaway traveler fee versus transactional revenue mark d okerstrom  expedia inc yes sure yeah so were not going to give the quarterly number but just as a reminder what we said was that by the end of  here wed be at about  subscription and no change were really on track to turn that way operator well go next to ross sandler with barclays deepak mathivanan  barclays capital inc hey guys this is deepak on for ross can you talk about the levels of marketing spend that are going into different components between the ota brands and homeaway this year i think homeaway was expected to ramp and then given the several quarters we are into the integration are the practices that are employed typically in expedia to optimize for conversions currently put into place in homeaway at this stage how do you view their efficiency of marketing programs i have one more followup after that dara khosrowshahi  expedia inc yeah i think on the second question most definitely the ceo of homeaway is john kim and john was the head of product at expedia so you can imagine that we have taken a number of expedia practices and we have combined them with homeaway practices that come up with call it the bestofbreed both in terms of design and in product and in technology as well so the homeaway team is driving a lot more experimentation significantly more ab testing and the pace of change and testing on that site now is – while its not up to call it expedia or hotelscom standards it has significantly accelerated versus where they were a year ago and i anticipate its going to significantly accelerate going into next year which is going to help conversion rates and is also going to help our ability to market into variable channels we have moved over talent from online marketing from hotelscom to homeaway as well so theres a bunch of talent moving over the trends in terms of conversion are good its translating into higher online marketing numbers and its safe to assume that the homeaway marketing spend on a yearonyear basis the increase is higher than the yearonyear increases that you see in our core ota anything to add there mark mark d okerstrom  expedia inc yeah i mean id say id put some numbers on it i think our direct sales and marketing for homeaway up north of  in the first quarter we will start to see those decelerate though as we move through the year because were going to lap particularly in the back half of the year the aggressive rampup in sales and marketing thats not in a spot where its totally moving the needle on our overall sales and marketing numbers yet although it is a factor and to your other point around where were putting dollars across the core ota brands were really putting money in behind brand expedia were putting it in behind hotelscom egencia is a driver as well other segment for us and when you look at the bulk of our direct sales and marketing spend which is growing  in the quarter i think about the growth rate in sales and marketing in the core ota segment as being pretty close to that because thats really where its going its going to the big global brands operator well go next to douglas anmuth with jpmorgan dara khosrowshahi  expedia inc there doug operator douglas your line is open please check your mute function dara khosrowshahi  expedia inc lets try someone else and maybe doug will come back operator well go next to brian fitzgerald with jefferies brian p fitzgerald  jefferies llc thanks guys as you look at the inventory additions this quarter can you give us any color of the mix overall hotels versus nontraditional i guess what im getting at is are you happy with your overall inventory mix maybe across geographies are you happy with the way youre adding nontraditional and hotels dara khosrowshahi  expedia inc yeah id say were happy but we think we have a long way to go the inventory now is at about  hotels we are early in the integration of the homeaway inventory into the mainline ota inventory so were just getting started there and we have a long way to go and we think that the pace of inventory addition i think weve added its up about  on a yearonyear basis as far as inventory goes that kind of a pace is going to continue its not going to be consistent every single quarter but that kind of a base is certainly going to continue the new hotels continue to perform well within our marketplace they represent an opportunity for us to spend more marketing dollars as well as to increase conversion on a destination basis as well and its just part of the formula right now its higher conversion the higher conversion driving more marketing both online and offline the more marketing allowing us the ability to add more supply into the marketplace and all of that increasing customer loyalty which is really the formula that weve had for a long time and youve got to optimize each portion of that formula a little bit in order to improve and of course you have to improve more than the overall market because the market is certainly improving as well so i think we are in the early middle portion of the game and were quite optimistic about the opportunities here over the next  to  years operator well go next to akshay bhatia with bank of america akshay bhatia  merrill lynch pierce fenner  smith inc hi thanks for the question when we look at the core ota take rate looks pretty stable yearoveryear could you talk about some of the puts and takes specifically touching on maybe the mix of agency hotel accelerator and then maybe some of the negotiations you guys are having with hotel brands mark d okerstrom  expedia inc yeah so i think the story is similar to what weve seen for a while i think on the hotel side there still is a little bit of a headwind on margin although thats significantly less than what its been in the past thats essentially offset by a couple of factors one is we do continue to see a mix shift of the business towards hotel which is generally going faster than our air business secondly weve seen nice results from ancillary revenues and media revenues that are also buttressing those take rates and all of those sort of net out to something thats relatively stable and i think were happy with generally where we are and were particularly happy with some of these ancillary revenue streams in the core ota business like insurance like our activities business that are performing nicely akshay bhatia  merrill lynch pierce fenner  smith inc thank you dara khosrowshahi  expedia inc youre welcome next question please operator well go next to paul bieber with credit suisse paul bieber  credit suisse securities usa llc thanks for taking my questions first off how should we think about the room night growth trajectory during the summer booking season for both domestic and international given the deceleration and especially domestic in the reported numbers and then just generally how would you characterize the macro backdrop for travel in the us europe and apac mark d okerstrom  expedia inc sure so in terms of room night growth id just remind you that the easter impact was significant here in the first quarter we were actually quite happy with what we saw in terms of room night growth and generally pointed to stable to faster in the first quarter on the normalized numbers that we look at a few things to keep in mind though as we move into q and q one is easter will be a helper for us in q from a reported basis and then our comps do start to get easier as we move into q and again the easiest comp is probably into q so a few things to keep in mind on that front in terms of the macro landscape in europe and otherwise i think largely similar i think the london attack for us we could certainly see impact to london but its hard to tease that out completely from easter and our expectation thing would be to get back to business as usual is thats what weve seen generally with other regions the elections in france didnt cause too much of a stir for us the macro backdrop in europe seems to be reasonably healthy when we look at the us again similar stories things seem to be reasonably healthy we have seen a little bit of a slowdown in travel from the middle east into the us and a few crossregional patterns like that but netnet from where we see looks like a healthy market to us operator well go next to heath terry with goldman sachs heath terry  goldman sachs  co great thanks i was just wondering if you could give us a bit of a sense of strategically how youre thinking about the tradeoff between sales and marketing leverage and revenue growth obviously youve got the targets out there for ebitda but to the extent that we saw the roughly  basis points of deleverage in sales and marketing this year or this quarter can you give us a sense of what youre trying to get or what you think youll get out of that kind of spend from a revenue growth perspective and where as a company youre happy with that revenue growth being mark d okerstrom  expedia inc thanks heath i guess just one note for you in terms of sales and marketing leverage this quarter this is always a tough quarter for us from a sales and marketing deleverage standpoint and primary reason is that were spending sales and marketing essentially against bookings not against stayed revenues so theres a little bit of a mismatch thats accentuated this quarter by the fact that we had easter also shift which of course is an impact revenue and nothing to sales and marketing id say generally our strategy though as it relates to sales and marketing has not changed i mean we are really looking to drive bottomline adjusted ebitda dollar growth and to that end really were looking to spend to drive more volume get new customers into the platform have them get a great experience and have them come back to us through the direct channels like apps like email et cetera and the formula is working and so most of what you see when you see sales and marketing delevered with us is largely as a result of mix drivers its the fact that were spending more aggressively and the region is getting bigger asia pacific for example than we are in the us and though even asia – even though asia is less efficient from a sales and marketing perspective than the us thats whats driving the mix and asia itself is getting more efficient over time we also see channel shifts in our sales and marketing expense as we drive conversion it allows us to spend more into variable marketing channels again the direct channels the chief channels still look very healthy and theyre growing nicely but essentially were able to buy more in these variable channels and thats a factor for us as well so i think youll see the same strategy for us we like to invest aggressively in sales and marketing we like to fund that with leverage and fixed cost thats the formula and i think youll expect see that for a long time to come dara khosrowshahi  expedia inc and just to push that home heath we are not at all sensitive to overall sales and marketing leverage or deleverage as a percentage of revenue were very much sensitive to channel roi but really the two factors that we look at when were trying to gauge the health of the business is how fast is our direct channel growing and that growth really is the biggest driver of our profit growth and that has been healthy and were happy about the signs there and then how much money can we put to work in some of these indirect channels especially outside of the us because thats a key factor as the new customer acquisition and then moving those new customers into loyalty customers for example with hotelscom or getting those new customers to try out packages on expedia that really is an opportunity to save that you cant find really any place else and the more new customers we bring in to some extent the worse our sales and marketing leverage is going to look just because of the margins in that part of the business but that usually is not connected to roi were pretty disciplined about our roi in these channels and as a result were just driving roi and the amount we spend in each channel is to some extent unbalanced well spend as much as we can at a certain roi the more you spend in the channel the more difficult it is to drive rois that are attractive and those are the two factors that essentially are going after each other operator and well go next to ron josey with jmp securities ronald v josey  jmp securities llc great thanks for taking the question just one or two first and foremost you talked about hotel room nights booked great to see that metric grew  yearoveryear is this something we can expect going forward or more like a onetime disclosure just talking about the booking trends in the quarter and then dara following up on that last comment actually around new packages and may be mark to your ancillary revenue comments there has been talk about the newer format package as more flexible can you just help us understand where that is and how sort of meaningful that is in the rollout and then lastly any insight on homeaway properties on expedia would be helpful thank you mark d okerstrom  expedia inc ron so just on the hotel room nights booked its something that we will periodically disclose when we find it to be helpful to understand whats happening in the business in this case because easter was just such a big factor both for the core ota business and particularly for homeaway we thought it was relevant to point it out in normal operating circumstances those numbers actually look relatively close together but when theyre not we will call it out when its helpful on the packages side ill start and then dara definitely jump in i think we are at a id say relatively early stage here the brand expedia team particularly is working on some really interesting ways to dramatically improve the shopping experience when youre shopping for travel we can – call it packages but the experience starts to look a lot more just like a multiitem purchase where either during the time of your purchase you can bundle things together in whatever order you want into almost like a shopping cart experience or increasing what were seeing as products that weve launched where if you booked a flight you dont necessarily have to book it at the same time but you can get a big discount on a hotel or maybe a car rental or an activity so i think were relatively early here the exciting thing is when we look at it theres really only one player on a global basis that can do these types of things there are things that at least our early tests suggest that consumers really want and we think that brand expedia and the whole brand expedia multiproduct group including orbitz and travelocity and wotif and cheaptickets and ebookers in that great staple of brands are going to benefit from this for many many many years to come dara khosrowshahi  expedia inc the only thing i would add just the key to what mark said is with our package path in the past we would force our users to declare that theyre looking for a package upfront and the fact is that most travelers dont look – a vast majority of our travelers arent looking for packages upfront so the key here in our development is allowing users to attach more and more products to the single product that they came into the shop for so to speak we are consistently driving up our attach rates we think theres a lot of upside there and as we are able to attach more that allows us to actually pay more for new customers that we find especially in variable channels and international pointsofsale as well so it has a double effect and that obviously it allows us to monetize users more effectively it allows us to deliver discounts to those users that they cant find pretty much anywhere else on the web and also the more contact that we have with our users the better the more relevant that we are the better and it allows us to be more aggressive about marketing in the various channels so we think its – were in the middle of the game and we think theres lots of potential left for us in that area as far as the homeaway properties on expedia were up to almost  properties on the platform still relatively small compared to the overall homeaway supply base and one of the factors there is that the expedia model is based on commission and the homeaway model is based on a combination of commission and traveler service fee and we are going to be looking to build that flexibility into the expedia platform which we think is really going to open up the expedia hotelscom channel into the homeaway supply as well so that is going to happen throughout the year i would say that when you look at this year and the development of homeaway this year by far the number one priority for us is pushing homeaway and developing that trend – that transition from an advertising platform to a global transactional platform we think the upside there is absolutely enormous and by far the number one priority is homeaway on a standalone basis the homeaway supply on expedia hotelscom is considerable longterm upside but its priority number two at this point operator well go next to kevin kopelman with cowen  company kevin kopelman  cowen  co llc hi thanks a lot i just had a followup on homeaway when you look at night stayed there at plus  in q versus nights booked at plus  it was a pretty dramatic recovery could you just go over the top key factors again that you saw over q and q in that business that drove the acceleration thanks mark d okerstrom  expedia inc thanks kevin well easter was a factor but by far the biggest factor is a lengthening in the booking window that were seeing with homeaway and it really goes to we believe anyways one of the factors that dara called out the early adopters on online bookability were predominantly some of the larger property managers and as we have rolled out online bookability throughout a broader selection of properties what weve actually seen is an increase in the value per booking which suggests to us that theres a mix shift into some of these larger bigger tickets wholehome unique properties and those types of properties generally need to be booked much further in advance so were definitely seeing a lengthening of the booking window we think that could be a driver we havent nailed down all of the specifics of what could be causing it but thats by far the most obvious one that we can see at this point kevin kopelman  cowen  co llc okay great and then just to followup on that how far along do you think you are in the process of kind of making sure all of the business that youre originating is  transacted online to the platform mark d okerstrom  expedia inc well id say weve got a ways to go on that its a big opportunity still we know that there are transactions that are happening offplatform and the team is really focused on really developing reasons why both on the traveler side and on the property owner side or property manager side reasons for people to stick with the platform youve seen it on the consumer side where theyve introduced the book with confidence guarantee increasingly youll see homeaway willing to step in front of a traveler and if theyve got a bad experience help them move to a new property or help solve their problem they are working on various series of what id call carrots and sticks on the owner and the supplier side to incent the right behavior and put more bookings on the platform theyre early on that side theyve got a number of supplierfacing data and tools that theyre building out dashboarding et cetera as dara mentioned theyre experimenting with sort and these are the types of factors around onplatform versus offplatform that can start to influence sort order and theres a number of other call it goodies that homeaway is looking at rolling out across the platform to incent the right behavior so its relatively early its a really high priority for that team and were very optimistic that theyre going to be able to increasingly just drive much more onplatform adoption because its going to be something that both travelers and suppliers want to do dara khosrowshahi  expedia inc yes i think were going to make it considerably more attractive especially for our homeowners and property managers to stay on platform so there are some pretty exciting products coming out there so stay tuned operator and well go next to mark mahaney with rbc capital markets jim shaughnessy  rbc capital markets llc good afternoon thanks guys this is jim shaughnessy stepping in for mark just a quick question on international booking trends i think on the last call you mentioned that you expect trends to improve throughout  and it looks like they have so maybe building off a prior question why dont you drill down a little bit on which markets you think are performing particularly well and continue in  thanks mark d okerstrom  expedia inc yes i mean i think were seeing a broad pickup across the region brand expedia particularly has seen some nice growth in europe they rolled out some new features in the air side of the business thats been driving some really solid results weve seen strong results in various parts of asia hotelscom is having a blockbuster year so far in south korea posting pretty impressive results and latin america generally is good mexico has been pretty strongly really for across our brands id also say that one of the things to keep in mind when youre looking at international booking trends is that we will start to see some improvement further in the back half of the year as we lap over the ebookers transition and thats actually a headwind on bookings and because it was a business that had a fair bit of air in it it has a disproportionate impact on gross bookings but id say generally asia latin america and europe are strengths with the countries i mentioned dara khosrowshahi  expedia inc and paris is coming back now is recovering from obviously the negative numbers that we saw last year so paris is growing for us which is great to see that city certainly needs a business and london as a destination for us is very very strong which we think has to do with the british pound once the british pound went down london as a destination became – the numbers there were pretty darn attractive and they continue as we speak operator well go next to mike olson with piper jaffray michael olson  piper jaffray  co hey good afternoon i guess you may have answered some portion of the question but tell us what percent of homeaway properties or transactions are now capturing the traveler bookings or do you expect to keep that at  of properties or will there always be some subset that dont capture the booking fees mark d okerstrom  expedia inc well the general way to think about it is when properties are online bookable so the  million properties we have that are online bookable they are all feeable and are generally all being applied a traveler fee to it on the homeaway platform there will be some that are on the brand expedia platform for example which currently dont have a fee attached to them but generally on homeaway everything thats online think about that as traveler feeable there are still some transactions though that are happening offline which we dont have great visibility into and thats where youd call there be leakage if you will but thats really isolated to the offline business michael olson  piper jaffray  co okay and then you talked about buying back  shares so far this year is it your goal to somewhat offset stock comp dilution or is the goal longerterm to actually shrink the share count over time through your buyback activity or do you kind of want to focus on keeping dry powder for acquisitions thank you mark d okerstrom  expedia inc well id say its the same strategy as weve always had if you look back over history we have shrunk our share count over time and were big believers in this business and i would look at our past behavior as an indication of what we will likely do in the future but thats not the case always from quartertoquarter and its not always the case from yeartoyear and we certainly take into account the ma pipeline and what were thinking about doing on that side we look at our dividend and then share repurchase is something that we do look at we always have an eye to dilution but its not formulaic its not the driver and we do think that part of our capital allocation strategy will include share repurchases over the next number of years alan pickerill  expedia inc next question please operator well go next to mark may with citi mark a may  citigroup global markets inc thanks for taking my questions i appreciate it hopefully these werent taken already but in terms of core ota margins could you provide any color in terms of how much of the modest decline yearonyear was attributable to investments in say new markets new growth initiatives versus kind of investing and doubling down if you will in some of your core markets and if you could provide if you havent already a progress update in terms of where you are in terms of leveraging the homeaway inventory across the expedia brands and what if any impact that that is having either in q or you expect to have this year in terms of room night growth thanks mark d okerstrom  expedia inc mark the real driver on margins for the quarter was the shift of easter to the second quarter that id call that number one and no real other significant drivers id call out its really sort of business as usual for us and were happy with the margin profile that we see and i think in q youll probably see the offset there of what happened in the first quarter dara you want to talk about homeaway dara khosrowshahi  expedia inc mark on the homeaway inventory we talked about it some earlier its very early right now the production of homeaway inventory on expedia brands is pretty small and we would expect to see that increase significantly as the year goes on and especially into next year the priority for the homeaway teams at this point is to make sure that the transition to online transactions go smoothly make sure that the experience the traveler experience and the homeowner experience is as good as it can be and thats really what were focused on at this point operator well go next to justin patterson with raymond james justin t patterson  raymond james  associates inc great thank you very much first on egencia dara you alluded to the business hitting an inflection point could you discuss what changed and just remind us whether the sales force investment was in the initial plan for the year or if it does something youve decided that lean into and invest a bit more in and then secondly on homeaway could you walk through just what differences you see between conversion on instantly bookable and online bookable today and then what levers you have to move back more toward instant bookable over time thanks dara khosrowshahi  expedia inc sure as far as egencia hitting an inflection point egencia has been – the team has been hard at work in a number of integrations over the past three years via integration orbitz for business integrations the orbitz business integration really really going well and those integrations always take time and they take focus and they cost money and at the same time the team has been investing in the core systems of the business to globalize them or to modernize the technology stack really in the same way that weve been consistently doing with expedia hotelscom et cetera egencia has been a little later in coming just because of all the integrations that the team has been driving but we feel like were in a really good spot where the team is starting to deliver just excellent innovation on the product side the sale the response to our sales pictures et cetera has been very attractive and we just continue to gain share in the core travel marketplace we think that we are competing against a set of competitors who has fundamentally not made the shift online has fundamentally not made the shift to agile technology and we think this is the time for it to double down so seeing the very strong results in the first quarter we were already planning to invest in the egencia sales team but the pattern for our company overall expedia inc is when we see some strength we like to lean into that strength and with egencia were seeing strength were leaning into that strength and it will be safe to assume that the sales plan and the sales hiring plan for egencia is higher today than where we started a year from and thats a great thing as far as homeaway the differences in conversion were not going to disclose specific differences but its safe to assume that online bookable properties convert and produce at better rates – sorry instant bookable properties produce at stronger rates than simply online bookable properties right now the focus is moving the folks to online bookable and we will quickly shift to getting as much of them instant bookable as possible operator well go next to michael millman with millman research associates michael millman  millman research associates thank you kind of following up on some of the things you suggested interested in your thoughts on if you see some major disruptive technology on the horizon and if so where so and when so and does it involve ai or what it may involve and sort of unrelated to that can you talk about what youre seeing in timeshare business as competitive for homeaway and for maybe some of the related type of companies thank you mark d okerstrom  expedia inc i think ai is a good deal down the road i think right now we are more dependent on oi organic intelligence here of folks here at the company i think as far as disruptive technology i do like to talk about the ms and its not disruptive its just happening one is mobile for us and right now with most brands over athird of our transactions are mobile over half of our traffic is mobile and the cool thing about mobile is its always on and it gives you location context the second m for us thats emerging especially in the apac markets are messaging and what messaging does for us is it allows twoway communication at any time but it also combines identity with our communication and once you have identity you can start communicating with someone on a onetoone basis most of our systems right now are built to serve the average basically as a consumer when you come to expedia most of our systems are built to serve the average consumer now more and more we can optimize to the specific customer and you combine that with a third m which is machine learning it is only possible to optimize to the individual based on very significant amounts of data very significant amounts of interaction so that you can start treating every single customer in a different way you can go back to the olden days when youre travel agent knew exactly what you wanted this is going to be disruptive but its going to be a slow disruption as we learn more and more about you as you tell us more and more about you through your behavior and otherwise give us more data but we think that that personal onetoone connection is something thats coming over a period of time and we think that because we have so many opportunities to interact with a customer we are – and also because we are investing significantly in technology in product in user interaction i think that we are one of the best positioned companies in travel to take advantage of it so call it a slow disruption but it is absolutely coming as far as the timeshare business as it relates to homeaway i think the timeshare companies and timeshare owners probably are participants in the homeaway marketplace but i cant say that its something that we talk about on a significant basis in the homeaway haul so im sure theyre part of the marketplace but at this point its not a significant portion of our strategy operator well go next to perry gold with moffettnathanson perry gold  moffettnathanson llc hi thanks for taking the question two please if i may is there any other color you can provide on the overall performance at your ota brand other than orbitz and then also the stepup at intercompany eliminations does that just have to do with expedias brand taking more share on trivago or driving more traffic through trivago relative to other channels thanks so much mark d okerstrom  expedia inc sure ill take those perry but just take the second one first the answer is yes that is largely due to our brands so it could be brand expedia hotelscom taking share in the trivago channel and doing very well there super attractive channel right now in the market generally just because its growing so quickly and our brands are performing well and were very happy with the performance there so it shows up in that number in terms of overall performance at the core ota brands i think brand expedia is doing very well right now its great to have that team refocused on the core business and not so focused on integrations they did a phenomenal job of those integrations but as we all know they did take a toll on the results but that team is right back to business as usual theyre thrilled to be back to business as usual and theyre thrilled with the opportunity ahead of them and theyre going after it and the results are starting to show up were pleased with what were seeing at hotelscom as well that team has been executing very well for a long period of time theyve got a great rewards program and they continue to press on that their international growth i mentioned south korea is impressive and they just continue to execute on their formula around the world and then id also call out our private label business the expedia affiliate network business who had a really good year last year and is just on a really solid footing this year just exceptional results really powering the whole industry offline travel agencies corporate travel players other online travel agencies airlines all with our worldclass agency and merchant hotel inventory and id just say the team is executing very well there and were very excited about what that team can do operator well go next to eric sheridan with ubs eric j sheridan  ubs securities llc thanks for taking the question i think in a number of industry forums its come up recently that paid marketing channels might actually be increasing their importance in terms of the way consumers are finding travel brands planning their travel you obviously have a play on that with trivago but i dont know if either dara or mark if you would like to talk about the importance of the paid marketing channels how relative rois might be evolving at some of those channels versus what you can do brand building and trying to drive more direct traffic over time and maybe lowering your overall roi over time thanks guys dara khosrowshahi  expedia inc sure eric in general listen i think its accurate to say that the paid channels are growing their audience share in terms of travel spend and the fastest share growth is coming from the meta channels and the fastest share grower in the meta channels is trivago that team is really executing on a worldclass basis and trivago i think as far as audience share as far as the channel goes probably the fastestgrowing scaled channel there is in terms of audience and thats a great thing and as it relates to our relationship with these paid channels i think in general the otas are consistently investing in conversion in user experience and in data science that allows us to get call it a higher share of those paid channels than the other players out there so while from a profitability margin basis the increase in growth of those paid channels hurts our margin we talked a little bit about our sales and marketing margin as a percentage of revenue from a share standpoint it is unquestionably a positive for us and its a bigger positive because trivago is a part of the family were very strict on rois and in general rois for us look stable and they look good and we view the paid channels as very significant means for us to gain share and a significant means for us to go acquire new customers especially in international markets and then if we provide them for – if we provide those customers a great experience again and again we see that a certain percentage of those customers move over to repeat customers and stay with us and come direct and when you look at the profit dollars that are coming into call it the big two otas you can certainly see that the profit dollars and the profit dollar growth there is quite healthy on a global basis and at this point i dont see anything that would change that operator and well go next to lloyd walmsley with deutsche bank seth gilbert  deutsche bank securities inc thanks for the question this is seth on for lloyd i was wondering if you could provide any additional color as to how homeaway contributed to room night growth in the quarter and what the core room night yearoveryear was as it seems to slowed even given the exeaster and leap year impact thanks mark d okerstrom  expedia inc yeah so homeaways standalone stayed room night growth was right in line with the rest of the business so it didnt have an impact it did help the books room night metric that we gave you but i think also just keep in mind that the other number we gave is just around the global brands which grew about  yearoveryear on a stayed basis so homeaway was a factor but it didnt change the story at all for us next question please operator that is all the time we have questions for today so ill hand the call back over for alan pickerill for any additional or closing remarks alan pickerill  expedia inc great job thanks everybody for joining us today we appreciate it dara any closing remarks dara khosrowshahi  expedia inc
