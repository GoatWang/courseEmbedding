incorporated in the state of delaware on november   since inception the company has been engaged in organizational efforts and obtaining initial financing the company was formed as a vehicle to pursue a business combination and has made no efforts to identify a possible business combination as a result the company has not conducted negotiations or entered into a letter of intent concerning any target business the business purpose of the company is to seek the acquisition of or merger with an existing company the company selected december  as its fiscal year end   the company is currently considered to be a “blank check” company the us securities and exchange commission the “sec” defines those companies as “any development stage company that is issuing a penny stock within the meaning of section  a of the securities exchange act of  as amended the “exchange act” and that has no specific business plan or purpose or has indicated that its business plan is to merge with an unidentified company or companies” under sec rule b under the exchange act the company also qualifies as a “shell company” because it has no or nominal assets other than cash and no or nominal operations many states have enacted statutes rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of “blank check” companies in their respective jurisdictions management does not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in our securities either debt or equity until we have successfully concluded a business combination the company intends to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the exchange act for so long as it is subject to those requirements   in addition the company is an “emerging growth company” as defined in the jumpstart our business startups act of  “jobs act” and may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including but not limited to not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section b of the sarbanesoxley act and exemptions from the requirements of sections aa and b of the securities exchange act of  to hold a nonbinding advisory vote of shareholders on executive compensation and any golden parachute payments not previously approved   the company has also elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under section b of the jobs act this election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies as a result of this election our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates   we will remain an “emerging growth company” until the earliest of  the last day of the fiscal year during which our revenues exceed  billion  the date on which we issue more than  billion in nonconvertible debt in a three year period  the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement filed pursuant to the securities act of  as amended the “securities act” or  when the market value of our common stock that is held by nonaffiliates exceeds  million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter to the extent that we continue to qualify as a “smaller reporting company” as such term is defined in rule b under the securities exchange act of  after we cease to qualify as an emerging growth company certain of the exemptions available to us as an emerging growth company may continue to be available to us as a smaller reporting company including  not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section b of the sarbanes oxley act  scaled executive compensation disclosures and  the requirement to provide only two years of audited financial statements instead of three years          the company was organized as a vehicle to investigate and if such investigation warrants acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation the company’s principal business objective for the next  months and beyond such time will be to achieve longterm growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate shortterm earnings the company will not restrict its potential candidate target companies to any specific business industry or geographical location and thus may acquire any type of business   the analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of the officers and directors of the company  as of this date the company has not entered into any definitive agreement with any party regarding business opportunities for the company  the company has unrestricted flexibility in seeking analyzing and participating in potential business opportunities in that it may seek a business combination target located in any industry or location in its efforts to analyze potential acquisition targets the company will consider the following kinds of factors   apotential for growth indicated by new technology anticipated market expansion or new products   bcompetitive position as compared to other firms of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the industry as a whole   cstrength and diversity of management either in place or scheduled for recruitment   dcapital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds to be provided by the company or from operations through the sale of additional securities through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources   ethe cost of participation by the company as compared to the perceived tangible and intangible values and potentials   fthe extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced and   gthe accessibility of required management expertise personnel raw materials services professional assistance and other required items   in applying the foregoing criteria no one of which will be controlling management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data potentially available business opportunities may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex due to the company’s limited capital available for investigation the company may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the opportunity to be acquired in evaluating a prospective business combination we will conduct as extensive a due diligence review of potential targets as possible given the lack of information which may be available regarding private companies our limited personnel and financial resources and the inexperience of our management with respect to such activities we expect that our due diligence will encompass among other things meetings with the target business’s incumbent management and inspection of its facilities as necessary as well as a review of financial and other information which is made available to us this due diligence review will be conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage including but not limited to attorneys accountants consultants or such other professionals at this time the company has not specifically identified any third parties that it may engage the costs associated with hiring third parties to complete a business combination target may be significant and are difficult to determine as such costs may vary depending on a variety of factors including the amount of time it takes to complete a business combination the location of the target company and the size and the complexity of the target company our limited funds and the lack of fulltime management will likely make it impracticable to conduct a complete and exhaustive investigation and analysis of a target business before we consummate a business combination management decisions therefore will likely be made without detailed feasibility studies independent analysis market surveys and the like which if we had more funds available to us would be desirable we will be particularly dependent in making decisions upon information provided by the promoters owners sponsors or others associated with the target business seeking our participation          the time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete a business combination cannot presently be ascertained with any degree of certainty the amount of time it takes to complete a business combination the location of the target company and the size and complexity of the business of the target company are all factors that determine the costs associated with completing a business combination transaction the time and costs required to complete a business combination transaction can be ascertained once a business combination target has been identified any costs incurred with respect to evaluation of a prospective business combination that is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us   competition   in identifying evaluating and selecting a target business we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours there are numerous “public shell” companies either actively or passively seeking operating businesses with which to merge in addition to a large number of “blank check” companies formed and capitalized specifically to acquire operating businesses additionally we are subject to competition from other companies looking to expand their operations through the acquisition of a target business many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates many of these competitors possess greater technical human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses is limited by our available financial resources this inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business   any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination our management believes however that our status as a public entity and potential access to the united states public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privatelyheld entities with a business objective similar to ours to acquire a target business on favorable terms   if we succeed in effecting a business combination there will be in all likelihood intense competition from competitors of the target business many of our target business’ competitors are likely to be significantly larger and have far greater financial and other resources than we will some of these competitors may be divisions or subsidiaries of large diversified companies that have access to financial resources of their respective parent companies our target business may not be able to compete effectively with these companies or maintain them as customers while competing with them on other projects in addition it is likely that our target business will face significant competition from smaller companies that have specialized capabilities in similar areas we cannot accurately predict how our target business’ competitive position may be affected by changing economic conditions customer requirements or technical developments we cannot assure you that subsequent to a business combination we will have the resources to compete effectively   form of acquisition   the manner in which the company participates in an opportunity will depend upon the nature of the opportunity the respective needs and desires of the company and the promoters of the opportunity and the relative negotiating strength of the company and such promoters   it is likely that the company will acquire its participation in a business opportunity through the issuance of common stock or other securities of the company although the terms of any such transaction cannot be predicted it should be noted that in certain circumstances the criteria for determining whether or not an acquisition is a socalled “tax free” reorganization under section a of the internal revenue code of  as amended the “code” depends upon whether the owners of the acquired business own  or more of the voting stock of the surviving entity if a transaction were structured to take advantage of these provisions rather than other “tax free” provisions provided under the code all prior stockholders would in such circumstances retain  or less of the total issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity under other circumstances depending upon the relative negotiating strength of the parties prior stockholders may retain substantially less than  of the total issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity this could result in substantial additional dilution to the equity of those who were stockholders of the company prior to such reorganization          the stockholders of the company will likely not have control of a majority of the voting securities of the company following a reorganization transaction as part of such a transaction all or a majority of the company’s directors may resign and one or more new directors may be appointed without any vote by stockholders   in the case of an acquisition the transaction may be accomplished upon the sole determination of management without any vote or approval by stockholders in the case of a statutory merger or consolidation directly involving the company it will likely be necessary to call a stockholders’ meeting and obtain the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding securities the necessity to obtain such stockholder approval may result in delay and additional expense in the consummation of any proposed transaction and will also give rise to certain appraisal rights to dissenting stockholders most likely management will seek to structure any such transaction so as not to require stockholder approval   it is anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation drafting and execution of relevant agreements disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial cost for accountants attorneys and others if a decision is made not to participate in a specific business opportunity the costs theretofore incurred in the related investigation might not be recoverable furthermore even if an agreement is reached for the participation in a specific business opportunity the failure to consummate that transaction may result in the loss to the company of the related costs incurred   we presently have no employees apart from our management our officers and directors are engaged in outside business activities and anticipate that they will devote very limited time to our business until the acquisition of a successful business opportunity has been identified we expect no significant changes in the number of our employees other than such changes if any incident to a business combination   item a risk factors   as a “smaller

warrants acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation our principal business objective for the next  months and beyond such time will be to achieve longterm growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate shortterm earnings the company will not restrict our potential candidate target companies to any specific business industry or geographical location and thus may acquire any type of business          the company currently does not engage in any business activities that provide cash flow  during the next twelve months we anticipate incurring costs related to   i filing exchange act reports and   ii investigating analyzing and consummating an acquisition   we believe we will be able to meet these costs through use of funds in our treasury through deferral of fees by certain service providers and additional amounts as necessary to be loaned to or invested in us by our stockholders management or other investors as of the date of the period covered by this report the company has  in cash there are no assurances that the company will be able to secure any additional funding as needed currently however our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate future profitable operations andor to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due our ability to continue as a going concern is also dependent on our ability to find a suitable target company and enter into a possible reverse merger with such company management’s plan includes obtaining additional funds by equity financing through a reverse merger transaction andor related party advances however there is no assurance of additional funding being available   the company may consider acquiring a business which has recently commenced operations is a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products or markets is seeking to develop a new product or service or is an established business which may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital in the alternative a business combination may involve the acquisition of or merger with a company which does not need substantial additional capital but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares while avoiding among other things the time delays significant expense and loss of voting control which may occur in a public offering   our management has not had any contact or discussions with representatives of other entities regarding a business combination with us any target business that is selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth including entities without established records of sales or earnings in that event we will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies in addition we may effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk and although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks our management anticipates that it will likely be able to effect only one business combination due primarily to our limited financing and the dilution of interest for present and prospective stockholders which is likely to occur as a result of our management’s plan to offer a controlling interest to a target business in order to achieve a taxfree reorganization this lack of diversification should be considered a substantial risk in investing in us because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one venture against gains from another   the company anticipates that the selection of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky through information received from industry professionals and publications such as the reverse merger report our management believes that there are numerous firms seeking the perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include among other things facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained providing liquidity for the principals of and investors in a business creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees and offering greater flexibility in structuring acquisitions joint ventures and the like through the issuance of stock potentially available business combinations may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex    liquidity and capital resources   as of december   the company had total assets equal to  comprised of cash and cash equivalents  this

organizational efforts and obtaining initial financing the company was formed as a vehicle to pursue a business combination through the acquisition of or merger with an operating business the company filed a registration statement on form sb with the us securities and exchange commission the “sec” on february   and since its effectiveness the company has focused its efforts to identify a possible business combination the company based on proposed business activities is a “blank check” company the sec defines those companies as any development stage company that is issuing a penny stock within the meaning of section a of the securities exchange act  as amended the “exchange act” and that has no specific business plan or purpose or has indicated that its business plan is to merge with an unidentified company or companies many states have enacted statutes rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of blank check companies in their respective jurisdictions the company is also a “shell company” defined in rule b under the exchange act as a company with no or nominal assets other than cash and no or nominal operations management does not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in our securities either debt or equity until we have successfully concluded a business combination the company intends to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the exchange act for so long as we are subject to those requirements in addition the company is an “emerging growth company” as defined in the jumpstart our business startups act of  “jobs act” and may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including but not limited to not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section b of the sarbanesoxley act and exemptions from the requirements of sections aa and b of the securities exchange act of  to hold a nonbinding advisory vote of shareholders on executive compensation and any golden parachute payments not previously approved   the company has also elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under section b of the jobs act this election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies as a result of this election our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates          we will remain an “emerging growth company” until the earliest of  the last day of the fiscal year during which our revenues exceed  billion  the date on which we issue more than  billion in nonconvertible debt in a three year period  the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement filed pursuant to the securities act of  as amended or  when the market value of our common stock that is held by nonaffiliates exceeds  million as of  the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter to the extent that we continue to qualify as a “smaller reporting company” as such term is defined in rule b under the securities exchange act of  after we cease to qualify as an emerging growth company certain of the exemptions available to us as an emerging growth company may continue to be available to us as a smaller reporting company including  not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section b of the sarbanes oxley act  scaled executive compensation disclosures and  the requirement to provide only two years of audited financial statements instead of three years the company was organized as a vehicle to investigate and if such investigation warrants acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation the company’s principal business objective for the next  months and beyond such time will be to achieve longterm growth potential through a combination with an operating business the company will not restrict its potential candidate target companies to any specific business industry or geographical location and thus may acquire any type of business   the company currently does not engage in any business activities that provide cash flow  during the next twelve months we anticipate incurring costs related to i       filing exchange act reports and ii      investigating analyzing and consummating an acquisition   we believe we will be able to meet these costs through use of funds in our treasury through deferral of fees by certain service providers and additional amounts as necessary to be loaned to or invested in us by our stockholders management or other investors as of the date of the period covered by this report the company has  in cash there are no assurances that the company will be able to secure any additional funding as needed   currently however our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate future profitable operations andor to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due our ability to continue as a going concern is also dependent on our ability to find a suitable target company and enter into a possible reverse merger with such company management’s plan includes obtaining additional funds by equity financing through a reverse merger transaction andor related party advances however there is no assurance of additional funding being available the company may consider acquiring a business which has recently commenced operations is a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products or markets is seeking to develop a new product or service or is an established business which may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital in the alternative a business combination may involve the acquisition of or merger with a company which does not need substantial additional capital but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares while avoiding among other things the time delays significant expense and loss of voting control which may occur in a public offering        since our registration statement on form sb went effective our management has not had any contact or discussions with representatives of other entities regarding a business combination with us any target business that is selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth including entities without established records of sales or earnings in that event we will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies in addition we may effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk and although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks our management anticipates that it will likely be able to effect only one business combination due primarily to our limited financing and the dilution of interest for present and prospective stockholders which is likely to occur as a result of our management’s plan to offer a controlling interest to a target business in order to achieve a taxfree reorganization this lack of diversification should be considered a substantial risk in investing in us because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one venture against gains from another   the company anticipates that the selection of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky because of general economic conditions rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available capital our management believes that there are numerous firms seeking even the perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include among other things facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained providing liquidity for the principals of and investors in a business creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees and offering greater flexibility in structuring acquisitions joint ventures and the like through the issuance of stock potentially available business combinations may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex liquidity and capital resources as of june   the company had current assets equal to  comprised exclusively of cash and cash equivalents  this compares with current assets of   comprised of cash and cash equivalents and prepaid expenses as of december     the company’s current liabilities as of june   totaled

business plan of seeking a combination with a private operating company in addition the company is dependent upon certain related parties to provide continued funding and capital resources if continued funding and capital resources are unavailable at reasonable terms the company may not be able to implement its plan of operations        results of operations the company has not conducted any active operations since inception except for its efforts to locate suitable acquisition candidates no revenue has been generated by the company from november   inception though june   it is unlikely the company will have any revenues unless it is able to effect an acquisition or merger with an operating company of which there can be no assurance  it is managements assertion that these circumstances may hinder the companys ability to continue as a going concern  the company’s plan of operation for the next twelve months shall be to continue its efforts to locate suitable acquisition
