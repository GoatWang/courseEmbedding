a metal on the periodic chart with the symbol mo and the atomic number  in our world we call her moly for short in the science world she’s called molybdenum pronounced “mollibdinum” more about moly the metal and the robot  how we mine moly a quick overview of the process  our operations the world has an insatiable appetite for moly and for that we put plans in place people to work and machinery in motion we drill… …we blast… …we haul away ores that are then crushed… …ground… …floated… …and separated operating the mine is a  job our people are seven days on and seven days off moly is always there and is expected to be mined here until  in certain places across the globe the earth is uncommonly generous dishing up gems and minerals in abundance and it doesn’t take long for people to find them in central idaho those kinds of people — miners — arrived in the s in search of the mother of all precious metals — gold a century later in that place that eventually came to be known as custer county miners of another era arrived this time with modern machinery in pursuit of another kind of ore — an ore liberally laced with an element that would eventually make this area — and the thompson creek metals company — one of the world’s top producers of molybdenum those places thompson creek mine calls home are at elevations reaching upwards of feet thirty miles away is challis – the town that many of thompson creek’s employees call home it can be quiet up here maybe a noisy blue jay now and then… or the wind… or a bull elk two ridges away it can be about as quiet as quiet can get but it hasn’t always been that way    thompson creek mine staked its first mineral claims here in  when explorations revealed deposits projected to contain more than  million tons of molybdenumlaced ore getting to that ore however would take another sixteen years the company engaged in thorough environmental impact assessments – an ongoing practice it continues to place tremendous focus on in all it does every single day and after  million worth of studies and preparation the mine finally began operation in  the thompson creek molybdenum deposit occurs in a complex environment near a break between two geologic provinces which is to say that essentially fault lines within the earth here conspired to stir up conditions that made for the perfect recipe of an ore that would eventually become molybdenum    thompson creek mining company a subsidiary of thompson creek metals company inc presently controls a block of mineral claims comprising about  square miles of land or about  acres and while digging for ore is our primary goal we’ve also unearthed our fair share of environmental awards from the first shovel of rock thompson creek was developed within a comprehensive framework of state and federal regulations the mine pioneered the interagency task force a successful model for cooperative oversight by state and federal regulatory agencies our plan of operation covers ongoing mining waste rock disposal ore processing tailings disposal and eventually closure of the facility and final reclamations projected for     awards  recognition us forest service — environmentally safe

league — outstanding reclamation university of idaho college of earth sciences — balancing mining and environment bureau of land management — hardrock mineral community outreach and economic security award pacific northwest pollution control association idaho department of fish and game idaho division of environmental quality idaho department of water resources today thompson creek has an enviable record of excellence in the areas of reclamation environmental protection and stewardship and has been recognized by the many organizations    that’s why our process water treatment plants are nothing short of stateoftheart there’s nothing very subtle about mining never has been but our love for the streams we fish for the hills we hike and for the air we breathe – for those things that we hand down to our kids and grandkids – dictates why our environmental stewardship and innovative reclamation practices are the envy of the industry with all the commotion that takes place we manage to maintain a tremendous safety record — in fact when it comes to safety we are a bit extreme at the same time we strive to minimize our imprint on the worldaround us    yes it can be busy up here but never much more than a cup of coffee away in any direction is one of those places that can be as quiet as quiet can be as quiet as it’s always been up here in this land of uncommon abundance  end  technically thompson creek is a mine a company a major producer of molybdenum but enough of technicalities because thompson creek is more than that at our heart we’re a community – one that’s built on rock solid leadership and downtoearth people challis idaho is our home and the world around us contains an abundance of all we live for and work for that means taking care of our streams our air and our neighbors and digging deeper in all we do to make ours a community to be proud of    where natural resources are equal parts human nature and mother nature waste rock removal the tailings drilling

results for the three and six months ended june    prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles us gaap all dollar amounts are in united states us dollars unless otherwise indicatedjacques perron  president and chief executive officer of thompson creek said during the second quarter of  we continued to achieve solid performance with our companywide safety program  we reduced unit cash costs on a byproduct basis by  compared to the second quarter of  generated net cash flows from our molybdenum business of approximately  million and ended the quarter with working capital of approximately  million  including approximately  million of cashwe had a challenging quarter at mount milligan mine with decreased copper and gold payable production quarter over quarter as a result of lower recoveries resulting mainly from lower ore grades together with operational inefficiencies in the mill from higher throughput the performance for the quarter was also impacted by lower mill availability due to a scheduled relining of the sag mill and the planned relocation of the reclaim barge  additionally the operation incurred some unscheduled downtime associated with a tear to the main conveyor belt feeding the mill and electrical issues with one ball mill  based on our forecast for the balance of the year we expect annual production to be in line with our  guidance of  to  million pounds of copper and  to  thousand ounces of gold with payable copper production near the high end of the range and payable gold production at the low end of the range  for the remainder of  our primary operational focus is to continue to optimize the mine and mill with the expectation to gradually increase recoveries said mr perronas previously announced on

measures to assess the companys operating performance for the reasons described further below these measures do not have standard meanings prescribed by us gaap and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies the presentation of these measures is not intended to be considered in isolation from as a substitute for or as superior to the financial information prepared and

accordance with us gaapread moreadjusted net loss income adjusted net loss income per share—basic and dilutedmanagement of the company uses adjusted net loss income and adjusted net loss income per share basic and diluted to evaluate the companys operating performance and for planning and forecasting future business operations the company believes the use of these measures allows investors and analysts to compare results of the continuing operations of the company to similar operating results of other mining companies by excluding unusual or infrequent items that are considered noncore to its businessadjusted net loss income represents the loss income prepared in accordance with us gaap adjusted for significant noncash itemsfor the first three and six months of  and  and for the five quarters ended june    the significant items were the net gains and losses related to the impact of foreign exchange due primarily to intercompany notes and related tax effects additionally for the fourth quarter of  in connection with a change in its legal structure the company also had a significant noncash release of tax valuation allowances which were generated in prior years primarily as a result of asset impairmentsin connection with managements strategy to manage cash balances fund its operations and provide future tax benefits the company may enter into intercompany loan arrangements at times the loans are denominated in currencies other than the measurement currency of one of the parties us gaap requires that notes that are intended to be repaid should not be considered a capital contribution and therefore the foreign exchange fluctuations related to these loans impact net loss income each period at each period end management compares the exchange rate between the canadian and us dollars to the exchange rate at the end of the prior reporting period the difference between those rates is recorded as an unrealized gain or loss on the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss income at each period end settlement of these intercompany loans results in realized foreign exchange gains or losses recorded on the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss the loans between the parent company and its subsidiaries are the primary driver of our foreign exchange gains and losses as discussed above management does not consider gains or losses on foreign exchange in its evaluation of our financial performance management believes that presentation of our nongaap measures excluding these gains or losses provides useful information to the companys investors regarding our financial condition and results of operationsadjusted net loss income per share basic and diluted is calculated using adjusted net loss income as defined above divided by the weightedaverage basic and weightedaverage diluted shares outstanding during the period as determined in accordance with us gaap if the
