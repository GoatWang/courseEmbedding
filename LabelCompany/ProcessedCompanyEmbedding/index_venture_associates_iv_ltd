connections at firmmergers acquisitions and joint ventures mas amongst businesses are well known trends and often considered critical for the growth of a company additionally mas help to strengthen and explore market opportunities functional and financial synergy along with ability to generate additional revenues mas further encourage crosscultural growth transfer of technical knowhow and administrative maturity andor adaptation however mas do not always result in a success especially amongst companies with different objectives and scope of businesses at times companies tend to become overtly adamant leading to operative challenges while also facing difficulties in adapting to the cultural diversity in dissimilar markets nevertheless in todays time it is imperative to have mas with the key players in an industry so as to grow and eventually become market leaders a merger is a combination of two or more entities at various degree into forming one entity the result of merger is not only accumulation of assets and liabilities of the entities but also to form one business with the uniform objectives finances access to technologies and shared markets on the other hand an acquisition is a takeover by an acquirer entity by virtue of controlling the share capital assets andor liabilities of the target or acquired entity lastly joint ventures are coming together of two or more businesses for a purpose such as entering into a new business andor new expertise or for investments which may or may not be for a limited duration the different forms of mergers are explained under competition act  horizontal merger the merging entities are from the similar industries this merger supports merged entity towards monopoly by removing competitor as far as the competition concern this merger is performed under competition commission vertical merger the merging entities are at different stage even though from similar industries this merger supports merged entity towards greater independence and self sufficiency congeneric merger the merging entities with different customerrelationship even though from interrelated industries this merger supports merged entitys market growth by using aggregated customer relationship conglomerate merger the merging entities are from the different industries this merger results in support for the merged entity by financial resources and increased market value cash merger the shareholder of one entity receives cash instead of shares and exit from the merged entity triangular merger this is a tripartite arrangement as a target merges with a subsidiary of acquirer and vice versa also called triangular mergers mergers acquisitions and joint ventures in biosimilar industries a biosimilar is a biological drug that has similar pharmaceutical standards safety and efficacy profile visŕvis an approved reference biological molecule however unlike generics biosimilars do not have structural similarities or they do not form replica of the original molecule a biopharmaceutical entity dedicated to developing manufacturing and marketing of the biosimilars as part of its therapeutic portfolio is called a biosimilar entity in contemporary times the increased demand of biosimilars is not only beneficial to the biosimilar entities but also offers more viable options to the consumers or patients requiring treatment especially for diseases like cancer cardiovascular disorders arthritis etc mergers and acquisitions mas in biosimilar industries are primary to strengthen the service brand and patient accessibility for a certain drug moreover biosimilars mas also help to overcome challenges such as seeking investments research and development process manufacturing marketing andor distribution of biosimilars here are some of the prominent mas from biosimilar industries  the pfizers acquisition of hospira the acquisition of hospira by pfizer for  billion is one of the biggest horizontal mergers in recent years and has been approved conditionally by european commission ec merger regulation after investigating the competition concerns and commitments offered by the merging companies both pfizer and hospira are us based industries and global provider of injectable biosimilars and human pharmaceuticals respectively therefore the said acquisition helps pfizer to expand its existing generic injectable drugs range as well as access over the infusion technology and new  category of biosimilars are collectively expected to generate revenues of  million annually by  hospira inc is now a subsidiary of pfizer inc and the global market for biosimilars is estimated to be approximately  billion in  however hospiras biosimilars and generics range already helped to raise  revenues of pfizer as reported on its second quarter result after acquisitions later pfizer started to take a bid from hospiras few units and sites which seem underutilized as a part of cost cutting and improvisation in company performance in later  pfizer sold out hospiras infusion system his to icu medical and also planning to close hospiras plant at colorado and few sites at usa by   the icu medicals acquisition of hospira from pfizer a deal between pfizer and icu medical inc comes out as a cash and stock deal as icu acquired hospiras infusion system his having iv pumps solutions and devices from pfizer which compliments icu existing intravenous product portfolio consequently icu is expected to become a bigger player of infusions by this deal with hospira enhanced global marketing platform the deal is settled for  billion by exchange of cash of  million  million newly issued shares of icu medical apart from this pfizer will nominate one member on icu medicals board as long as it hold  of its equity however in january  the definitive agreement between icu and pfizer for hospira infusion system his has been revised as the latest performance report of his deviates as expected based on the modified agreement the deal is settled for  million  million in equity   millions cash   million seller note pfizer may be receiving additional  based on the his performance target till december  as per mr vivek jain chief executive officer icu medical the combination of these two businesses is the natural evolution of a productive relationship that began more than  years ago when hospira began integrating icu medical needle free technology into their infusion offering globally   gedeon richter acquisitions of finox holding the hungarian drugmaker gedeon richter acquire of finox holding a swiss biotech firm for   million finox holding a leading producer of wide range female reproductive health products has handed over the global right of bemfola development and marketing to richter by this transaction bemfola is a recombinanthuman follicle stimulating hormone rhfsh biosimilar of gonalf which stimulates egg development in ovaries and suggested during invitro fertilization the global right of bemfola includes the exclusive marketing authorization in eu presently counting  countries where drug is being sold already excluding marketing authorization in usa this acquisition helps richter not only to strengthen and expand its existing women healthcare portfolio by using finox scientific and managerial expertise but also to further expand its dedication towards biosimilar development and commercialization the leading approach and expertise of richter toward development and marketing of female fertility product worldwide will definitely get boost by finox existing portfolio the leading biopharmaceuticals are acquiring more firms like ge healthcare acquisitions of xcellerex inc amgen acquires onyx pharmaceuticals etc with aim to monopolize and mark their presence as leading player in health care industry  the newer player aurobindo acquired four biosimilars from tl biopharmaceutical aurobindo pharma ltd an indian generic pharmaceutical industry is expanding its diverse portfolio specifically the biosimilars manufacturing by acquiring four licensed biosimilars from a swiss firm tl biopharmaceutical ag in undisclosed amount aurobindo pharma will get development commercialization and marketing rights of these biosimilars three out of four acquired products are anticancer monoclonal antibodies and one of lead molecule bevacizumab from this transaction is expected to conduct a clinical trial this year aurobindo will acquire eight more biosimilars in future to strengthen its biosimilar portfolio the company has been building a biosimilar manufacturing facility in hyderabad the transaction is a strategic investment for future growth and will position aurobindo as a strong player in the rapidly evolving biosimilars landscape according to the company likewise eagle pharma acquires arsia therapeutics fresenius kabi acquisitions to merck kgaa and many more new players are making their entry to biosimilar portfolio by ma conclusion the primary goal of an ma is to strengthen and expand the functional and financial synergies of the merged entities while also enabling exploration of new portfolios or business sectors for the said entities further at times ma also results in market leadership by merger of entities of samesimilar industries in biosimilar industry we see a considerable increase in coming together of entities which has led to faster growth of the industry and increased demand of biosimilars biopharmaceutical firms often differ in functional financial customer related services and other aspects therefore the conventional ma gets modified at various levels and with mixed ratios based on the interest areas and objectives of participating entities for eg the icu medicals acquisition of hospira from pfizer is a mixed ma firms new to biosimilars such as aurobindo eagle pharma etc are showing interest towards building and acquiring biosimilar portfolio as a part of greater therapeutic coverage and to charter the global markets on the other hand the leading producers of biosimilars like sandoz teva pharmaceutical amgen mylan abbvie etc are stepping slowly toward monopolization of the market by ma with promising biosimilar entities the trend of increased mas in the biosimilar industry would lead to advanced research  development in the sector and will infuse competition amongst pharmaceutical firms which will hopefully result in efficacious and safer biosimilar innovations for diagnosis and treatment of diseases footnotes  httpeuropaeurapidpressreleaseipenhtm
