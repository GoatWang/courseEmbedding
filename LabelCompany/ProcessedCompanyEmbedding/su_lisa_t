in   percent of its business was in the traditional pc microprocessor and graphics chips now about  percent of revenues come from markets such as game consoles dense servers and embedded devices amd is still no  in pc processors to intel but su told us in an interview that amd won’t define itself in somebody else’s shadow here’s an edited transcript of our interview above amd ceo lisa suimage credit amd venturebeat what are your plans as ceo lisa su my focus has always been on running the business and making sure that we’re building the right products as ceo i’m looking at opportunities to streamline and improve our business operations vb amd has always had tough competition from intel how do you look at that given that you have a chance to start a new era here su my view of amd is that we have a tremendous set of technology assets people capability customer relationships we’re not going to define ourselves in somebody else’s shadow we have great technology assets that we can apply across a number of different markets in the pc business we obviously compete against intel but in other businesses as we go into embedded and semicustom it’s a different playing field vb what are some things that you could say to address anybody who might have a concern about a transition period ahead people may be worried that amd’s financial performance could take a hit during a transition su i’ve been with this company for almost three years i know it very well we’ve always said that this is a multistage transformation the first two steps were focused on resetting and restructuring the company as we go into this third phase it’s about technology and technology bets we’re in this for the long term — certainly i’m in this for the long term — to build out great products and create a great franchise for the company those are the key beats vb how do you feel about being the first woman to become ceo of amd and one of the few women holding that office in a big silicon valley company su i’m obviously honored and excited to accept that vision being ceo of amd is a tremendous opportunity to influence the industry and influence the future of computing i’m very excited and enthusiastic about all that’s in front of us vb diversity in silicon valley seems like it’s more on the radar in recent months doesn’t it su one of the key things is when you look at semiconductor companies it’s all about experience i’ve spent my entire career in semiconductors from an opportunity standpoint there’s a lot of opportunity to move this company forward vb you’re still a rare example in the industry hopefully that won’t be the case as much going forward su certainly there’s an opportunity to improve no doubt vb recommendations hackerrank washington not california has the
