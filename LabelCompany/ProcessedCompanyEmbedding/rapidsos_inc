wish there were more implementations of technology that actually did something useful instead of twitter on your microwave the only thing i dont like us that it doesnt notify you that your contacts will be notified during a test am couldnt sleep phone calls concerned about what is going on from sleeping family not cool other than that fantastic especially given my personal medical issues missing key features of the patronus app in which it replaces like on my way which would allow you to send your destination to friends and family and give them updates as well as an automated notification of

way up to the ceo position heres what ceos that champion design have to say by yazin akkawi yazin akkawi is the founder and principal of mstq an experience design consultancy in chicago above all akkawi is driven by an audacious vision to shape the future by empowering forwardthinking companies with design atyazin founder and principal mstqatyazin write a comment many new companies are proving that design is leading the way credit getty images for todays forwardthinking companies user experience ux design has become firmly ingrained as a vital componentso much so that design leadership has worked its way up to the ceo position a survey of  companies by the new enterprise associates found that  percent of startups have ceos or clevel executives weigh in on design decisions within those companies the design efforts have led to a measurable impact to business resultsleading to more sales higher customer retention and faster product cycles these days companies that are designcentric are led by ceos that prioritize ux they proactively cultivate design thinking and they know that behind every number is a person theyre constantly looking for ways to make the endtoend experience across every touchpoint offline and online better for their customers part of this trend is likely because weve seen so much success from companies founded by designers for example pinterest airbnb kickstarter tumblr twitter were all founded or cofounded by individuals who were formerly designers by trade some might even argue that steve jobs while never formerly referred to as a designer may have been one of the most accomplished designers of our generation to dive deeper into the matter i spoke with  successful designcentric ceos on why they believe ux and design matters heres what they had to say david mcintosh cofounder and ceo of tenor according to david mcintosh ux goes beyond the surface and served as the foundation for building tenors gif sharing platform which has over  million active users each month great user experience is the foundation of modern digital businesses some assume user experience is synonymous with visual design when in fact every part of the business from backend engineering to business development has to work in concert to deliver a great user experience at tenor the visual skeleton of our product is just the tip of the iceberg  our highestexpectation customers want to find the perfect gif that helps them express their exact emotion as fast as possible michael martin ceo of rapidsos named startup of the year by consumer technology association rapidsoss michael martin puts an emphasis on ux to make his users feel secure when we originally set out to solve the  mobile location challenge we developed an appbased solution that required users to abandon their natural behavior of simply dialing  in an emergency when it comes to someone calling for help we have to ensure that our designs arent confusing misleading or distracting we focus our efforts on creating interfaces that are conducive to quick actions and we give plenty of feedback and confirmations to the user whenever an action is taken our main goal with our designs is to build trust and an overall feeling of security brian barnes ceo of m finance with m finance poised to disrupt the wealth management industry brian barnes believes ux is the best way to earn customer trust the entire finance industry has made investing more complicated than it needs to be its an industry thats dominated by incumbents and regulations where ux comes in is distilling all of your investing information down to its simplest form providing only the information you need to make an investment decision user experience also helps win trust with users which is especially difficult to do in the finance industry where people are uncomfortable to begin with we cant make mistakes when were stewards of peoples money pat vihtelic ceo of home chef with pat vihtelic at the helm of home chef the mealkit service delivering more than  million meals per month ux helps bridge the gap between online and offline interactions with the company in the meal kit delivery space user experience matters online and offline our menu design  not just how they are displayed on the website but also the design and ease of execution of recipes themselves  is critical to customer satisfaction we think about customer experience at each point along the journey our advertising is straightforward our website is simple and intuitive and our recipes designed to be cooked by chefs of all levels critical design is important at each point on the journey final thoughts its no coincidence that ceos have adopted designer mindsets or designer mindsets have enabled some to rise to ceo for companies to succeed in todays and tomorrows economy design must be at the heart of everything these companies do at its core design is about people company decisions not just product or marketing decisions should be made on true customer insight when design thinking is embedded in company culture it enables companies to find success by focusing all of their efforts around customer
