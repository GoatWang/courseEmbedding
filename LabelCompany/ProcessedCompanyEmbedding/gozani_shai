exclusive medicine pain management rehab facebook twitter google linkedin yesterday we reported news of neurometrix a waltham ma company receiving fda clearance for its sensus transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator for diabetic pain management  we had a chance to speak with ceo and director of neurometrix shai gozani about the developments at the company and what are its goals for the future shiv gaglani medgadget can you describe the existing neurometrix products eg ncstat and sensus  your pipeline are there any new problems you are looking to tackle shai n gozani md phd thanks shiv let me first provide some background to the company and our products neurometrix was founded in  and has had fda approved products on the market since  until recently these products primarily consisted of medical devices used to perform nerve conduction tests at the point of care point of care nerve testing is a market that we created and one in which we had very good success until unfavorable changes in the reimbursement environment began to emerge around  after several years of working to address these market conditions we changed the neurometrix focus in mid from general purpose devices for nerve conduction tests ie the advance system to devices designed to specifically address diabetic peripheral neuropathy or dpn this made strategic sense because the opportunity in the narrowly defined area of dpn was very large and attractive we had extensive experience in this area and the market for our general purpose products was contracting nerve disease is the most common complication of diabetes and effects over  of people with diabetes it can lead to problems with balance resulting in falls and can lead to foot ulcers which can lead to amputation these complications can be very costly to manage and adversely affect the quality of life of patients the tools that are generally available to physicians to assess diabetesrelated nerve disease are not sophisticated rely on judgment for interpretation and do not provide quantitative information they are only effective in detecting late stage disease when the foot has lost its protective sensation in late  we launched our first diabetes product ncstat dpncheck which is a rapid accurate quantitative device for assessing diabetic neuropathy at the point of care  this hand held device is used to detect diabetic neuropathy at an early stage and to guide treatment since launch we have seen encouraging market reception in endocrinology and podiatry our launch market and increasingly in managed care and in retail health beyond ncstat dpncheck we have an active rd pipeline and are planning our next product launch for later this year the product is named sensus™ it is a pain management device designed to provide nonpharmacological relief to chronic pain in the lower legs and feet in fact about  of people with diabetes have pain sensus is an easy to use wearable device that provides ondemand pain relief at the push of a button it also tracks patient usage which is important to the physician’s assessment of effectiveness we recently received k clearance from the fda for sensus we hope to launch it in the fourth quarter of this year as you may be aware diabetic peripheral neuropathy is often accompanied by severe foot pain medgadget the “ million nerves tested” description on your site is great about how many clinicianspatients have benefited from your products over the past decade our products have been used to perform nerve conduction tests on nearly two million patients with over five million tests performed these have ranged from tests directed at low back pain carpal tunnel syndrome cubital tunnel diabetic peripheral neuropathy and other nerve disorders the technology is well established our long history and experience has positioned us well to address diagnostic and therapeutic challenges in dpn   medgadget what differentiated your products from those of competitors the most common tool used today in assessing diabetesrelated nerve disease is the monofilament a simple piece of plastic line which is pushed against the bottom of the foot in multiple locations to determine whether the patient has feeling the results are qualitative rather than quantitative the examination relies on technique and the test is only effective at determining latestage neuropathy after the foot has lost protective sensation at this point nerve deterioration has usually advanced to the point where defensive foot care is the only available option by contrast the neurometrix ncstat dpncheck provides immediate quantitative data that allows early identification on neuropathy in terms of pain management sensus offers an ondemand medical device alternative to pharmacological products it is nonaddictive dosing is easily regulated and it avoids side effects often associated with drugs further the device has the capability to track patient usage for review and evaluation by his physician   medgadget are you excited by any particular trends in healthcare and med tech we are encouraged by the trend in medicare away from fee for service and increasingly toward the funding of capitated managed care plans under these plans the risk of rising patient health care costs is shifted to the private sector in exchange for an annual premium payment these plans in turn place a high value on early identification of disease complications such as diabetic peripheral neuropathy which allows for early intervention to avoid the expensive treatment costs of foot ulcers and amputation in the future ncstat dpncheck is an attractive tool in this emerging healthcare model   medgadget what is your background in medical technology is neurometrix the first med tech company

md phd neurometrix december    entrepreneur spotlight neurometrix develops wearable medical technology and pointofcare tests for management of chronic pain nerve diseases and sleep disorders we spoke with president and ceo shai gozani md phd about neurometrix and the opportunities they see in the  market longevity network what does quell the company do shai gozani the company name is actually neurometrix and we are a commercial stage innovation driven healthcare company combining bioelectrical and digital medicine to address chronic health conditions including chronic pain sleep disorders and diabetes the company’s lead product is quell® an overthecounter wearable therapeutic device for chronic pain  the company also markets dpncheck® a rapid pointofcare test for diabetic neuropathy which is the most common longterm complication of type  diabetes ln can you tell us about your products and how they work  sg quell is a wearable device to treat chronic pain  it is lightweight and can be worn during the day while active and at night while sleeping  it has been cleared by the fda for treatment of chronic pain without a prescription  at its core it is a high powered neurostimulator that electrically activates the body’s ability to decrease pain perception through release of endogenous pain modulators called enkephalins   in a recent study  of quell users reported an improvement in their chronic pain and twothirds reported reduced use of pain medications  quell seeks to go beyond its direct analgesic benefits towards precision medicine  it does this by tracking biometric and health parameters such as sleep activity gait and pain to improve the user’s understanding of their chronic pain and its impact on their health and importantly the reciprocal influence of their behaviors such as how much they sleep on their chronic pain  the data is presented to the user in the quell smartphone app and is also aggregated in the quell health cloud  quell users can also start stop and adjust therapy discreetly via the quell app ln what opportunity did you want to address with the development of your wearable technology sg there are over m americans and b people worldwide with chronic pain  the us spends b annually on the direct and indirect costs of chronic pain yet more than half of pain sufferers report inadequate pain control  moreover many people in chronic pain have poor sleep low levels of activity anxiety depression and generally poor health  we set out to develop a wearable device that would both directly reduce pain through neurostimulation and also help our users manage their overall health using digital medicine technology such as sleep and activity monitoring with smartphone and cloud integration ln who are your primary users how do your products benefit the  population sg our primary users are people in chronic pain who are seeking to manage their chronic pain using fewer pain medications  our typical user is over the age of  has a college education and has an active lifestyle that they are trying to maintain  quell is ideal for the  population that is seeking to maintain a high quality of life with fewer medications  moreover the integrated health monitoring technology helps our users evaluate and optimize their sleep activity gait and other metrics ln how did you assemble your team sg carefully  we try to hire people who are passionate about our mission  our employees are truly excited by the opportunity to develop manufacture market and support leading medical technology that improves the lives of our customers   we have a flat organizational structure so we hire selfstarters who are not afraid to be put into key roles regardless of their prior experience ln how has quell the company differed from what you envisioned it would be if at all sg i never thought that one day our products would be available on amazon and on the shelves of leading retailers such as target and cvs  when we started we were entirely focused on the professional health care market developing and selling products to physicians and health care systems  we evolved into our present directtoconsumer products and effort partially out of necessity and partially out of seeing a great opportunity to directly educate and engage consumers with chronic pain ln what do you wish you had known before developing your products sg i wish we had a better understanding of the challenges of high volume low cost manufacturing  i have come to learn that manufacturing is really an extension of product development and design for manufacturability is not just a buzz word  i now believe that manufacturing expertise and input is essential at the earliest stages of product development to ensure that the eventual product can be manufactured so as to minimize cost while maximizing reliability and quality  this cannot be achieved by simply handing over a product design to a thirdparty manufacturing team no matter how good that team is  that internal or external manufacturing partner needs to be involved from the beginning ln what most excites you about the aging and or health technology market sg the aging or older adult market is exciting for multiple reasons  first it is a large and growing market  more importantly the individuals making up this market have every intention of remaining healthy and active with a high quality of life as long as possible  they are much more technology savvy then they are given credit and are looking for technology solutions to help them maintain the life and goals they aspire to achieve ln what is your best piece of advice for startups who want to include or target the  market sg you have to truly understand the lives of individuals in this age group  what chronic health conditions such as pain are they dealing with and how  what are their quality of life aspirations  how do they want to live  i find that most wearable technology is designed by and for young adults to optimize their fitness levels  these products are mostly vanity products  this is not to say that they are not important or useful but to truly touch the lives of older adults you have to understand both health and disease because they are intertwined  because of this i recommend that startups targeting the  market understand and accept the fact that their products may very well be regulated by the fda and similar agencies in other countries and they should develop the expertise to address these challenges early in their development because they impact the company culture and mission in fundamental ways ln do you have any other products in development sg at this time we are narrowly focused on continual improvement in the quell technology ln where do you see quell five years from now sg we are looking to continue improving quell making it more effective with expanded clinical indications and even more sophisticated ln what health or wellness technology do you hope exists by the time you retire sg i have no plans to retire  i actually don’t think in those terms and remain focused on building great solutions for people today – whether retired or not ln is there anything else you’d like to share sg i want to encourage the bright motivated entrepreneurs to apply themselves to the older adult market and chronic disease even though it may not seem like the most intuitive space for them  the bulk of our national health care spending is on this age group and the potential impact on lives and the economy is massive shai n gozani md phd founded neurometrix inc in  as a

thomas higgins thank you nova im joined on the call by dr shai gozani our president and chief executive officer and we appreciate your participation in this quarterly review for those of you who are new neurometrix operates in two markets wearable therapeutics and pointofcare diagnostics our proprietary platform technologies in both markets are based on expertise accumulated over two decades in precision neurostimulation to achieve a therapeutic or a diagnostic result our markets are large our primary product quell which is an overthecounter wearable device for the millions of people suffering from chronic pain has an addressable us market of about  million by our estimation ous would be at least that large dpncheck our test for diabetic nerve disease addresses a medical condition of about half of diabetics representing about  of the us population or about  million persons the financial focus of neurometrix is on topline revenue growth and on cash management as reflected in quarterly net cash usage q was a good quarter for the company topline revenue of  million was up  yearonyear and slightly higher sequentially from q quarterly net cash usage of  million was lower by  from  million in q of last year and was also down about  or nearly  sequentially the revenue increase and reduced cash usage were achieved while maintaining the pace of quell product development in rd and while increasing our brand investment in advertising both of which ultimately strengthened our competitive position and are essential to business capable growth over the longterm turning to our principal product lines we measure quell progress based on devices placed and invoiced value of shipments in q devices placed totaled  and invoiced shipments totaled  million both up  sequentially from q  this marked the eighth consecutive growth quarter for quell starting with its commercial launch in mid  quell gaap revenue was  million up  from the prior year and essentially flat with q of  it constituted about  of total company revenue electrode reorders totaled k sleeves approximately × k electrode sleeves we shipped in the year ago quarter the sequential quarter growth rate from q of this year was  deferred quell sales which were anticipated to convert to future gaap revenue were approximately  million and this was up from  million at the end of q of this year these amounts are net of estimated returns now dpncheck dpncheck contributed  in the quarter this was up  yearonyear and essentially flat with q of this year the product line constituted  of total revenue in the second quarter we saw continuation of strong q demand in our us medicare advantage business ous orders were light in the second quarter and these are historically lumpy and primarily from our distributors in asia and mexico we anticipate strengthening ous in the second half of this year which should compensate for any seasonal effects in medicare advantage overall dpncheck is on track for a strong full year growth our legacy products primarily advance diagnostics tests are managed for cash and are not actively marketed and these contributed the remaining  of revenue or about  of the total moving down to our gross margin it was  million a rate of just under  and this compared with  million gross margin or a rate of about  in q a year ago we recorded an increased weighting of quell sales in total revenue and within quell a shift in mix toward retail distributors and qvc retail and qvc sales carry lower average sales price and consequently lower margins operating expenses totaled  million down  from  million in the year ago quarter rd spending of  decreased by about  reflecting lower outside engineering costs sales and marketing spending of  million increased by about  and this encompassed higher tv advertising costs offset by savings from reduced sales headcount ga spending of  million was essentially flat our net loss for the quarter declined to  million versus  million in q of last year our net cash usage of  million continued the downward trend from a peak of  million in q of  we ended the quarter with  million in cash after quarter end we strengthened our balance sheet by signing a  million private placement and funded the first of two  million tranches so those are the financial highlights in summary strong yearonyear revenue growth in both product lines quell continues to maintain the upward trend in it skewed metrics and quarterly cash usage continue to trend down now dr gozani will comment on our business and strategy shai gozani thank you tom i will focus my comments on quell which is our primary growth driver we believe that quell is wellpositioned to address unmet needs in the  billion global market for devices and drugs to treat chronic pain in the us alone there are over  million people with chronic pain ill address the following five aspects of our quell effort first will be our advertising strategy the development of the retail channel third will be strategic partnerships fourth rd and five digital health first with respect to our advertising strategy we are still in the early stages of building national awareness for quell with verbal pain relief technology within the chronic pain community our current market penetration is only about  of estimated attainable market of  million us consumers we are working toward reaching a tipping point where viral marketing within the chronic pain community will generate an upward sales inflection and we are starting to see more and more peer to peer marketing however at this early stage of commercialization we still recognize that most sales will be generated by direct advertising as a result a substantial portion of our sales and marketing spend is devoted to building awareness primarily through tv and online advertising we continue to believe that the most effective way to reach our core audience is through tv advertising therefore since the second quarter of  we have been investing in tv promotions our most common approach is second spots on national cable news channels however we will also utilize other channels that match our customer demographics and characteristics and we expect to continue a similar level of tv promotion throughout the balance of this year we also recently developed an impactful new commercial which we will launch in the near term in addition to our own tv advertising efforts we continue to effectively partner with qvc their customers are interested in novel health products and we had strong sales on qvc during the second quarter digital marketing is also an important component of our advertising strategy and it represents about quarter of our advertising spend our digital marketing strategy consists primarily of paid search through google and online advertising including social media sites such as facebook and then in addition to tv and digital marketing weve also found that radio advertising is cost effective in building the retail channel we believe that the availability of quell in top retail outlets is important to the growth of the brand the association of quell with premium us retailers enhances its credibility and the convenience of instore access is important to many of our customers therefore we continue to invest in developing this channel were also recognizing and managing the challenges inherent in retail these include lower margins and deferred revenue recognition quell is available in about  retail stores among target cvs best buy bed bath  beyond and several others the breadth of retail outlets carrying quell confirms the quell value proposition extends beyond pharmacies et cetera nontraditional consumer health settings we believe this is consistent with a secular trend towards increased consumer control over healthcare decisions in purchasing with respect to strategic partnerships the us consumer health market is the largest in the world we intend to directly build quell into a premium high value consumer brand under neurometrixs ownership at the same time we also see opportunities for quell outside the us there are  billion people worldwide with chronic pain we now have regulatory clearance for marketing in canada the eu and australia we are most likely going to tap into ous opportunities through distribution and licensing partnerships and our strategy is still evolving here although we are engaged in several ongoing discussions these agreements take time and must be entered into carefully to yield both near term and long term value on the rd front the core strength in neurometrix is research and development and ability to rapidly innovate i believe we have the most advanced engineering team and technology in the wearable nerve stimulation sector our focus is to expand in our existing competitive advantages and establish a foundation for longterm growth we typically target major product launches for the consumer electronics show known as ces in january in fact we announced our secondgeneration quell device at the ces meeting this past january this device provides enhanced personalization automation battery life and health tracking this started shipping in the middle of the first quarter we are currently developing a novel third generation device that we expect to launch in early  we believe this device will both drive accelerated growth and substantially enhance the profitability of the quell business we are committed to conducting clinical studies that build the credibility of the quell technology and enhance our understanding of the mechanism of action and clinical efficacy we have two studies that have recently completed and have presented results are in the data analysis phase and two additional studies are still enrolling subjects we expect to see additional data readouts in the second half of this year we are also focused on building our ip position two new quell us utility patents were issues in the second quarter and we have many patent applications at various stages of review both in the us and internationally now quell and digital health an underappreciated aspect of the quell system is in addition to being a neurotherapeutic it is also a digital health solution for chronic pain chronic pain is a disease onto itself that goes beyond the direct experience of pain to impact all aspects of the sufferers life including their sleep quality activity levels and mental health and thus leads to poor overall health effectively managing chronic pain requires a broad view of the patients overall health quell is uniquely designed to provide this holistic approach to pain management through tracking of objective health metrics such as sleep and activity and subjective outcomes such as pain and mood the data and related health insights are presented to the user via the quell app and stored and synthesized in the quell health cloud we already have over  users that have created quell health cloud accounts we are just starting to tap into the tremendous potential of this rapidly growing database which may very well be the largest chronic pain database in the world we intend to use sophisticated analytical methods to better understand each users pain and health and thereby offer them personalized insights to optimize their use of quell and to decrease their pain and its impact on their life we expect to present new results in these analyses at medical conferences in the third and fourth quarters of this year we believe that these types of services will create longterm loyal customers that will form the foundation of for long and profitable consumer health brand and that constitutes our prepared comments we will be happy to take questions at this point questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions and our first question comes from the line of jared cohen of cohen and company jared your line is open jared cohen oh yean thank you just going to what you said about the different types of users because the thing im most interested in is the reorder rate of electrodes do you find that its the people who the most severe people of chronic pain or the ones who reorder the most are for the electrodes i guess thats my question shai gozani thank you for your question jared we – i don’t have a quantitative answer to give you there we’ve not done that specific form of analysis yet that being said it wouldn’t make sense but we have not specifically analyzed the quell health cloud from that perspective one of the reasons for that is we don’t have  we have a lot of information about the individual their use of the device but we don’t see electrode reorders through the quell health cloud and given that most people are now buying it the electrodes through amazon or retail or various channels we don’t necessarily have the ability to track reorders jared cohen okay because i was just trying to understand or see how you understand or what would stimulate more reorder use all right shai gozani yes well i think yeah i mean were at pretty consistently at a little bit under about one per quarter per active user and we want to grow that number somewhat we believe that one of the most important ways to achieve that is to increase the engagement particularly early with the user so we are working primarily on developing various features of the app and communicating via the app particularly on the on boarding experience in the first  or  days of use to really make sure that new users are effectively utilizing the device and maximizing its potential and then developing early and strong relationship with the customer so we have some significant initiatives on that front this quarter and we hope to start seeing some further acceleration in the growth of electrode reorders based on that jared cohen okay thank you very much shai gozani thank you operator our next question comes from the line of yi chen of hc wainwright yi chen hi thank you for taking my question looking at second quarter’s revenue and the sales and marketing expense as compared to your first quarter of this year the revenue is relatively flat while the sales and marketing expense is higher than the first quarter so is there something we should worry about regarding more dollars need to be spent on sales and marketing to boost the sales of quell i mean is the sales trend kind of slowing down shai gozani i wouldn’t say that you know the sales and marketing i don’t have the exact number in front of me the numbers are fairly comparable i think you know the customer acquisition cost can vary a little bit from quartertoquarter we will have pr effects which may lower it in one quarter and that may not kick in another quarter but we actually as you’ll see we actually sold shipped more devices this quarter and considerably more electrodes so the invoice value of sales was up  versus the first quarter especially from a shipment perspective sales were up the revenue recognition could be delayed based on the timing of those shipments so we actually saw growth in quarter two literally relative to q yi chen thank you sorry go ahead thomas higgins i was going to say that we did benefit in the first quarter from strong pr so that was nonpaid pr and it was primarily the i think it was the forward innovation foundation interview that shined it so that was the major benefit and it might have helped us lighten up a little bit on our advertising spending but not very much i don’t think the numbers were that different between q sales and marketing spending in q but… shai gozani well yi its a good question i guess just to sort of summarize there we really because there will be some lumpiness in that in the customer acquisition cost may vary from quartertoquarter based on nonpr and other effects but it was important to look at the number of units and the electrodes and that will ultimately drive the continued gaap revenue growth yi chen got it so for the third and fourth quarter shall we expect the sales and marketing expenses to remain relatively very stable compared to the second quarter shai gozani yes so i think in the third quarter and the fourth quarter we will see a little bit of growth not too much in the third quarter but several hundred thousand dollars worth of growth in q and there what were looking to is q is a strong we believe it will be a strong quarter anyway its holiday it’s end of year and we want to optimize what we are doing in the fourth quarter so i would say a little bit up in the third quarter and then may be up few hundred thousand in the fourth quarter current plan yi chen thank you shai gozani you are welcome operator operator instructions and im showing no further questions at this time i would like to turn the call back to dr gozani for closing remarks one moment sir we do have another participant in the queue our question comes from the line of alan singer ph your line is open unidentified analyst yes good morning and thank you for this very valuable call it seems to me like that there are opportunities here to take advantage of the opioid crisis to offer up a potentially very useful solution pain free i mean a drug free solution to a really challenging problem and there is a second community that i am very interested in hearing about your efforts and that would be the sleep medicine community because i happen to i have rls and i would use quell i wear it every night and it has been enormously beneficial to me so i am just wondering what efforts are being undertaken to reach out to the medical communities and rheumatology and sleep medicine to try to make inroads into those communities for purposes of allowing physicians who treat chronic pain patients and rls patients a low cost drug free alternative to the medicines that are proving to be challenging in both areas shai gozani thank you very much for the question and im delighted to hear that’s beneficial for your rls on the matter of the opioid crisis we are actively engaged with the pain medicine community and also from a public relations perspective to educate physicians educate patients educate government agencies about the opportunity to potentially reduce the dependence on opioids through technology like quell we have taken the position were not sort of anti or proopioids banning means we are arguing that there is a role for technology in managing chronic pain and potentially that could help reduce the dependence on opioids so we really view ourselves as advocates of the chronic pain community and for many of them some level of opioid use is still very very important so were just trying to be part of the solution our approach again is primarily by educating pain medicine physicians and by engaging through public relations and we have been pretty successful there we also have been focused on clinical studies specifically to look at that question we just  one of the studies that i referenced has finished enrollment and that’s a study at scripps translational science institute in san diego which is looking at specifically opioid reduction in cancer pain using quell so well have some  hopefully some quantitative data to talk about on the sleep side very interesting application we are engaged with the sleep medicine community we recently were presenting at sleep  which is the big annual sleep medicine conference happened to be in boston we have done some work specifically on rls and that’s a feature application for the product and many people with chronic pain actually have rls so there is a lot of overlap in any case so we have been engaging the sleep medicine community primarily through professional health conferences and through publications and we do see sleep as a  and primarily through rls and through the impact of chronic pain on sleep as an extension market for us operator thank you and sir im showing no further questions in the queue at this time id now like to turn the call back to dr gozani for closing remarks shai gozani thank you very much for joining us on the second quarter conference call we continue to be encouraged by the strong response to quell in the marketplace as well for dpncheck and we look forward to updating you through the balance of the year
