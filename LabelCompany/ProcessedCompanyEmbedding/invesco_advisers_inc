license agreement  dun  bradstreet inc  all rights reserved noaction letter invesco advisers inc april   home  previous page investment company act  section a invesco advisers inc april   response of the office of chief counsel division of investment management our ref no  invesco advisers inc your letter dated march   requests our assurance that we would not recommend enforcement action to the securities and exchange commission “commission” under section a of the investment company act of  “ act” against insurance company separate accounts “separate accounts” that offer and sell group annuity contracts “contracts” as part of a generic stable value investment option managed by invesco advisers inc “invesco advisers” if the sponsors of plans organized under section b of the internal revenue code of  “code” invest in such separate accounts facts you state the following invesco advisers is an investment adviser registered under the investment advisers act of  it provides discretionary advisory and asset management services to a variety of clients including sponsors of b plans in particular invesco advisers would manage the b plan assets of b plan participants that designate assets to a generic stable value investment option the “invesco option” the targeted market for the invesco option will be b plans sponsored primarily by large institutions such as universities and hospitals “b plans” the b plans will offer their participants “participants” multiple investment options including the invesco option under the invesco option invesco advisers will allocate the b plan assets it advises among certain investments such as contracts offered and sold by separate accounts the contracts will be privately offered in reliance on section a of the securities act of  or regulation d thereunder the contracts offer employees a bundled investment and insurance product invesco advisers will negotiate the features of each contract with each issuing insurance company including the terms of any insurance protection or wrapper assets deposited into a separate account generally are managed by an asset manager unaffiliated with invesco advisers the separate accounts essentially serve as building blocks to help achieve the invesco option’s investment objective and a participant generally would not know that she is investing in any particular separate account other investments of the invesco option will likely include a money market fund that is an investment company registered under the  act a b plan is a taxdeferred retirement plan for employees of public schools employees of certain taxexempt organizations and certain ministers many b plans and their sponsors are not subject to the employee retirement securities act of  “erisa” including the erisa fiduciary standard in addition the vast majority of b plans are not funded through trusts with trustees that either make investment decisions on behalf of the trust or select a menu of investment options for participants instead the employer that sponsors the b plan or a committee appointed by the sponsoring employer serves as the b plan’s fiduciary and designs the b plan’s investment menu eg a menu that could include the invesco option participants direct the investment of their b plan balances in one or more of such investment options and if the invesco option was selected the b plan sponsor would invest the proceeds in one or more separate accounts you represent that each b plan sponsor will be subject to the prudent man fiduciary standard of erisa as defined below when selecting investment options and managers available under a b plan through which assets would be invested in a separate account including the invesco option and its manager invesco advisers in particular the prudent man fiduciary standard requires a fiduciary to discharge its duties with respect to a plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries and “with the care skill prudence and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims” “prudent man fiduciary standard” accordingly either the b plans will indicate that their sponsors are subject to the prudent man fiduciary standard or the b plan sponsors will contractually agree to be subject to the prudent man fiduciary standard to the extent that invesco advisers manages b plan assets that are subject to erisa you represent that it will comply with the provisions of erisa and the rules and interpretations thereunder you also represent that a participant’s investment discretion will be limited to allocating his or her account among the investment options available in the b plan including the ability to choose the invesco option no representation will be made to participants that any specific portion of their contributions to or account balances in the b plan or any specific portion of the invesco option will be invested in any particular separate account the participants would generally not know that they are investing in a separate account if the b plan delivers any information to its participants that mentions an investment in a particular separate account it will be accompanied by a disclaimer to the effect that no assurances can be given that the invesco option will continue to invest its assets or the same portion of its assets in the separate account you state that invesco advisers would like to offer the invesco option to b plan sponsors which would require the b plan sponsors to purchase the contracts on behalf of the participants that are invested in the separate account invesco advisers are concerned however that participants will not be able to invest in the separate account because they generally will not be “qualified purchasers” under section a of the  act you ask us to conclude analogous to our position in heb investment and retirement plan “heb” discussed below that a fund relying on the exclusion from the definition of investment company in section c of the  act ie a separate account in which the invesco option invests may treat the b plan and is not required to treat each participant as a qualified purchaser for section c purposes if the b plan sponsor is subject to the prudent man fiduciary standard of erisa when selecting investment options and managers available under a b plan through which assets would be invested in a separate account such as the invesco option analysis section a of the  act prohibits an investment company organized or otherwise created under the laws of the united states or of a state and having a board of directors from among other things offering or selling any security or engaging in certain other activities by use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce unless the company is registered under the  act section c of the  act excludes from the definition of investment company any issuer whose outstanding securities are owned exclusively by persons who at the time of acquisition of the securities are qualified purchasers and which is not making and does not propose to make a public offering of its securities section aaiv of the  act defines “qualified purchaser” to include “any person acting for its own account or the accounts of other qualified purchasers who in the aggregate owns and invests on a discretionary basis not less than  in investments” you represent that any b plan investing in the separate accounts will meet the definition of “qualified purchaser” as defined in section aiv because the b plan will own and invest on a discretionary basis not less than  million in investments and will be acting for its own account you state that most of the participants will not meet the “qualified purchaser” definition you argue that the proposed arrangement is structured and operated in a manner substantially similar to heb in that letter we provided noaction assurances under section a of the  act to c funds if a k plan subject to erisa invested in c funds in particular the k plan participants were not qualified purchasers but the k plan’s trustees were subject to the fiduciary provisions of erisa these noaction assurances to heb were provided under conditions designed to ensure that  plan participants are not permitted to decide whether or how much to invest in particular investment alternatives and  the decision to invest in a c fund is made by the plan trustee or other plan fiduciary that makes investment decisions for the plan you contend that your proposed arrangement is consistent with our prior noaction assurances in particular each participant’s investment discretion will be limited to allocating his or her account among a number of investment options including the invesco option in addition the decision to invest the assets of the invesco option in a separate account relying on section c’s exclusion from the definition of investment company is the sole responsibility of the b plan sponsor without direction from or consultation with any participant other than the b plan sponsors acting in their capacity as b plan sponsors you acknowledge that many b plans are not subject to erisa and thus the b plan sponsors are not required to be fiduciaries by operation of erisa you represent that either each such b plan sponsor will indicate that it is subject to the prudent man fiduciary standard or the b plan sponsor will contractually agree to be subject to the prudent man fiduciary standard you believe that these representations together with certain others are consistent with congress’s recognition that financially sophisticated investors are in a position to appreciate the risks associated with certain investment pools and do not need the protections of the  act consistent with our noaction assurancesposition in heb and our previous positions we believe that a participantdirected plan including a b plan that offers its participants generic investment options that in turn may invest a portion of their assets in a c fund such as a separate account could be treated as a qualified purchaser in certain circumstances in particular the b plan sponsor that is subject to the prudent man fiduciary standard makes the decision to include the invesco option which in turn invests a portion of its assets in a separate account as an investment option under the b plan this approach consistent with the commission’s approach in the context of a defined benefit plan ensures that the person or persons making the investment decision would be in a position to appreciate the risks of investing in the separate account we believe it is appropriate to apply a similar approach here accordingly based on the facts and representations set forth in your letter we would not recommend enforcement action to the commission under section a of the  act against the separate accounts that offer and sell contracts as part of the invesco option if the b plan sponsors invest in such separate accounts in particular we rely upon the following representations the b plan will own and invest on a discretionary basis not less than  million in investments and was not formed for the specific purpose of acquiring the securities offered by any separate account relying on section c’s exclusion from the definition of investment company  the b plan sponsors will be subject to the prudent man fiduciary standard either contractually or pursuant to the provisions of the b plan with respect to a all of the b plan assets invested in the separate accounts including the invesco option which in turn invests a portion of its assets in a separate account and b selecting a manager such as invesco advisers that manages an option through which assets would be invested in a separate account each without direction from or consultation with any participant other than the b plan sponsors acting in their capacity as b plan sponsors  the invesco option will not be used to facilitate the individual investment decisions of participants into any separate account  a participant’s investment discretion will be limited to allocating his or her account among a number of investment options including the invesco option which has an identified generic investment objective  the invesco option may invest in the securities of multiple separate accounts provided that immediately following the purchase by the invesco option of a separate account’s securities no more than  of the invesco option’s assets will consist of securities of any one particular separate account and  no representation will be made to participants that any specific portion of their contributions to or account balances under the b plan or any specific portion of the relevant invesco option will be invested in a particular separate account if the b plan delivers any information to participants that mentions an investment in a particular separate account it will be accompanied by a disclaimer to the effect that no assurances can be given that the invesco option will continue to invest its assets or the same portion of its assets in the separate account because our position is based on all of the facts and representations made in your letter you should note that any different facts or circumstances might require a different conclusion holly hunterceci senior counsel  before allocating b plan assets to a separate account invesco advisers will consult with the b plan sponsor and recommend separate accounts in which the invesco option would invest ultimately the decision to invest the assets of the invesco option in a separate account is the sole responsibility of the b plan sponsor without direction from or consultation with any participant other than the b plan sponsor acting in its capacity as a b plan sponsor  you state that the purchase of mutual fund shares will require the creation of a custodial arrangement pursuant to section b of the code  see generally section ba of the code field assistance bulletin no  issued by the department of labor’s employee benefits security administration july   “ bulletin” under a b plan employers may purchase for their eligible employees annuity contracts or establish custodial accounts invested only in mutual funds for the purpose of providing retirement income see sections ba and b of the code  bulletin indicating that “although not subject to the qualification requirements of section  of the code some of the requirements that apply to qualified plans also apply with modifications to b plans”  the erisa fiduciary standard generally requires that a fiduciary discharge his or her duties with respect to a plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries and  for the exclusive purpose of “providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries” and “defraying reasonable expenses of administering the plan”  “with the care skill prudence and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims”  “by diversifying the investment of the plan so as to minimize the risk of large losses unless under the circumstances it is clearly prudent not to do so” and  “in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan …” see section a of erisa  section ab of erisa  the selection of investment options by these b plan sponsors also may be subject to state law fiduciary standards in addition invesco advisers serves in a fiduciary capacity with respect to the b plan assets that it allocates to the various contracts pursuant to its advisory agreement with the applicable b plan sponsor  see heb investment and retirement plan he butt grocery company sec staff

investment pools and do not need the protection of the  act s rep no  th cong d sess   “generally these investors can evaluate on their own behalf matters such as the level of a fund’s management fees governance provisions transactions with affiliates investment risk leverage and redemption rights”  section aa of the  act also generally defines “qualified purchaser” to include  any natural person
