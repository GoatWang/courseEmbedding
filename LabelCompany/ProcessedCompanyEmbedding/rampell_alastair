state university believefly ash silica fume and slag are all industrial waste products that have been used previously in some types of construction said paul tikalsky associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at penn state who led the bridge study these additives reduce the permeability of concrete and deter salts from entering said tikalsky the additives also increase electrical resistancethe engineers have developed several mixtures they believe will extend the life of a bridge by three times without appreciably increasing construction costs but the only way to truly test the idea is to build some bridges and wait to see what happensover the next two years  bridges on interstate  between bald eagle and port matilda pa will be constructed using mixtures designed and

facilitator  of the transactional offer platform  the transaction offer offeror  and the primary vendor  in advance of a transaction offer  being presented however the agreement may include variable pricing wherein the amount paid may be determined at the time the transaction offer  is accepted such as during the user  checkout process this may allow a primary vendor  to differentiate pricing based on attributes of the user  such as geography consumers in low gdp per capita countries pay less for the productservice than consumers in high gpd per capital countries or user  credit worthiness consumers with greater propensity to select higherend offers will result in higher payments to the primary vendor  than consumers who select lowerend offers the primary vendor  may elect to adjust the amount to be paid by the transactional offer platform  based on an aspect of the user the price paid may be based on an algorithm that may facilitate scalability of the platform the algorithm may accept inputs related to the primary offer  the primary vendor  and the like these inputs may introduce ambiguity such as default versus custom payments and marginbased versus fixeddollar payments that may be resolved by logic associated with the algorithm aspects of offers and vendors may be classified to facilitate determining logic for resolving such ambiguity and for determining payment amounts offers may be classified as marginbased payments that may automatically base the margin on economies associated with the transaction offer  the transaction offer consolidator  and the likein certain optional embodiments offers may be associated with marginbased payments that include customization on an offerspecific basis or fixeddollar payments which may also include customization on an offerspecific basis vendor payment aspects that may impact the logic may be classified as a base case wherein no additional vendor criteria are required to determine the payment other vendor classifications include nonstandard aligned classifications wherein a primary vendor  may define custom payment criteria while remaining aligned with a transaction offer  related payment paradigm custom margins wherein a primary vendor  defines a fully custom margin scheme that may be independent of transaction offer  or transaction offer offeror  related economies and flat payout fixed pricing wherein a primary vendor  requires a fixed payment per transaction to facilitate avoiding impact on payments caused by other variables these classifications are only exemplary and are not meant to be limiting the algorithms logic classifications and other aspects of primary vendor  payments should be considered extensible so that additional classifications may be introduced and supported resolution of the ambiguities herein described may be based at least in part on a rules table that may include offer parameters vendor parameters and the like additionally the platform  may support fully customized payments that may be applied such customized payments may be configured to override or work in cooperation with the algorithms associated with paymentschanges to primary vendor  payment rules may be incorporated into the rules tables algorithms customized payments and the like the following exemplifies one of many possible payment configurationspayment tableoffer

co fixedpayment  in the previous table payment ambiguity is resolved by entries in the table such as when offer type  custom margin overrides vendor big co custom margin resulting in big co receiving  for offer  but only  for offer to facilitate an administrator of the platform  or a vendor accessing the platform  managing the payment algorithms logic rules and the like one or more of the following screens may be included in one or more interfaces of the platform  payouts for all offers associated with a specific vendor payouts for all vendors associated with a specific offer configuration of vendor rules and parameters configuration of offer rules and parameters override screen triggered by a change to an offer eg a change to the offer classification override screen triggered by a change to a vendor eg a new vendor classification offer record screen to create linkage with one or more of these screens and vendor record screen to create linkage with one or more of these screensthe payment module  may record indications of events associated with transaction offers  such as notifications that various activities have taken place respect to offers such as viewing the transaction offers  acceptance of transaction offers  or redemption of transaction offers such that upon occurrence of relevant events or activities each primary vendor  may receive the credit  herein disclosed the vendor payment facility may perform a financial payment transaction to a primary vendor  account such as and without limitation a bank account for an amount associated with any and all accumulated offer notifications this financial payment transaction may occur upon offer notifications from time to time periodically and so forththe debit  from the transaction offer offeror  may include a fixed portion related to the transaction offer  or related to the primary offer  with which the transaction offer  is associated the fixed portion may be set by the transaction offer offeror  or the facilitator  the debit  may include a variable amount such as an amount based on the number of new users  who accept a transaction offer  with the transaction offer offeror  the variable amount may be based on a quality of the user  accepting the transaction offer  the quality of the user  may include a user characteristic such as a user demographic commission based transaction offers  may require an adjustable debit  wherein the amount debited from the transaction offer offeror  is calculated at the time the transaction offer  is presented or accepted a credit  resulting from a commission based transaction offer  may also be variably based at least in part on the commission of the transaction offer  the payment module  may perform the calculations and issue the debit  and credit  accordinglythe user  may be notified of the transaction offer  in a variety of ways the way of notifying the user  may influence the likelihood of the user  completing the offer  therefore it may be beneficial to include a plurality of ways of notifying the user  of the offer  however it may not be beneficial in that the user  may disregard all subsequent offers after declining the first offer a user  may be notified of the transaction offer  on the primary vendor  payment webpage this notification may be in lieu of or independent of a primary offer  the transaction offer platform  may enable users  to select a transaction offer  p in addition to other forms of paymentthe facilitator  may facilitate the display of transaction offers  in a multitude of ways herein called touchpoints in order to facilitate a transaction between the user  primary vendor  and advertiser  these touchpoints define the context in which the facilitator  may display or otherwise present the transaction offers  to the user  and by which the user  is encouraged to accept a transaction offer a webpage of a primary vendor  website may include a transactional offer button or other selectable element that may be placed on the page with equal lesser or greater prominence than a buy button in an example of greater prominence the transactional offer selection button may include animated graphics to attract a users  attention lesser prominence may include placing the transactional offer selection button at the bottom of the web page along side contact or other selections that are not payment related equal prominence may include placing the buy button and the transactional offer button side by side with similar visual impact the transactional offer selection may be presented in a wide range of combinations of position and visual prominence that include the above examples and many others the prominence of the transactional offer selection may be specified in a contractual agreement between a facilitator  of the transactional offer platform  and a primary vendor  the prominence may be selected to meet a certain marketing objective the prominence may alternatively be based on an aspect of the user  such as a user preference so that the transactional offer selection element is more appealing to the user  independent of prominence selection of the transactional offer element may result in a transaction offer  being presented to the user  as a transactional offer optionthe navigation alternatives herein described may be performed by aspects of the web page being viewed such as html code or by other software executing on the user  computing facility in association with the web browser such as a plugin applet browser menu or the like although a web browser is described for viewing web pages of a primary vendor  web site other web page access and display software programs devices hardware and services may also be used to display and navigate the web pagesa user  may be notified of offers by configuring an rss reader to deliver information related to primary offers  or primary vendors  being associated with transaction offers  or transaction offer offerors  in this way the user  may create a wish list of offer combinations and may be notified of published electronic information related to the combinations the wish list may be created through a webpage of the transactional offer platform  or through rss reader softwaretransaction offer transaction offers  may be associated with the primary offer  the primary vendor  or the user  a primary offer  or transaction offer  may be provided to a user  based on user  attributes such as demographics geoprofile of comparable consumers and the like based on information the user  provides to the facilitator  or the transaction offer offeror  while completing a transaction offer  the offer may be selected from an inventory of offers or dynamically generated the offer may be based on a relevance to one or more user  demographics such as age income address sex profession marital status and the like the offer may be selected to maximize the overall profit of the transaction based on a conversion rate a payout amount and total volume of completed transaction offers  from all vendors associated with the transaction offer platform  and the likea transaction offer offeror  may be an advertiser product supplier service provider market research firm nonprofit agency educational institution or any other entity that may benefit from a user  engaging with the transaction offer offeror  by completing a transaction offer  since in certain optional embodiments the transaction offer offeror  may only pay the facilitator  for a completed transaction offer  the transaction offer offeror  can in such cases have some improved confidence that the information provided by the user  is accurate since the same information may be used to provide the primary offer  the transaction offer offeror  may also seek primary vendors  with which they may establish cross promotional arrangements they may also seek primary vendors  with products that align with their own product objectives such that a user  of the primary vendor  product may have a greater likelihood of having an interest in the transaction offer the facilitator  may solicit or receive from the users  of primary offers  recommendations or suggestions for items or services of interest to the users  such recommendations and suggestions may also be provided to the facilitator  by the primary vendor  on behalf of the users  additionally or alternatively the primary vendor  may provide to the facilitator  demographic andor preference data in embodiments this data may be utilized by the facilitator  in targeting transaction offers  to users  so as to increase conversion rates for the primary vendor  the facilitator  may solicit primary vendors  andor transaction offer transaction offer offerors  for such items or services the facilitator  may coordinate the association of a primary offer  with a transaction offer  based on the suggestions or recommendations the facilitator  may seek new primary vendors  andor transaction offer offerors  to provide items or services based on the suggestions or recommendationsa transactional offer platform  may include an offer optimization facility  which may select andor create an optimized offer  optimization of a transaction offer  may be based at least in part on one or more aspects of the transaction offer  a transaction offer offeror  a primary offer  a user  and timing associated with the transaction offer  a transaction offer  that is not accepted by a user  may not provide significant value to the transaction offer offeror  primary vendor  user  or facilitator  therefore transaction offers  may be optimized so they are relevant to the user  thereby increasing the likelihood of user  acceptance offer optimization may be based on an aspect of the transaction offer  the transaction offer  may include aspects such as approval terms transaction offer  redemption value to the user  time to redeem a transaction offer  age restrictions to accept the transaction offer  residency requirements and the like one or more of these aspects may be combined so that a transaction offer  may be optimized on a combination such as age restrictions and transaction offer  redemption value to the user  in an example a transaction offer  may be optimized based on approval terms the approval terms of transaction offers  may be evaluated to determine which transaction offer  may provide the best approval terms one transaction offer  may require approval based on an online credit scoring method that returns an approval decision to the user  in seconds another transaction offer  may require approval by an underwriting department that requires  days for an approval decision in this example the transaction offer  that returns an approval decision in seconds may be considered to be optimal as compared with the other transaction offer  because a user  is more likely to accept an offer with immediate feedback as compared with an offer that requires considerable time for approval offer optimization may also include combining one or more of these aspects with one or more aspects of the user  facilitator  primary vendor  primary offer  and transaction offer  timing certain combinations are exemplified elsewhere hereinin another example offer optimization may also be based on an aspect of the popularity of a transaction offer  popularity optimization may be beneficial in that a more popular transaction offer  is likely to be frequently accepted thereby providing valueoptimization may be based on one or more aspects of a transaction offer offeror  the aspects of a transaction offer offeror  for optimization may include cross marketing arrangements time for the transaction offer offeror  to pay the facilitator  amount the transaction offer offeror  pays the facilitator  for a transaction offer  acceptance the number of potential transaction offers  from the transaction offer offeror  a trafficpayout plan and the likeoffer optimization based on aspects of the transaction offer  may be related to offer optimization based on the transaction offer offeror  as an example a transaction offer offeror  may provide a plurality of transaction offers  this plurality of transaction offers  may be combinable so that payout tier traffic volume may be reached using a combination of transaction offer  acceptances a transaction offer offeror  that permits combining transaction offers  to reach a payout tier increased payout may be optimized above a transaction offer offeror  that does not permit combining transaction offers  in this example the transaction offers  of the transaction offer offeror  that can be combined may be presented before other transaction offers an offer may be optimized based on an aspect of a primary offer  aspects of a primary offer  may include the class of primary offer  the list or normal price the discounted price of the primary offer  and the likean offer may be optimized based on one or more aspects of a primary vendor  aspects of a primary vendor  may include business affiliations between a primary vendor  and a transaction offer offeror  transaction offer  preferences or restrictions the number of primary offers  available to the transactional offer platform  from the vendor a volume discount threshold and the likewhen primary offer  aspects and primary vendor  aspects are combined for optimization transaction offers  may be selected that have a high relevance to a user  of a primary offer  and may more readily be acceptedan offer may be optimized based on one or more aspects of a user  aspects of a user  for optimization may include demographics prior transaction offer  acceptance history geographic region browser type internet connection speed receipt history prior transaction history and the likean offer may be optimized based on one or more aspects of timing aspects of timing for optimization may include time until expiration of a transaction offer  duration of a transaction offer  a difference between the time to deliver the primary offer  and time to approve the transaction offer  and the like optimization of transaction offers  based on timing may include selecting a transaction offer  that expires sooner than one that expires later since the later expiring transaction offer  may be presented after the sooner expiring transaction offer  expiresan offer may be optimized to maximize revenue eg vendor revenue platform revenue to target users  based on user  demographics user  behavior user  interaction with the platform  and the like offer optimization may be unique for each transaction offer offeror  transaction offer  transaction offer consolidator  and other transaction offer related aspects such as offer terms offer timing and the like offer optimization may be dynamic so that it takes into account transaction offer offerors  who may be approaching a pricing threshold associated with transaction offer payouts to the platform  offers may also be optimized to generate the highest quality leads for transaction offer offerors the offer optimization facility  may include access to one or more databases containing transaction offers  preferences user  transaction history demographics and the like the results of an optimization may be stored in one or more of the databases delivered to the offer selection and display facility  or bothoffer optimization may include one or more algorithms to facilitate optimizing offers optimization algorithms may include heuristic optimization algorithms markov decision processes ranking techniques steepest descent methods conjugate gradient methods and the like in an example nongenderneutral offers based on the gender of the user may be selected through a markov decision process offers relating to womens clothing may be optimized to be presented to female users while offers relating to mens clothing may be optimized to be presented to male usersoptimization may be performed locally for each vendor it may also be performed across a plurality of vendors associated with the payment platform  so that the benefits of optimization may accrue to all parties associated with the platform an aspect of the transactional offer platform  may include an offer selection and display facility  the offer selection and display facility  may match an offer or offers to a user  match an offer or offers to a primary offer  match an offer to an optimization result and the like the offer selection and display facility  may also present offers the offers may be presented based on location based on an aspect of the offer based on a user  preference based on a primary vendor  preference based on an optimization result based on a transaction offer offeror  preference and the likethe offer selection and display facility  may select a plurality of offers to be presented to a user  based on the geographic location of the user  for example and without limitation a user  located in the united states may be presented with a selection of offers that can be transacted in the united states while a user  located in canada may be presented with a selection of offers that can be transacted in canadathe offer selection and display facility  may facilitate a users  viewing of any and all combinations of offers available through the transactional offer platform  when facilitating such viewing the offer selection and display facility  may mark any and all offers that might not be valid for the user  this mark may involve italicizing text graying out text or graphics using an alternate visual representation to provide the offer and so onin another example the optimization facility may place optimized offers  into a results list or group of optimized offers  the selection facility may first access this results list or group when selecting one or more offers to present to a user  the selection facility may apply selection criteria as herein described to the optimized results list or group of offers the selection facility may present none some or all of the offers in the optimization results list with none or some other offersthe selection facility may arrange the offers for presentation to the user  so that optimized offers  are presented first or more prominently than nonoptimized offers  in certain preferred embodiments optimized offers  are presented in a list of offers rather than onebyonethe selection facility may facilitate presenting the offers in an order or prominence that is relevant to the user  in an example a user  may instruct the selection facility through a user  interface to arrange the offers so that the offers with the greatest relevance to the user  are presented first or more prominently to the extent that a user  may be unknown to the transactional offer platform  when offers are presented the user  may enter relevant information that may be used in the selection of offers for example the user  may be presented a list of interest areas from which they could select one or more the selection facility may use this information to identify and present to the user  offers that are relevant to the users  interestsalternatively the user  may select to register with the transactional offer platform  so that each time the user  accesses the platform  the preferences interests and other information related to the user  can be applied to offer selection by the offer selection and display facility the selection facility may include an interface to the optimization facility the payment module  and other modules and facilities of the transactional offer platform  as necessary the selection facility may also include an interface to one or more databases containing offers preferences user  transaction history demographics  and the likein certain preferred embodiments the offer selection and display facility  may further include web pages for presenting aspects of the offer and or the transactional offer platform  the web pages may include user  interaction screens related to viewing evaluating selecting and responding to a transactional offer  the offer selection and display facility  may allow a facilitator  to associate new transaction offers  with one or more primary vendors  so that a user  selecting to alternatively pay for the primary offer  may select the associated new transaction offer  the association may be based at least in part on pricing of the offer geography and primary vendor  preferencesthe offer selection and display facility  may also provide transaction offer  tracking so that a user  will not see and cannot accept two related transaction offers  in an example a user  may accept a transaction offer  from blockbuster from primary vendor a although the blockbuster transaction offer  is available from primary vendor b the user  may not be presented the blockbuster transaction offer  through primary vendor b in this way the user  may not be presented offers that the user  cannot accept and the transaction offer offeror  does not have to deny the users  acceptance of the transaction offer  this may also maintain the image and integrity of the transactional offer platform the transaction offer offerors  may provide variable payment for acceptance of a transaction offer  based on the quality of the user  engagement an aspect of quality may be geography which may be represented by regional pricing offer selection as may be performed through offer selection and display facility  may include regional pricing offer selection may be based at least in part on an aspect of the transaction offer offeror  payment terms as they relate to geography aspects of transaction offer offeror  payment terms that may affect payments to the platform  may include the user location such as the user country county district postal code neighborhood town city street and the like offer selection with regional pricing may facilitate an administrator of the platform  to quickly and clearly select one or more offers that meet the applicable pricing and geographic constraintsoffer selection and display facility  may include logic for selecting an offer based on location to support regional pricing the logic may iterate through each user location associated with each potentially related offer and identify offers that target the user  location eg country and have an expected payout pricing greater than the minimum acceptable price agreed to by the primary vendor  for the primary offer  the logic may consider user location offer availability in the user  location pricing of offer in the user  location primary offer  price and other factors associated with offer selection and display facility  as described elsewhere herein the logic may determine that an offer may not suitably meet selection criteria in an example the minimum acceptable price that primary vendor  has agreed to accept with respect to a primary offer  that is presented to a user  in the usa may be  in this case any offer yielding less than this amount to the primary vendor  will not be displayed to the user the platform  may include an offers database  the offers database  may contain advertisements that may be offered to the user  the offers database  may be updated at regular interval with new offers provided by the advertisers for presentation to the user  the new offers may be presented to the user  in addition the offers database  may include the procedures eg programs built within the database using sql procedures for selection of advertisements from the database an advertisement may be selected based on a predeterminedidentified criteria for example the repository  may be queried for a transactional advertisement based on an anticipated advertiser payout the user  may promise to complete a transaction of  in this case the platform  may query the offers database  for advertisement offers that are below  of the anticipated payout ie less than  in the above example in may be noted that the anticipated payout may be calculated in a number of ways such as total expected payout over a unit time immediate payout or a promise to complete the transaction after receipt of product and the like for example the user  may promise to pay the outstanding amount after the product is received in this scenario the anticipated payout may be calculated using a predefined rulein embodiments the current transaction with the primary merchant may provide the user  with a transaction offer that includes an incentive for completing the current transaction with the primary merchant the transaction offer may be based on price type of product terms of payment location and type of credit card master card or visa customer loyalty customer preferences customer affiliation and the like of the first transaction for example the purchaser may enter into a transaction with the primary merchant and subsequently may be presented with the transaction offer since the user  has a long transaction history of purchasing products from another merchant z the user  may be presented with a transaction offer belonging to merchant zin embodiments the completion of the current transaction may allow access to users history maintained in the users demographic  as described herein and elsewhere the user demographics  may include age profession transaction history location address office address and the like in addition to the anticipated payout the user  may be presented with a transactional offer that may completely or partially dependent on the users demographics  in addition to the anticipated payout the user may be presented with the transactional offer based on the completion of the last transaction for example the user  may be located in ottawa in canada and may have made a transaction of  with the platform  the platform  may spout a transaction advertisement to the user  for a discount of  on purchase of pizza from the local pizza outlet in this example the transactional offer may be based both on the users demographics location of purchase as well as the transactional payoutin embodiments the transactional offer presented to the user  as result of the last transaction may be based on the terms of the payment accepted by the user  as described above the transaction offer may be presented to the user after the completion of the last transaction the user  may select one of the following options  advance  advance and  at delivery of the product  on delivery of the product or any other mutually agreed criteria between the user  and the merchantin addition the transactional offer presented to the user  may at least be based on mutually accepted terms of payment in embodiments the platform  may query offers database  and select relevant offers to be presented to the user  for example a  advance payment may reward user  with a free holiday tour to an amusement park such an offer will be presented to the user  based on the total transaction value of the last committed transaction in another embodiment the platform  may maintain the purchase history of the user  incentive for a volume of purchases and transactions done previously may be provided to the user  and the best offer available in the received bid may be selected for display overruling other rules in order to reward the user an advertiser may offer to payout an amount for one or more of presenting a transaction offer to a user and the user accepting a presented transaction offer the payout amount may be anticipated based on a variety of factors that may include aspects of the transaction such as an amount of a current transaction in which the transaction offer is being presented an anticipated payout amount may be derived using any of the payout calculation or other methods and systems described herein and elsewhere an anticipated payout amount may be an actual payout amount that is promised by or debited from a transaction offer offeror such as in association with placement of a transaction offer or in association with an acceptance of a placed transaction offerpayout amounts andor amounts debited from transaction offer offerors advertisers and the like may be used for a variety of purposes including for example selecting an offer and other uses as described herein and elsewhere in addition to these many uses an anticipated payout amount may be used to customize a transaction offer to be presented to a user who is engaged in an electronic purchase transaction customizing a transaction offer may be facilitated by an anticipated payout in that a variable value of the transaction offer may be determined based on the anticipated payout an anticipated payout may affect other aspects of a transaction offer including without limitation offer redemption value offer duration offer terms offer flexibility offer placement offer presentation features and the like customizing an offer based at least in part on an anticipated payout may impact offer redemption value in that offer redemption value may be determined as a percentage of the anticipated payout an anticipated payout for placement andor acceptance of a transaction offer may be determined based on factors described herein such as lifetime value of the user geographic location of the user and the like based on the determined anticipated payout a transaction offer may be presented that reflects a redemption value that is some fraction or multiple of the anticipated payout amountin an example a user located in a geographic location associated with very affluent consumers may be engaged with a primary vendor and may have committed to an electronic transaction with the vendor the platform may determine candidate transaction offers to present to the affluent user based on a variety of factors eg primary vendor guidelines or requirements the platform may calculate an anticipated payout which may include a range of payout values from one or more advertisers transaction offer offerors the anticipated payout for one of the candidate offers that has a default redemption value of  may be  for transaction offer user acceptance but only  for transaction offer placement without acceptance the platform may determine a likelihood of the user accepting the transaction offer to be  if the redemption value of the transaction offer is only  with higher redemption values resulting in higher likelihood of acceptance the platform may consider other factors and then customize the one candidate offer to have a  redemption value therefore presenting the offer to the user provides a  chance of the platform will receive  for placement however a customized transaction offer redemption value of  may have a much greater chance that the offer will be accepted by the user so that the platform or a facilitator of the platform may receive a portion of the  acceptance payout that is greater than the placement only payout of  by customizing the transaction offer to have a higher redemption value of  the platform has ‘spent’  to increase the likelihood that the user will accept the transaction offer therefore the platform has increased the chances that presenting the customized offer will result in the advertiser paying the acceptance amount of  in this way the platform may increase the likelihood of receiving  profit instead of just  for presenting the transaction offer the platform would not receive all  of the advertiser acceptance payout as profit because the platform has contributed  to the redemption valuein another example of transaction offer customization an advertiser may offer  to place a transaction offer and the transaction offer may have an adjustable redemption value in the range of  based on other factors associated with at least one of the transaction the user the primary vendor the item being purchased a monthly transaction offer acceptance goal and the like the transaction offer acceptance anticipated payout may be  and may be independent of the redemption value of the transaction offer the platform or an aspect of the platform that may operate as part of the platform or as part of the advertiser environment or both may consider these andor other factors related to the transaction and may present the transaction offer with a value within the redemption value range in an example in which an advertiser has already reached a monthly transaction offer acceptance goal the platform may utilize this information and other transaction user or vendor information and present a transaction offer near the low end of the range such as  alternatively if the advertiser has not yet reached a monthly offer acceptance goal the platform may customize the transaction offer based at least in part on the advertiser monthly offer acceptance goal status and present a transaction offer with a redemption value of other examples of customized transaction offers may include adjusting an offer redemption period requiring the user to use the same form of payment when redeeming the transaction offer as is used in the current transaction using a specific form of payment and the likea user  interface associated with the platform  such as the primary vendor interface  the transaction offer offeror interface  the facilitator interface  and the like may include offer selection related input in an optional example the platform  interface may facilitate displaying offers based on a target user  location an actual user  location and the like a user  target location may include north america which may include the us mainland portions of mexico canada puerto rico and the like therefore targeting north america may display only those offers that are valid in the geographic regions associated with the target location offer selection may be based at least in part on predefined offer groups as may be presented through a template that may be based at least in part on a vendor industry geography and the likethe transactional offer platform  may include a payment module  the payment module  may facilitate transactions associated with payments related to the transactional offer platform  the payment module  may maintain payment records the payment records may be maintained permanently such as in one or more databases of the transactional offer platform  the payment module  may track a user  interaction with an accepted offer in such a way that the accepted offer is associated with a transaction offer offeror  a primary vendor  a user  and a primary offer  the payment module  may facilitate processing accepted offer approval notifications from the transaction offer offeror  so that payments can be processed it should be noted that a variety of conditions may result in an offer  being completed in some cases any engagement by a user  with the offer  may be sufficient to complete the offer  ranging from viewing the offer  to accepting the offer to redeeming the transaction offer  an accepted offer may or may not require approval by the transaction offer offeror  in order to be completed and in cases where approval is required the acceptance of the offer  may or may not in fact be approved by the transaction offer offeror  thus only some accepted offers require approval such may be the case for example for offers that involve user  payments or credit approval an accepted offer that requires approval becomes a completed offer once a transaction offer offeror  approves the accepted offer in some cases the transaction offer offeror  may not approve an accepted offer and consequently the accepted offer may be vacated in other cases any accepted offer is completed it should be noted that while in some cases there is a distinction between accepted offers and completed offers in many cases an accepted offer a completed offer or an engagement by the user  with the transaction offer offeror  are equivalent in the methods and systems disclosed herein therefore references to each of these terms should be understood to encompass in various alternative embodiments the others except where context depends on the distinctions described herethe payment module  may process payments associated with offers of the transactional offer platform  to process a payment the payment module  may include receiving notification or an indication of the user  viewing a transaction offer  accepting an offer receiving electronic payment or record of electronic payment from the transaction offer offeror  sending electronic payment to the primary vendor  sending payment to the facilitator  and the likethe payment module  may process a payment associated with a transaction offer offeror  the payment module  may access a database or other storage of transaction offer offeror  payment information such as a fixed amount and a variable amount associated with a transaction offer offeror  payment the payment module  may use this information for verifying the transaction offer offeror  payment the payment module  may also determine an amount owed by the transaction offer offeror  and may issue a debit  to the transaction offer offeror  for the determined amount the payment module  may determine this for each accepted offer or may determine it on an aggregation of accepted offers as often a once per hour day week or other time period the payment module  may process an electronic payment received from the transaction offer offeror  in one or more portions such as a fixed portion and a variable portion the payment module  may verify a fixed portion includes an amount related to an agreed payment for each accepted offer approval the payment module  may verify the transaction offer offeror  electronic payment includes a variable amount such as an amount based on the number of new users  who accept a transaction offer with the transaction offer offeror  the payment module  may access a database or other storage of transaction offer offeror  payment information such as the fixed amount and the variable amount for use in verifying the transaction offer offeror  payment the payment module  may record the transaction offer offeror  payment in a permanent record such as one or more databases of the transactional offer platform the payment module  may process primary vendor  payments associated with an accepted offer the payment module  may process a payment to be made to the primary vendor  that includes one or more portions such as a fixed portion and a variable portion the payment module  may access a database of primary vendor  payment information to determine the fixed andor variable portion of a primary vendor  payment the payment module  may process records associated with the primary vendor  such as related profit earned by the facilitator  number of accepted offers and accepted offer approvals associated with the primary vendor  and the like to determine the fixed portion andor the variable portion to be paid to the primary vendor  the payment module  may determine an amount owed to the primary vendor  for each accepted offer or may determine the amount owed on an aggregation of accepted offers as often a once per hour day week or other time period the payment module  may record the primary vendor  payment in a permanent record such as one or more databases of the transactional offer platform the payment module  may facilitate processing a payment associated with a user  the payment module  may send a payment to a user  such as to a users  bank account or other electronic account the payment module  may receive payment from a user  such as from a users  bank account credit card or other electronic account the payment module  may record the user  payment in a permanent record such as one or more databases of the transactional offer platform  the payment module  may facilitate processing both transaction offers as well as traditional payment processing such as with a credit card in embodiments processing may facilitate a blended or hybrid payment with a component of traditional payment and

bidding module  may be associated with a transaction offer offeror  through a transaction offer offeror interface  an offer search module  and other aspects of the transactional offer platform  such as one or more databases the offer bidding module  may facilitate bidding related to transaction offers  bidding may be useful in determining transaction offer  placement in a presentation of transaction offers  to a user  bidding may also be useful to the transactional offer platform  in selecting one or more offers to present to a user  bidding may also facilitate optimizing transaction offers the bidding module  may receive bids from transaction offer offerors  that relate to specific transaction offers  or that relate to any transaction offer  from the transaction offer offeror  the bidding module  may compare bids to facilitate ranking the bids and associated offers based at least partially on the bid amount a bid may include a presentation amount to be paid upon confirmation of a placement to a user  an acceptance amount to be paid upon user acceptance of the offer an approval amount to be paid upon approval of the users  acceptance of the offer and any other amount such as a marketing fee a transaction fee and the likebid amounts may be based on quality of users  accepting transaction offer offers volume of use acceptances and the like in an example a user  from a particular primary vendor  may be significantly more affluent and thus have a greater ability to transact with a transaction offer offeror  than a user  from a different primary vendor the transaction offer offeror  may be willing to bid more for this user  from the higher quality primary vendor the bidding module  may process the bids including associating bids with transaction offers  transaction offer offerors  and the like for use by the offer search facility  the offer optimization facility  offer selection and display facility  and the like the bidding module  may also store information such as bids bid history and the like in one or more databases of the transactional offer platform for example and without limitation a participant of the transactional offer platform  such as a transaction offer offeror  may place a bid with the bidding module  to obtain a preferred placement of an offer in a presentation of offers to a user  the bidding module  may determine that an aspect of this bid such as the amount of the bid enables the transactional offer platform  to fulfill the preferred placement of the offer associated with the bid upon selection of the offer by the offer selection and display facility  and presentation of the offer by the transaction offer transaction facility  the offer would be presented to the user  in the preferred placement the preferred placement may include preferred presentation such as ranking in a list highlighting images font animation and the like that may differentiate this offer from other offersa transaction offer offers  placement preference may be affected by bid flexibility bid flexibility may be related to a transaction offer  a transaction offer offeror  or other elements of the transaction offer process bid flexibility may be specified when a bid is placed or may be based on a transaction offer offeror  preference bid flexibility may include a maximum number of times the bid will automatically be increased kicks to keep pace with other bids bid flexibility may also include an amount per kick a total kick amount a maximum bid amount or any combination thereofa transaction offer offeror  may specify the bid flexibility as a preference that may apply to all transaction offer bids placed by the advertiser the transaction offer offeror  may use the transaction offer offeror interface  to specify bid flexibility preferencestransaction offers  associated with highly flexible bids may be provided higher placement preferences for example a bid with a  upside bid amount flexibility may be placed ahead of an identical bid with only  upside bid amount in this way transaction offer offerors  who are willing to spend more per transaction offer may be receive improved placement relative to other transaction offer offerors in addition to considering bid flexibility in transaction offer  placement the performance of the transaction offer offeror  and the transaction offer  may be included in placement preference it may be understood that a factor in the likelihood that a transaction offer  will be accepted is a previous performance measurement associated with the offer for example a transaction offer with a high number of acceptances from previous placements may be highly placed in a new transaction offer offer also a high number of transaction offer  placements may improve the placement of future transaction offers  from the transaction offer offeror some factors that may affect a transaction offer offers  placement may also affect amounts debited from a transaction offer offeror  that is associated with the transaction offer offers  placement factors such as clickthroughs user selections of transaction offers  may indicate a relevance andor user interest in the transaction offer  although a high or relatively advantageous placement of a transaction offer  may be valuable to a transaction offer offeror  engaging the user  in further evaluation of the transaction offer  may be of value even if the user  does not accept the transaction offer  for example a user  who clicks through selects a transaction offer  may be presented with further details about the offer as well as other information that the transaction offer offeror  may deem to be relevant in this way the transaction offer offeror  may gain the attention of the potential new customer this may provide some measurable value to the transaction offer offeror the transaction offer offeror  may be willing to pay a fee based on click through rates as measured daily weekly monthly or the like the fee that the transaction offer offeror  is willing to pay may be debited  from the transaction offer offeror  on a schedule based on a volume based on an event such as a transaction offer  acceptance and so on a debit amount may be associated with each click through and may be accumulated over time an accumulation interval may include hours day week month et cetera by the transaction offer transaction facility  the debit amount may be debited  at least once per accumulation interval alternatively a transaction offer offeror  may specify that click through debits may be accumulated and added to debits made for accepted offersin an example the transactional offer platform  may receive a user  request for an ecommerce transaction the transactional offer platform  may select a nonmonetary compensation offer through an automated ecommerce bidding process included in the bidding module  the transactional offer platform  may present the selected nonmonetary compensation offer to the user the bidding module  may be embodied as an automatic service such as and without limitation according to a serviceoriented architecture or any other computing architecturethe bidding module  may facilitate a transaction offer offeror  bidding for transaction offer  placement the bidding module may interact with the primary transaction facility  and other elements of the transactional offer platform  such as user demographics  user transaction history including transactional offer history one or more databases of the transactional offer platform  the offer optimization facility  and the offer selection and display facility  and any other element as needed to facilitate offer biddingthe bidding module  may compute a consumer score for a user  seeking to alternatively purchase a primary offer  the consumer score may be useful in facilitating offer bidding to compute the consumer score the bidding module  may assess information related to the primary offer  and the active user  the bidding module  may receive information about a primary offer transaction from the primary transaction facility  the information may include the primary vendor  primary offer  and the user  the bidding module may retrieve the users  transaction history from one or more of the databases of the transactional offer platform  the bidding module may also retrieve the users  demographics  the bidding module may combine the information about the primary offer  the user  transaction history and the active user demographics  to compute the users  consumer score in an example a user  may be seeking to alternatively purchase a subscription to zagatcom the users  transaction history may show the user accepted transaction offers  for three previous transactions with an average transaction offer  user cost of  the users  demographics may indicate the users  address as an upper middleclass suburb of boston mass based on this example user information the bidding module  may compute a consumer score as eight points out of a possible ten points the bidding module  may present this consumer score to a plurality of transaction offer offerors  through the bidding module  so that the transaction offer offeror  may bid to present a transaction offer  to the user  the consumer score may refer to one or more defined characteristics of the user  a high consumer score may be a strong indication of that particular user  characteristic while a low consumer may represent an absence of that particular characteristic the consumer score may be an aggregation of multiple similar consumer scores relating to different characteristics of the user  furthermore these scores may be valued differently by transaction offer offerors  such that one transaction offer offeror  may pay a premium for a particular score while another transaction offer offeror  will not in this way a transaction offer offeror  can bid on the consumer scores that best relate to type of user  the transaction offer  seeks to attract in this document consumer score refers to an individual consumer score relating to a particular characteristic of the user  or an aggregation of consumer scores that may be refer to the overall characteristics of the user  and may be the weighted sum of the individual consumer scoresa transaction offer offeror  may place multiple bids for multiple different consumer scores relating to various aspects of a user  for example a transaction offer offeror  may place a bid for high consumer scores relating to the female gender and may also place a bid for high consumer scores relating to high household incomesome or all of the plurality of transaction offer offerors  may bid to offer the user  a transaction offer  the transaction offer offerors  may adjust a bid amount based on the consumer score of the user  for example a transaction offer offeror  may bid  to offer a transaction offer  to a user  with a consumer score of four however the same transaction offer offeror  may bid  for a user  with a consumer score of eight the transaction offer offerors  may also include a conversion rate associated with a bid where the conversion rate is a measure of the likelihood that a transaction offer  associated with the bid will be completed by the target user  associated with the bid an expected value based on a function of the bid and the conversion rate may be computed by the bidding module  for each bid received the transaction offer offeror  bid rate expected value and transaction offer  information may be shared with the optimization facility  alternatively the expected value may not be computed by the bidding module  instead the optimization facility may compute the expected valuethrough the bidding module  computation of a consumer value for the user  and the transaction offer offerors  placing bids and associated conversion rates for the user  the optimization facility  may now optimize among transaction offers  each with a computed expected value offer optimization may be directed toward maximizing the expected value that may be shared with the primary vendor  for the user transaction to maximize the expected value of a user transaction the offer optimization facility  may rank the offers based on expected value so that the offer selection and display facility  may select the top ranked offers for prominent presentation to the user  in an example the table below shows bids and conversion rates of six transaction offer offerors  for the user with a consumer rating of eightten in the example abovetransaction offer bid exampletransaction offerofferorbid amountconversion rateexpected valuecingularverizondiscoveramerican expressrealrhapsody stampscom the offer optimization facility  or the bidding module  may compute the expected value as shown in the table and forward the cingular and the realrhapsody offers as optimized offers  to the offer selection and display facility  the selection and display facility  may select one or more of the optimized offers  and send them to the transaction offer transaction facility  as selected offers  for presentation to the user  the remaining four offers may not be presented to the user  unless the user rejects the cingular and the realrhapsody transaction offers  however the remaining four offers may be presented to the user  along with the cingular and realrhapsody offers in a less prominent way such as by smaller print lower order in a list and the like the bidding module  may provide realtime feedback to the transaction offer offeror  as to the potential impact in offer performance that may result from an increased bid for example a message may be sent to the transaction offer offeror  indicating that an increase of a given amount will make a particular transaction offer  the highest ranked offer on a pagethe transactional platform  may include a bidding module  for selection of transaction offers stored in the offers database  the offers database  may be continuously updated with new offers realized by the merchants the offer selection facility  may select transactional offers provided by different merchants based on the predetermined bidding criteria the bidding criteria may be based on transaction amount users commitment to a transaction correlation of advertiser offer with the transaction mode of payment payment type indication to make payment and the likethe platform  may include a transactional bidding module  that may bid module  present bidding suggestions to the advertisers the bid module  suggested bid amount may be based on partial or complete match of the transactional offers stored in the offers database  and the information associated with the advertiser for example a user  may have committed to purchase a mobile phone from ebay in response to this purchase commitment the platform may prepare for the user  to be presented with a transaction offer the platform  may suggest to the advertiser a bid amount for placement of transactional offers the bid module  may suggest a higher bid amount to the companies selling mobile accessories based on the likelihood of the transaction offer being accepted by the user  given that a user  who has committed to buy a mobile phone will more likely purchase mobile accessoriesthe bidding module  may not suggest an amount of bid but may suggest that one or more advertisers to bid on placing a transaction offer based on the relationship described above or other factors andor relationships of factors associated with an electronic transactionin embodiments the bid module  may evaluate various parameters related to transactional offers and the advertisers various rules and algorithmbased criteria may be implemented in the bid module  to facilitate selection of the probable advertisers and their bidding amounts in embodiments the bid module  may implement a statistical criterion for determining the correlation between the transaction and the advertiser the transactional offer and the bid amount and the like in another embodiment the bid module  may implement a neural network for determining the correlation between the transaction and the advertiser the transactional offer and the bid amount and the like in yet another embodiment the bid module  may use fuzzy logic for determining the correlation between the transaction and the advertiser the transactional offer and the bid amount and the like in addition the bid module  may use a rulebased facility programmed for suggesting the bid amount corresponding to the transactional offer for any plurality of advertisers respectivelyin embodiments the advertisers may bid for placing the offer to the user  an offer selection and display facility  may be entrusted with the task of evaluating the bid received from a plurality of merchants the evaluation of bids may be based on contents associated with the transaction for example the user  may be purchasing a book from abookscom and in response to this transaction bbookscom and cbookscom may like to suggest a transactional offer to the user  in this example evaluation of bid may be performed based on the highest bid entered by each party in another example the bid may be evaluated on the content match between the purchased title of the book and the corresponding transactional offer the offer display facility  may display the selected transactional offer to the useruser  the offer selection and display facility  may decide the timing duration placement on the page and the length of the transactional offers and the like for placement of transactional offers presented to the useruser while evaluating the criteria for selection of transactional offers to be presented to the user  the offer selection facility  may evaluate a plurality of factors including transaction amount payment type shipping address shopping cart contents user level of commitment and transactional status and the like for example if the transaction shows a shipping address for india the user  may be presented with transactional offers applicable in india even though the advertiser of such an offer may not be the highest bidder in another example if the committed transaction showed a large number of shopping cart contents of closely related items the transactional offer corresponding to the advertiser providing a package offer may be presented to the user  in yet another example the user indication to try a product and users commitment to make the payment after the trial would classify the user  as first adopter and transactional offers corresponding to new product trial may be provided to the user  without any obligation to buy the users level of commitment may be segmented in different categories an indication of nonpayment an indication of payment and an indication of indecision to pay and the transactional offers may be presented to the user  based on users level of commitmentin embodiments the transaction status may be an important determinant in identifying the transactional offer to be presented to the user  without any obligation or promise in entering into a transaction for the transaction offer further the transaction status may indicate a position of the user  communicating a desire to enter into a transaction based on the incentive provided in the transaction offer alternatively the user may foresee a benefit in the form of the transaction offer without any obligation to pay for accepting the transaction by making full payment in another scenario the payment approval for the transaction may attract an incentive which may be embodied as a transaction offerthe transactional offer platform  may include an offer search facility  the offer search facility  may communicate with aspects of the transactional offer platform  such as a bidding module  the offer optimization facility  the offer selection and display facility  various databases of the transactional offer platform  external offer databases  and the like the offer search facility  may comprise search techniques such as text string matching to identify one or more offers from a plurality of offer databases  searching by the offer search facility  may be performed as a result of an event or a request a search event may include receiving a user  request for an ecommerce transaction such as acquiring a primary offer  using the transactional offer platform  a search event may be a vendor registering with the transactional offer platform  a vendor introducing the transactional offer platform  to a new primary offer  or a new transaction offer  a user  rejecting all offers presented through the transaction offer transaction facility  a schedule such as a date and time and the like the search request may include any participant including a user  of the transactional offer platform  sending the transactional offer platform  a request to perform an offer searchthe offer search facility  may maintain a directory of offer databases  vendors and facilitators  may provide input to the directory so that new offer databases  may be searched by the search facility  the search facility  may search through specific offer databases  such as those in the directory additionally the search facility  may also search throughout a network such as the internet for offers or offer databases  that have a relevance to the transactional offer platform changes to offer databases  may be provided to the offer search facility  through a variety of notifications in an example an rss feed of updates to one or more of the offer databases  may be monitored by the search facility the offer search facility  may also include information provided by bidding module  in identifying offers for possible presentation to users the offer search facility  may also receive a request from the offer selection and display facility  to retrieve one or more offers from one or more of the offer databases  upon receiving the request the offer search facility  may access the appropriate offer databases  retrieve the offer and present it to the offer selection and display facility  for use in a presentation to a user  for examplein an example the transactional offer platform  may receive a user  request for an ecommerce transaction the offer search facility  may search a plurality of databases for nonmonetary compensation offers to be presented to the user  as further incentive to complete the transaction the offer search facility  may retrieve at least one nonmonetary compensation offer from the plurality of databases and present it to the user through the transactional offer platform the offer search facility  may be embodied as an automatic service such as and without limitation according to a serviceoriented architecture or any other computing architecturethe transactional offer platform  may include a lead generation facility  for developing leads of users  that may appeal to one or more vendors such as primary vendors  and transaction offer offerors  the lead generation facility may communicate with users  and aspects of the transactional offer platform  such as the offer optimization facility  the offer selection and display facility  and the likethe lead generation facility  may process primary offers  and transaction offers  to generate criteria for lead generation the criteria may include aspects of the offers such as user  cost geographic limits user demographics  and the like the lead generation facility  may generate a lead that may contain user  contact information such as an email address or messaging username telephone number and the like so that the generated lead has a relevance to a primary offer  or a transaction offer users may be contacted by the lead generation facility  based on their email address being known to the lead generation facility  such as would be the case if a user  had registered with the transactional offer platform  the lead generation facility  may contact users through a variety of other methods including telephone text message instant message and the like user contact may include offer promotional material such as an advertisement for the offer if the promotional material appeals to the user  heshe may respond and thereby generate an acceptance of a transaction offer  of the transactional offer platform  this acceptance may result in the transaction offer offeror  associated with the transaction offer  paying the transactional offer platform  a fee for providing the leadthe lead generation facility  may match one or more aspects of an offer to one or more aspects of a user  so that the offer  may appeal to the user the lead generation facility  may be embodied as an automatic service such as and without limitation according to a serviceoriented architecture or any other computing architecturethe transactional offer platform  may include external offer databases  the external offer databases  may be accessible by the transactional offer platform  through the offer search facility  the external offer databases  may be configured as a collection of records stored in one or more computers in a systematic way so that a computer program such as the offer search facility  consult it to find offers however any collection list single entry or other logically related group of offers may comprise the external offer databases one or more of the external offer databases  may be established andor maintained by the transactional offer platform  this may be used as a primary store of offers by the transactional offer platform  or it may be a backup or transaction offer store of offersan external offer database  may be established andor maintained by a vendor such as a transaction offer offeror  or an offer consolidator  the database  may be maintained such that from time to time offers may be added removed or changed the addition removal or change of an offer in one or more of the external offer databases  may result in a signal such as an rss feed being sent to the transactional offer platform in addition to offers being stored in an external offer database  the transactional offer platform  or a vendor may also store information related to offers such as bid amounts payment terms account numbers contact information offer performance user  acceptance information and the like including this additional information in one or more of the external offer databases  may facilitate communicating the information between a vendor and the transactional offer platform  in an example the offer search facility  may retrieve an offer and associated information as herein described from an external offer database  for processing by the offer optimization facility external offer databases  may be distributed andor duplicated to facilitate timely searching and retrieval of information in the databases in an embodiment including a plurality of transactional offer platforms  information may be stored in the external offer databases  to facilitate coordination of access among the transactional offer platforms  alternatively the transactional offer platform  may coordinate access separately from the external offer databases the transactional offer platform  may include user demographics  user demographics  communicate with aspects of the transactional offer platform  such as offer optimization facility  offer selection and display facility  vendor reporting  and the like user demographics  may be stored in a database that may be accessible to the transactional offer platform  at all times the user demographics  database may be external to the transactional offer platform  and may be established andor maintained by a user demographics provider alternatively the transactional offer platform  may establish andor maintain a user demographics  databaseas herein described the offer optimization facility  and the offer selection and display facility  may use user demographics  in optimizing and selecting offers for presentation to a user  the user demographics  may facilitate presenting offers to a user  that have a relevance of some importance to the user  in an example an offer for fly fishing equipment may have an important relevance to a user  with demographic aspects that may characterize the user as having an interest in outdoor participatory sportsuser demographics  may include a users  individual demographic variables such as age sex race religion an area code zip code a home address a work address a billing address credit information family information income range birth date range birthplace employer job title length of employment an affiliation or other such information as described hereinthe transactional offer platform  may include one or more transaction offer redemption facilitators  the transaction offer redemption facilitators  may communicate with users  and the transactional offer platform  such as through the transaction vendor  transaction offer redemption facilitators  may facilitate a user  redeeming a transaction offer that the user previously accepted in an electronic transactionthe transactional offer platform  may include offer consolidators  offer consolidators  may communicate with one or more transaction offer offerors  and one or more transactional offer platforms  an offer consolidator  may coordinate offers such as transaction offers  from transaction offer offerors  to enable users  to take advantage of the offers an offer consolidator  may handle aspects of the offer such as user registration offer approval offer delivery transactional offer platform  payment and so on an offer consolidator  may perform these and other functions for a fee paid by the transaction offer offerors an offer consolidator  may provide benefits of consolidating offers from different aspects of a vendors business while maintaining a consistent methodology and standards for the offers in an example an offer consolidator  may manage offers from a transaction offer offeror  so that a single offer may be adjusted for different geographic regions for example the payment associated with a transaction offer  may be different with respect to accepting users  from different regions the price of the primary offer  may vary by region or the likeoffer consolidators  may also provide additional services such as consolidating offers from a plurality of transaction offer offerors facilitating transaction offer offerors  reaching high quality users  may be a valuable service of the transactional offer platform  transaction offer offerors  may be looking to acquire high quality users  to increase the likelihood that such a user  will become a customer of the transaction offer offeror  determining which users  are high quality may be challenging in an electronic commerce environment because users  can make a transaction including accepting a transaction offer offer without providing key quality information such as spending habits product preferences and the like a users  email address and contact information while required for most transactions may not facilitate quality determination in an electronic transaction such as a transaction offer transaction users  may also be reluctant to provide personal detailsthe transactional offer platform  may offer alternative ways for transaction offer offerors  to gain access to high quality users  by establishing a customer acquisition marketplace also referred to herein as a “customer marketplace” the transaction offer platform  may facilitate a transaction offer offeror  gaining access to highquality users  through the platforms dynamic transaction offer  association features the transactional offer platform  may allow transaction offer offerors  to specify aspects of user  quality that can be assessed by the platform  user  quality may include aspects of primary offers  therefore transaction offer offerors  may request their transaction offers  be offered to users  who are alternatively purchasing products or services with specified aspects for example and without limitation a user  who is interested in a primary offer  that involves purchasing a luxury good may be a user  that is ready to spend a relatively large amount of money in this respect the user  may be considered a highquality user for another example and also without limitation a user  who is interested in a primary offer  that is generally associated with a particular demographic may be considered a highquality user to a transaction offer offeror  who is a purveyor of goods that are typically purchased by members of that demographic many definitions of a highquality user  will be appreciated and all such definitions are within the scope of the present disclosure similarly many systems and methods of determining whether a user  is a highquality user  will be appreciated and all such systems and methods are within the scope of the present disclosurein embodiments there may be many transaction offer offerors  interested in acquiring users  who are alternatively purchasing one or more of the primary offers  with the specified aspects therefore the transactional offer platform  may enable transaction offer offerors  to request promotion placement pricing and the like collectively referred to herein simply as “placement” of their transaction offers  to high quality users  such placement may be associated with positioning one transaction offer  in relation to another transaction offer  providing one transaction offer  instead of another transaction offer  modifying a look feel price or other element of a transaction offer  such as and without limitation to improve the appearance andor allure of one transaction offer  as compared with another and so on transaction offer offerors  may include a bid in association with a transaction offer  placement request the offer bidding module  may determine which transaction offer  is selected based at least in part on the bid in an example credit card vendors such as discover card visa master card and the like may be willing to pay more to acquire a customer alternatively purchasing a zagatcom subscription than a customer alternatively purchasing winzip perhaps because the purchase of a subscription to zagatcom as opposed to a purchase of winzip naturally leads to additional purchases such as for restaurant visits for which using a credit card may be a preferred method of payment additionally or alternatively such a customer ie a user  may have income or spending habits that would highly benefit a credit card vendor this aspect of the transactional offer platform  which a customer marketplace may encompass may allow transaction offer offerors  to bid on users  who are performing live transaction offer transactions rather than soft leadsto facilitate the customer marketplace the transactional offer platform  may allow transaction offer offerors  to specify aspects of primary offers  that indicate that a user  who is selecting the primary offer  might be a high quality user  the transaction offer offerors  may specify these aspects through one or more screens dialogue boxes webpages et cetera of the transaction offer offeror interface  aspects of the primary offer  may be associated with specific products or services in other examples a home equity lender may consider a user  alternatively purchasing replacement windows as a high quality customer a horse transportation vendor may consider a user  alternatively purchasing a saddle as a high quality customer a wine club may consider a user  alternatively purchasing a case of wine to be a high quality customer many other such examples will be appreciated and all such examples are within the scope of the present disclosureaspects of primary offers  may also include categories or types of products or services it will be appreciated from the foregoing examples that the products or services may be included in categories such as home improvement products or services horse riding and care products or services wine and liquor products and services and so on additional category examples may include gaming products or services camping products or services travel product or services boating products or services and the like it will be appreciated that primary offers  may be categorized or typed in a wide variety of ways that may be usefully specified by transaction offer offerors  to identify potentially high quality customers all such categories types and combinations of aspects are contemplated by this specification and are within the scope of the present disclosureaspects of primary offers  related to customer quality and the transaction offer offerors  specification of these aspects may be processed by the offer optimization facility  such that the optimized offer  selection incorporates these additional factors offer selection as performed by the offer selection and display facility  may also be affected by these factors a possible outcome of incorporating these additional factors into offer optimization and offer selection is a presentation by the transaction offer transaction facility  of transaction offers  that may have a greater relevance and possibly greater value to the user  than other transaction offers in addition to the customer acquisition marketplace being useful and beneficial to transaction offer offerors  it may also be beneficial to primary vendors  primary vendors  may view the possible associations with transaction offer offerors  as adding value by providing comarketing andor cobranding opportunities primary vendors  may perceive that participating in the transactional offer platform  may increase their sales through these offer associations and therefore the primary vendors  may employ the transactional offer platform  to provide a transaction offer option for their products and services a user  that is a high quality customer to a transaction offer offeror  may also be a high quality customer to a primary vendor  therefore if a primary vendor  is aware that a user  may be able to buy the primary vendors  product or service by alternatively purchasing a product or service transaction offer  that the user  highly desires the primary vendor  may want to participate in that offer association these offer associations thereby make the transactional offer platform  a viable effective and desirable method of purchase for primary vendors demographic and other user  aspects that factor into a consumers value to a vendor may include zip code and may relate to property value these user  aspects may be implicitly determined based on location detection of the user through the isp andor ip address the user  aspects may be explicitly determined based on userprovided data such as zip code for example a user  may provide a zip code that when evaluated against demographic data is considered a “high approval rate” zip code for financial products such as loans credit cards and the like a credit card company may be willing to pay a relatively high fee to acquire a customer from a “high approval rate” zip codethirdparty services that provide online access to property value income assessment approval rate and the like may provide valuable information for determining customer quality to the transactional offer platform  for example and without limitation an area with relatively high property values may contain higher qualityvalue customer and therefore an advertiser may be willing to pay a premium to acquire a customer from such an areasimilarly an aspect of a users  househomeapartment may factor into customer qualityvalue a user  in an apartment may not be a high qualityvalue customer for transaction offer offerors  that provide home improvement products and services however such a user  may be quite valuable to insurers that are offering apartment insurance therefore determining whether a userl  lives in an apartment home or other type of domicile may allow the transactional offer platform  to establish an appropriate qualityvalue factor for the customerother factors such as a customers ie a users  use of a particular type of internet connection a particular type of web browser a particular operating system and the like may also be of value in establishing the qualityvalue of the customer for example a transaction offer offeror  offering faster internet access may consider a user with an outofdate operating system eg windows  as a low quality potential customer conversely a user with a current model computer an updated operating system and a slow internet connection may be considered a high quality potential customer many other examples will be appreciated and all such examples are within the scope of the present disclosurefrom the transaction offer offerors  viewpoint having timely access to highquality customers who are actively performing electronic transactions may provide much greater value than traditional internet advertising and marketing techniques such as costperclick keywordbased marketplacestransaction offers  may take place before a primary offer  salecheckout or after the salecheckout additionally the user  may be presented with multiple offers from the platform  the platform  may present the multiple offers at one time such as through a webpage showing the offers or may be presented at more than one time directly presented offers may be presented in succession on individual webpages or may be presented together on a single webpage offers may include low value items such as a digital music song download and the likethe transactional offer platform  may include release testing for testing changes additions conversion updates and new releases of aspects of the platform  to ensure the platform  achieves high quality performance and reliability release testing may be automated to support and facilitate platform  complexity the platform  release may be deployed to a subset of users a subset of vendors and the like the deployment may be automatic or manual and may include a sufficient numbers of users and vendors to create a statistically significant sample size the release may be deployed for only certain tasks new releases of a transactional offer platform  may be tested for performance usability bugs advance warning of support needs and the like these measurements may be made automatically in an example and without limitation usability may be inferred from tracking user times to complete tasks by analyzing results from subjective assessments by tracking the number of completed versus abandoned transactions in relation to the number of bugs and the likethe platform  may be associated with vendor administration vendor administration may involve tracking active placements active placements may include urls emails and other touchpoints such as uninstall nagscreen unsubscribe cancel shopping cart abandon and the like involving the transactional offer platform  active placement tracking may involve account managers vendors and the like identifying where a given product page is being promoted active placement tracking may facilitate making sure “best practices” are implemented identifying misrepresentations demonstration of live examples for prospective vendors identifying sources of traffic and the like in an example active placement tracking may capture touch point type along with associated information duration comments and the like a vendor interface may facilitate active placement tracking by presenting information and analysis that may identify revenue associated with a ‘constant’ traffic source and a transient sourcethe transactional offer platform  may comprise a vendor interface the vendor interface may facilitate vendor registration configuration of the vendor account management of a vendor account monitoring of a vendor account and the like the vendor interface may facilitate monitoring of primary offers referrals referral commissions active placements statistics and the like analytics and reports may be generated through a vendor interfacethe transactional offer platform  may comprise a primary vendor interface  the primary vendor interface  may allow primary vendors  to perform analytics for each product available through the transactional offer platform  and monitor performance of various customer communications analytics may be available as a daily feed through a dashboard of the primary vendor interface  analytics may include traffic sources actions taken on a product webpage products sold repeat customers the association of revenue generated with traffic source the association of revenue generated with repeat customers payment option performance touch point analytics and the like analytics may assist primary vendors  in decision making and adjusting communication strategy analytics may assist a primary vendor  in determining optimal pricing of a product in an example and without limitation analytics may demonstrate payment option performance such as the rate of transaction completion for creditcard transactions versus transactional offer platform  transactions analytics may assist a primary vendor  in determining how to convert webpage visitors into customers by analyzing past transactions analytics may assist a primary vendor  in determining when to introduce the transactional offer platform  during a transaction analytics may assist in determining user  related fraud such as when a user completes multiple transaction offers  without regard to the terms and conditions of the transaction offer  in an example and without limitation analytics may assist in deciding if a transactional offer platform  may be introduced prior to a payment point during a transaction with the payment point after the payment point at any time in the transaction and the like by providing data regarding rates of transaction completion for each touch point wherever there may be a payment option there may be a touch pointthe primary vendor interface  may allow primary vendors  to extend transaction offer offeror  timeout as described elsewhere herein with respect to offer optimization  the primary vendor interface  may allow primary vendors  to add a landing page option for the checkout process in an example and without limitation a vendor may want to specify additional context on the transactional offer platform  payment module using a landing page which may be provided with default messaging custom messaging and the like the landing page may be customized based on a traffic source a season a demographic and the likethe transactional offer platform  may comprise pricing alternatives in an example and without limitation a vendor may indicate a minimum acceptable price for one region of the world but indicate a different minimum acceptable price for another region in another example pricing may be based on a demographic in an example and without limitation a vendor may indicate a lower minimum acceptable price for seniors and a higher one for nonseniors in another example pricing may be based on a psychographic in an example and without limitation a vendor may indicate a lower price for members of amnesty international the transactional offer platform  payment module  may aggregate pricing parameters for each region demographic and psychographic where a vendor may indicate a pricing alternative in a pricing table the pricing table may allow the vendor to indicate the pricing alternative as a new entry as a percentage of a prior minimum acceptable price and the like pricing alternatives may be indicated in any currency in use the pricing table may be accessed by the payment module when a user indicates a certain regional location demographic psychographic and the likea vendor may receive additional information related to a user  after a transaction is complete in an example and without limitation a user  may accept a user id from a vendor using this user id the vendor may track and report completed offers associated with the user id in another example a vendor may have access to an order id or product id associated with a transaction offer  the vendor may be able to track the fulfillment status of a transaction offer  using the order id or product id vendors may be able to indicate transaction parameters to which they want access vendors may make transaction parameter choices by configuring a transaction parameter list upon initiation of a new transaction the transaction parameter list may be accessed all relevant parameters may be delivered to the vendor once they become available in the course of the transaction the transaction parameters may be available on a webpage in a report by email and the likethe platform  may facilitate offer management by allowing primary vendors  to select transaction offer  to make available as transactional offer options for their primary offers  a k a pulling offers the platform  may alternatively or additionally facilitate offer management by pushing a selected offer or offers to a primary vendor  the selection may be based on aspects of the primary offer  primary vendor  transaction offer offeror  transaction offer  user location or geography and the like the primary vendor  may review selected offers that are pushed so that only offers that meet the primary vendor  offer selection criteria may be presented to users seeking to use the transaction offer platform  to acquire a primary offer pushing offers may facilitate a reduction in the overhead and human interaction associated with pulling offers by utilizing the offer selection facilities  and other offer coordination aspects of the platform  to push highly relevant offers to the primary vendor  to approve use of the transaction offer  as transactional offer for the primary offer preferences and other transaction offer  related constraints identified by the primary vendor  to the platform  may be included in the selection of offers to push to the primary vendors  a primary vendor  may identify preferences that indicate certain types of offers or offers with certain content may not be presented to a user as a transactional offer for the primary offer  the primary vendor  may identify these and other preferences through the primary vendor user interface  the primary vendor  may select options such as “accept all pushed offers” “accept all qualified pushed offers” “accept all pushed offers except those listed below” “only accept pushed offers listed below” “accept no offers automatically” and the like a primary vendor  may choose to review each pushed offer or offers before making a decision about allowing the offers to be presented to users vendors may establish relationships with affiliates to further promote sale of the vendors product or service affiliates may be associated with primary vendors  transaction offer offerors  and may also be associated with the platform  an affiliate associated with the platform  may be similar to a transaction offer  consolidator  in that the affiliate provides a realtime connection between a user  and a primary  or transaction offer  through the platform  vendors may compensate an affiliate for a completed transaction such as a purchase of a primary offer  therefore vendors may want to compensate an affiliate for a user  who uses the transactional offer platform  to complete a primary offer  to ensure an affiliate that is involved in a platform  related transaction receives proper credit for a transaction for which they provided the user  the platform  may support receiving storing tracking and reporting the affiliate identification associated with transactions maintaining a record of the relationship of an affiliate with a platform  transaction may facilitate proper accounting of posttransaction actions such as charge backs credit and debit adjustments and the liketo promote quality use of the platform  a best practices forum may be associated with the platform  participants to the platform  may have access to the best practices forum

means such as direct credit card processing indirect credit card processing through a third party and the like conventional purchase transactions may be facilitated with the powerful capabilities of the platform to seamlessly incorporate transaction offers as part of the transaction resulting in blended or hybrid transactions as herein describe because the platform provides significant flexibility in sourcing and presenting offers a merchants ability to offer highly desirable offers is essentially unlimitedanother advantage of the platform  for conventional payment transactions is that the user may receive reimbursement against the current transaction by fully accepting one of the offers this is distinct from ‘postpurchase’ offers that propose to provide a discount to a user on a future purchase or offers that require a user to select a particular form of payment to gain a discount at least because the platform may facilitate the payment directly offers can impact the amount charged to the users form of payment for the current transactiontransaction based offers such as conventional purchase transaction offers that are provided through the platform  are advantageous in that information from the user the merchant the platform and the advertiser making the offer may be combined and provided to the advertiser or transaction offer offeror at least some of the information provided to the advertiser may be user related information that may allow the advertiser to begin a business relationship with the user maintain an existing business relationship with the user conduct a transaction with the user any and all combinations of the foregoing and the likeby supporting blended purchase transactions and a powerful offer selection and optimization engine that can target ads that protect business interests of the merchants the platform  enables merchants to have high confidence that the offers presented to the merchants users at the critical purchase authorization stage will be viewed by the user as beneficial rather than annoying or disruptive this allows the merchant to direct all purchase transactions to the platform  without concern for losing sales or promoting competition with are both serious concerns with keyword based ad serving systemsthe platform supports a business model that ensures profitable transactions for the merchant and the platform facilitator when a blended purchase transaction is executed because the advertiser pays a fee to the platform in conjunction with an accepted offer the platform benefits the user in a blended transaction because a blended transaction executed through the platform enables a user to choose a form of payment such as credit card debit card third party payment service eg paypal and the like while taking advantage of a transaction offer presented during the payment transaction in an example a user making a purchase transaction may be presented with a choice of payment options including an option to open a credit account such as with a  interest rate to allow for interest free payment over time this offer benefits the user because the user can spread the payments that total the purchase price over the  interest rate term however the new credit card may not be applied to the primary transaction by signing up for the  credit card the user and the vendor providing the credit card offer enter a business relationship that is facilitated by the platform the advertiser pays the platform for facilitating access to a new customer the merchant may receive a portion of the advertiser payment as an incentive to use the platform for purchase transactions the user may receive a portion of the advertiser payment as an incentive to signup for the credit card these and a wide variety of other uses of the fee paid by the vendoradvertiser are possible with the methods and systems of the transactional offer platformanother example is simply to offer a consumer the opportunity to receive a coupon from an online retailer benefit to consumer might be  off any purchase for new customers benefit to advertiser might be a new business relationship with a consumerthe transaction offer platform  may facilitate a reduction elimination or reversal of fees typically paid by merchants for purchase transactions using conventional means fees may typically be charged to a merchant by a payment processor bank or other transaction offer redemption facilitator that accepts a user form of payment such as a credit card while the user form of payment may be charged a full purchase amount the amount paid to the merchant is usually reduced by the fee charged a prepayment transaction such as this may be required for the user to receive the item that the user has selected to purchase and for the merchant to receive payment for the item typically the merchant does not receive compensation directly from the user instead the user authorizes a third party such as credit card provider bank and the like to make a payment to the merchant on the users behalf and the third party collects the user authorized purchase amount from the user through a billing or debiting process although the merchant agrees with the user to sell the item service subscription or the like at a fixed price and the user agrees to pay the fixed price the merchant receives less than the fixed price from the users authorized third party because the third party retains a portion of the fixed purchase price as a transaction fee the transactional offer platform  may facilitate feebased payments while enabling the merchant to receive the full amount paid by the userby providing the merchant with such an opportunity the merchant may allow the platform to prepare and present offers such as transactional offer offers to the user at various times during the purchase transaction process the merchant may also provide the platform with information related to the user that may allow the platform to identify and prepare offers that may be relevant to the user in addition to user related information the merchant may provide information related to other users with which the merchant has or had engagements such as prior purchases and purchases made by other users the platform may combine the information provided by the merchant with other information available to the platform as herein described and use the combined information to select one or more offers targeted at the user the offer selecting optimizing processing and other features and capabilities of the platform as herein described may be applied to this process the offers such as transaction offer offers as herein described may be provided to the userthe merchant may receive compensation such as an amount equal to a financial transaction fee described herein that may be charged by a transaction service provider for engaging the platform to make offers to the user during the checkoutpayment transaction process the amount of merchant compensation may be variable using the methods and systems for determining merchant payments as herein described in this way a merchant may offer an item or service at a fixed price the user may agree to purchase the item or service for the fixed price and provide a form of payment to pay the fixed price and the merchant may receive a feereduced amount provided through the form of paymentplus an amount based on an agreement with a facilitator of the platform in this way the merchant may receive the full amount paid by the user based on a wide variety of factors such as the perceived value of the user to the platform or to an advertiser the amount of merchant compensation may be adjusted to be more less or the same as the transaction feethe offers provided to the user may be provided at various points during the checkout or purchase transaction process the user may be presented offers after the user has agreed to make a purchase and has selected the payment method such as the type of credit card offers presented at this point may be based at least in part on the form of payment selected alternatively the user may be presented offers after the user has entered payment information such as a credit card number based on the credit card number and information related thereto that may be available to the platform such as a credit rating a purchase history address information a credit limit and the like one or more offers may be selected additionally this information may affect the amount of merchant compensation for using the platform to present offers a user with a high credit score or high credit limit may be deemed to be of higher value than low credit score users and the merchant may receive comparatively more compensation in an example one or more offers may be presented during a payment confirmation page so that the user may receive a reimbursement against the completed transaction by fully accepting one of the offersbecause offer selection can be based on a wide variety of factors including without exclusion important information about the user the offers can be targeted to the user in ways that typical ‘postpurchasedecision’ offers cannot be targeted instead of the offers being based on the item being purchased or merchantcentric information the offers can be independent of the item being purchased and do not have to be related to merchant inventory the platform provides significant flexibility in sourcing and presenting offers that allow the merchant to gain access to an essentially unlimited number of offers for usersthe platform may play a critical role in providing advertisers with access to a user during one or more critical points in the purchase transaction process access to the user may be in the form of information related to or otherwise identifying the user in terms that are important to the advertiser to receive the information that facilitates access to the user the advertisers may pay a fee to the platform the fee may entitle the advertisers to receive information about the user andor transaction that may allow the advertiser to begin a business relationship with the user maintain an existing business relationship with the user conduct a transaction with the user make adjustments in offers to improve offer performance as herein described and the like the advertisers may also compensate the platform for presenting the offers andor for the user accepting the offer andor for the user fulfilling requirements of acceptance of the offer and the like the platform  may facilitate a user  and an advertiser  to engage in or support an existing business relationshipby receiving compensation from the advertisers the platform may distribute the compensation to the user the merchant to a facilitator of the platform and the like the platform may act as an intermediary during the payment transaction so that the platform pays the purchase transaction fee to the financial institution as herein described in this way the platform may be able to reduce the cost of the transaction fee charged by the financial institution because of a large volume of transactions performed for a plurality of merchants through the platformoffer selection optimization presentation primary and transaction offer fulfillment and offer types all herein described may apply to purchase transaction based offers independent of the location of the purchase eg online point of sale and the likereferring again to fig  the flow diagram  shows certain actions that may take place in the context of some embodiments of the transaction offer platform  at least one of these embodiments may be a purchase transaction based embodiment as previously describedat step  the primary offeror  also referred to herein without limitation as the merchant may offer the primary offer  to the user at step  the user  may begin a merchant transaction to purchase the primary offer  in some embodiments beginning the merchant transaction may involve selecting a “checkout” option in an online shopping cart containing the primary offer  it will be understood that a variety of embodiments are possible including without limitation single click purchase actions commonly referred to as “buy it now” transactions automated selfserve checkout stations and the likein at least the purchase transaction offer embodiment the user  may be associated with user data that relates to aspects of the user  andor aspects of the merchant transaction in some embodiments the user data may include demographic information  about the user information about an online shopping cart of the user information about the online shopping carts contents information about the primary offeror  any and all combinations of the foregoing or the like at least some of the uses of this information are described herein for conventional purchase transaction offersat step  the transaction offer offerors  also referred to herein without limitation as the advertisers may specify the transaction offers  also referred to herein without limitation as the transaction offers each of the transaction offers  may be associated with target data including without limitation demographic merchant andor shopping cart data for example and without limitation the transaction offer offeror  may be a local restaurant the transaction offer  may be a  gift certificate to the local restaurant the gift certificate priced at  and the target data may include zip codes in the local restaurants service areaat step  the facilitator  may analyze the transaction offers  in light of user data in order to select which if any of the transaction offers  might be presented to the user at step  and based upon the analysis of step  the facilitator  may select which if any of the transaction offers  will be presented to the user  in some embodiments the platform  andor the facilitator  may select those transaction offers  having ad target data that is more or less associated with the user data for example and without limitation the ad target data may be data associated with an offer and may include a zip code and radius eg  and  miles and the user data may include a zip code eg  in this example the ad target data and the user data may be associated in that a geographic area defined by the users zip code intersects a geographic area defined by the target data for another example and also without limitation the target data may include a musicians name eg victor wooten and the user data may include another musicians name eg marcus miller in this example the target data and the user data may be associated by collaborative filtering the collaborative filtering determining that a user who is purchasing a primary offer  having “marcus miller” in the target data eg an mp file featuring marcus miller may be interested in a transaction offer  having “victor wooten” in the target data eg subscribing to victor wootens promotional mailing list in still another example and also without limitation the target data may include a threshold shopping cart value eg  and the user data may include the total cost of all items in the users online shopping cart eg  in this example the target data and the user data may be associated in that the total cost of all items in the users online shipping cart exceeds the threshold shopping cart value it will be understood that a variety of correlations between the target data and the user data are possibleas a result of a committed transaction or intent to purchase a product through an electronic transaction the purchaser may receive a transaction offer the transaction offer may be based on the instantaneous transactional content that may include the information related to the purchaser at the time of transaction or generally associated with the purchaser the transactional content may include a credit card number an address location the url used for making the transaction the country of transaction or some other type of attributes entered by the purchaser while conducting the transaction in contrast to conventional advertisement and offer targeting which may associate user preferences or history with demographic data to determine potentially relevant offers or advertisements a transaction offer can take advantage of extensive specific information that is only available in connection with the transaction while conventional offer matching methods may recognize a user history that includes a type of credit card that a user may have provided in the past a transaction offer can be based on the card being used in the current transaction and important information related to the card such as approval status of the card in the current transaction other information may include the actual shipping address of the current transaction rather than a general localization offered by internet service providers based on an ip address of a users computer transaction specific information may include descriptions of items actually being purchased rather than items that may have been added to an electronic shopping cart that was discarded in one example the purchaser may commit to purchasing a rolex watch using a visa credit card which may result in a transaction offer that the user may find to be complimentary such as a discount for watch repair services another immediate transaction specific context for offer selection may include the transaction amount by applying a threshold comparison to the instant transaction amount transaction offers may be selectable based on the transaction exceeding the thresholdthe platform may implement one or more algorithms rules procedures programs and the like to ensure that the transactional offers are not annoying or disruptive for the client and also protects the business interest of the merchant conventional electronic shopping offer methods and systems often rely on the preferences or behaviors of other users to present items to add to an existing shopping transaction these offers can often be disruptive because although they may be related to an item being added to an electronic shopping cart they are not well related to the current transaction andor userspecific aspects of the current transaction similarly merchants using the transaction offer methods and systems as described herein want to make valuable offers to their customers while protecting their own business interests in this way an online vendor of watches may not want to offer a customer a discount for a purchase of a watch at a competitor however as described in the example above watch repair or restoration services may complement the online watch retailers offerings and therefore may make for a potentially valuable and highly relevant transaction offerselection of a transaction offer may be based partially on the instantaneous transactional content as well as one or more attributes of the purchaser without deviating from the scope and spirit of the invention for example the transaction offer may be provided based on the credit card used by the purchaser at the time of purchase and the purchase history of the purchaserthe transactional offer may be associated with the type of transaction and the amount of transaction apart from other parameters examples of transaction types may include mode of payment ie credit card echeck electronic fund transfer debit card electronic purse and the like additional information associated with the mode of payment may influence the selection of offer for example the name of the bank and the type of credit card platinum gold or silver that the purchaser is holding may directly be correlated to the offer in another example the type of card and the purchase amount may influence the transaction offer in addition the transaction offer may be based on shipping address for example the shipping address may include zip code country code town state locality and the like the purchaser may accumulate products in the shopping cart with an intention to purchase them or in the process of making a transaction in this scenario the transaction offer presented to the purchaser may be partially or completely based on the shopping cart in another scenario the purchaser may be registered with the primary merchant the primary merchant may issue an alpha numeric code to the purchaser which the purchaser may enter at the time of the transaction to validate the relationship claim with the primary merchant alternatively the purchaser may be registered with the online site provider who may in turn validate the purchasers relationships with merchants via a database that maintains such data accordingly the transaction offer may be presented in correlation with the purchasers relationship with the primary merchantin embodiments the transaction offer presented to the purchaser may depend upon the transaction status intermediate states may include payment credited payment approved for crediting payment promised but not initiated or any other type of intermediate state for example the transaction offer may differ based on the state of transaction in addition the time and date of the year may also influence the transaction offer presented to the purchaser it may be noted that the disclosed method and system may present transaction offers that depend on the current transaction and may not be based on keyword search product comparison client recommendation product ratings blogs recommendations or some other type of parametersin embodiments the transaction offers presented to the purchaser may benefit both the merchants and the purchasers the merchants may advertise their products by offering free trial in anticipation of increasing sales the purchasers would benefit from it by availing free trial of product or by accepting the free discount available to themat step  the transaction offers  selected for presentation to the user  are presented to the user  in some embodiments these transaction offers  are provided to the user  as a more or less integral part of a checkout experience associated with the online shopping cart containing the primary offer it will be understood that a variety of embodiments are possible for providing these transaction offers  to the user for example and without limitation when the user  selects the checkout option on the online shopping cart the user  may be presented with a confirmation page showing the contents of the shopping cart the confirmation page may include a user interface element labeled “for an extra  add a  gift certificate to charlies kitchen to your order a  value for only ” alternatively or additionally the confirmation page may also include a message that reads “text ‘go charlie’ to short code  to add the gift certificate to your order now” in this example the transaction offer offeror  may be a restaurant named charlies kitchen the transaction offer  may be a  gift certificate to charlies kitchen the gift certificate priced at  the target data may include the  zip code the zip code in which charlies kitchen resides and the user data may include  a zip code in the vicinity of at step  the user  may accept the transaction offer  by responding to it in some embodiments responding to the transaction offer  may involve selecting a userinterface element provided to the user  during the checkout experience continuing with the previous example without limitation the user  may click on the userinterface element also continuing with the previous example without limitation the user  may text the string ‘go charlie’ to short code  it will be understood that a variety of methods for responding to the transaction offers  are possiblethen at step  the user  may receive the accepted transaction offer from offeror  accepting the transaction offer may result in the transaction offer offeror  receiving information about the user  that allows the transaction offer offeror  to begin a business relationship with the user  to maintain the business relationship with the user  to conduct a transaction with the user  any and all combinations of the foregoing and the likeas described herein and elsewhere the user  may accept the transaction by accepting the transaction the user  may avail the free transaction offer without any obligation to use the offer the transaction offer may be in the form of a digital instrument or a physical instrument digital instruments may include electronic coupons ecash echeck a digital certificate a digital code or some other type of digital instrument similarly the transaction in the form of a

mailer or some other type of physical instrumentsin embodiments the user may receive a transaction offer in the form of an electronic coupon electronic coupons may be stored locally or may be provided through a reference location in the network electronic coupons may provide an advantage in that they may include the capability to be organized in different ways such as date of receipt expiry date vendor or manufacture and the like the electronic coupon may include the capability to refresh periodically or may offer discounts based on the total amount of purchase made by the user  the user  may periodically receive electronic coupons based on past purchases or based on the user information user information may include age address profession credit card number email id and the like in another embodiment the user may receive a transaction offer through email an attachment may be provided with the email that can be utilized to avail the offer associated with it while making an online purchase in another embodiment the user  may download a small program that may be executed on the user device such as a mobile phone a pda a computer a laptop a palmtop and the like that may periodically pop information regarding various transaction offer opportunitiesin embodiments the transaction offer may be in the form of an echeck that the buyer may offer as a gift for the last transaction for example as a result of the transactions the user  may be offered a paypal echeck that can be credited to the users account without any obligation paypal may promote this echeck to the user  by providing the user with a free trail without any obligation to enroll for echeck services with paypal in this example the user  was provided with paypal echeck since the user  had used the paypal service for purchasing goods therefore the transaction offer is not disruptive in embodiments the transaction offer may be in the form of a digital certificate that may be exchanged in the next purchase without any obligation to buy or make the next purchase the digital certificate may be stored in the user s device or may be stored in the form of a cookie in the browser and may be automatically instantiated at the time of purchase in another embodiment the digital certificate may be delivered to the email address of the user in embodiments the transaction offer may be in the

discount on the purchase of a cake on june  the platform  may access user information after or during the transaction and associate this information to the transaction offer being made to the user  in the above example the platform determined that june  happened to be an anniversary of the user  in embodiments the transaction offer may be a physical instrument that may be in the form of a physical product such as a free product or a service for example a user  may be provided with a free air ticket in the delivery of an item purchased in a transactionit will be understood that a variety of embodiments of the engagement are possible for example and without limitation in some embodiments the engagement may involve providing to the user  information associated with the transaction offer offeror  andor the transaction offer  in some embodiments the engagement may involve the user  providing information to the transaction offer offeror  in some embodiments the engagement may involve the user  giving permission to the facilitator  to release to the transaction offer offeror  information relating to the user  in some embodiments the engagement may involve providing an incentive or enticement to the user  in exchange for the users providing information to the transaction offer offeror  in some embodiments the incentive or enticement may without limitation comprise a cash payment a credit incentive points eg frequent flier miles or the like any and all combinations of the foregoing or the likeupon completion of the engagement the facilitator  may credit the merchant as shown in step  the user may receive a benefit as shown in step  the facilitator  may retain a credit as shown in step  and the facilitator  may debit the transaction offer offeror the debit applied to the transaction offer offeror  may be a function of an aspect of the engagement in some embodiments the aspect of the engagement may be a type or extent of the engagement may influence the debit it will be understood that a variety of aspects and functions may be possiblethe credit provided to the merchant and the credit retained by the facilitator  may each be a portion of the debit to the transaction offer offeror  additionally or alternatively the user  may pay an engagement fee to the facilitator  the facilitator  may retain part of the engagement fee and distribute part of the engagement fee to the primary offeror the user benefit may include or be associated with the transaction offer  in some embodiments the benefit may include a coupon a frequent flier mile cash or cash back advertising or promotional content a prospect of exclusive deals and the likethroughout the merchant transaction the facilitator  may act on behalf of the primary offeror  the facilitators  actions may be associated with providing andor enabling the merchant transaction between the user  and the primary offeror  additionally the facilitators actions may be associated with providing andor enabling the engagement between the user  and the transaction offer offeror in some embodiments the facilitator  may provide an online shopping cart andor checkout sequence that enables the merchant transaction between the primary offeror  and the user in some embodiments primary offeror  may provide its own online shopping cart andor checkout sequence systems providing the primary offerors online shopping cart andor checkout sequence may communicate with the facilitator  via systemtosystem calls these calls may be enabled by an api sdk software plugin or the like offers or advertisements could be presented through the merchants shopping cartcheckout interface facilitated by the api and the like the api sdk software plugin or the like could embody any portion of the platform functionality in an example an online retailer may already use an existing shopping cart platform such as a proprietary platform or a commercial thirdparty platform to process payments in this example the traditional shopping cart platform may provide certain benefits to the retailer such as tight integration with inventory systems in this example the retailer can take advantage of the blended transaction capability of the transactional offer platform  through use of software such as the api which can add the blended payments capability to the existing traditional shopping cart platform by incorporating programming in the retailer checkout system that supports a functional interface with the platform  for offer selection presentation and fulfillment the retailer can process the users primary purchase through their system while gaining the advantages that the transactional offer platform  provides through blended andor transactional offer transactions further in this example a user of the retailer purchase system may be offered through the api interface an option to accept a coupon for a discount at another retailer if the user accepts the coupon can be delivered to the user by the platform  while the user completes the item purchase from the retailer because the advertisementoffer targeting facilities of the platform have determined that the user meets an acceptability criteria for the coupon the vendor or advertiser providing the coupon to be offered to the user pays the platform for among other things proper delivery of the coupon to the user the foregoing example shows how an apibased embodiment of the methods and systems of the transactional offer platform  provides essentially the same benefits to a user a merchant an advertiser the platform facilitator and the like as providing the full payment transaction through the platform in another example a user makes an online purchase of music with a total transaction amount of  the online music retailer uses the api interface of the platform  and provides context of the transaction to the platform through the api the platform determines using the offer optimization and targeting capabilities herein described that the user making this transaction is a good customer for a high end outdoor adventure clothing retailer and presents a discount coupon for a future purchase at the high end outdoor adventure clothing retailer to the user during the purchase transaction if the user accepts the offer the coupon may be added at no cost to the users list of items being purchased during the transaction for fulfilling the identification offers presentation and proper delivery of the coupon the outdoor clothing retailer pays the platform a fee similar to an advertising delivery fee at the conclusion of the blended transaction the user has received a free coupon along with the selected music for  without having to take on any obligation to use the coupon or visit the outdoor clothing retailerfig  shows a flow diagram  of a method of the engagement in some embodiments the method may be directed at selling a customerengagement to an advertiser and enabling that advertiser to own whatever customer information may be gathered during the course of the engagementthe engagement may begin as shown in step  as shown in step  the facilitator  andor the transaction offer offeror  may receive a fee from the user  while an engagement fee step is shown in the flow diagram of fig  step  may be optional alternatively the engagement fee may be a symbolic commitment that indicates the users willingness to engage in transaction offers the user may agree to be charged the fee but based on the result of the offer process the user may not actually be charged the fee alternatively the fee may be returned to the user upon completion of the offer processas shown in step  the facilitator  andor the transaction offer offeror  may provide information from the transaction offer offeror  to the user  the information relating to the transaction offer  in a purchase transaction embodiment the offer may be presented to the user at various points in time during the purchase transaction process as described herein a plurality of transaction offers  may be aggregated organized ordered andor visually arranged by the platform  to be presented to the user as shown in step  the facilitator  andor the transaction offer offeror  may receive user information such as from the user  this information may be associated with establishing andor maintaining a business relationship between the user  and the transaction offer offeror  this information may be associated with enabling a transaction between the user  and the transaction offer offeror  the information having been received by the facilitator  may then be provided to the transaction offer offeror  by the facilitator  and vice versa the user information or information related to the specific usertransaction may be provided by the merchant  to the platform  the facilitator  or the transaction offer offeror as shown in step  the facilitator  andor the transaction offer offeror  may compensate the user for participating in the engagement in some embodiments this compensation may take the form of cash merchandise services rewards points any and all combinations of the foregoing and the like the user compensation may be a credit against a form of payment used by the user in the current merchant purchase transaction because the user may be known to the platform  all of the information about the user that is known to the platform may be used to determine the user compensation therefore the user compensation may be based on a plurality of transactions or engagements between the user and the platform it will be understood that a variety of embodiments are possibleas shown in step  the facilitator  may execute a purchase transaction in which the user  purchases the transaction offer  in some embodiments the transaction offer  may include a product andor a service in some embodiments some or all of the information relating to the purchase transaction may be shared between the facilitator  and the transaction offer offeror  but may or may not be shared with the primary offeror  the user supplied form of payment may be charged for the merchant product or

embodiments a transaction fee may be associated with any and all of the transactions for example and without limitation the transaction offer offeror  may pay a transaction fee to the facilitator  as part of the purchase transactionin some embodiments a transaction payment may be associated with any and all of the transactions for example and without limitation the primary offeror  may receive a transaction payment from the facilitator  as part of the merchant transactionthe embodiment of the method of the engagement may then conclude as shown in step referring to fig  a user account  that may belong to a user is shown on a platform  the user may receive one or more transaction offers  for example discount coupons for a day free trial with lifelock  off on the next purchase of  at a chinese laundry the user  may use these coupons based on the availability and the transaction offer in embodiments there may be many transaction offer offerors  interested in acquiring users  who are alternatively purchasing one or more of the primary offers  with the specified aspects therefore the transactional offer platform  may enable transaction offer offerors  to request promotion placement pricing and the like collectively referred to herein simply as “placement” of their transaction offers  to high quality users  such placement may be associated with positioning one transaction offer  in relation to another transaction offer  providing one transaction offer  instead of another transaction offer  modifying a look feel price or other elements of a transaction offer  such as and without limitation to improve the appearance andor allure of one transaction offer  as compared with another and so on transaction offer offerors  may include a bid in association with a transaction offer  placement request the offer bidding module  may determine which transaction offer  is selected based at least in part on the bid in an example credit card vendors such as discover card visa master card and the like may be willing to pay more to acquire a customer alternatively purchasing a zagatcom subscription than a customer alternatively purchasing winzip perhaps because the purchase of a subscription to zagatcom as opposed to a purchase of winzip naturally leads to additional purchases such as for restaurant visits for which using a credit card may be a preferred method of payment additionally or alternatively such a customer ie a user  may have income or spending habits that would highly benefit a credit card vendor this aspect of the transactional offer platform  which a customer marketplace may encompass may allow transaction offer offerors  to bid on users  who are performing live transaction offer transactions rather than soft leadsfig  depicts the screen showing the status of the transaction offer  in embodiments the user  may check the status of the transaction offer  online for example the user  may have purchased a primary offering as part of the primary offering the user  may have received one or more transaction offers  such as the “discover open road card” offer the embodiment of fig  provides an example of a user having accepted an offer  that has not yet been fully completed however the platform  may have debited an advertiser when the transaction offer was presented and may again have debited the advertiser when the user accepted the credit card offer it is conceivable that the platform  would again debit the advertiser once the user receives approval of the exemplary credit card the embodiment of fig  may also depict a transaction offer screen in which a user has just accepted one transaction offer and additional transaction offers are presented the user  may check the status of these offers online that are displayed on the platform  in addition the user  may view the various other transaction offer  availablereferring to figs  through  which depict various embodiments of transactional offer and transactional offer invitation placements in a primary transaction environment a transactional offer may be fully integrated with a primary offeror website electronic transaction shopping cart and the likefig  depicts a primary offeror web page with an embodiment of the invention users may be informed of transactional advertisements to facilitate planning their purchases with the merchant a primary offeror web page  may include merchant information  and an invitation  for a transactional offer the invitation  may include conditions of the transactional offer that may help a user of the merchant site plan for an electronic transaction which may include a transaction offerfig  depicts an exemplary web browser display of a detailed description of a transactional offer a user may visit the web page of fig  or any other web page that may display an invitation to a transactional offer and interact with the invitation  so that details  andor expanded details  may be displayed the transactional offer  andor expanded details  may facilitate a user determining if a transaction offer is right for him the user may also learn that the transactional offer while being contingent on a completed electronic transaction with the merchant does not obligate the user to any other action or financial commitmentfig  depicts a transactional offer invitation placement on a product page in which a user may be reminded of a transactional offer to help the user to make a purchase decision with the merchant primary vendor web page  may include product information and an invitation  to select a transactional offer that may be presented at the completion of an electronic transaction with the primary vendor the invitation may be adjusted based on the methods and systems described herein to reflect a status of the transaction the user shopping cart contents advertiser anticipated payout and the like the user may also choose to view transactional offer details  or expanded details  as shown in fig  continued visualization of transactional offers and invitations for transactional offers within a primary vendors web pages reinforces the transactional offer as an integral part of the primary vendors electronic transaction environment such placement may also strengthen brand association between the primary vendor and the transactional offer such placement may provide the user with confidence that the transactional offer is endorsed by andor supported by the primary offeror in this way transactional offer invitations may be differentiated from conventional banner or popup advertisements that may be keyword basedfigs  and  depict checkout web page embodiments of a transactional offer invitation in the embodiment of fig  the user may be presented with a checkout page  that includes an optout transactional offer invitation  for one or more transactional offers because the transactional offer may be provided to the user for no cost or obligation to the user an ‘optout’ type invitation  may provide the user with an easier checkout because the user does not have to take an action to explicitly include the transactional offer with the electronic transaction even though the user may be presented with two transaction offer invitations not opting out of both may not result in the user receiving both although the user may receive both the user may alternatively receive the most appropriate offer based on information associated with the transactionfig  depicts a checkout page similar to the embodiment of fig  and includes a checkout page  however in contrast with the optout invitation  of fig  the embodiment of fig  includes an optin transactional offer invitation  that the user must explicitly select to “add” the transactional offer to the electronic transaction if the user does not explicitly add the transactional offer to the electronic transaction the user may again be presented with the offer or another offer at the completion of the electronic transaction however explicitly selecting the transaction offer during the checkout process may streamline the electronic transaction confirmation process because the user has already selected to receive a transaction offer even though the user may be presented with two transaction offer invitations opting in to both may not result in the user receiving both although the user may receive both the user may alternatively receive the most appropriate offer based on information associated with the transactionfig  depicts a transactional offer in an electronic transaction confirmation page if the user optedin or did not optout of the transaction offer during the checkout process as described for figs  and  the electronic transaction confirmation page may include a confirmation of the transaction offer that the user included in her shopping cart the user may receive the transaction offer via an email or other contact means provided by the user as part of the electronic transaction checkout process alternatively the user may not have included any transaction offer with his electronic transaction and he may be presented with one or more transaction offers  that he may optionally acceptall of the elements of the transaction offer platform  may be depicted throughout the figures with respect to logical boundaries between the elements according to
