portfoliosmarketplacethe insiders forumsummarytoday we look at a small biotech concern with recent insider buying versartis is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical concern focused on novel endocrinal treatments its twice monthly rhgh therapy should greatly increase patient adherence to protocol over the current daily injection paradigm leading to greater patient outcomes trials to date for its lead product candidate have shown good promise and if approved it could garner significant market share in a lucrative niche market we hang the petty thieves and appoint the great ones to public office  aesop join me at the diy investor summit that commenced yesterday and lasts all this week i will share detailed tips on my core investment strategies top advice for diy investors and specific ways im positioning my portfolio for  piper jaffray came out late last week and reiterated its outperform rating and  price target on versartis jaffrays also called the company a top pick heading into key phase iii trial results that should be out in the third quarter despite a market capitalization north of  million this name gets relatively little analyst attention piper was only the fifth analyst firm to provide ratings on versartis over the last year this is a name i recently picked up a small stake in as i think its deserves consideration within a welldiversified biotech portfolio it also has had some notable insider buying within it stock recently given this i am going repost a recent exclusive deep dive analysis that was done within the insider forum for the larger seekingalpha community start of article company overview versartis inc nasdaqvsar is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company based in menlo park ca founded in december  and publicly traded since march  versartis is a promising single product play focusing on human growth hormone deficiencies in children and adults the result of these deficiencies include short stature skeletal issues poor body mass index impaired growth of skeletal muscles along with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular consequences in adults  all of which lead to shorter life expectancy the stock has a market capitalization of approximately  million and trades just under  a share which is near its week high market for recombinant human growth hormone rhgh the current market for rhgh therapies is approximately  billion the frequency of pediatric growth hormone deficiency  is approximately  in  and  in  for adult ghd pghd is approximately  of the rhgh market adult ghd idiopathic short stature turner syndrome and small for gestational age comprise approximately another  of the market current rhgh regimen the current rhgh regimen calls for a daily injection that can take up to one hour this  day a year treatment can last seven or more years for children there are many drug companies servicing this space with novo nordisk nysenvo norditropin and pfizer nysepfe genotropin accounting for  billion in  sales the opportunity with painful daily injections that can take up to an hour due to twenty or more preparatory steps adherence to the treatment protocol is difficult to maintain as a result of this administrative burden two out of three patients miss more than one injection per week nonadherence is significant in that missing two injections a week can mean treatment failure to address this noncompliance issue vsar has developed somavaratan vrs which is a longacting form of rhgh the halflife of somavaratan is  hours versus  to  hours for the daily rhgh solutions on the market vsar achieved this longacting rhgh by adding two amino acid chains one long tail   aas  and one short tail   aas to the hormone these chains do not confer structure but add molecular weight the long tail amino acid chain reduces kidney filtration while the short tail reduces receptor binding thus keeping the rhgh in the system much longer as a result of this longer halflife injections are reduced to twice monthly with an autoinjector resulting in greater adherence additionally the product is about fifty times less potent than daily injectables thus providing a consistent effective dosing somavaratan can be stored at room temperature as opposed to the refrigeration required for most daily rhgh products versartis believes that the longacting nature of somavartan will increase the rhgh market from  billion to  billion based on greater compliance and the addition of previously untreated patients electing the more convenient therapy the catalyst trial results so far the trials have shown great promise from efficacy safety and adherence standpoints there are currently four pediatric trials ongoing or planned in the united states and japan as well as one adult trial  vista phase  extension study this pghd trial is entering its fourth year the positive results from this trial have led to phase  initiation and enrollment  velocity phase  enrollment is for this multinational pghd study is complete with topline data due in q  this trial should be sufficient as a basis for approval in the us eu and canada  switch study this will familiarize physicians with moving patients off daily rhgh regimens onto twice monthly somavaratan  jvts this japanese pghd study has completed phase  phase  has been initiated japan accounts for  of all pghd cases worldwide  vital adult study phase a has been completed with phase  initiation planned for  in totality over  children are included in the various pediatric trials all data to this point has suggested that twice monthly somavaratan is as efficacious  not only with observational data related to high velocity and bone density but also for surrogate marker insulinlike growth factor  igf  as the daily regimens it has also shown to be welltolerated with no adverse sideeffects the company expects to file a bla in early  strategic partnerships on august   versartis announced a strategic alliance with teijin limited to commercialize somavaratan in japan as part of the agreement the company received  million up front and has potential development regulatory and sales milestones totaling  million it will also receive significant running royalty and transfer pricing based upon net sales in japan teijin is the th largest japanese drug concern in terms of sales in the united states versartis has no strategic partners and may try to go it alone as the medical professionals who prescribe rhgh is relatively focused on the other side of the coin versartis licenses much of its technologyip from amunix including  patents that will expire between  and  versartis is actually a development spinout from amunix as part of the licensing agreement amunix can receive up to  million in milestone payments and  royalties on versartis first two products higher royalties are paid on any additional products the company states that somavaratan will be patent protected until  potential competition to be sure there are other companies attempting to produce a longacting rhgh for pediatric use including ascendis nasdaqasnd opko health nysemktopkpfizer critical therapeutics and novo nordisk however all of their products appear inferior in terms of either injection frequencies or projected entry into the market being firsttomarket with a twice monthly product before others weekly products should provide a huge competitive advantage for the firm relevant financials the company just executed a secondary offering on september   that netted it  million exclusive of the secondary it exited the third quarter with  million in cash assuming a burn rate of  million per quarter vsar should have enough cash to get it to mid management has suggested that a european partnership is possible after the release of phase  data in q which would provide additional cash before going to market institutional sponsorship and insider buying nothing is as sure thing but based on the institutional sponsorship if we are wrong on versartis we will be in good company the stock is  institutionally owned and perceptive advisors just added  shares   to its four million share position in late december perceptive fmr aisling capital baker brothers and new leaf collectively own  of the company nine hedge funds initiated positions in q bringing the total to fifteen director akkaraju srinivas purchase  million of the stock on the september  secondary at  other notes the company is currently followed by six analyst firms with five buys and one hold rating the current median price target on vsar is  a share approximately  the current price of the stock despite it sitting near week highs credit suisse was the last analyst firm to chime in on december th it upgraded the shares to a buy with a  price target outlook i prefer to have more shots on goal in the developmental space before making a small investment in this sort of concern however with a novel and very likely firsttomarket product featuring a more tolerable administration to a rhgh regimen that hasnt changed much in forty years versartis is likely to eventually gain a significant foothold in what is a  billion to  billion market even though the stock has had a significant run in the second half of  it still could have room to rally if it continues to make progress developing its lead drug it is wellfunded for the time being has upcoming milestones and insiders seem to believe it still has further upside i added a few shares in vsar earlier this week and have it on my watch list i offer it up via this analysis for investment consideration end of article note dont forget to register for the st annual seeking alpha online investing summit that kicked off yesterday and lasts all week  of the top contributors here on seeking
