targeted audiences to their ad network based on a user’s location beacon interactions and installed applications reveal mobile requires an account with the reveal system and a valid api key click here to sign up for an api key and use sdkrevealmobilecom reveal mobile ios sdk version  published  reveal mobile is a native mobile sdk that allows developers to provide tailored personas to their ad network based on a user’s location beacon interactions and installed applications swift note the prebuilt framework version does not support swift due to legacy compatibility constraints the easiest way to use the framework in swift is to install from cocoapods we can provide prebuilt framework versions supporting ios  only if cocoapod installation is not suitable for your implementation a note about our use of background modes in order to detect ibeacons we follow apple’s documentation for uibackgroundmodes in order to detect eddystone beacons which can’t use the ibeacon methods we follow apple’s documentation for using bluetoothcentral our customers use both ibeacon and eddystone formats so we must use both approaches in order to save battery life all bluetooth related scanning is only turned on after all startup tasks are finished and then only in short intervals we only use bluetoothcentral for beacon detection to tailor locationbased content and advertising and do not use it to connect to other bluetooth devices usage simple setup objectivec import revealrevealh  setup the reveal mobile sdk pointed at production with no debug features reveal thesdk  reveal sharedinstance

permission requests targeting sdk   only in apps targeting android sdk level  and above  developers must explicitly request permissions from the user that android deems “dangerous” such as location

suggest following android’s guide to request permissions and handle the results here httpdeveloperandroidcomtrainingpermissionsrequestinghtml the reveal sdk will function if location access is denied
