pleasureinvestor and advisory board memberpeeraspectoctober  – present  monthsbaltimore maryland areawe are the creators of sheets by peeraspect the worlds most advanced and friendliest software for collecting and managing supply chain dataorganizations around the world are faced with an evergrowing need to collect send and manage data whether it is for compliance with regulations or adherence to voluntary standards all players in the st century economy increasingly deal in data but the tools most of us have been using to collect this data are crude and illsuited to the task in most cases companies create surveys in programs like excel and word which they then email back and forth this makes it difficult to track versions or have coherent conversations about the contents of the documents leading users to waste time digging through emails for important informationonline surveys are an improvement but they tend to lack the kinds of compliance tools needed to verify the data some examples include the ability to attach documentation to specific data points or to set automatic or manual compliance checks on individual questions or entire surveysadditionally surveys are static once theyre sent and responded to you need to send a whole new one if you want to change or add to it  even if it means asking many of the same questions over and over again sheets by peeraspect are living surveys that change as data needs evolve for example data collected for compliance with regulations in europe can be applied to similar compliance programs in other countries eliminating the need to send multiple redundant surveys to suppliers they have builtin tracking and communications tools meaning youll stop spending time searching through emails and folders for the information you need and instead put it to work for you  the very reason you collect it in the first placesheets are easy and fun to use secure and save our clients time and money contact us for a
