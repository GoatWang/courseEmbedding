nothing more nothing less it lets you order complete meals with a single tap chosen specifically for you thanks to its unique algorithms you save time energy and get a consistently delicious variety of meals  so you can stop spending time wondering what to eat and start actually eating lightbulboutlinewhy pander personpersonalized doneallsimple updateadaptive settingscustomizable why build pander online food ordering is broken sure there are hundreds thousands of restaurants you can choose from  but what good is that you dont have time to read hundreds of menus so you settle and go back to that same justbarelygoodenough meal you get every day we think theres a better way thats why we built pander from beginning to end pander is about giving you a simple personalized experience  without sacrificing choice so stop spending time digging through lists when what you really want to be doing is digging into the perfect meal picked just for you start being pandered to personalized for you you have unique tastes we understand that  which is why pander isnt just some list of dishes we think most people would like instead when you first set up pander well ask you a couple of questions about what kinds of food you enjoy from there our unique algorithms get to work every time you pull up pander well show you options you might like  pasta maybe or perhaps seafood each option will be tailored to fit your palate so that youre not wasting time looking at dishes that you dont feel like eating simple straightforward stressfree ordering isnt the important part  eating is so we built pander to be simple and efficient letting you order a meal as easily as possible from the list of options we show you all you have to do is tap on one that looks good well then take care of all the busywork  well check the restaurants that are open for delivery and pick a good one well analyze their menu to build you a great meal and well make sure everything fits within your budget even if there are delivery charges or minimum order sizes to worry about once thats handled well show you the full meal weve put together to look over you can confirm with another tap  and thats it well place the order  you can just sit back and wait for your food to arrive adaptable  intelligent pander will improve with every meal we think we can do a pretty good job of finding food for you based on the initial questions we ask  but you cant always learn everything right away so pander will always be on the lookout for ways to get smarter maybe you like some cuisines for lunch but not dinner makes sense pander will make a note of it maybe you generally like a cuisine but really arent a fan of a couple of common dishes well keep that in mind and if you want you can speed the process up  youll have the opportunity to rate every order you place so we can understand if some restaurants or dishes just arent quite cutting it for you customize every detail you can control every part of your pander experience should we order you dessert and a drink with your meal jump into the settings and let us know want to control how much tip to include with every order go for it  well include that amount by default so you dont have to look for change when the food shows up do you want to be able to edit on a dishbydish basis the meals we suggest to you maybe switch out the appetizer for something else but keep the rest of what weve picked you can do that too dive in and tweak pander to your hearts content  we want pander to fit into your lifestyle not make you change to work around it and stay tuned  we have plenty more options for you to play with coming soon get started android web connect facebook instagram twitter supported locations pander is currently available in most
