august    pm  rebecca jones launched in  blackrock frontiers investment trust has notched up some impressive returns during its short life over three years the trust has returned nearly  per cent close to four times that of its sector it global emerging market equities while over one year it has returned  per centin many respects this is a remarkable recovery for a trust that in its first year of launch lost over  per cent on a total return basis however comanagers sam vecht and emily fletcher have more than proved themselves since then and the trust now boasts one of the lowest volatility scores of any blackrock equity fundvecht an emerging and frontier markets specialist with nearly  years of experience investing in the region attributes the trusts remarkable stability in no small part to the uncorrelated nature of frontier marketsits low volatility is not because frontier markets arent risky  i must stress that  its because when you put nigeria together with saudi arabia together with argentina together with vietnam they dont move togetheryou may argue that the us japan and brazil dont have much in common but i can tell you when the sp  is down  per cent they all move down together these frontier markets have their own totally different investors he saysvaluation valuation valuationat the launch of the trust some of vechts favoured investments included holdings in nigerian banks like zenith bank which remains a top  holding towards the end of  nearly  per cent of blackrock frontiers was invested in nigerian financials and vecht saw his conviction pay dividends as share prices rocketedhowever as shares reached their target price vecht and fletcher reduced their holdings significantly despite the firms still trading well and nigerian banks now account for around  per cent of the trust this disciplined approach is characteristic of vecht who is by any estimation a true value investornot all of these countries are going to be attractive all of the time and the principal reason is not because there is a war going on or whatever the biggest issue is that of valuation and its something people forget time and time again explains the frank nononsense managervaluation was also the principal driver behind vechts decision to exit his holdings in qatar and the united arab emirates uae some three months before they were promoted from frontier to emerging market status which would naturally exclude them from the trustinitially this seemed to be the wrong move as qatar and the uae continued to trade upwards however upon their promotion at the end of may they plummeted some  per cent with individual stocks losing up to  per cent as vecht predicted emerging market investors were less inclined to pour money into grossly overvalued assetsdespite his focus on valuation however vecht does not entirely dismiss political and structural issues within frontier markets insisting that investors should always be comfortable with the macro economic situation before they begin looking at the micro not least due to the formers bearing on currency movementshowever using nigeria as an example  which currently faces a significant threat from domestic terrorist organisation boko haram  he insists that it is important to put the macro into contextone has to be fully aware of the risks investing in a country like nigeria that has violence in the north which is a humanitarian tragedy but is not particularly relevant for the economy as its not a particularly developed area he saysnew opportunitiestoday vecht and fletchers portfolio looks very different to three years ago with less emphasis on nigeria and the middle east and investments spread a little further through the frontier market universewhile the trusts top regional weighting remains nigeria at just over  per cent its second largest weighting is now in kuwait which accounts for over  per cent of the fundunsurprisingly this is not a regional call rather vecht and fletcher have invested heavily in two kuwaiti companies they see particular value in mobile telecommunications otherwise known as zain and kuwait food  their top holding at over  per cent of the trustkuwait food also known as americana group operates fast food franchises including kfc and pizza hut in the middle east and north africa at the moment the  billion £ billion firm is reportedly being approached by us and ukbased private equity companies interested in a leveraged buyout a mouthwatering prospect for early adopters like vecht and fletcherweve always liked this stock because it has a fabulous franchising footprint across the middle east it is rumoured that the controlling shareholder has an interest in selling thats not why we own the stock but its interesting to see private equity firms interested in it vecht saysbangladesh is a relatively new addition a region vecht was reluctant to buy into three years ago again due to markets being overvalued since then however markets have halved in value and vechts enthusiasm on the countrys growth prospects means over  per cent of the portfolio is now invested therethe region is also the trusts largest overweight compared to its benchmark the msci frontier index of which bangladesh accounts for less than  per centlooking ahead vecht says that he expects to see the portfolio continually evolve and shift unafraid as he and fletcher are to make changes as when they see an opportunitywe started off with pretty much nothing in bangladesh pakistan vietnam and sri lanka  perhaps  per cent between the four  whereas today they account for around  per cent so these opportunities do arisei would expect that we will have more in argentina in a years time if there is some political change there  a change in prime minister or a change in its approach to foreign investment  that would be a very interesting marketfor more information on the blackrock frontiers investment trust see our money observer fund factsheet you can
