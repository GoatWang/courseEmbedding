minute read managing mergers will aberdeen asset management – standard life go through winners and losers    july       minute read managing mergers will aberdeen asset management – standard life go through managing mergers will aberdeen asset management – standard life go through the competition and markets authority cma is a nonministerial government department that ensures markets function well for consumers businesses and the economy the cma’s mission is to observe situations where there is a chance of unfair treatment or market problems one of its key responsibilities is to investigate mergers in the uk note that the cma does not assess all mergers some are assessed by the european commission particularly mergers of businesses within the eu or ones with global revenues above a certain threshold a more focused change the cma is reducing the number of mergers it investigates in smaller markets only important enough merger references will be warranted  the figure for markets has been raised to over £m from over £m also the figure for markets considered not important enough to warrant a merger reference has been raised from below £m to below £m what does this mean sheldon mills senior director of mergers at the cma said “it’s important that we focus our resources on those mergers with the most potential to harm customers” the number of investigations will particularly reduce mergers where the cost is not worth the effect it has on the market this means the cma will become more cost and time effective placing more focus on the mergers of larger businesses which bear more risk smaller businesses will merge more easily without losing a lot of revenue paying legal fees the larger combined company should deliver a better financial performance for the shareholders and greater performance in the markets through synergy  economies of scale however there is always a risk of failure when considering the culture clash and the integration the operations of two businesses which is why only around  of ma deals are successful overall despite this by allowing smaller businesses to merge the cma will give them the opportunity to dominate their sector and have fewer rivals a promising merger the cma investigated the desired merger on  may  it cleared it’s phase  investigation on  june  but has yet to clear the phase  investigation by  july  once the deal is completed standard life aberdeen plc is set to trade on lse th august  speculation was rife on the th of june after it was released that  of standard life and  of aberdeen asset management shareholders voted to approve the merger this caused aberdeen asset management’s stock price to fall which indicated uncertainty amongst investors despite the approval of shareholders a possible reason for this is that standard life shareholders would own  percent of the combined firm this means that aberdeen shareholders’ stock is worth significantly less hence the plummet in stock price after the deal closes investor confidence should increase and so the share price of the combined entity should subsequently increase particularly after simon troughton chairman of aberdeen said “this deal opens up significant opportunities across all facets of aberdeen’s business and is an important step towards realising the company’s ambition of creating a worldclass investment business with a truly global footprint” the above quote highlights the main reason why mergers occur it allows two companies to combine their strengths have a larger market share and greater dominance in the investment sector the merger between standard life and aberdeen asset management is an instance where this will hopefully hold conclusion mergers are made to please shareholders and generate more revenue many mergers have succeeded like orange  tmobile  while others have failed aol  time warner  the cma is the first hurdle that merging companies must pass the cma’s assessment ensures that mergers do not gravely decrease competition and lead to worse outcomes for consumers later further complications may arise such as a culture clash  failure to integrate operations  however if these problems are resolved the merged business should have a brighter future in the financial market get articles like this straight to your inbox each morning with our breakfast briefing sign up by

than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be
