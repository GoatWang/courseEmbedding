our chief financial officer and executive vice president mark parkey for the  weeks ended january   it marked another successful quarter for j alexander’s holdings reflecting gains in several key areas of measurement we finished the year with improving sales trends in all of our restaurant concepts we were encouraged though with our performance particularly against the comparable quarter of  which included an next week of operations for the fourth quarter of  net sales amount  that was a decrease of  compared to the fourth quarter a year earlier however we had an extra week in the fourth quarter of  we estimate that extra week last year accounted for about  million  in net income and  in adjusted ebitda on a comparable  week basis net sales in the fourth quarter of  increased by estimated  or  compared to those reported in the fourth quarter of  on a consolidated basis net income for the fourth quarter of  was  this compared to  in the fourth quarter of  adjusted ebitda for the fourth quarter of  was  compared to  in the same quarter of  our j alexanders redland’s group had consolidated weekly sales of  in the fourth quarter of  this compares to  in the fourth quarter of  our average weekly samestore sales increased  in the final quarter of  during a very difficult environment for the restaurant industry this is aided in part by a  increase posted during the critical holiday season that ran from november   through january   december  was an excellent holiday month for us in addition to the momentum achieved at the revenue line we also were pleased to see a successful gift card selling season during the last quarter of  and this is serving us well in our guests traffic during the first quarter of  in addition to strong fourth quarter holiday sales and gift card sales our results at the jax redlands group benefited by easing of beef prices these costs were estimated to have decreased about  compared to the fourth quarter of  the overreaching theme for  within the j alexander’s redlands restaurants was at the first six months of the year were a struggle at the net sales line which predictably impacted our bottom line results the encouraging takeaway is that the corrective measures we implemented at the beginning of last year produced the desired results starting in the third quarter and that momentum continued into the final quarter of  as well our only disappointment related to  is that the sales turnaround did not occur as rapidly as we had hoped over at our stoney river steakhouse and grill restaurant sales continued to benefit from the excellent performance at the germantown restaurants that we opened in january of last year our weekly sales average during the most recent quarter was  up  from the  posted in the same quarter of  the  restaurants in the samestore space had a sales average of  during the fourth quarter of  that is a  decrease from the  achieved in the fourth quarter of  at our jax redlands group and our stoney river restaurant and grill restaurants they experienced a decrease in beef prices as well and those costs were approximately  less than the fourth quarter of the previous year our primary concern relative to stoney river was soft sales performance in the first few months of the fourth quarter however we had an excellent december at stoney river both in a samestore sales increase in december of  but we have seen some softening in samestore sales at stoney river during the early part of  nothing that concerns us to a great degree lets turn now to our development program during the fourth quarter of  we opened the new j alexanders in raleigh north carolina we have been pleased with the results to date earlier this week we opened the th stoney river steakhouse and grill in chapel hill north carolina on march the th we’ll be opening a new j alexander’s in lexington kentucky later this month we expect to announce plans for what new j alexander’s restaurant and when new stoney river are stoney river steakhouse and grill with targeted openings in the fourth quarter of  finally the company decided not to renew the lease and we closed our j alexanders restaurant in houston texas at the end of january our guest rewarded us with an almost record six day week the last week we were open we believe houston is a good market for us and we’ll carefully evaluate opportunities to reenter that market in the future ill be back on the call after we have some comments from mark parkey ill now turn it over to mark our chief financial officer mark a parkey thank you lonnie and good morning everyone we concluded  with solid momentum in sales from all of our restaurant concepts were coming off a quarter with excellent holiday and gift card sales along with success in the programs we implemented in early  to build sales in our ohio markets so we were pleased with our results particularly against the final quarter of  which as lonnie alluded to included an additional week of sales lonnie has provided an overview of fourth quarter sales results and the impact of the extra week let’s look now at other important measurements of our performance in the fourth quarter of  for the final quarter of  average weekly guest counts on the samestore base in the j alexander’s redlands grill restaurants were up to  while average weekly guest counts on a samestore base in the stoney river steakhouse and grill restaurants decreased by  however due to the strength of the stoney river location in germantown tennessee consolidated average weekly guest counts for stoney river increased by  percent during the fourth quarter of  compared to the same quarter in  at the combined j alexander’s redlands grill restaurants average guest checks which includes alcoholic beverage sales decreased onefifth of  to  in the fourth quarter of  as compared with  in the corresponding quarter a year earlier average guest checks for the stoney river steakhouse and grill restaurants were down to  to  in the fourth quarter of  compared to  in the fourth quarter of  this is primarily due to the impact of the germantown restaurant which serves both lunch and dinner in fact remaining price adjustments for the most recent quarter was estimated to be sixtenths of  increase for the j alexander’s redlands grill restaurants and sixtenths of  decrease for the stoney river steakhouse and grill restaurants river safe as they grow restaurants as compared to the same quarter of the prior year deflation include costs for the fourth quarter of  was estimated to total  and  for the j alexander’s redlands grill restaurants and the stoney river restaurants respectively as compared to the fourth quarter of  the companys consolidated operating income for the last quarter of  was  compared to consolidated operating income of  recorded in the corresponding quarter of  our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of  was  compared to  in the final quarter of  our income from continuing operations before income taxes in the final quarter of  totaled  compared to income from continuing operations before income taxes of  in the final periods of previous year the results for the fourth quarter of  were impacted by nonrecurring transaction and integration expenses at  associated with our ultimate spinoff from fidelity national financial ventures llc in  excluding these nonrecurring transaction and integration expenses income from continuing operations before income taxes would have totaled  for the fourth quarter of  the results also included income tax expense of

services llc and that compares to  in the fourth quarter at the prior year also during the fourth quarter of  the company recognized  of noncash profits interest compensation expense related to the black knight profits interest grant compared to  of such expense in the final quarter of  we remind those listening thats a fair value of the black knight profits interest grant is recalculated on a quarterly basis during the three year period over which it is scheduled to vest any change in the estimated fair value of the grant is reported at the end of the quarter in a manner which brings the cumulative expense recognized relative to the grant current with the latest valuation the valuation at the end of the fourth quarter of  was calculated to be approximately  million as compared to an estimated  million at the end of the third quarter of  during the fourth quarter of  the companys board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to  million shares of the companys outstanding common stock over a period of three years ending october   shares repurchases under the program have been made and are expected to be made solely from cash on hand and available operating cash flow repurchases will be made in accordance with applicable securities laws that maybe made from timetotime in the open market the timing prices and amount of repurchases will depend upon prevailing market prices general economic and marketing conditions and other considerations the repurchase program does not obligate the companies to acquire any particular amount of stock during the fourth quarter of  the company purchased  shares under the program since the inception of the stock repurchase program  shares have been purchased by the company at an aggregate price of  as we look ahead to  our guidance includes the following increase in average weekly samestore sales of  to  at the j alexander’s grills locations as well as  to  increase in average weekly samestore sales for our stoney river restaurants capital expenditures ranging from  million to  million total revenue ranging from  million to  million net income of  million to  million adjusted ebitda of  million to  million and effective tax rate of  and basic earnings per share of  to  cents i’ll now turn the call back to the operator to open the participant calling segment for this mornings call questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of will slabaugh from stephens please proceed with your question drew stevenson thanks guys this is actually drew on for will so first i just wanted to ask on your updated thoughts with regard to new store productivity and how things are progressing relative to your expectations there lonnie j stout ii well raleigh opened in december and is right on where we thought it would be as we said germantown stoney river that we opened in january last year exceeded our expectations by a wide margin and chapel hill stoney river has only been open for four days so cant really say much about it yet drew stevenson yeah and then just any update on quarter todate trend you said you ended the year strong and then nothings really concerning you to start out in january february but i just wanted to see if theres anything specific you had been seeing positive or negatively around the space lonnie j stout ii well we think things are generally positive in the sales area our january trends j alexanders and all the redlands grills were very strong stoney river weve got a couple of restaurants that are under a lot of competitive pressure from new openings those samestore sales were a little soft and nothing that concerns us or nothing systemic so we generally think the environment for the upscale casual dining group is pretty positive right now or positive in the areas that were in you’d recalled a year or so ago we had some sales softness in ohio we addressed that that market has performed well for us so we think things are firing on all cylinders mark a parkey it continues to remain  lonnie j stout ii yeah mark said beef is favorable to us we’ve seen some increases in seafood costs but beef certainly more than offset that so i would call our outlook positive and sales trends are continuing to encourage us drew stevenson awesome great well you all answered my last question on the commodities so congrats on the corner and thanks for answering my questions lonnie j stout ii thanks a lot operator operator instructions there are no further questions in the queue i’d like to hand the call back over to management for closing comments lonnie j stout ii well i want to thank everyone for being on the call today just a couple of thoughts as we previously mentioned we’re encouraged by the momentum achieved during the recent holiday season and the strong finish we had to the year on balance we feel comfortable with our ability to get our targeted annual increases in samestore sales for  as we mentioned beef prices continue to be favorable during the early part of the year we anticipate theyll stay favorable for most of this year and that our input costs should be stable while there’s some other commodity increases beef decreases will more than offset that we always are cautious about the cost pressures as we mentioned seafood or salmon a few things have gone up but beef right now is running very very favorable again were firing on all cylinders in our markets and were looking forward to an exciting year thank you all operator ladies and gentlemen this does
