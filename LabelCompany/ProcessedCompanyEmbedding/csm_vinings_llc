sidethey serve overall disappointed positive sidethey serve one of the best persian foods in town they use organic meat chicken …very organize on their catering and don’t disappoint you in front of your guests but …they make best looking cake but you have to like the taste we don’t negative sidewhen you are signing the contract make sure you write whatever you talked about the owner mentioned at least  times they will bring  food in addition to our total guests and then they pack the leftovers it did not happen and it was very disappointing after the guests finished their dinner all the dishes were full of kebab chicken kebab stews salads different kind of rice and whatever was in our menu the next day we were so shocked to see they have just packed bread herbs half of the box egg plant appetizer and plain rice flavor café simply blamed the hotel after our investigation we found out the manager of the restaurant picked all the good stuff with him couple weeks later my friend had the same experience on her private party at her house i would really like to know what they do with all those food the next day when we were shopping around the other restaurants told us upfront after the party we have to pay between  to  tips to each server flavor café did not mention anything and then asked for  tip of our check in our case it was  tip for each server and  in total we were discussed so many times what kind of flavor we want for our cake the owner tried his best to change our mind and finally he agreed to make what we were asking for guess what he made what he was trying to force us to agree on from the beginning we had so much cake leftover as well and what we got was just the top part of cake and they took the restthe other night we took our guests from out of town there although there were only one other family beside us and the food was great the service was not caring and good b beatty bakery diner  cafechelen ratedso i work two doors down from so i work two doors down from this restaurant and ive been eagerly anticipating its opening ever since they first posted their menu in the window by eagerly anticipating i mean stalking seriously it got pretty badtheyre finally open and i had my first meal there today i was a little worried that it wouldnt live up to the hype that i was building in my head but it definitely did first of all the menu is quite extensive they have everything from chicken  waffles to handcut fries to baked goods to fresh fruit flavored lemonades to buildyourowncrepes which is what i chose along with the sweet potato blood orange souffle tons of options for vegetarians as well something im accidentally conscious of because of my pretentious trendy vegetarian brotherthe food was great there are no frilly menu options here so if youre looking for foods that are impossible to pronounce this isnt the place just simple but delicious southerninspired cuisinethe waitstaff was friendlyso overall i would say that my first experience at b beatty was definitely all i hoped for and i am so thankful for this place being open  doors down from where i work i anticipate most of my check will be going hereoh i almost forgot speaking of checks the food was ridiculously underpriced yes underpriced my boyfriend and i have no idea how theyre pulling off this menu with the prices theyre charging but maybe i wont be spending my whole check in here after alldefinitely check it outsprinkles cupcakesiris l ratedsprinkles in my opinion is usually a hit or miss maybe it is just my preference but their are items which i really love and some that i just do not care for my go to favs are usually the salted corn flake cookie strawberry ice cream captain crunch ice cream and definitely the smores cupcake if i were to narrow it down some more i would have to say that the smores and cookie are my top  you must try it at least once they both feature a sweet and salty aspect which i love because sometimes eating something just sweet can become pretty boring the service here is usually a hit or miss too sometimes you might get exceptional and friendly service while other times you might receive service from someone who does not want to be there nevertheless i still have a place for sprinkles and will be going back whenever i get a sweetsalty cravingalons bakery  market at park placeabby b ratedif youre all about indie and gourmet foods here is a place of significance the fromage and fruit preserves are endless the best selection ive seen in the metropolitan my israeli breakfast included two types of cheese cheddar and goat cheese dayum its the creamiest cheeses ive tasted the jams were seedless and smooth spread country french bread was thin and freshthe groceries are somewhat pricey but if artisanal and organic appeals to you the price is not questionable because the quality is worth it the staff is pretty knowledgeable and friendly and theyre happy to give samples and product info theres no wait to be seated plus food service is speedy i love this place for a quick snack or meal moreover the foods are guilt free youll be impressed if youre interested in all natural everythingsweet cheatsgia e ratedsweet cheats is no less than bombcom i have no problem squeezing through the narrow streets of cabbagetown to indulge in their yummy treats my favorite are the macarons the flavors rotate daily my best is the strawberry macaron whats also great about sweet cheats is that they do custom orders theyve done a few custom cakes and cupcakes for my catering events at the georgia dome my favorite was the drum corps international trophy cake not only was it amazing visually but the crème brulee flavor of the cake was to die for their cakes have a signature taste that is unlike any other bakery our clients loved it the owner shirley is really nice and dedicated to her work shes produced amazing desserts for me a couple of times with only two days noticeurban land cruisersjason t ratedive purchased parts from dave and the crew at ulc and ulr urban land rovers for nearly  years now dave was so helpful i decided to have him do a full restoration on one of my vehicles the work has taken a bit longer then planned but with a bit of patience the progress has been steady and the truck looks amazing todayfirst of all let me say how much the shop has changed in the past few years its gone from a small land cruiser shop to one of the largest suppliers of new and used land rover parts in the south easti would not hesitate to recommend ulc to anyone looking for the best in parts and vehicle sales call dave or even better email him for some of the most knowledgeable and honest advice anywhere  starsbuttermilk sky pie shopiris l ratedfirst off what a cute and sweet looking place we were greeted by a sweet grandma that informed us about their pies and how they make it i choose the pecan pie which was delicious and a must when you are in the south we then asked about the various empty bottles that were displayed and she told us that they bottle their own milk i repeat they bottle their milk apparently they do this because they like to keep their milk at a low  degrees what pairs better than ice cold milk with a delicious pie everything about the place is absolutely adorable and truly exemplifies southern hospitality i will definitely be back when i get a chance to have their delicious pies and milkevans bake shopsonyaweaver ratedi love evans key lime cakei first experienced their scrumptious cake at a jrcrickets they were sooooooo delicious to me i started to go there just for the cakes low and behold i saw the car displaying their cake in east point but i couldnt write down the number fast enough low and behold again after eating in east point me and a companion decided to take a stroll through downtown eastpoint it was during our stroll that i told my companion how i wish i could go to jrcrickets to get a piece of cake in our walking we literally came upon the bake shop in downtown east point talk about happy yes ive found the best key lime cake in georgia thus far ����������������proof bakeshopdave d ratedwalked over for a gingercranberry scone  and a smallish cup of coffee  tax  tip made it  delightfully sunny open atmosphere  counter servicethere may be scones as good elsewhere but i promise you there are none better also the coffee was nirvana in a coffee kind of way two thumbs way up on the foodbut pricey in proofs defense ill admit i did not ask for a refill on the coffee but for that price you can get a cup
