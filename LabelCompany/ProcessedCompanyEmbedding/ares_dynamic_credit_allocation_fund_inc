investment process ares capital management ii llc the “adviser” serves as the fund’s investment adviser the adviser is an affiliate of ares management llc “ares” the adviser’s investment philosophy portfolio construction and portfolio management involve an assessment of the overall macroeconomic environment financial markets and company specific research and analysis its investment approach emphasizes capital preservation low volatility and minimization of downside risk in addition to engaging in extensive due diligence from the perspective of a longterm investor the adviser’s approach seeks to reduce risk as further described below leverage the fund may use leverage through borrowings including loans from certain financial institutions and or the issuance of debt securities as well as through the issuance of shares of preferred stock the fund has a revolving funding facility with an institutional lender pursuant to which the fund may borrow funds to make additional investments subject to available collateral the use of leverage is a speculative technique that involves special risks there can be no assurance that the fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful risks and other considerations investing in the funds common shares involves certain risks and the fund may not be able to achieve its intended results for a variety of reasons because the value of your investment in the fund will fluctuate there is a risk that you will lose money your investment will decline in value if among other things the value of the funds investments decreases the value of
