not equal the total of the actual checks citizens bank did not take action to fix the mistake if it fell below a certain dollar amount over the years by ignoring the discrepancies the bank shorted consumers millions of dollars specifically citizens bank failed to credit consumers the full amount of their deposits citizens bank frequently did not give consumers full credit for their deposits
