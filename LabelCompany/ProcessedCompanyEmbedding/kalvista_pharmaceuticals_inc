kalvista pharmaceuticals inc the “company” or “kalvista” is a clinicalstage pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery development and commercialization of small molecule serine protease inhibitors as new treatments for diseases with significant unmet need  the company’s initial focus is on developing a portfolio of oral inhibitors of plasma kallikrein for two indications hereditary angioedema or hae and diabetic macular edema or dme  the first oral program kvd is currently in phase i clinical testing and additional programs are in preclinical development  kalvista also has developed an intravitreally administered plasma kallikrein inhibitor for dme that has completed a phase i clinical trial and is anticipated to commence phase ii testing later in   the company’s headquarters is located in cambridge massachusetts  on november   kalvista pharmaceuticals limited “kalvista limited” completed a share purchase transaction with carbylan therapeutics inc “carbylan” in an allstock transaction whereby immediately following the transaction carbylan’s equity holders owned  and kalvista limited’s equity holders owned  of the combined company respectively see note    as a result carbylan issued approximately eight million shares of common stock to the stockholders of kalvista limited in exchange for their common shares of kalvista limited the combined company was renamed kalvista pharmaceuticals inc following the transaction  following the completion of the transaction the business being conducted by the company became primarily the business conducted by kalvista limited which is a clinicalstage pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of small molecule protease inhibitors kalvista has devoted substantially all of its efforts to research and development including clinical trials of its product candidates the company has not completed the development of any product candidates   pharmaceutical drug product candidates like those being developed by the company require approvals from the us food and drug administration “fda” or foreign regulatory agencies prior to commercial sales there can be no assurance that any product candidates will receive the necessary approvals and any failure to receive approval or delay in approval may have a material adverse impact on the business and financial statements of the company   the company has never been profitable and has not yet commenced commercial operations  kalvista is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties similar to those of other life science companies developing new products including among others the risks related to the necessity to obtain adequate additional financing to successfully develop product candidates to obtain regulatory approval of product candidates to comply with government regulations to successfully commercialize its potential products to the protection of proprietary technology and to the dependence on key individuals  the company has funded its operations primarily through the issuance of preferred stock and grant income as of january   kalvista had an accumulated deficit of  million and  million of cash and cash equivalents    the company’s working capital including cash obtained through the share purchase transaction with carbylan is anticipated to fund the company’s operations for at least the next twelve months from the date these interim condensed consolidated financial statements are issued accordingly the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  summary of significant accounting policies and basis of presentation basis of presentation the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its whollyowned subsidiary  all intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation   the accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap” for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to form q and rule  of regulation sx  accordingly they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements   such financial statements reflect all adjustments that are in management’s opinion necessary to present fairly in all material respects the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows there were no adjustments other than normal recurring adjustments   the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual financial statements these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending april   or for any other future annual or interim period the accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements as of and for the year ended april   and the related notes thereto included in the company’s form ka filed on november   with the securities and exchange commission kalvista was determined to be the accounting acquirer in the reverse acquisition with carbylan therefore all prior periods are those of kalvista pharmaceuticals limited    use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from these estimates foreign currency translation the functional currency of the company’s foreign subsidiary is the great britain pound sterling  assets and liabilities of the foreign subsidiary are translated using the exchange rate existing on each respective balance sheet date revenues and expenses are translated using the monthly average exchange rates prevailing throughout the year the translation adjustments resulting from this process are included as the only component of the accumulated other comprehensive loss segment reporting the company manages its operations as a single operating segment for the purposes of assessing performance and making operating decisions cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents consist of bank deposits and money market accounts cash equivalents are carried at cost which approximates fair value due to their shortterm nature the company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of  days or less to be cash equivalents the company maintains its cash and cash equivalent balances with financial institutions that management believes are creditworthy the company’s cash and cash equivalent accounts at times may exceed federally insured limits the company has not experienced any losses in such accounts the company believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk of cash and cash equivalents research and development research and development costs consist primarily of clinical trial expenses salaries and related expenses for personnel and fees paid to outside consultants and outside service providers including costs associated with licensing milestone and grant revenue research and development costs are expensed as incurred stockbased compensation  the company maintains performance incentive plans under which stock options may be granted to employees and nonemployees the company accounts for stockbased compensation arrangements at fair value the company’s determination of the fair value of stock options on the date of grant utilizes the blackscholes optionpricing model and is impacted by its common stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables these variables include the expected term that options will remain outstanding expected common stock price volatility over the term of the option awards riskfree interest rates and expected dividends  the fair value is recognized over the period during which an optionee is required to provide services usually the vesting period on a straightline basis stockbased compensation expense recognized at fair value includes the impact of estimated forfeitures the company estimates future forfeitures at the date of grant and revises the estimates if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates    net loss per share attributable to common stockholders basic and diluted net income loss per share is presented in conformity with the twoclass method required for participating securities under the twoclass method basic net income loss per share is computed by dividing the net income loss attributable to common shareholders by the weightedaverage number of common shares outstanding during the period net income loss attributable to common shareholders is determined by allocating undistributed earnings between holders of common and convertible preferred shares based on the contractual dividend rights contained in our preferred share agreement where there is an undistributed loss no amount is allocated to the convertible preferred shares diluted net income loss per share is computed by dividing net income loss by the sum of the weighted average number of common shares and the number of dilutive potential common share equivalents outstanding during the period potential dilutive common share equivalents consist of the incremental common shares issuable upon the exercise of vested share options or the conversion of preferred stock    potential dilutive common share equivalents consist of     january                preferred stock     —          stock options                 in computing diluted earnings per share common share equivalents are not considered in periods in which a net loss is reported as the inclusion of the common share equivalents would be antidilutive as a result there is no difference between the company’s basic and diluted loss per share for the periods presente d

pursuant to this reverse acquisition the company recorded the shares of common stock held by carbylan shareholders at the fair value of carbylan’s net monetary assets received at november   as these

kingdom locations to better accommodate existing operations and future growth and anticipates entering into arrangements for new offices and laboratory locations during    contingencies from time to time the company may have certain contingent liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of business activities the company accrues a liability for such matters when it is probable that such expenditures can be reasonably estimated there are no contingent liabilities requiring accrual at january   as a result of the terms of grant income received in prior years upon successful regulatory approval and following the first commercial sale of certain products the company will be required to pay royalty fees of up to  million within  days of the first commercial sale of the product subject to certain limitations and follow on payments depending upon commercial success and type of product given the stage of development of the current pipeline of products it is not possible to predict with certainty the amount or timing of any such liability  grant income grant income is recognized through two agreements the first agreement is with the technology strategy board tsb a united kingdom government organization the company recognizes revenue for reimbursements of research and development costs as the services are performed up to an agreed upon threshold the company records these reimbursements as revenue and not as a reduction of research and development expenses as the company has the risks and rewards as the principal in the research and development activities any services performed and not yet collected upon are shown as a receivable during the three months ended january   and  revenue recognized through the tsb grant amounted to  and  respectively and amounted to  million and  million for the nine months ended january   and  respectively    the second agreement is w ith the jdrf a nonprofit organization the company applies the milestone method of accounting to recognize revenue from milestone payments when earned as evidenced by written acknowledgement from the grantor and other persuasive evidence that the milest one has been achieved and the payment is nonrefundable provided that the milestone event is substantive a milestone event is defined as an event i that can only be achieved based in whole or in part on either the company’s performance or on the occurr ence of a specific outcome resulting from the company’s performance ii for which there is substantive uncertainty at the inception of the arrangement that the event will be achieved and iii that would result in additional payments being due to the co mpany events for which the occurrence is either contingent solely upon the passage of time or the result of a counterparty’s performance are not considered to be milestone events a milestone event is substantive if all of the following conditions are met  i the consideration is commensurate with either the company’s performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value to the delivered items as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the company’s performance to achieve the miles tone ii the consideration relates solely to past performance and iii the consideration is reasonable relative to all the deliverables and payment terms including other potential milestone consideration within the arrangement the company assesses whether a milestone is substantive at the inception of the arrangement if a milestone is deemed nonsubstantive the company accounts for that milestone payment in accordance with the multiple element arrangements guidance and recognizes revenue consistent with the related units of accounting for the arrangement over the related performance period the company has one contract in process with jdrf accounted for under the milestone method milestones may include for example the successful completions of clinical trials development of certain reports and different reviewapproval processes all milestones under the contract in process were deemed substantive based on the fact that the payments are commensurate with the company’s efforts to achieve the milestone event and the milestones are related to past performance and are nonrefundable during the three months ended january   and  revenue recognized through the achievement of multiple milestones amounted to  and  respectively and amounted to  and  for the nine months ended january   and  respectively the last milestone in the jdrf contract was met in may  and no additional revenue is due from this contract  there are no performance cancellation termination or refund provisions in the arrangement that contain material financial consequences to the company the company evaluates the terms of sponsored research agreement grants and federal grants to assess the company’s obligations and if the company’s obligations are satisfied by the passage of time revenue is recognized as described above for grants with refund provisions the company reviews the grant to determine the likelihood of repayment if the likelihood of repayment of the grant is determined to be remote the grant is recognized as revenue if the probability of repayment is determined to be more than remote the company records the grant as a deferred revenue liability until such time that the grant requirements have been satisfied  income taxes the company generated a net loss for the three  and nine  months ended  january    and incurred no tax expense for the three  and nine  months ended  january     the company’s effective tax rate is  for income tax for the three  and nine  months ended  january    and the company expects that its effective tax rate for the full fiscal  year will be  based on the weight of available evidence including cumulative losses since inception and expected future losses the company has determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset amount will not be realized and therefore a valuation allowance has been provided on net deferred tax assets the company has substantial net operating loss carry forwards available to offset future taxable income for federal and state income tax purposes  our ability to utilize our net operating losses is limited due to changes in our ownership as defined by section  of the internal revenue code the “code”  under the provisions of sections  and  of the code a change of control as defined in the code imposes an annual limitation on the amount of the company’s net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and other tax attributes that can be used to reduce future tax liabilities  we determined that an ownership change occurred as a result of the company’s acquisition in november   as a result of the november  ownership change the company will be limited to utilizing approximately  of preownership change us federal and california nols annually for each of the next  years thereby limiting preownership change net operating loss carryovers to only  million for both us federal and california purposes  furthermore none of the company’s federal rd credit carryforwards will be available due to the section  limitations  because california rd credit carryforwards never expire none of the california rd credit carryforwards will expire unutilized but all of the preownership change california rd credit carryforwards will be subject to a  annual limitation the company files tax returns in the united kingdom as well as us federal and state of california and massachusetts tax returns the company is not currently subject to any income tax examinations since the company’s inception the company has incurred losses from operations which generally allows all tax years to remain open      uncertain tax positions the company recognizes the financial statement effects of a tax position when it becomes more likely than not based upon the technical merits that the position will be sustained upon examination  the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of january   is approximately  related to the unrecognized tax benefit on rd credits none of which will affect the effective tax rate if recognized due to the valuation allowance the company does not expect any material changes in the next  months in unrecognized tax benefits the company recognizes interest andor penalties related to uncertain tax positions to the extent accrued interest and penalties do not ultimately become payable amounts accrued will be reduced and reflected in the period that such determination is made the interest and penalties are recognized as other expense and not tax expense the company currently has no interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions        item  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and related notes appearing in this report some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this report including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing includes forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties as a result of many factors including those factors set forth in the “risk factors” section of our definitive proxy statement filed october   and our form ka filed december   our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forwardlooking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis as used in this report unless the context suggests otherwise “we” “us” “our” “the company” or “kalvista” refer to kalvista pharmaceuticals inc overview we are a pharmaceuticals company focused on the discovery development and commercialization of small molecule serine protease inhibitors as new treatments for diseases with significant unmet needs our initial focus is on inhibitors of plasma kallikrein which is an important component of the body’s inflammatory response and which in excess can lead to increased vascular permeability edema and inflammation we are developing a proprietary portfolio of novel small molecule plasma kallikrein inhibitors initially targeting hereditary angioedema hae and diabetic macular edema dme the first of this planned portfolio of programs kvd is currently in a phase  firstinhuman study that commenced in the second half of   our most advanced program an intravitreally administered plasma kallikrein inhibitor known as kvd has successfully completed its firstinhuman study in patients with dme and is being prepared for phase ii studies later in  recent developments on november   kalvista pharmaceuticals ltd “kalvista limited” completed a share purchase transaction with carbylan therapeutics inc “carbylan” in an allstock transaction whereby immediately following the transaction carbylan’s equity holders owned  and kalvista limited’s equity holders owned  of the combined company respectively as a result carbylan issued

combined company as the accounting acquirer kalvista limited’s assets and liabilities will be recorded at their pre combination carrying amounts and the historical operations that are reflected in the financial statements are those of kalvista limited  the company’s consolidated financial statements reflect carbylan’s results of operations beginning after november    carbylan has no ongoing operations so the impact of the share purchase transaction on the company is not significant except for the equity issued and the cash acquired in the transaction grant income we have received grant income to support our research and development activities from two main sources jdrf a charitable organization based in new york and the technology strategy board “tsb” the uk government’s biomedical catalyst funding initiative through january   jdrf has provided  million in milestonebased financial support to advance the intravitreal drug program but this program has concluded and no further receipts are expected  under the terms of a grant approved in the second calendar quarter of  the tsb will provide a total amount of  million over the lifetime of the agreements between us and the tsb to accelerate the development of the oral drug program of which  million was received or was due to be received as of january   research and development expenses research and development expenses primarily consist of costs associated with our research activities including the preclinical and clinical development of product candidates we contract with clinical research organizations to manage our clinical trials under agreed upon budgets for each study with oversight by our clinical program managers we account for all goods and services including nonrefundable advance payments as expenses and all research and development costs are expensed as incurred    we expect to continue to incur substantial expenses related to developme nt activities for the foreseeable future as we conduct clinical development manufacturing and toxicology studies product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical d evelopment primarily due to the increased size and duration of laterstage clinical trials additional drug manufacturing requirements and later stage toxicology studies such as carcinogenicity studies the process of conducting preclinical studies and c linical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time consuming the probability of success for each product candidate is affected by numerous factors including preclinical data clinical data competition manufacturing capability and commercial viability accordingly we may never succeed in achieving marketing approval for any of our product candidates completion dates and costs for clinical development programs as well as our research program can vary significantly for each current and future product candidate and are difficult to predict as a result we cannot estimate with any degree of certainty the costs associated with development of our product candidates at this point in time we anticipate making determinations as to which programs and product candidates to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program and product candidate on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific success of early research programs results of ongoing and future clinical trials our ability to enter into collaborative agreements with respect to programs or potential product candidates as well as ongoing assessments as to each current or future product candidate’s commercial potential general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the costs associated with general management obtaining and maintaining our patent portfolio professional fees for accounting auditing consulting and legal services and general overhead expenses we expect ongoing general and administrative expenses to increase in the future as we expand our operating activities maintain and expand the patent portfolio and incur additional costs associated with the management of a public company and maintaining compliance with exchange listing and sec requirements these potential increases will likely include management costs legal fees accounting fees directors’ and officers’ liability insurance premiums and expenses associated with investor relations other income other income consists of bank interest research and development tax credits from the uk government’s tax incentive programs set up to encourage research and development in the united kingdom and realized and unrealized exchange rate gainslosses on cash held in foreign currencies income taxes we historically have incurred net losses and have no corporation tax liabilities under the uk government’s research and development tax incentive scheme we have surrendered tax losses in exchange for

expenses were  million for the three months ended january   compared to  million for the same period in  primarily due to a change in the usd to gbp currency translation rate on a constant currency

completion of toxicology studies and the ongoing costs of the clinical study   the additional oral programs expenses in the three months ended january   increased to  from  in the same period in  due to expenses incurred in connection with the progression of multiple candidates through discovery characterization initial scaleup manufacture and entry into early toxicology assessment unallocated and internal research and development expenses for the three months ended january   increased to  million compared to  million for the same period in  due to an increase in early stage discovery

administrative expenses  general and administrative expenses were  million for the three months ended january   which was  million higher compared to  million for the same period in  the increase in general and administrative expenses for the three months ended january   was substantially due to  million of professional fees and regulatory costs associated with the carbylan transaction completed in november  as well as  million of severance costs and  million of other expenses as we expand the management team and other key positions and incur costs associated with operations as a public

and operating activities and incur expenses associated with being a public company other income other income was  million for the three months ended january   compared to  million for the same period

expenses were  million for the nine months ended january   compared to  million for the same period in  the decrease is primarily due to a change in the usd to gbp currency translation rate of

chemistry and early toxicology studies unallocated and internal research and development expenses increased to  million in the nine months ended january   compared to  million for the same period in

january   which was  million higher than the  million for the same period in  the increase in general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended january   was due to  million of additional

hire additional staff including clinical scientific operational financial and management personnel and incur additional costs associated with being a public company we have funded operations primarily through private placement offerings of equity securities and through the receipt of grant income from two main sources the jdrf and the tsb we plan to continue to fund research and development and

commercialization we do not expect to generate significant revenue unless and until we obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize one of our current or future product candidates we anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future and we expect the losses to increase as we continue the development of and seek regulatory approvals for product candidates and begin to commercialize any approved products we are subject to all of the risks inherent in the development of new therapeutic products and we may encounter unforeseen expenses difficulties complications delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business as a result of the completion of the carbylan share purchase transaction in november  we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company we currently anticipate that based upon our operating plans existing capital resources and the additional funding secured through the transaction we have sufficient funding to operate for at least the next twelve to eighteen months until such time if ever as we can generate substantial revenues we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity or debt financings collaborations strategic partnerships or licensing arrangements to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of stock or convertible debt securities the ownership interest of existing stockholders will be diluted and the terms of these newly issued securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of common stockholders debt financing if available may involve agreements that include increased fixed payment obligations and covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring additional debt making capital expenditures declaring dividends selling or licensing intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct business additional fundraising through collaborations strategic partnerships or licensing arrangements with third parties may require us to relinquish valuable rights to product candidates including its other technologies future revenue streams or research programs or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable if we are unable to raise additional funds when needed we may be required to delay limit reduce or terminate product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and commercialize its other product candidates even if we would otherwise prefer to develop and commercialize such product candidates internally contractual obligations and commitments we enter into contracts in the normal course of business with contract research organizations and clinical trial sites for the conduct of clinical trials preclinical and clinical studies professional consultants and other vendors for clinical supply manufacturing or other

during the reported periods we evaluate these estimates and judgments including those described below on an ongoing basis we base our estimates on historical experience known trends and events contractual milestones and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions preclinical and clinical trial accruals we base our accrued expenses related to clinical trials on estimates of patient enrollment and related expenses at clinical investigator sites as well as estimates for services received and efforts expended

balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us and based on contracted amounts applied to the level of patient enrollment and activity according to the protocol if timelines or contracts are    modified based upon changes in the clinical trial protocol or scope of work to be performed we modify our estimates of accrued expenses accordingly on a prospective basis if we do not identify costs that we have begun to incur or if we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of these services our actual expenses could differ from our estimates to date there have been no material adjustments to our estimates at any balance sheet date income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized  given our history of losses we currently provide a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc   accounting for uncertainty in income taxes we assess all material positions taken in any income tax return including all significant uncertain positions in all tax years that are still subject to assessment or challenge by relevant taxing authorities assessing an uncertain tax position begins with the initial determination of the position’s sustainability and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement as of each balance sheet date unresolved uncertain tax positions are reassessed and we determine whether i the factors underlying the sustainability assertion have changed and ii the amount of the recognized tax benefit is still appropriate the recognition and measurement of tax benefits requires significant judgment judgments concerning the recognition and measurement of a tax benefit might change as new information becomes available recent accounting pronouncements for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements please refer to note  summary of significant accounting policies and basis of presentation within our condensed consolidated financial statements item  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we have exposure to market risk in interest income sensitivity which is affected by changes in the general level of interest rates however because of the shortterm nature of the bank deposit arrangements and the very low interest rates prevailing in the united kingdom and the united states a sudden change in market interest rates would not be expected to have a material impact on our financial condition andor results of operations we do not believe that our cash or cash equivalents have significant risk of default or illiquidity foreign exchange rate risk we maintain cash balances in both us dollars “usd” and british pound sterling “gbp” to fund ongoing operations  cash and cash equivalents as of january   was  million and consisted of readily available checking and bank deposit accounts held primarily in both usd and gbp as of january    of cash and cash equivalents were held in usd and  in gbp we currently incur significant expense primarily in gbp and convert usd as needed to fund those expenses we do not believe our cash and cash equivalents are exposed to significant exchange rate risk though we do not currently engage in exchange rate hedging or other similar activities  a  change in the exchange rate would result in a net gain or loss of approximately  million effects of inflation we do not believe that inflation and changing prices had a significant impact on the results of operations for any periods presented herein    item  controls and procedures evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures as required by rule ab under the securities exchange act of  as amended the “exchange act” our management under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of january   the term “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in rules ae and de under the exchange act means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management including its principal executive and principal financial officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures   management previously identified and reported two material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting that existed at april   as further discussed below certain controls were implemented since april   however sufficient time has not elapsed to evidence the effectiveness of these controls at january    based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of january   and the material weaknesses identified our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at january   changes in internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended january   management continued to implement additional controls to enhance the operating effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting  in addition to the controls discussed below the company hired additional accounting personnel to supplement existing staff  the new accounting personnel provided additional oversight and monitoring of the financial close and reporting process   as previously reported a material weakness was identified as of april   related to controls over the measurement of fair value of equitybased awards at such time there was no active market for our common stock  upon completion of the carbylan transaction on november   the company’s common stock is publicly traded and the valuation of the stock underlying new awards is readily determinable from the quoted price of the company’s common stock  in addition the company implemented a software tool to improve tracking of equity awards the new software when fully implemented will allow for more effective controls over processing and oversight of the measurement and recording of stockbased compensation in addition a material weakness was identified as of april   with respect to ineffective design and operation of controls to ensure that operating expenses were recorded in the correct period  during the quarter ended management implemented additional controls related to approval of expenditures and ensuring that goods and services were received at or near the end of the period were properly identified and recorded while these controls were implemented in the quarter ended january   management has concluded that there was insufficient time elapsed to allow for the operation of the controls to occur with enough frequency such that there was sufficient evidence of design and operating effectiveness the implementation of these controls as well as the additional personnel have materially affected our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended january   and are intended to remediate the material weaknesses previously identified      part ii other information item  legal proceedings from time to time we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business  we are currently not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results   item a risk factors except for the historical information in this report on form q the matters contained in this report include forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties our operating results and financial condition have varied in the past and may in the future vary significantly depending on a number of factors these factors among others could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forwardlooking statements made in this report and presented elsewhere by management from time to time such factors may have a material adverse effect upon our business results of operations and financial condition you should consider carefully the risk factors together with all of the other information included in our definitive proxy statement filed on october   each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock  there have been no material changes in our ris k factors from those disclosed in our definitive proxy statement and our form ka filed december   other than the following updates the vote by citizens of the united kingdom to leave the european union in a process referred to as “brexit” may lead to economic and regulatory changes in that country that could affect our operations and financial position the majority of kalvista’s scientific operations are based in the united kingdom and the company has historically received significant funding through uk government sources and tax credits in the year ended april   we recognized  million in revenue from a uk government grant program and an additional  million in income through a uk government program that allows companies to surrender tax losses in exchange for a cash payment related to a portion of their research and development expenditures for the year  we also have conducted and expect to continue to conduct a number of our clinical trials in the uk under the eu regulatory regime the process and outcome of brexit is inherently unpredictable at this time and could impact the economy and regulatory regime of the uk in a number of negative ways  to the extent that those changes reduce government funding sources increase the cost and complexity of executing clinical trials change regulations applicable to pharmaceuticals discovery and development or otherwise make our uk operations more costly or less efficient it could have a material adverse effect on our overall business and financial position kalvista has incurred significant losses since its inception kalvista expects to incur losses over the next several years and may never achieve or maintain profitability  since inception kalvista has incurred significant operating losses as it focuses on its discovery efforts and developing its product candidates kalvista has recently initiated clinical development of its lead product candidates kvd for the treatment of hae and kvd for the treatment of dme and expects that it will be many years if ever before kalvista has a product candidate ready for commercialization to date kalvista has financed its operations primarily through private placements of its preferred stock kalvista expects to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future the net losses kalvista incurs may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter kalvista anticipates that its expenses will increase substantially if and as kalvista      •   continues clinical development of its product candidates     •   seeks to identify additional product candidates     •   acquires or inlicenses other products and technologies or enters into collaboration arrangements with regards to product discovery     •   initiates clinical trials for its product candidates        •   seeks marketing approvals for its product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials     •   establishes a sales marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which it may obtain marketing approval     •   maintains expands and protects its intellectual property portfolio     •   hires additional personnel      •   adds operational financial and management information systems and personnel including personnel to support its product development and planned future commercialization efforts and      •   incurs increased costs as a result of operating as a public company    to become and remain profitable kalvista must develop and eventually commercialize a product or products with significant market potential this will require it to be successful in a range of challenging activities including completing clinical trials of its product candidates obtaining marketing approval for these product candidates and manufacturing marketing and selling those products for which kalvista may obtain marketing approval kalvista may never succeed in these activities and even if it does may never generate  revenues that are significant or large enough to achieve profitability if kalvista does achieve profitability it may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis kalvista’s failure to become and remain profitable would decrease the value of the company and could impair its ability to raise capital maintain its discovery and preclinical development efforts expand its business or continue its operations and may require it to raise additional capital that may dilute the ownership interest of common stockholders a decline in the value of kalvista could also cause stockholders to lose all or part of their investment kalvista’s short operating history may make it difficult to evaluate the success of its business to date and to assess its future viability kalvista is an early stage clinical development company and its operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing the company business planning raising capital acquiring and developing the technology identifying potential product candidates undertaking preclinical studies and early stage clinical studies of its most advanced product candidates kvd which kalvista is planning to advance into phase  clinical trials and kvd which recently initiated its phase  clinical trial kalvista has not yet demonstrated its ability to successfully complete largescale pivotal clinical trials obtain marketing approvals manufacture a commercial scale product or arrange for a third party to do so on its behalf or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful product commercialization it takes an average of about  to  years to develop one new medicine from the time it is discovered to when it is available for treating patients consequently any predictions made about kalvista’s future success or viability based on its short operating history to date may not be as accurate as they could be if kalvista had a longer operating history  in addition as a new business kalvista may encounter unforeseen expenses difficulties complications delays and other known and unknown factors kalvista will need to transition from a company with a research focus to a company capable of supporting commercial activities kalvista may not be successful in such a transition kalvista will need substantial additional funding if kalvista is unable to raise capital when needed it would be compelled to delay reduce or eliminate its product development programs or commercialization efforts kalvista expects its expenses to increase in parallel with its ongoing activities particularly as it continues its discovery and preclinical development collaborations to identify new clinical candidates and initiate clinical trials of and seek marketing approval for its product candidates in addition if kalvista obtains marketing approval for any of its product candidates kalvista expects to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales marketing manufacturing and distribution accordingly kalvista will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with its continuing operations if kalvista is unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms kalvista would be forced to delay reduce or eliminate its discovery and preclinical development programs or any future commercialization efforts     raising additional capital may cause dilution to kalvista’s stockholders restrict its operations or require it to relinquish rights to its technologies or product candidates   until such time if ever as kalvista can generate substantial product revenues kalvista expects to finance its cash needs through a combination of equity offerings and debt financings kalvista does not have any committed external source of funds   to the extent that kalvista raises additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities the ownership interest of common stockholders will be diluted and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of common stockholders debt financing and preferred equity financing if available may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting its ability to take specific actions such as incurring additional debt making capital expenditures or declaring dividends  kalvista cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms or at all if kalvista is unable to raise additional funds when needed it may be required to delay limit reduce or terminate its product development or future commercialization efforts  risks related to the discovery and development of kalvista’s product candidates  kalvista is very early in its development efforts and has only two drug candidates kvd and kvd in clinical development if kalvista or its collaborators are unable to successfully develop and commercialize kvd or kvd or one of kalvista’s related compounds or if it experiences significant delays in doing so the business will be materially harmed  kalvista currently does not have any products that have gained regulatory approval kalvista has invested substantially all of its efforts and financial resources in identifying potential drug candidates and funding its preclinical and clinical studies kalvista’s ability to generate product revenues which it does not expect will occur for many years if ever will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of kvd kvd and additional similar product candidates as a result the business is substantially dependent on kalvista’s ability to complete the development of and obtain regulatory approval for kvd and kvd   kalvista has not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully overcome many of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving fields particularly in the biopharmaceutical area for example to execute its business plan kalvista will need to successfully      •   execute kvd and kvd development activities      •   move other product candidates into development     •   obtain required regulatory approvals for the development and commercialization of kvd kvd or other product candidates     •   maintain leverage and expand its intellectual property portfolio     •   build and maintain robust sales distribution and marketing capabilities either on its own or in collaboration with strategic partners     •   gain market acceptance for kvd kvd and other product candidates     •   develop and maintain any strategic relationships kalvista elects to enter into and      •   manage its spending as costs and expenses increase due to drug discovery preclinical development clinical trials regulatory approvals and commercialization  if kalvista is unsuccessful in accomplishing these objectives kalvista may not be able to successfully develop and commercialize kvd kvd or other product candidates and its business will suffer clinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome kalvista may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing or ultimately be unable to complete the development and commercialization of its product candidates  kalvista has only recently commenced clinical development of its lead product candidates kvd and kvd and the risk of failure for all of its product candidates is high before obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of any product candidate kalvista must complete preclinical development and then conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of its product candidates in humans clinical testing is expensive difficult to design and implement and can take many years to complete and its outcome is inherently uncertain failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process    further the results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials of its product candidates may not be predictive of the results of laterstage clinical trials  and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results moreover preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses and many companies that have believed their product candidates perfor med satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their products it is impossible to predict when or if any of kalvista’s product candidates will prove effective or safe in humans or will receive regulatory approval  kalvista may experience delays in its clinical trials and it does not know whether planned clinical trials will begin or enroll subjects on time need to be redesigned or be completed on schedule if at all there can be no assurance that the medicines  healthcare products regulatory agency the “ mhra ” the uk regulatory authority or us food and drug administration the “ fda ” will not put any of its product candidates on clinical hold in the future kalvista may experience numerous unforeseen events during or as a result of clinical trials that could delay or prevent its ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize its product candidates clinical trials may be delayed suspended or prematurely terminated for a variety of reasons such as      •   delay or failure in reaching agreement with the mhra fda or a comparable foreign regulatory authority on a trial design that kalvista wants to execute      •   delay or failure in obtaining authorization to commence a trial or inability to comply with conditions imposed by a regulatory authority regarding the scope or design of a clinical study      •   delays in reaching or failure to reach agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective trial sites     •   inability delay or failure in identifying and maintaining a sufficient number of trial sites many of which may already be engaged in other clinical programs      •   delay or failure in recruiting and enrolling suitable subjects to participate in a trial      •   delay or failure in having subjects complete a trial or return for posttreatment followup      •   clinical sites and investigators deviating from trial protocol failing to conduct the trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or dropping out of a trial      •   lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial including the incurrence of unforeseen costs due to enrollment delays requirements to conduct additional clinical studies and increased expenses associated with the services of its clinical research organizations “ cros ” and other third parties      •   clinical trials of its product candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results and kalvista may decide or regulators may require it to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs      •   the number of patients required for clinical trials of its product candidates may be larger than kalvista anticipates enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than it anticipates or participants may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than it anticipates      •   kalvista may experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients that its product candidates are designed to target      •   its third party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to it in a timely manner or at all      •   kalvista may have difficulty partnering with experienced cros that can identify patients that its product candidates are designed to target and run its clinical trials effectively      •   regulators or institutional review boards “ irbs ” may require that kalvista or its investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks      •   the cost of clinical trials of its product candidates may be greater than kalvista anticipates      •   the supply or quality of its product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of its product candidates may be insufficient or inadequate or      •   there may be changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions     if kalvista is required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of its product candidates beyond those that it currently contemplates if kalvista is unable to successfully complete clini cal trials of its product candidates or other testing if the results of these trials or tests are not positive or are only modestly positive or if there are safety concerns kalvista may      •   be delayed in obtaining marketing approval for its product candidates      •   not obtain marketing approval at all      •   obtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired      •   obtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings that would reduce the potential market for its products or inhibit its ability to successfully commercialize its products     •   be subject to additional postmarketing restrictions andor testing requirements or     •   have the product removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval kalvista’s product development costs will also increase if it experiences delays in testing or marketing approvals kalvista does not know whether any of its preclinical studies or clinical trials will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule or at all significant preclinical or clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which kalvista may have the exclusive right to commercialize its product candidates or allow its competitors to bring products to market before it does and impair its ability to successfully commercialize its product candidates and may harm its business and results of operations if kalvista experiences delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in clinical trials its receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented and expenses for development of its product candidates could increase kalvista may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for its product candidates if kalvista is unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials to demonstrate safety and efficacy kalvista has just initiated the first clinical trials with kvd and plans to initiate the second clinical trials with kvd in the future and it does not know whether the planned or ongoing clinical trial will enroll subjects in a timely fashion require redesign of essential trial elements or be completed on its projected schedule in particular because kalvista is focused on patients with hae which is a rare disease its ability to enroll eligible patients in trials may be limited or may result in slower enrollment than kalvista anticipates in addition competitors have ongoing clinical trials for product candidates that treat the same indications as its product candidates and patients who would otherwise be eligible for its clinical trials may instead enroll in clinical trials of its competitors’ product candidates kalvista’s inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for its clinical trials would result in significant delays and could require it to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether  patient enrollment is affected by other factors including      •   the eligibility criteria for the study in question      •   the perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study      •   the efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials      •   the inability to identify and maintain a sufficient number of trial sites many of which may already be engaged in other clinical trial programs including some that may be for the same disease indication     •   the patient referral practices of physicians      •   the proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients      •   ambiguous or negative interim results of its clinical trials or results that are inconsistent with earlier results      •   feedback from the mhra fda irbs data safety monitoring boards or a comparable foreign regulatory authority or results from earlier stage or concurrent preclinical and clinical studies that might require modifications to the protocol      •   decisions by the mhra fda irbs a comparable foreign regulatory authority or kalvista or recommendations by data safety monitoring boards to suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time for safety issues or for any other reason and      •   unacceptable riskbenefit profile or unforeseen safety issues or adverse effects  enrollment delays in kalvista’s clinical trials may result in increased development costs for its product candidates which would cause the value of its company to decline and limit its ability to obtain additional financing    if serious adverse events or unacceptable side effects are identified during the development of its product candidates kalvista may need to abandon or limit its development of some of its product candidates   if its product candidates are associated with undesirable effects in preclinical or clinical trials or have characteristics that are unexpected kalvista may need to interrupt delay or abandon their development or limit development to more narrow uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent less severe or more acceptable from a riskbenefit perspective there are risks inherent in the intravitreal administration of drugs like kvd such as intraocular inflammation or pressure sterile and culture positive endophthalmitis corneal decomposition retinal detachment and retinal tear which can cause injury to the eye and other complications for example two drugrelated adverse events were reported in the phase  clinical trial of kvd and both events were also considered related to study procedures the first of these was a case of eye inflammation considered of mild intensity and possibly related to study drug and study procedure the second was a case of increased intraocular pressure considered of severe intensity and related to study procedure and probably related to study drug however additional or more severe side effects may be identified through further clinical studies these or other drugrelated side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled subjects to complete the trial or result in potential product liability claims any of these occurrences may harm its business financial condition and prospects significantly risks related to regulatory approval of kalvista’s product candidates and other legal compliance matters  if kalvista is not able to obtain or if there are delays in obtaining required regulatory approvals it will not be able to commercialize its product candidates and its ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired  kalvista’s product candidates must be approved by the fda pursuant to a new drug application “ nda ” in the united states and by the european medicines agency the “ ema ” and similar regulatory authorities outside the united states prior to commercialization the process of obtaining marketing approvals both in the united states and abroad is expensive and takes many years if approval is obtained at all and can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors including the type complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved failure to obtain marketing approval for a product candidate will prevent kalvista from commercializing the product candidate kalvista has not received approval to market any of its product candidates from regulatory authorities in any jurisdiction kalvista has no experience in filing and supporting the applications necessary to gain marketing approvals and expect to rely on third party cros to assist it in this process securing marketing approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate’s safety and efficacy securing marketing approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to and inspection of manufacturing facilities by the regulatory authorities kalvista’s product candidates may not be effective may be only moderately effective or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects toxicities or other characteristics that may preclude its obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that its data are insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical clinical or other studies in addition varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay limit or prevent marketing approval of a product candidate changes in marketing approval policies during the development period changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application may also cause delays in or prevent the approval of an application  any marketing approval kalvista ultimately obtains may be limited or subject to restrictions or postapproval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable  if kalvista experiences delays in obtaining approval or if it fails to obtain approval of its product candidates the commercial prospects for its product candidates may be harmed and its ability to generate revenues will be materially impaired   kalvista may seek orphan drug exclusivity for some of its product candidates and kalvista may be unsuccessful  regulatory authorities in some jurisdictions including the united states and europe may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs under the orphan drug act the fda may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition which is generally defined as a disease with a patient population of fewer than  individuals in the united states     generally if a product with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation the product is entitled to a peri od of marketing exclusivity which precludes the ema or the fda from approving another marketing application for the same drug for the same indication during the period of exclusivity the applicable period is seven years in the united states and ten years in europe the european exclusivity period can be reduced to six years if a drug no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation or if the drug is sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is no longer justified orphan drug exclusivity may be lost if the fda or ema determines that the request for designation was materially defective if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition   even if kalvista obtains orphan drug exclusivity for a product candidate that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product candidate from competition because different drugs can be approved for the same condition even after an orphan drug is approved the fda can subsequently approve a different drug for the same condition if the fda concludes that the later drug is clinically superior in that it is shown to be safer more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care   a fast track designation by the fda even if granted for any of kalvista’s product candidates may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process and does not increase the likelihood that its product candidates will receive marketing approval  kalvista does not currently have fast track designation for any of its product candidates but may seek such designation if a drug is intended for the treatment of a serious or lifethreatening condition and the drug demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for this condition the drug sponsor may apply for fda fast track designation the fda has broad discretion whether or not to grant this designation even if kalvista believes a particular product candidate is eligible for this designation it cannot assure that the fda would decide to grant it even if it does receive fast track designation kalvista may not experience a faster development process review or approval compared to conventional fda procedures the fda may withdraw fast track designation if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from its clinical development program many drugs that have received fast track designation have failed to obtain drug approval   a breakthrough therapy designation by the fda even if granted for any of kalvista’s product candidates may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process and does not increase the likelihood that its product candidates will receive marketing approval  kalvista does not currently have breakthrough therapy designation for any of its product candidates but may seek such designation a breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended alone or in combination with one or more other drugs to treat a serious or lifethreatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development for drugs that have been designated as breakthrough therapies interaction and communication between the fda and the sponsor can help to identify the most efficient path for development  designation as a breakthrough therapy is within the discretion of the fda accordingly even if kalvista believes after completing early clinical trials that one of its product candidates meets the criteria for designation as a breakthrough therapy the fda may disagree and instead determine not to make such designation in any event the receipt of a breakthrough therapy designation for a product candidate may not result in a faster development process review or approval compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional fda procedures and does not assure ultimate approval by the fda in addition even if one or more of its product candidates qualify as breakthrough therapies the fda may later decide that such product candidates no longer meet the conditions for qualification failure to obtain marketing approval in international jurisdictions would prevent kalvista’s product candidates from being marketed abroad  in order to market and sell its products in the european union and many other jurisdictions kalvista or its third party collaborators must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements the approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing the time required to obtain approval may differ substantially from that required to obtain mhra or fda approval the regulatory approval process outside the united kingdom and united states generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining respectively mhra or fda approval in addition in many countries outside the united states it is required that the product be approved for reimbursement before the product can be approved for sale in that country kalvista or these third parties may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the united states on a timely basis if at all approval by the mhra or fda does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions and approval by one regulatory authority outside the united states does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the fda kalvista may not be able to file for marketing approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize its products in any market    any product candidate for which kalvista obtains marketing approval will be subject to extensive postmarketing regulatory requirements and could be subject to postmarketing restrictions or withdrawal from the market and kalvista may be subject to penalties if it fails to comply with regulatory requirements or if it experiences unanticipated problems with its products when and if any of them are approved   kalvista’s product candidates and the activities associated with their development and commercialization including their testing manufacture recordkeeping labeling storage approval advertising promotion sale and distribution are subject to comprehensive regulation by the mhra fda and other regulatory authorities in the united states these requirements include submissions of safety and other postmarketing information and reports registration and listing requirements current good manufacturing practices “ cgmp ” requirements relating to manufacturing quality control quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents including periodic inspections by the fda and other regulatory authority requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping  the fda or other regulatory authorities may also impose requirements for costly postmarketing studies or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product the fda closely regulates the postapproval marketing and promotion of drugs to ensure drugs are marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling the fda imposes stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding use of their products and if kalvista promotes its products beyond their approved indications it may be subject to enforcement action for offlabel promotion violations of the federal food drug and cosmetic act relating to the promotion of prescription drugs may lead to investigations alleging violations of federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws as well as state consumer protection laws  in addition later discovery of previously unknown adverse events or other problems with kalvista’s products manufacturers or manufacturing processes or failure to comply with regulatory requirements may yield various results including      •   restrictions on such products manufacturers or manufacturing processes     •   restrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product            •   restrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product      •   restrictions on product distribution or use      •   requirements to conduct postmarketing studies or clinical trials      •   warning or untitled letters      •   withdrawal of the products from the market      •   refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that it submits      •   recall of products      •   fines restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenues      •   suspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals      •   refusal to permit the import or export of its products      •   product seizure or      •   injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties  noncompliance with european union requirements regarding safety monitoring or pharmacovigilance and with requirements related to the development of products for the pediatric population can also result in significant financial penalties similarly failure to comply with the european union’s requirements regarding the protection of personal information can also lead to significant penalties and sanctions   recently enacted and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for kalvista to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize its product candidates and affect the prices kalvista may obtain  in the united states and some foreign jurisdictions there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of its product candidates restrict or regulate postapproval activities and affect its ability to profitably sell any product candidates for which kalvista obtains marketing approval     for example in  president obama signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and educ ation affordability reconciliation act collectively the  “ppaca”  among the provisions of the ppaca of importance to its potential product candidates are the following      •   an annual nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents      •   an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the medicaid drug rebate program      •   expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws including the false claims act and the antikickback statute new government investigative powers and enhanced penalties for noncompliance      •   a new medicare part d coverage gap discount program in which manufacturers must agree to offer  pointofsale discounts off negotiated prices      •   extension of manufacturers’ medicaid rebate liability      •   expansion of eligibility criteria for medicaid programs      •   expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the public health service pharmaceutical pricing program      •   new requirements to report financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals      •   a new requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians and      •   a new patientcentered outcomes research institute to oversee identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research along with funding for such research  in addition other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ppaca was enacted these changes included aggregate reductions to medicare payments to providers of up to  per fiscal year starting in  in january  president obama signed into law the american taxpayer relief act of  which among other things reduced medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years these new laws may result in additional reductions in medicare and other healthcare funding  kalvista expects that the ppaca as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that it receives for any approved product any reduction in reimbursement from medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors the implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent kalvista from being able to generate revenue attain profitability or commercialize its products  legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand postapproval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products kalvista cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted or whether the fda regulations guidance or interpretations will be changed or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of its product candidates if any may be in addition increased scrutiny by the us congress of the fda’s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval as well as subject kalvista to more stringent product labeling and postmarketing testing and other requirements governments outside the united states tend to impose strict price controls which may adversely affect kalvista’s revenues if any  in some countries particularly the countries of the european union the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in these countries pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries kalvista may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the costeffectiveness of its product candidate to other available therapies if reimbursement of its products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels its business could be harmed possibly materially      if kalvista fails to comply with environmental health and safety laws and regulations it could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could harm its business   kalvista is subject to numerous environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling use storage treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes kalvista’s operations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials including chemicals and biological materials kalvista’s operations also produce hazardous waste products kalvista generally contracts with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes kalvista cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials in the event of contamination or injury resulting from its use of hazardous materials kalvista could be held liable for any resulting damages and any liability could exceed its resources kalvista also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations  although kalvista maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover it for costs and expenses it may incur due to injuries to its employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities kalvista does not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against it in connection with its storage or disposal of biological hazardous or radioactive materials  in addition kalvista may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental health and safety laws and regulations these current or future laws and regulations may impair its discovery preclinical development or production efforts kalvista’s failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines penalties or other sanctions risks related to the commercialization of kalvista’s product candidates  even if any of its product candidates receives marketing approval kalvista may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians patients third party payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success  if any of its product candidates receives marketing approval kalvista may nonetheless fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians patients third party payors and others in the medical community in addition physicians patients and third party payors may prefer other novel products to kalvista’s if its product candidates do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance kalvista may not generate significant product revenues and kalvista may not become profitable the degree of market acceptance of kalvista’s product candidates if approved for commercial sale will depend on a number of factors including     •   the efficacy and safety and potential advantages and disadvantages compared to alternative treatments      •   the ability to offer its products for sale at competitive prices      •   the convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments      •   the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies      •   the strength of its marketing and distribution support      •   the availability of third party coverage and adequate reimbursement including patient costsharing programs such as copays and deductibles      •   the ability to develop or partner with thirdparty collaborators to develop companion diagnostics      •   the prevalence and severity of any side effects and      •   any restrictions on the use of its products together with other medications kalvista currently has no marketing and sales force if kalvista is unable to establish effective marketing and sales capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell its product candidates kalvista may not be able to effectively market and sell its product candidates if approved or generate product revenues kalvista currently does not have a marketing or sales team for the marketing sales and distribution of any of its product candidates that are able to obtain regulatory approval in order to commercialize any product candidates kalvista must build on a territorybyterritory basis marketing sales distribution managerial and other nontechnical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services and kalvista may not be successful in doing so if its product candidates receive regulatory approval kalvista intends to establish an internal sales and marketing team with technical expertise and supporting distribution capabilities to commercialize its product candidates which will be expensive and time consuming and will require significant attention of its executive officers to manage any failure or delay in the development of its internal sales marketing and distribution capabilities would adversely impact the commercialization of any of its products that kalvista obtains approval to market with    respect to the commercialization of all or certain of its product   candidates kalvista may choose to col laborate either globally or on a territorybyterritory basis with third parties that have direct sales forces and established distribution systems either to augment its own sales force and distribution systems or in lieu of its own sales force and dist ribution systems if kalvista is unable to enter into such arrangements when needed on acceptable terms or at all kalvista may not be able to successfully commercialize any of its product candidates that receive regulatory approval or any such commerciali zation may experience delays or limitations if kalvista is not successful in commercializing its product candidates either on its own or through collaborations with one or more third parties its future product revenue will suffer and kalvista may incur significant additional losses kalvista faces substantial competition which may result in others discovering developing or commercializing competing products before or more successfully than kalvista does the development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive kalvista faces competition with respect to its current product candidates and will face competition with respect to any product candidates that kalvista may seek to develop or commercialize in the future from major pharmaceutical companies specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide there are a number of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently market and sell products or are pursuing the development of products for the treatment of the disease indications for which kalvista is developing its product candidates some of these competitive products and therapies are based on scientific approaches that are the same as or similar to kalvista’s approach and others are based on entirely different approaches potential competitors also include academic institutions government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research development manufacturing and commercialization  specifically there are a large number of companies developing or marketing treatments for hereditary angioedema and diabetic macular edema including many major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in hae kalvista expects to face competition from several fdaapproved therapeutics including cinryze marketed by shire in the united states and europe for the prevention of angioedema attacks in adults and adolescents firazyr marketed by shire in the united states europe and certain other geographic territories for the treatment of acute angioedema attacks in adult patients kalbitor an injectable plasma kallikrein inhibitor marketed by shire for the resolution of acute attacks in adolescent and adult hae patients berinert marketed by csl behring for the treatment of acute abdominal facial or laryngeal attacks of hae in adults and adolescents and ruconest marketed by pharming group in europe and salix pharmaceuticals in the united states for the treatment of acute angioedema attacks in adult patients kalvista is also aware of companies including shire biocryst pharmaceuticals and global blood therapeutics that are engaged in the clinical development of other product candidates including a plasma kallikrein monoclonal antibody and oral plasma kallikrein inhibitors for the treatment of hae patients  in dme kalvista expects to face competition from several fdaapproved therapeutics including antivegf therapies lucentis marketed by roche and novartis eylea marketed by regeneron and off label use of avastin from roche kalvista also faces competition from various corticoid steroids including extended release formulations lluvien marketed by alimera and ozurdex marketed by allergan kalvista also expects to compete with generic corticosteroids such as acetonide fluocinolone and dexamethasone kalvista is also aware of a number of other companies who have product candidates in early clinical trials including novartis glaxosmithkline boehringer ingelheim roche regeneron ohr pharmaceutical aerpio therapeutics and allegro ophthalmics although kalvista is not aware that any of these therapies target plasma kallikrein  kalvista’s commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if its competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer more effective have fewer or less severe side effects are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that kalvista may develop in addition its ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products generic products are expected to become available over the coming years potentially creating pricing pressure if its product candidates achieve marketing approval kalvista expects that they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products  many of the companies against which kalvista is competing or against which kalvista may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development manufacturing preclinical testing conducting clinical trials obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than kalvista does mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of its competitors smaller and other early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies these third parties compete with kalvista in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to or necessary for kalvista’s programs     the insurance coverage and reimbursement status of newlyapproved products is uncertain failure to obtain or maintain adequate coverage and reimbursement for new o r current products could limit kalvista’s ability to market those products and decrease its ability to generate revenue   the availability and extent of reimbursement by governmental and private payors is essential for most patients to be able to afford expensive treatments sales of kalvista’s product candidates will depend substantially both domestically and abroad on the extent to which the costs of kalvista’s product candidates will be paid by health maintenance managed care pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations or reimbursed by government health administration authorities private health coverage insurers and other thirdparty payors if reimbursement is not available or is available only to limited levels kalvista may not be able to successfully commercialize its product candidates even if coverage is provided the approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow kalvista to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize a sufficient return on its investment  there is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products in the united states the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by the centers for medicare  medicaid services “ cms ” an agency within the us department of health and human services as cms decides whether and to what extent a new medicine will be covered and reimbursed under medicare private payors tend to follow cms to a substantial degree it is difficult to predict what cms will decide with respect to reimbursement for fundamentally novel products such as kalvista’s as there is no body of established practices and precedents for these new products reimbursement agencies in europe may be more conservative than cms outside the united states international operations are generally subject to extensive governmental price controls and other market regulations and kalvista believes the increasing emphasis on costcontainment initiatives in europe canada and other countries has and will continue to put pressure on the pricing and usage of its product candidates in many countries the prices of medical products are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems in general the prices of medicines under such systems are substantially lower than in the united states other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits additional foreign price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that kalvista is able to charge for its product candidates accordingly in markets outside the united states the reimbursement for its products may be reduced compared with the united states and may be insufficient to generate commercially reasonable revenues and profits  moreover increasing efforts by governmental and thirdparty payors in the united states and abroad to cap or reduce healthcare costs may cause such organizations to limit both coverage and level of reimbursement for new products approved and as a result they may not cover or provide adequate payment for kalvista’s product candidates kalvista expects to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of any of its product candidates due to the trend toward managed healthcare the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative changes the downward pressure on healthcare costs in general particularly prescription drugs and surgical procedures and other treatments has become very intense as a result increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products into the healthcare market  in addition many private payors contract with commercial vendors who sell software that provide guidelines that attempt to limit utilization of and therefore reimbursement for certain products deemed to provide limited benefit to existing alternatives such organizations may set guidelines that limit reimbursement or utilization of its products  product liability lawsuits against kalvista could cause it to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of any products that kalvista may develop  kalvista faces an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of its product candidates in human clinical trials and will face an even greater risk if it commercially sells any products that it may develop if kalvista cannot successfully defend against claims that its product candidates or products caused injuries it will incur substantial liabilities regardless of merit or eventual outcome liability claims may result in      •   decreased demand for any product candidates or products that kalvista may develop      •   injury to its reputation and significant negative media attention      •   withdrawal of clinical trial participants      •   significant costs to defend the related litigation      •   substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients      •   loss of revenue      •   reduced resources of its management to pursue its business strategy and      •   the inability to commercialize any products that kalvista may develop     kalvista currently holds  in product liability insurance coverage in the aggregate with a per incident limit of  which may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that kalvista may incur kalvista may need to increase its insurance coverage as it expands its clinical trials or if it commences commercialization of its product candidates insurance coverage is increasingly expensive kalvista may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise   risks related to kalvista’s dependence on third parties  future discovery and preclinical development collaborations may be important to kalvista if kalvista is unable to maintain these collaborations or if these collaborations are not successful its business could be adversely affected  for some of its product candidates kalvista may in the future determine to collaborate with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for development of products kalvista faces significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators kalvista’s ability to reach a definitive agreement for any collaboration will depend among other things upon its assessment of the collaborator’s resources and expertise the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator’s evaluation of a number of factors if kalvista is unable to reach agreements with suitable collaborators on a timely basis on acceptable terms or at all kalvista may have to curtail the development of a product candidate reduce or delay its development program or one or more of its other development programs delay its potential development schedule or reduce the scope of research activities or increase its expenditures and undertake discovery or preclinical development activities at its own expense if it fails to enter into collaborations and do not have sufficient funds or expertise to undertake the necessary development activities kalvista may not be able to further develop its product candidates or continue to develop its product candidates and its business may be materially and adversely affected  future collaborations kalvista may enter into may involve the following risks      •   collaborators may have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations      •   collaborators may not perform their obligations as expected      •   changes in the collaborators’ strategic focus or available funding or external factors such as an acquisition may divert resources or create competing priorities      •   collaborators may delay discovery and preclinical development provide insufficient funding for product development of targets selected by kalvista stop or abandon discovery and preclinical development for a product candidate repeat or conduct new discovery and preclinical development for a product candidate      •   collaborators could independently develop or develop with third parties products that compete directly or indirectly with kalvista’s products or product candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed than kalvista’s products      •   product candidates discovered in collaboration with kalvista may be viewed by its collaborators as competitive with their own product candidates or products which may cause collaborators to cease to devote resources to the development of its product candidates      •   disagreements with collaborators including disagreements over proprietary rights contract interpretation or the preferred course of development might cause delays or termination of the discovery preclinical development or commercialization of product candidates might lead to additional responsibilities for kalvista with respect to product candidates or might result in litigation or arbitration any of which would be timeconsuming and expensive     •   collaborators may not properly maintain or defend its intellectual property rights or intellectual property rights licensed to kalvista or may use its proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate its intellectual property or proprietary information or expose kalvista to potential litigation      •   collaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties which may expose kalvista to litigation and potential liability and      •   collaborations may be terminated for the convenience of the collaborator and if terminated kalvista could be required to raise additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates     additionally subject to its contractual obligations to kalvista if a collaborator is involved in a business combination the collaborator might deemphasize or terminate the development of any of kalvista’s product candidates if one of kalvista’s collaborators terminates its agreement with kalvista it may find kalvista more difficult to attract new collaborators and kalvista’s perception in the business and financial communi ties could be adversely affected   if kalvista’s collaborations do not result in the successful development of products or product candidates product candidates could be delayed and kalvista may need additional resources to develop product candidates all of the risks relating to product development regulatory approval and commercialization described in this proxy statement also apply to the activities of its collaborators  kalvista contracts with third parties for the manufacture of its product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing and expects to continue to do so for commercialization this reliance on third parties increases the risk that kalvista will not have sufficient quantities of its product candidates or products at an acceptable cost and quality which could delay prevent or impair its development or commercialization efforts  kalvista does not own or operate facilities for the manufacture of its product candidates and it does not have any manufacturing personnel kalvista currently has no plans to build its own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities kalvista relies and expects to continue to rely on third parties for the manufacture of its product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing kalvista will rely on third parties as well for commercial manufacture if any of its product candidates receive marketing approval kalvista reviews the manufacturing process for each of its candidates and assesses the risk to supply and as appropriate establishes multiple manufacturers andor establishes stock levels to support future activities and does not believe it is currently substantially dependent on any one third party despite the drug substance and product risk management this reliance on third parties presents a risk that kalvista will not have sufficient quantities of its product candidates or products or such quantities at an acceptable cost or quality which could delay prevent or impair its development or commercialization efforts  any performance failure on the part of its existing or future manufacturers of drug substance or drug products could delay clinical development or marketing approval kalvista does not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply if current suppliers cannot supply kalvista with its phase  requirements as agreed kalvista may be required to identify alternative manufacturers which would lead it to incur added costs and delays in identifying and qualifying any such replacement  the formulation used in early studies is not a final formulation for commercialization additional changes may be required by the fda or other regulatory authorities on specifications and storage conditions these may require additional studies and may delay its clinical trials  kalvista expects to rely on third party manufacturers or third party collaborators for the manufacture of commercial supply of any other product candidates for which its collaborators or it obtains marketing approval  kalvista also expect to rely on other third parties to store and distribute drug supplies for its clinical trials any performance failure on the part of its distributors could delay clinical development or marketing approval of its product candidates or commercialization of its products producing additional losses and depriving it of potential product revenue  kalvista may be unable to establish any agreements with third party manufacturers or to do so on acceptable terms even if kalvista is able to establish agreements with third party manufacturers reliance on third party manufacturers entails additional risks including      •   reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance      •   the possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party      •   the possible misappropriation of its proprietary information including its trade secrets and knowhow and      •   the possible termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for kalvista  third party manufacturers may not be able to comply with cgmp regulations or similar regulatory requirements outside the united states kalvista’s failure or the failure of its third party manufacturers to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on kalvista including clinical holds fines injunctions civil penalties delays suspension or withdrawal of approvals license revocation seizures or recalls of product candidates or products operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of its products     kalvista’s product candidates and any products that kalvista may develop may compete with other product candidates and products for access to manufacturing facilities there are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under cgmp regulations and that might be capable of manufacturing for kalvista   kalvista’s current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of its product candidates or products may adversely affect its future profit margins and its ability to commercialize any products that receive marketing approval on a timely and competitive basis    risks related to kalvista’s intellectual property  if kalvista is unable to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for its technology and products or if the scope of the intellectual property protection obtained is not sufficiently broad its competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or identical to kalvista’s and its ability to successfully commercialize its technology and products may be impaired  kalvista’s success depends in large part on its ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the european union the united states and other countries with respect to its proprietary technology and products kalvista seeks to protect its proprietary position by filing patent applications in the united states and abroad related to its novel technologies and product candidates this patent portfolio includes issued patents and pending patent applications covering compositions of matter and methods of use  the patent prosecution process is expensive and timeconsuming and kalvista may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner kalvista may choose not to seek patent protection for certain innovations and may choose not to pursue patent protection in certain jurisdictions and under the laws of certain jurisdictions patents or other intellectual property rights may be unavailable or limited in scope it is also possible that kalvista will fail to identify patentable aspects of its discovery and preclinical development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection moreover in some circumstances it may not have the right to control the preparation filing and prosecution of patent applications or to maintain the patents covering technology that kalvista licenses from third parties therefore these patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of its business  the patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation in addition the laws of foreign countries may not protect its rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states for example india and china do not allow patents for methods of treating the human body publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries and patent applications in the united states and other jurisdictions are typically not published until  months after filing or in some cases not at all therefore kalvista cannot know with certainty whether it was the first to make the inventions claimed in its owned or licensed patents or pending patent applications or that it was the first to file for patent protection of such inventions as a result the issuance scope validity enforceability and commercial value of its patent rights are highly uncertain kalvista’s pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect its technology or products in whole or in part or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the european union the united states and other countries may diminish the value of its patents or narrow the scope of its patent protection  recent patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of its patent applications and the enforcement or defense of its issued patents on september   the leahysmith america invents act the “ leahysmith act ” was signed into law the leahysmith act includes a number of significant changes to united states patent law these include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation the uspto recently developed new regulations and procedures to govern administration of the leahysmith act and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the leahysmith act and in particular the first to file provisions only became effective on march   accordingly it is not clear what if any impact the leahysmith act will have on the operation of kalvista’s business however the leahysmith act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of its patent applications and the enforcement or defense of its issued patents all of which could have a material adverse effect on its business and financial condition     moreover kalvista may be subject to a third party preissuance submission of prior art to the uspto or become involved in opposition derivation reexamination inter partes review postgrant review or interference proceedings challenging its patent rights or the patent rights of others an adverse determination in any such submission proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of or invalidate its patent rights allow third parties to commercialize its technology or prod ucts and compete directly with kalvista without payment to it or result in its inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third party patent rights in addition if the breadth or strength of protection provided by its patents and patent applications is threatened it could dissuade companies from collaborating with kalvista to license develop or commercialize current or future product candidates   even if kalvista’s owned and licensed patent applications issue as patents they may not issue in a form that will provide it with any meaningful protection prevent competitors from competing with it or otherwise provide it with any competitive advantage kalvista’s competitors may be able to circumvent its owned or licensed patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a noninfringing manner  the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship scope validity or enforceability and its owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the united states and abroad such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or freedom to operate or in patent claims being narrowed invalidated or held unenforceable in whole or in part which could limit kalvista’s ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products or limit the duration of the patent protection of kalvista’s technology and products given the amount of time required for the development testing and regulatory review of new product candidates patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized as a result kalvista’s owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide it with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to kalvista’s  the risks described elsewhere pertaining to its patents and other intellectual property rights also apply to the intellectual property rights that kalvista licenses and any failure to obtain maintain and enforce these rights could have a material adverse effect on its business in some cases kalvista may not have control over the prosecution maintenance or enforcement of the patents that it licenses and its licensors may fail to take the steps that kalvista believes are necessary or desirable in order to obtain maintain and enforce the licensed patents any inability on kalvista’s part to protect adequately its intellectual property may have a material adverse effect on its business operating results and financial position  obtaining and maintaining patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural document submission fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies and patent protection for kalvista’s programs could be reduced or eliminated for noncompliance with these requirements  periodic maintenance fees renewal fees annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents andor applications will be due to be paid to the uspto and various governmental patent agencies outside of the united states in several stages over the lifetime of the patents andor applications kalvista has systems in place to remind it to pay these fees and it employs an outside firm and relies on its outside counsel to pay these fees due to nonus patent agencies the uspto and various nonus governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural documentary fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process kalvista employs reputable law firms and other professionals to help it comply and in many cases an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules however there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction in such an event kalvista’s competitors might be able to enter the market and this circumstance would have a material adverse effect on its business    kalvista may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce its patents or other intellectual property which could be expensive time consuming and unsuccessful  because competition in kalvista’s industry is intense competitors may infringe or otherwise violate its issued patents patents of its licensors or other intellectual property to counter infringement or unauthorized use kalvista may be required to file infringement claims which can be expensive and time consuming any claims kalvista asserts against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against it alleging that kalvista infringes their patents in addition in a patent infringement proceeding a court may decide that a patent of kalvista’s is invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part construe the patent’s claims narrowly or refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that its patents do not cover the technology in question an adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of its patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly kalvista may also elect to enter into license agreements in order to settle patent infringement claims or to resolve disputes prior to litigation and any such license agreements may require kalvista to pay royalties and other fees that could be significant furthermore because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation there is a risk that some of its confidential information could be compromised by disclosure     kalvista may need to license certain intellectual property from third parties and such licenses may not be available or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms   a third party may hold intellectual property including patent rights that are important or necessary to the development of kalvista’s products it may be necessary for kalvista to use the patented or proprietary technology of third parties to commercialize its products in which case it would be required to obtain a license from these third parties on commercially reasonable terms or its business could be harmed possibly materially although kalvista believes that licenses to these patents are available from these third parties on commercially reasonable terms if it was not able to obtain a license or were not able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms its business could be harmed possibly materially  third parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that kalvista is infringing their intellectual property rights the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of its business  kalvista’s commercial success depends upon its ability and the ability of its collaborators to develop manufacture market and sell its product candidates and use its proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties there is considerable intellectual property litigation in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries kalvista may become party to or threatened with future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to its products and technology including interference or derivation proceedings before the uspto third parties may assert infringement claims against kalvista based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future  if kalvista is found to infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights kalvista could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing and marketing its products and technology however kalvista may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all even if kalvista was able to obtain a license it could be nonexclusive thereby giving its competitors access to the same technologies licensed to it kalvista could be forced including by court order to cease commercializing the infringing technology or product in addition kalvista could be found liable for monetary damages including treble damages and attorneys’ fees if kalvista is found to have willfully infringed a patent a finding of infringement could prevent kalvista from commercializing its product candidates or force it to cease some of its business operations which could materially harm its business claims that kalvista has misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on its business    if kalvista is unable to protect the confidentiality of its trade secrets its business and competitive position would be harmed  in addition to seeking patents for some of its technology and product candidates kalvista also relies on trade secrets including unpatented knowhow technology and other proprietary information to maintain its competitive position kalvista seeks to protect these trade secrets in part by entering into nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them such as its employees corporate collaborators outside scientific collaborators contract manufacturers consultants advisors and other third parties kalvista seeks to protect its confidential proprietary information in part by entering into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with its employees and consultants however it cannot be certain that such agreements have been entered into with all relevant parties moreover to the extent kalvista enters into such agreements any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose its proprietary information including its trade secrets and kalvista may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult expensive and timeconsuming and the outcome is unpredictable in addition some courts inside and outside the united states are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets if any of its trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor kalvista would have no right to prevent them or those to whom they communicate them from using that technology or information to compete with kalvista if any of its trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor kalvista’s competitive position would be harmed  risks related to employee matters managing growth and macroeconomic conditions  kalvista’s future success depends on its ability to retain key executives and to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel  kalvista is highly dependent on the research and development clinical and business development expertise of t andrew crockett its cofounder and chief executive officer christopher yea phd its chief development officer and edward feener phd its cofounder and chief scientific officer as well as the other principal members of its management scientific and clinical team although kalvista has entered into employment letter agreements with its executive officers each of them may terminate their employment with it at any time kalvista does not maintain “key person” insurance for any of its executives or other employees     recruiting and retaining qualified scientific clinical manufacturing sales and marketing personnel will also be critical to kalvista’s success the loss of the services of its executive officers or other key employees could impede the achievement of kalvista’s research development and commercialization objectives and seriously harm kalvista’s ability to successfully implement its business strategy furthermore replacing executive officers and key employees may be difficult and may tak e an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in kalvista’s industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to successfully develop gain regulatory approval of and commercialize products competition to hire from th is limited pool is intense and kalvista may be unable to hire train retain or motivate these key personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel kalvista also experienc es competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions in addition kalvista relies on consultants and advisors including scientific and clinical advisors to assist it in formulating its discovery and preclinical development and commercialization strategy kalvista’s consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than kalvista and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availa bility to provide services to kalvista if kalvista is unable to continue to attract and retain high quality personnel its ability to pursue its growth strategy will be limited     kalvista expects to expand its development and regulatory capabilities and potentially implement sales marketing and distribution capabilities and as a result kalvista may encounter difficulties in managing its growth which could disrupt its operations  kalvista expects to experience significant growth in the number of its employees and the scope of its operations particularly in the areas of drug development regulatory affairs and if any of its product candidates receives marketing approval sales marketing and distribution to manage its anticipated future growth kalvista must continue to implement and improve its managerial operational and financial systems expand its facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel due to its limited financial resources and the limited experience of its management team in managing a company with such anticipated growth kalvista may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of its operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel the expansion of its operations may lead to significant costs and may divert its management and business development resources any inability to manage growth could delay the execution of its business plans or disrupt its operations  unfavorable global economic conditions could adversely affect kalvista’s business financial condition or results of operations  kalvista’s results of operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy and in the global financial markets a severe or prolonged economic downturn such as the recent global financial crisis could result in a variety of risks to its business including its ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms if at all this is particularly true in europe where the united kingdom’s vote to leave the european union has created additional economic uncertainty a weak or declining economy could also strain its suppliers possibly resulting in supply disruption any of the foregoing could harm its business and kalvista cannot anticipate all of the ways in which the current economic climate and financial market conditions could adversely impact its business  kalvista’s business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures  despite the implementation of security measures its internal computer systems and those of its cros collaborators and thirdparties on whom kalvista relies are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses unauthorized access natural disasters terrorism war and telecommunication and electrical failures furthermore kalvista has little or no control over the security measures and computer systems of its thirdparty collaborators while kalvista and to its knowledge its third party collaborators have not experienced any such system failure accident or security breach to date if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in its operations or its third party collaborators it could result in a material disruption of its drug development programs for example the loss of research data could delay development of its product candidates and the loss of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing or planned clinical trials could result in delays in its regulatory approval efforts and kalvista may incur substantial costs to attempt to recover or reproduce the data if any disruption or security breach resulted in a loss of or damage to its data or applications or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information kalvista could incur liability andor the further development of its product candidates could be delayed item  unregistered sales of equity securities and use of proceeds not applicable item  defaults
