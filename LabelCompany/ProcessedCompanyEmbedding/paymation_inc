without some or all of these specific details in other instances well known process operations have not been described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present embodiments  now referring to fig  a payment instrument processing system  will be described the payment instrument processing system  includes an issuer system  a card network system  and an acquirer system  the issuer system  communicates with the card network system  over link  the card network system  communicates with the acquirer system  over link   the issuer system  may be part of a bank or a financial institution system that issues a payment instrument to a payer the payment instrument may be based on a specific instrument network system some of the well known card network systems are card systems based on visa® mastercard® discover® and american express® card network system the issuer system  may further include a card management system  card management system  may be sometimes referred to as a cms  cms  further includes a cms data store   when an issuer issues a payment instrument to a payer various information related to the payment instrument and the payer is stored in the cms data store  some of the information stored in the cms data store  may be name of the payer address of the payer contact information for the payer payment instrument identification number expiration date of the payment instrument amount of available funds on the payment instrument the cms data store  may also store one or more additional identification number specifically issued to the payment instrument some of the information stored in the cms data store  may be physically printed on the payment instrument the issuer system  further includes a payer controlled module  the payer controlled module  is configured to communicate with a payer computer  over link  functions and features of payer controlled module  will be later described in detail  an acquirer system  may be a card processing system run by one or more acquirers sometimes acquirers may be banking institutions the acquirer system  includes a card information processing system  which may be sometimes referred to as a cips  the cips  is configured to communicate with a card reader device  over a link  in general an acquirer provides a card reader device  at a point of sale location for example to a merchant to receive information stored in a payment instrument these types of transactions are referred to as a card present cp transactions  in some examples information related to the payment instrument may be entered into a computer for example in a payment screen of a web application for example in some examples the cips  may be configured to present a payment screen on a computing device  over a link  to receive information related to the payment instrument these types of transactions are referred to as a card not present cnp transactions cp transactions and cnp transactions may require entry of additional information to validate the transaction in some examples entry of additional information is either physically present in the payment instrument or only known to the payer of the payment instrument  the card network system  includes an issuer routing system  and an acquirer routing system  the issuer routing system  is configured to selectively communicate with the issuer system  over link  based on selective information stored in the payment instrument the acquirer routing system  is configured to selectively communicate with an acquirer system  over link  based on selective identification information received from the acquirer system as one skilled in the art appreciates the card network system  acts as a transaction routing system to selectively route communication between an acquirer system  and a corresponding issuer system  an example payment transaction processing for a payment instrument will now be described  each payment transaction generally includes an authorization cycle and a settlement cycle authorization cycle is initiated to approve or disapprove a requested payment a settlement cycle is initiated periodically to confirm conclusion of a payment transaction so that acquirer can pay the approved payment amount to a merchant and issuer can bill a payer for the approved payment amount  authorization cycle is started when a payment instrument information is entered and submitted to the acquirer system  for example a payment transaction information may include information related to the payment instrument along with the amount to be paid the payment transaction information is received by the cips  of the acquirer system  cipc  may receive payment transaction information from either a computing device  in a cnp transaction or from a card reader system  in a cp transaction the acquirer system  decodes a portion of the payment transaction information to determine the corresponding card network the payment instrument belongs to based on the card network the payment instrument belongs to the payment transaction information is transmitted to the corresponding card network system for example the payment transaction information is transmitted to card network system  over link  now the acquirer system  awaits for an approval or disapproval of the payment transaction from the card network system   the card network system  decodes a portion of the payment transaction information to determine the specific card issuer and transmits the payment transaction information to the card issuer system for example the card network system  may decode a portion of the payment transaction information and determine the specific card issuer by using the issuer routing system  in some examples the issuer routing system  transmits the payment transaction information to the card issuer system  over link  now the card network system  awaits for an approval or disapproval of the payment transaction by the card issuer system   upon receipt of the payment transaction information the card issuer system  determines if the requested payment should be approved based on one or more predefined criteria for example the card issuer system  may use the cms  to determine if the payment transaction should be approved or disapproved for example cms  may check the credit limit established for the payment instrument and validation of the payment instrument identification information stored in the cms data store  if there is a match the cms  may indicate to the card issuer system  to communicate an approval message if there is no match the cms  may indicate to the card issuer system  to communicate a disapproval message  the card issuer system  sends a return message to the card network system  either approving or disapproving the payment transaction the card network system  in turn forwards the return message of approval or disapproval to the acquirer system  for example the card issuer system  may use the acquirer routing system  to determine the corresponding acquirer system to forward the return message  the acquirer system  receives the return message over link  upon receipt of the return message based on the message content approval or disapproval the acquirer system  send a message to the card reader system  or the computing device  indicating the approval or disapproval of the transaction for example the cips  of the acquirer system  may communicate with the computing device  or the card reader system  to indicate the approval or disapproval of the transaction this completes the approval cycle of the payment transaction  a settlement cycle is initiated periodically to confirm conclusion of a payment transaction so that approved payment amount may be paid to the merchant and approved payment amount is collected from the payer or the payment instrument holder for example settlement cycle may be run periodically for example at the end of the day the acquirer system  compiles all the payment transactions that were approved and sends it to the card network system  the card network system  segregates all the payment transactions by its corresponding issuer system and sends specific completed payment transaction to the corresponding issuer system eventually as part of the conclusion of the settlement cycle each issuer pays the total approved amount owed to the corresponding acquirer the acquirer pays its merchant payment owed by the payer and the issuer collects the amount paid from the payer  having described an example payment transaction processing by the payment processing system  now the functions and features of the payer controlled module  will be described with reference to fig   fig  illustrates a block diagram of the payer controlled module  the cms  and payer computer  as one skilled in the art appreciates the payer controlled module  and cms  may be implemented in hardware software or a combination of hardware and software  payer controlled module  includes a pcm processor module  a pcm data store  a pc communication module  a payer configuration module  a cms communication module  and a transaction communication module  the pcm processor module  performs

data store  may be used to store and access various data values on a temporary or permanent basis  pc communication module  may be configured to communicate with the payer computer  for example the pc communication module  may be configured to communicate with a pcm configuration module  of the payer computer  over link  pc communication module  may also be configured to communicate with other functional modules of pcm  payer configuration module  is configured to set various parameters of the payer controlled module  which will be described in detail with reference to fig b for example payer configuration module  may communicate with the payer computer using the pc communication module  to receive various inputs for example from a payer based on the received input the payer configuration module  may store one or more parameters in the pcm data store in some examples payer configuration module  may communicate with the payer computer using the pc communication module  to present various input screens on the payer computer  the cms  may include a cms processor module  cms data store  pcm communication module  and cns communication module  the cms processor module  performs various processing functions of the cms  cms processor module  may be a hardware processor or a software processor configured to perform various arithmetic and logic functions cms data store  may be used to store and access various data values on a temporary or permanent basis the pcm communication module  is configured to communicate with pcm  over link  for example pcm communication module  may communicate with cms communication module  of pcm  the cns communication module  may be configured to communicate with cns  over link  as one skilled in the art appreciates cns communication module  and pcm communication module  may be configured to communicate with other functional modules of cms  in some examples the cns  may communicate with transaction communication module  of pcm  over link   now referring to fig a an example issuer table  that may be created and maintained by the issuer in the cms  is described the issuer table  may be stored in the cms data store  issuer table  maintains various attributes related to a payment instrument for example column  stores payment instrument identification number column  stores name of the payee column  stores credit limit of the payment instrument column  stores available credit for the payment instrument column  stores validity date for the payment instrument column  stores address of the payer column  stores city of the payer column  stores state of the payer column  stores zip code of the payer as one skilled in the art appreciates additional attributes related to the payer and the payment

compared against the payer set attributes as an example various information contained in the payment transaction information packet  of the request is compared against corresponding attributes stored in the payer table row that corresponds to the instrument identification number in one example the active status of the payment instrument is first checked for example if the active status in column  is set to enable or disable if the status of the payment instrument is set to disable the pcm  may return a message to the cms  indicating that the payment request should be denied or disapproved in some examples no other payer set attributes will be checked if the active field is set to disable if the status of the payment instrument is set to enable then the requested payment information is compared against other attributes set by the payer to generate a message indicative of approval or disapproval for example various fields of the payment transaction information packet  may be checked against attributes set by the payer for a match  for example payer instrument id  may be used to identify specific instrument id  stored in the payer table  then one or more attributes of the payment information packet  may be compared with associated fields of data corresponding to the instrument id  field that matches with the payer instrument id  for example merchant type  field may be used to compare with type of merchant  field in the payer table  merchant type  field may be used to compare with the type of merchant  field in the payer table  merchant location  field may be compared with geo location  field in the payer table  request datetime  field may be compared against date and time  field duration  and sleep time  field of the payer table  to confirm that a payment transaction is permitted during the time period when the request for payment approval was generated payment amount  may be compared with value per  field of the payer table to confirm the payment amount  is within the permitted value per transaction if the payment amount  is within the permitted value per transaction the total value  field may be compared with the payment amount  to confirm that the approval of the payment transaction will not exceed the total value  set in the payer table  additionally the  of transactions  field may be checked to see if this specific payment request approval is within the permitted number of transactions by the payer if this specific payment request approval is within the permitted number of transactions the  of transactions  field may be incremented by one in some examples upon approval of the payment transaction the  of transactions  field may be incremented by one further the total value  field may also be updated by subtracting the value of the transaction from the total value  field to reflect the updated total value  of the payer table   in block s if the requested payment information for example as received in one or more fields of the payment transaction information packet  matches or permitted per the payer set attributes a message indicative of approval is sent to the cms  if the requested payment information does not match the payer set attributes a message indicative of disapproval is sent to the cms   for example payer instrument id  may be used to identify specific instrument id  stored in the issuer table  then one or more attributes of the payment information packet  may be compared with associated fields of data corresponding to the instrument id  field that matches with the payer instrument id  for example payer name  field may be compared with name  of the payer for a match instrument validity date  may be compared with validity date  field for a match payer zipcode  field may be compared with zip code  field of the issuer table  payment amount  may be compared with available credit  field of the issuer table to confirm the payment amount  is within the available credit if the payment amount  is within the available credit  upon approval the available credit  field may be updated by subtracting the payment amount  from the previous available credit amount  if in block s the message indicative of disapproval is generated in block s a message rejecting payment request is sent to the card network system  in one example the cms  sends a message indicating disapproval of the payment request to the card network system   if in block s the message indicative of approval is generated in block s the request for payment approval is verified against issuer set attributes for example the instrument identification of payment instrument for the received request for payment approval is first extracted then based on the instrument identification for the payment instrument various fields of the payment transaction information packet  may be checked against attributes set by the issuer for a match as an example various fields of data of the payment transaction information packet  is compared against the attributes stored in the issuer table row that corresponds to the instrument identification number  in block  if the requested payment information for example as received in one or more fields of the payment transaction information packet  matches the issuer set attributes in block  a message approving payment request is sent to the card network system  for example the cms  sends a message approving the payment request to the card network system  if the requested payment information does not match the issuer set attributes in block  a message indicative of disapproval is sent to the card network system   as one skilled in the art appreciates payment approval systems operate on a rigid time frame to exchange messages between various systems in some examples the operations performed to verify request against payer set attributes and operations performed to verify request against issuer set attributes may be performed in parallel or independent of each other in some examples it may be preferable to send any messages to the card network system from the cms  for example if a payment request is disapproved by the pcm  it may be beneficial in some examples to pass the disapproval message through cms  so that cms  is aware of all transactions related to a payment instrument  fig  illustrates an example network environment  suitable for implementing embodiments

inventionthe dynamic personalizable automated finance management system afm described herein provides a financial management platform that allows users to easily generate a plurality of customized rules having conditions associated with one or more accounts thereby creating account plans each plan having one or more rules and each rule having one or more conditions in particular the conditionsrulesplans are able to define how much when and where to transfer money to and from the accounts based on user entered criteria or triggers upon which the conditions of the rulesplans are based in other words the afm gives a user the ability to schedule the payment of bills or the movement of money among different accounts depending on the status and activity of hisher accounts andor related conditions as a result the afm enables individuals to personalize the actions of their accounts beyond mere savings or bill payment to automatically and dynamically adjust to different personal financial situations or preferences accordingly the afm provides the advantage of allowing users to move money according to various scheduled rules thus allowing users at large to fully control their moneys incomes and payments based on highly customizable rules for example if a user schedules a payment for a future date heshe are able to set up a rule to skip the payment if hisher funding source account account from which the users own funds are taken has a low balance or increase the payment if hisher funding account balance is unusually high therefore at a time when a transfer is scheduled to be executed as determined by an entered frequency or an event such as a deposit made to an account andor the clearance thereof all of the users custom settings and rules are evaluated uniquely against all present related conditions to determine what dollar amount should be transferred when it should be transferred and where it should be transferred tofromthus the afm is able to be used to set up a fluctuating savings plan for a freelancer with highly variable income patterns create a specific revenue—split for business partners from one main account to multiple others set up a dedicated “save and purchase plan” for an item from an online retailer automatically pay bills as long as they are not unusually high and there exists at least a certain balance in the users funding account or passively repay debt among friends or family members further the afm provides a smart way to conditionally direct income payments or savings automatically mainly in response to fluctuations in the balance and cash—flow of a users funding source account but also possibly in response to many other measurable or readable conditions accordingly the afm provides users with a reliable passive solution for automatically sending receiving and moving different amounts of money according to fluctuations in the users incomes account balances or other digitally available variables from publicly accessible data such as stock prices or prices of products online to private data read through rd party application program interfaces in other words the afm is able to provide users with more control over the automation of their cash flow and purchases by incorporating scheduling with programmatic conditional rules which evaluate available data and hence determine resultant financial actionsafm systemfig a illustrates an afm system  for providing features of an afm product according to some embodiments similarly fig b illustrates an exemplary more detailed view of the

the user when logging onto the application alternatively the login information is able to be omitted and a user is able to use the application without creating a user profile or logging in in such embodiments the application on each client device  is able to have single a unique profile or identifier that is able to be identified by the server  andor afm product after a user profile is created the user is able to access the profile and any associated data by entering the username and password in order to identify themselves to the application in some embodiments factor identity verification may be required wherein a second tier of validation must be satisfied such as the automatic transmission via sms of a temporary password to a users mobile device which must be entered in order to access the profilethe account modulethe account module enables a user to add one or more accounts to the associated user profile add or move money between the accounts and withdraw money from the accounts for example in order to add an account the module enables a user to enter a routing number and an account number of the account which they would like to associated with the user profile the user is then able to be prompted for a username and password or another method of verification to automatically verify the bank account further if adding a credit card the user is able to enter the card number expiration date and security code wherein if further verification is required by the credit card issuer steps will be taken as advised by the card provider moreover if adding an online payment system account eg paypal® the module is able to ask and input a username and password associated with the online payment system to link the account in this manner the account module enables the user to save the added account andor add additional accounts the account module further enables money to be addedtransferredwithdrawn between the accounts for example the user is able to select one of the accounts associated with the user profile enters an amount to be added to or withdrawn from another account and confirms the deposit in some embodiments the user is able to enter a nickname for the deposit transactionthe rule generation modulethe rule generation module enables users to generate a ruleplan for one or more accounts andor combined accounts as described below that dynamically transfer money into andor out of the accounts each rule comprises a duration one or more conditiontrigger pairs an intervalfrequency and one or more actions as a result the rulesplans are able to automatically perform designated actions eg transfer money to manage the accounts of a user profile according to the scenarios defined by the conditiontrigger pairs of the rulesplans for example a user is able to use the rule generation module to generate an auto bill pay ruleplan associated with an account with two condition pairs one condition pair to automatically pay a bill if it is under  eg condition  triggerbill amount conditionless than or equal to  actionpay bill and another condition pair to hold the payment notify the user and let himher decide what to do next if the bill is over  eg condition  triggerbill amount conditiongreater than  actionnotify and wait for confirmation alternatively the secondanother condition pair is able to be an exception to the first condition such that the first condition is not performed if the secondexception condition is met for example the second condition is able to hold the payment notify the user and let himher decide what to do next if the balance of the auto bill pay source account is below  eg condition  triggersource account balance conditionless than  actionnotify and wait for confirmation thus in the first scenario the bill is not paid without confirmation if it is over the expected amount and in the second scenario the bill is not paid without confirmation even if it is lower than  if the source account balance is below  fig  illustrates auto bill pay rule generation selection boxes according to some embodiments the auto bill pay rule generation selection boxes are able to be added to the rule generation interface shown in figs  as an easier way to add the “funding account must have at least” andor the “bill amount must be less than” conditions to any of the rules as either a primary or exception condition indeed any number of types and combinations of conditions described herein are able to be utilized to customize the auto bill pay consequently using one or a plurality of these types of rulesplans for one or more of a users accounts the user is able to customize the afm product such that is automatically financially manages the users money as desiredthe duration of each rule defines when implementation of the rule by the product eg implementation module is to begin and end for example the duration is able to be a defined range of dates such as jan   to mar   or an undefined range of dates eg with no defined end date such jan   to manual termination by the user in some embodiments the duration is able to be seasonal or annual by defining the range of dates such as january st to march rd whereby not specifying a start and end year the plan is able to persist from year to year and be evaluated as valid as long as the date of execution of the rule is after the first date and before the second date of the same year or of the following year in cases when the first date is a month that occurs sequentially later in a year such as october st to february rd alternatively the end andor start of the duration is able to be based on a starting andor ending trigger for example the end is able to be when a predetermined amount of money transferred by the rule reaches a desired value eg goal in particular the end andor start triggers are able to be any one or combination of the triggers of the conditiontrigger pairs as described below wherein the start or termination of performance of the rule by the performance module occurs based on the endstart triggers occurringthe conditiontrigger pairs define a trigger or monitored variable eg parameter criteria upon which the control of the accounts for which the planrules are created is based and an associated condition of a value or range of values that the trigger must match in order for an action associated with the pair to be performed for example if the value of a trigger matches an acceptable value of the paired condition the condition is met and the associated action is able to be performed assuming any other conditions associated with the action have also been met in some embodiments each rule is able to have a “primary” conditiontrigger pair and one or more “exception” conditiontrigger pairs wherein the primary pair is executed when none of the exception conditions are satisfied in such embodiments the condition of this primary pair is the value or values indicated by the intervalfrequency of the rule as when the rule is to be evaluated eg every monday and the trigger of the primary pair is the intervalfrequency parameter eg the day of the week such that the primary conditiontrigger pair is met whenever the intervalfrequency is met as a result the action associated with the primary pair is executed pending satisfaction of user confirmation requirements if any at each interval when the rule is evaluated unless at least one of conditions of the exception pairs is met in which case the action of the at least one of the conditions of the exception pairs is executed again pending satisfaction of user confirmation requirementsin some embodiments each of the triggers is one of the group comprising an account balance eg source account destination account third party account local account or combination thereof a balance change eg income of an account source andor destination account a balance change having a value within a specific range from a specific source of a specific type andor during a specific time period of an account source andor destination account a current date or time eg day month year a price of an itemservice including or excluding taxes shipping costs discountssales andor other fees bill due date total amount owed eg billed amount plus remaining debt minimum payment due on bill a current amount billed eg billed amount letternumber grade grade point average event outcome eg sports event spread point totals other network accessible data values or combinations thereof for example a trigger is able to be check deposits or debits directauto deposit deposits the clearing of check deposits or debits the clearing of directauto deposit deposits deposits or debits having a value within a desired range eg greater than  depositsdebits within last month the sum of depositsdebits within the last month having a value within a selected range depositsdebits from one or more designated third party accounts andor check deposits within last month within a specified value range from a designated third party account in other words any data that is able to be monitored or accessed over a network eg the internet is able to be used as a triggersimilarly the conditions are each able to comprise one or a set of values that the trigger is able to be that satisfy the condition thus the conditions are able to be a numerical range or single value eg  a dynamic numerical range or single value eg between  and  of total balance of account a dynamic or static nonnumerical value eg letter grade a a letter grade above previous letter grade an eventoutcome eg celtics beat lakers or a combination thereof in other words the conditions are able to comprise any value or set of values that the paired triggers can beadditionally each of the conditiontrigger pairs is associated with one or more of the actions such that if the pair is satisfied the one or more of the actions are able to be performed further a plurality of pairs are able to be associated with the same one or more actions such that the action is only performed if all of the associated pairs have been satisfied for example a first pair associated with the action of a transfer of  to a savings account is able to require an account balance of over  and a second pair associated with the same action is able to require a most recent deposit of greater than  thus the action of transferring the  dollars will only occur when both of the pairs have been satisfied wherein an action or set of actions are able to be associated with any number of a plurality of pairs in some embodiments the pairs of each ruleplan are mutually exclusive such that only one of the pairs is able to be satisfied at once and therefore only one of the associated actions is performed at once alternatively one or more of the pairs of each ruleplan are able to be satisfied simultaneously or concurrently such that the associated actions are all performed indeed as described above when one of the actions is associated with a plurality of pairs by definition all of the plurality of the pairs all need to be satisfied simultaneously or concurrently for the action to be performedin some embodiments each of the rules further comprise starting ending andor milestone condition pairs in particular these pairs are the same as the conditiontrigger pairs except for the differences described herein specifically the action for when the starting condition pair is satisfied is to start the implementation of the rule the action for when the ending condition pair is satisfied is to terminate or pause the implementation of the rule and the action for when the milestone condition pair is satisfied is a notification that a milestone has been reached eg saved  to specified users via specified message medium as a result the starting andor ending pairs are able to be used by the implementation module to determine when to start or end implementation of the rule for example a starting condition pair is able to be “start when the account balance reaches ” and an ending condition pair is able to be “terminate when the account balance reaches ” alternatively the ending condition is able to be omitted or indicate that the rule is to be performed indefinitely and the notification module is activated when a milestone pair is satisfied to transmit the milestone messagenotification for example a milestone condition pair is able to be “notify parents when grade point average is below to ” alternatively in some embodiments one or both of the starting and ending condition pairs are simply starting andor ending dates wherein the implementation module begins implementing the rule on the starting date and ends implementation via termination or pausing at the end date wherein the difference between the terminate action and the pause action is that although both result in the rule no longer being actively implemented the termination action also deletes the rule from the afm system whereas the pause action saves the rule for future usereactivationthe interval or time of evaluation defines when andor how frequently the pairs of the rule are evaluated to determine if the conditions are satisfied by the triggers and thus whether the associated actions should be taken thus the interval is able to be a periodic time eg weekly monthly every  days a single time eg jan   upon demandcommand by a user or based on an interval condition pair specifically the interval condition pair is able to be the same as the conditiontrigger pairs except that the action for satisfaction of the interval condition pair is to evaluate the rule and its conditiontrigger pairs for example the interval condition pair is able to be “every time a deposit is made to a selected account” or “every time a deposit is received from a specific source in a selected account” or any of the other possible triggersconditions like the condition triggerpairs thus by selecting the interval the user is able to refine when the rule is implementedas described above the actions are each associated with one or more of the pairs described above wherein the actions are performed if all of the associated pairs have been satisfied the actions are able to comprise a transfer of money eg withdrawal or deposit between two or more accounts a purchase of an itemservice based on the purchase module information notification to a user of a status eg transfer performed confirmation notification to a user of a pending action eg please confirm transfer should be performed termination or pausing of a rule eg for an ending pair starting of a rule eg for a starting pair milestone notification eg similar to information notification for milestone pair or other actions known in the art additionally the actions are able to be conditional or independent combinations of the above actions wherein independent combinations of actions are all implemented independently when the pairs are met whereas conditional combinations require one or more of the actions of the combination to wait on the performance of one or more of the other actions of the combination andor other data before performance in other words two or more actions are grouped such that the same one or more conditions being satisfied causes the entire group to be performed for example a condition combination of actions is able to be a confirmation message action and a money transfer action wherein the money transfer action does not occur unless the confirmation action has been performed and the user confirmed that the transfer should be sentmade as another example an independent combination is able to be a notification message action and a money transfer action wherein both the notification and the money transfer are performed independent of each otherfurther each of the actions are able to have associated values andor messages for example transfers are able to have an amount of money to transfer and notifications are able to have the data or text of the message to be conveyed the medium to convey the message and the addresses or users to convey the message to in particular the transfer values like the trigger values are able to be static amounts value relativedynamic amounts  of deposits in the last month or a combinationhybrid amount  plus  of the total balance of the account thus the implementation module is able to use these action values to determine how much to transfer andor what to “say” when performing transfer andor notification actionsthus the rule generation module is enables users to select one or more of the actions the triggers the conditions acceptable values andor measurement metricequation and the interval via the user interface eg selection from a list of a drop down box entering text in a text box alternatively one or more of the components of each of the rules are able to be determined automatically by the generation module with default values eg if the user does not or cannot select a value once the necessary aspects of the ruleplan have been selected or assigned a default value the generation module generates and stores the rule such that it is able to be implemented by the implementation module as described belowfig n from the path aa as described below illustrates a generated rule of a plan having an action of transferring money from a selected checking source account to a selected savings destination account based on a primary condition trigger pair base transfer rule and two exception condition trigger pairs conditional rule  and conditional rule  specifically the primary condition will pay a metric determined amount every intervalfrequency of  month unless the first exception is met with the trigger of the payers checking account balance meeting the condition of being less than  or the second exception is met with the trigger of the payers checking account balance meeting the condition of the balance being between  and  the primary condition transfer amount metricequation is  of the checking account balance plus  the first exception condition transfer amount metricequation is  of the checking account balance plus  and the second exception condition transfer amount metricequation is  of the checking account balance plus  further the ruleplan will last for the duration of from feb   to an indefinite end date eg no end date save without limit finally the second exception condition requires a confirmation “text confirmation is required” before it is executed whereas the primary and first exception condition do not require confirmation before execution is performed other examples of ruleplans are shown in figs q i r k l i and nperformance modulethe performance module automatically performs eg via the servers  andor client devices  the plansrules generated by the user according to the characteristics of the plansrules as defined by the users when generating the rulesplans in particular the performance module begins monitoring the starting triggers of each of the rules once they have been created and then begins performing each of the rules when their duration begins based on the starting trigger and ceases performance when their duration ends based on the ending trigger similarly during the performance of each of the rules the performance module monitors all of the condition trigger values at the specified intervals and performs the associated actions when one or more of the conditions are satisfied based on the values of the corresponding triggers as a result the performance module automatically and dynamically performs the afm plans thereby enabling the users to easily control their financial accountsthe notification modulethe notification module enables users to specify whether they would like notifications when one or more of the conditions have been met and sends the notifications based on the user specifications the notifications are able to be in the form of text messages emails voice messages or other types of notification known in the art for example one or more of the actions associated with the rules are able to be assigned a notification status wherein if the status indicates to the notification module is able to provide notifications before one or more of the actions are performed as another example the notification module is able to optionally send notifications to the user based on one or more milestones of a rule being met such as a savings account reaching the halfway point or a grade point average becoming greater than additionally one or more of the notifications are able to include a confirmation feature wherein the action associated with the notification is able to only be performed by the module if the user confirms that the action should be made in response to the notification for example each of the conditiontrigger pairs of a rule are able to have different or the same confirmation requirements that must be satisfied before the action associated with the conditiontrigger pair and the rule is performed by the afm product thus the notifications are able to be used to ensure unwanted actions are not taken by the afm product without user confirmation indeed in some embodiments when a funding account holder receives a notification including a confirmation feature for manual approval on a pending transfer eg as a result of the conditions of a rule being met the user has the option to log in and approve the scheduled amount or manually enter an alternative dollar amount to be released instead eg manually overriding the transfer amount the user is able to also have the option to cancel any individual transfer that is awaiting hisher confirmation the notification module is further able to send the notifications to one or more parties other than the user wherein the other partys contact information has been input to the afm product for example both users of a transfer between two users are able to receive notifications as desiredthe ruleplan editing modulethe ruleplan editing module enables a user to review one or more of the existing rules associated with the user profile and change any of the selected characteristics of the rule andor delete the rule for example the user is able to add conditions to the rule or rules within a given payment plan change targets of one or more conditions or other adjustments to the rules additionally in some embodiments when a user finishes the initial set up of a rule establishing a payment plan of money from one or more accounts of the user “payer” to another account of a different user or third party “payee” the rule editing module enables the payer to either allow the payee to review and edit the details of the rules or instead to save and immediately activate the plan without enabling the payee to editconfirm the rules in contrast in some embodiments if a rule establishing a payment plan is created by a user who is the payee the rule is able to always be submitted to the payer for review and editing or approval in such embodiments once a payer has received the rule or rules generated by the payee the editing module enables the payer to allow or revoke the payees ability to edit plan details additionally in some embodiments whenever this “allow payee editing” feature of the editing module is enabled any time one of the users payer or payee makes one or more changes to the rule the rule is passed back and forth between the users until all of the users approve the rule without any new changes in some embodiments each time a plan is passed back and forth for approval a summary of the recent changes by each user is provided for the convenience of the usersthe ruleplan prioritization modulethe ruleplan prioritization module enables a user to adjust the order and therefore priority in which each of the rules associated with one or more of the accounts of their user profile are executed specifically based on this order each of the plans and their sets of rules are able to be evaluated and then executed in order such that the effects of the previoushigher priority rulesplans on the statusvalue of the associated accounts and targetparameter values of subsequent rulesplans are included in the evaluation and execution of those subsequent rulesplans thus the ruleplan prioritization module enables the users to optionally rearrange the priorityorder that the rules are executed in some embodiments this priority is assigned by assigning different times andor dates when each of the rules are to be executed such that rules with earlier times andor dates are prioritized before those with later times andor dates in such embodiments if two or more rules are scheduled to execute at the same time the module is able to prompt the user to assign a priority eg time difference between the two or more rules until all of the rules are orderedthe virtual savings bin modulethe virtual savings bin module enables a user to create savings bins or miniaccounts that are maintained and tracked by the afm product these bins are virtual accounts that freeze and control the money within them on behalf of a plan or goal while the funds within each virtual savings bin are comingled in a giant aggregate account contents of each of the virtual savings bins are not counted in any other balances thus the bins are operated to prevent the money associated within them from being transferred from the aggregate account unless that bin not the aggregate account is selected as the source of the transferin some embodiments the savings bin module is able to generate virtual folders of money that will be tracked separately from the rest of the users moneys held within one or more of the accounts associated with their user profile these savings bins are able to represent an identified subset of the money in one or more of the accounts wherein the subset is specified by the user when generating the savings bin with the savings bin module in some embodiments the subset is able to be money transferred into one of the accounts as a result of one or more of the rules alternatively the subset is able to be money transferred into one of the accounts by one or more rules andor any other types of deposits from one or more of the accounts such as those typesamounts of the targets as described above eg checks above  account transfers during a specified time period all depositsfor example a user is able to set up a savings bin that tracks an amount of money transferred into an associated account based on a rule for saving money each month as a result even if the account has a total balance of  if  of that balance is money transferred based on the rule associated with the savings bin the savings bin balance will be  in particular this enables a user to easily track how much they have saved for a desired item eg a purse by creating a purse savings bin associated with a rule that periodically saves money for the purpose once set up the module is able to enable the user to use the savings bin as a funding account or a receiving account just like any other account additionally all moneys in savings bins are able to be available for immediate transfer to any other system users andor a user is able to delete savings binsthe account grouping modulethe account grouping module enables users to create account groups that enable the users to use two or more accounts as a single account within the afm product in other words grouping accounts essentially creates a combined account that is presented to the user within the afm product such that the combined account represents an aggregation of the deposits and debits of all the accounts that are a part of the combined account in particular this is able to provide an ease of use for example if a user utilizes multiple different accounts for savings and would like to view their savings as a whole across all or a plurality of the accounts instead of individually further once created a user is able to use the combined account as if it is a regular single account for example a user is able to depositwithdraw money intoout of the combined account as if it was a single account utilize the rule generation module to generate rules utilizing the combined account as a source or destination account andor any of the other features described herein with respect to the accountsin order to generate a combined account the user specifies a plurality of the accounts associated with the user profile that are to make up the combined account and then selects funding and withdrawal policies that define how deposited money is distributed into the accounts of the combined account andor how withdrawntransferred money is divided between the balances of the accounts of the combined account in particular the withdrawal policies are able to address situations where one or more of the associated accounts have insufficient funds to cover a transfer out of the combined account in some embodiments the deposit andor withdrawal division is able to be percentage based where each of the associated accounts receives andor contributes an amount based on a percentage assigned to the associated account by the user in some embodiments the deposit andor withdrawal division is able to be proportional to the balance of each of the accounts with response to the whole combined account as dynamically determined each time before the fundingdraining occursin other words if an account makes up half of the entire balance of the combined account it is drainedfunded for half of the entire fundingwithdrawal amount alternatively the associated accounts are able to be ordered such that the associated accounts are drained andor funded based on the order as specified by the user in such embodiments the switching to the next account within the order is able to be triggered based on one or more switching thresholds being met for example each of the associated accounts is able to be associated with a value a percentage or both such that once the funding or draining of the account has reached the value the percentage increasedecrease or a percentage increasedecrease plus or minus the value the funding or draining switches to the next account within the order further in some embodiments if the end of the order is reached the remainder of the fundingdraining is performed by withdrawing as much as is needed from the last account regardless of its individual policies moving back up to the start of the order if needed to drain all that is required to fulfill the transfer from each account in order of priority or once the last account has been drained according to its policies the module switches back to the start of the order to drain all that is needed from each account in order of priority regardless of their individual policies until the transfer amount has been satisfied in some embodiments when defining policies while forming an account group a user is able to determine whether or not the individual policies for any individual account within the group are “preferred” or able to be overridden in cases such as those described above or whether the policies are absolute such that they are never to be violatedadditionally in some embodiments the policies are able to specify how to handle the case where one or more of the accounts have insufficient funds to meet the amount of their share of a withdrawal as determined by the withdrawal policy and thresholds for those accounts for example the policy is able to specify that if one or more of the accounts in a combined account has insufficient funds cancel the whole transfer do not transfer money from any account in the group cancel those accounts portionsshares of the transfer and send the withdrawal amount from the remaining accounts of the combined account with sufficient funds send as much as possible from each of those accounts and then send the remaining withdrawal amount from the remaining accounts of the combined account set up a linear insufficient funds priorityorder to use one account to pick up all insufficient funds then a second if the first falls short a third and so on as the user desires wherein if there are not enough funds in the last account to cover the difference all available money will be sent from all actively funding accounts in the group or distribute the difference equally between the other funding accounts paying as much from all accounts as possible if theres not enough to fund the whole amount with equal portions additionally in some embodiments if two or more accounts have insufficient funds or if one or more of the “overflow accounts” has insufficient funds to cover the whole amount of the difference from the accounts with insufficient funds as much as possible is able to be transferred from each account and the remaining balance owed is able to continue to be covered equally among any accounts in the account group with remaining fundsfurther in some embodiments the policies are able to specify an account buffer amount for one or more of the accounts making up the combined account or the combined account as a whole thus if the user selects an option to “protect a certain balance across this combined account” and enters  as the protected balance the distribution of funding andor draining in combined account proceeds normally but only after  is reserved proportionally over all accounts before performing any funding andor draining operations for example if the combined account was scheduled to transfer  and the accounts have balances of account a  account b  and account c  with the combined account funding method set to “pay automaticallyproportionally” first the protected  would be set aside according to the users “safety buffer” before any calculations are made or transfers sent the module presumes that account a has  available − account b has  − and account c has  − as a result the schedules transfer would result in sending  in total leaving account a with  account b with  and account c with  in other words this combined account would always pay as much as possible without dipping into the account buffers indeed in the above case both the payee and the payer are able to receive a notification that less funds were sent than were scheduled but that as much was paid as possible according to the policy in some embodiments only the payer would be able to see the details of why less funds were sent that the system was preserving hisher  combined account bufferfinally in some embodiments if a user wishes to use certain accounts in a combined account only to inform conditional rules in certain plans but does not want to use them for that combined accounts funding distribution the module provides the option to disable those accounts from active funding in that combined account by enabling “reference only” for that account in the smart combined accounts settings this option enables a user to select accounts to be included whenever the system references the combined accounts balance or income as in evaluating a conditional rule but omit it when the combined account is funding a payment or transfer it should be noted that all of these options described above are able to be input by a user into the account grouping module and then automatically enforced by the grouping module for the combined accountsthe review modulethe review module enables users to review different types of data about the accounts associated with their user profile specifically the review module illustrates incoming and outgoing histories where a user is able to see all transfers that have come in and gone out over time expand details where a user is able to expand any transaction to see what conditions and settings were triggered in determining transfer amounts and provide totals where a user is able to see the total cumulative amounts transferred for any plan and how much is still left to pay or save on it further in some embodiments the review module enables the user to hover over any of the rules to see their projected transfer amount according to the current or predicted values of the associated targetsparameter values associated with the rules and the entered priority in some embodiments the review module enables a user to choose to “add an expectedadjustment deposit to the timeline” wherein when the user chooses this option heshe selects the account receiving the deposit and enters an expected deposit amount and expected clearing date based on this input which is able to appear in a different color on the timeline the review module displays data indicating how payment and plan transfer amounts would change with various account balances or incomes on certain dates specifically after an expected deposit is entered on the timeline all plans and payments coming after it would show both a “projected transfer amount with current account conditions” and an additional “projected transfer amount with adjusted account conditions”in some embodiments the review module enables the user to toggle on or off a setting to “include expectedadjustment deposits in the timeline” according to hisher preference wherein  if toggled off expectedadjustment deposits disappear from the timeline and “projected transfer amounts with adjusted account conditions” are removed from payment and plan displays and  if toggled on the expected deposits are included on the timeline once again and both “projected transfer amounts with current account conditions” and “projected transfer amounts with adjusted account conditions” are shown also the review module enables the user to “verify” hisher account plans by evaluating a selected rule associated with the account and bring the users attention to potential common errors for example if a user has one account plan rule that pays  if hisher balance is less than  and another rule that pays  if hisher balance is over  the verification script will ask himher if heshe intentionally left a gap in the rules between  and  and the user will have the option to automatically resolve the gap by adjusting one or the other of the rules if the user chooses to automatically resolve the gap by fixing the first rule that rule will change to pay  if the balance is less than  or less than or equal to  if the user chooses to resolve the gap by choosing to fix the second rule the rule would be resolved in a similar fashion by paying  if the users balance is more than  or more than or equal to  thus the review module helps ensure that fully effective rules for each account plan are generatedthe product purchase modulethe product purchase module enables a user to select a productservice from a merchant eg a merchant website and associated the product with a rule that will automatically or upon approval input the necessary information and transmit the necessary money to purchase the selected productservice if the conditions of the rule are met in particular such a product purchase rule is similar to a rule for saving money as described herein except that one of the targetsparameters is the price of the productservice and the action is the purchase of the productservice in addition to the transfer of money for the purpose of savings for example the rule is able to be conditioned on the price of the itemservice eg including shipping taxes andor other fees being within a specified range thus if the price is within that range and other conditions are met eg the funds saved by the rule being equal or greater that price the current date being within a specified range or other types of conditions described herein the product purchase module will either automatically purchase the productservice or will ask the user for confirmation for the purchase and then purchase or not based on the response to the confirmationmethod of operationfig  illustrates a method of dynamic financial management of one or more of monetary accounts according to some embodiments as shown in fig  the afm product inputs selection of a source account and a destination account for an account ruleplan by a userthe afm product then inputs selection of a starting condition and an ending condition of the account rule by the user at the step  the afm product inputs selection of a condition of the transfer rule including a trigger one or more valid trigger values an evaluation time one or more actions and a transfer metric or equation by the user at the step  alternatively the afm product is able to input a plurality of conditions and their associated values from the user for the account ruleplan in some embodiments one or more of the input selections are able to be omitted and instead the afm product is able to provide predetermined default values based on the source account the destination account the starting condition the ending condition and the condition the afm product generates and stores the account ruleplan at the step  the afm product monitors the trigger of the account rule once the starting condition is satisfied and upon being triggered to evaluate based on the evaluation times indicated by the intervalfrequency evaluating the rule by determining the validity of the conditions of the rule and determining an action and a transfer amount based on the associated transfer amount metric of the valid one of the conditions at the step  in some embodiments a primary condition is satisfied by default at each of the evaluation times such that the evaluating of the rule comprises determining if any exception conditions are satisfied thereby overriding the primary condition finally the afm product initiates the action associated with the condition eg transfer of a quantity of money based on the transfer metric from the source account to the destination account if the trigger value or monitored variable matches at least one of the valid trigger values such that the condition is met in some embodiments if the rule includes a plurality of conditions associated with the same action the action is only initiated if all of the conditions are met in some embodiments if the rule includes a plurality of conditions associated with different actions the different actions are each initiated if their associated conditions are all met in some embodiments the afm product then pauses or terminates the account rule when the ending condition has been met alternatively the ending condition is able to be omitted andor indicate indefinite operation of the ruleplan as a result the method provides the advantage of enabling a user to easily automatically manage their financial accounts according to a plurality of selected scenariosin some embodiments the method further comprises receiving selection by the user of a confirmation preference for the rule eg whether a confirmation notification is required before an action should take place wherein the afm product then refrains from the initiating of the action until the confirmation preference has been met for the rule in some embodiments the method further comprises presenting a notification of the calculated amount of money to be transferred based on the rule or rules of the plan such that the user is able to evaluate whether the rule is going to do what they want it to accomplish or whether they would like to cancel or amend the transfer for any personal reason in some embodiments the method further comprises presenting to the user a total amount of money that has been transferred based on the rule such that the user is able to evaluate whether the rule is doing what they want the rule to accomplish in other words the user is able to be presented with “historical” data indicating how much when and where money has been transferred because of the rule or rules in a given time period in order to determine the effects of the rule or rules in that time period in some embodiments the method further comprises receiving selection by the user of a productservice from a third party website having a projected cost creating a savings bin for the product and automatically purchasing the productservice from the third party website if an amount of money within the virtual savings bin equals the projected cost in some embodiments the method further comprises receiving selection by the user of a spending limit for the rule associated with the product wherein the afm refrains from purchasing the productservice or shopping cart of products services taxes andor shipping fees if the total amount of money transferred based on the rule equals the spending limit in some embodiments the source andor destination accounts are combined accounts that represent a plurality of accounts that are funded and drained according to funding and draining policies additionally although the method of fig  includes steps  one or more of the steps are able to be omitted rearranged andor additional steps are able to be added including one or more of the features described hereinafm implementation examplesfigs a to n illustrate an exemplary flow chart  of implementing the afm product according to some embodiments additionally for each path aaii through the flow chart  figs  illustrate exemplary screenshots or images of a user interface of the afm product implementing the flow chart  for example figs an correspond to path aafigs aq correspond to path bb and so on such that figs ae correspond to path ii alternatively one or more screens or images of the user interface are able to be omitted andor changed while retaining the same functionality of the afm productas shown in figs a to n once a user has registered and logged in from hisher device  heshe arrives at the main menu of the afm product from here the user is able to select from various options eg paths aaii for example the main menu options are able to be create a rule for saving create a rule to pay another user create a rule to be paid by another user create a rule to pay a bill eg recurring create a rule to save for and automatically purchase an itemservice create a rule to split funds or income into multiple accounts eg creating a combined account create a onetime payment rule between accounts create a onetime bill payment rule and create a money request for an incoming payment proposal from another user alternatively more or less options are able to be provided each of the rules are able to be a part of one or more plans associated with a user such that each plan is able to comprise one or more of the rules created by the user additionally one or more of the paths or steps through one or more paths shown in figs an are able to be omitted for example in some embodiments escrow options are able to be omitted wherein the paths skip any escrow related stepsoptionspaths aa bb and ccthe streaming savings and payment plans aa bb and cc are mostly functionally the same except that they each have differently worded user prompts and different account options depending on where the involved money is coming from and going to for example a savings plan assumes funding would come from and go to ones own accounts and would not include options to enter another users account information just as one can set up a plan to pay another user it is also possible for a user to set up a plan to be paid if setting up a plan to be paid by another party the user would simply set the other users username as the funding account source account if setting up a plan to pay another user that payees username would instead be set as the receiving account destination account users begin by setting up funding and receiving account options scheduling options and transfer types and amounts users then have the opportunity to create conditional rules to determine how money will flow in various custom defined circumstances in some embodiments all participants must have an account and a username to use this service for example if a user is setting up a plan which involves another party who does not yet have an account that party is able to receive an invitation and must sign up in order to accept or create any transfers or payments alternatively one or more participants are able to not have accounts and instead have their account information input andor setup onetime guest accounts with necessary informationthe process for setting up a streaming transfer plan for savings or payment as provided by the afm systemproduct is able to begin with a user selecting a funding account money will be withdrawn from this account a receiving account money will be deposited into this account a frequency or trigger event for payments such as once per month or once every  days eg timeschedule based trigger or when a deposit is cleared into a selected account eg event based or when a particular type of deposit is cleared into a selected account eg direct deposit cash or an electronic money transfer a start date date of the first payment or time when the monitoring for triggers begins and an end date date the plan will pause or finish alternatively the user is able to opt not to enter an end date if heshe wishes the plan to continue until either heshe stops it or until the goal of the plan has been reached the user is then able to enter the maximum amount to be saved or paid in particular this field is useful for defining a finite saving goal or setting up a payment plan with a finite amount owed if a streaming transfer plan is created to pay back a  loan for example the user is able to enter “” as the maximum amount to be paid and the plan will automatically terminate when that amount has been paid in full if the user enters “” or leaves the “maximum amount” field empty the plan would have no limit and would remain active indefinitely or until stopped by the user the afm also provides the option to enter an annual interest rate on a plans “remaining amount” interest would be calculated and added periodically as determined by the userthe user is also able to set up a “base transfer” type and amount the base transfer is defined as the basic default amount that is sent with each transfer as long as the plan is active and no conditional rules exceptions or settings intervene the base transfer is able to be the primary default transfer directive for the plan the user is able to first select a transfer type to be used throughout all parts of the plan before entering the base transfer amount wherein the transfer types are fixed amount percentage or hybrid fixed and percentage the fixed amount transfers are a simple fixed dollar amount would be sent on each transfer date or trigger event wherein the user is able to enter a fixed dollar amount the percentage transfers are a percentage of the funding account income or account balance that would be sent on each transfer date or trigger event wherein the user is able to select a variable from which to calculate a percentage for example the entire funding account balance the entire funding account balance minus a certain dollar amount the recent income the recent income minus a certain dollar amount the recent income from certain sources eg checks cash bank transfers electronic transfers the recent income from certain sources minus a certain dollar amount or combinations thereof the user is able to enter the percentage amount andor an amount to subtract before calculating a percentage andor the user is able to define an amount of time eg week month to go back and calculate “recent income” further the user is able to specify which sources of income should be included eg checks auto deposits cash electronic transfers in some embodiments the user is able to enter comma separated “tags” to use to search for certain funding account deposit sources to mark these depositssources for inclusion in this income calculation the percentage amount is able to be dynamically calculated by the afm product on the date or trigger of each transfer to determine the amount for example if the rules is triggered by the clearing of a deposit into a selected account the percentage amount is able to be calculated and transferred upon the triggering event ie the clearing of the deposit into the selected account the hybrid transfers are a percentage plus fixed amount that allows a user to send a fixed dollar amount in addition to a percentage amount on each transfer date or trigger event if hybrid transfers is selected the user is able to enter the fixed amount the percentage and what the percentage is based on as described above in this way the user creates a base condition based on which the amount of money is transferred in some embodiments user approval is required before one or more trigger andor date based transfers are executedthe user is then able to optionally set up an additional condition that act as an exception or addition to the base condition indeed this process is able to be substantially similar to setting up the base condition except the action eg transferring money between the selected accounts is the same and thus does not need to be reselected instead for the new condition the trigger or condition type how the trigger value is to be valued eg trigger evaluation metric or equation and the amount of money to transfer eg fixed percentage hybrid needs to be selected for example the user is able to specify an exception to a rule that overrides the rules during selected dates selected accountsource balances andor upon specified trigger events and performs a different action eg transfers a different amount from a different source andor to a different destination or nonaction eg performs nothing in some embodiments the user will only have to define a new range to evaluate either account balance income within a certain period of time or amount of the currently evaluated deposit andor a date range condition or any combination of these conditions and an alternative amount of money to send whether it is a fixed amount a percentage of one of the above variables or a combination of bothan example of a ruleplan having both a base condition and an additional condition is “starting today at noon send  once a week to my savings account base condition unless on that day i have a balance of more than  in my account in which case send  instead additional condition” to set up a rule like this after setting up the base condition the user is able to choose “add a conditional rule” or in some embodiments choose from the options “pay more when    ” “pay less when    ” and “pay nothing when    ” to reveal expanded options to define specific range requirements for an exception to the rule eg including an alternative amount to transfer in some embodiments the user is able to select a condition type and then select from a dropdown menu of relevant conditional operators  the condition types are able to include but are not limited to  funding account balance  receiving account balance  recent funding account income interval to be entered by user  recent receiving account income this option available only if access to this data is granted by the receiving account holder  recent funding account income from certain sources  recent receiving account income from certain sources and  date of scheduled transfer and  amount of thiscurrent depositin some embodiments for   and  receiving account options are only available if access to this data is granted by the receiving account holder in some embodiments for    and  the user is able to next define an amount of time to go back and calculate “recent income” in some embodiments for   and  to specify which income should be included the user is able to enter comma separated “tags” to use to search for certain funding account deposits andor deposit types to mark for inclusion or exclusion in this income calculation for monetary values the conditional operators are able to include but are not limited to  is less than  is less than or equal to  is more than  is more than or equal to  is between or equal to and  is equal to for monetary values for dates of scheduled transfers the conditional operators are able to include but are not limited to  is before  is on or before  is after  is on or after  is on or between and  is on thus the user is able to enter any relevant values dollar amounts or dates to finish defining the additional condition in some embodiments by optionally selecting to “add another condition” and then repeating this process the user is able to add as many or as few conditions to the rule as desired when all the conditions have been created the user is able to choose “next” to reach the confirmationnotification pageat the confirmation andor notification page the user is able to require the funding account holder to give hisher manual confirmation before the release of funds for all or any individual parts of the transfer plan this feature is for the benefit of the payer to maintain one more level of control on outgoing moneys specifically the user is able to first select a confirmation preference as confirmation always required sometimes required or never requiredin “always required” the payer is able to notified by a text message email phone call or other medium when the system  tries to make a transfer under any condition in this case no money is able to moved by this plan without the payers confirmation in order to setup this if the user is the payer the user is able to then select hisher preferred confirmation method text email phone and corresponding details or if the user is the payee the user is able to instead enter hisher preferred notification method and corresponding details to for updates whenever heshe receives a cleared transfer in ‘“sometimes required” a user is able to require confirmation on only certain parts of the plan in which case heshe is able to select check boxes next to these individual parts to require confirmation on them in some embodiments the user is given the option to “require approval on transfer amounts greater than    ” and upon entering a maximum amount for automated transfers is able to ensure that all transfers over a certain threshold amount will require approval otherwise they would go out automatically in order to setup this option if the user is the payer the user is able to then select hisher preferred confirmation method text email phone and corresponding details and if the user is the payee the user is able to instead enter hisher preferred notification method and corresponding details to for updates whenever heshe receives a cleared transfer finally in “never required” if the user doesnt want to enable confirmation on any parts of the plan heshe selects “no confirmation required send all transfers automatically as scheduled” and no confirmations are sent or required for the transfer to take placethe user is then presented with the planrule review page from the review page the user is able to see all details in one place as entered on the previous pages additionally the user is able to go back to edit the details cancel the plan or save and submit the plan when a user submits a plan in some embodiments the plan is then passed to one or more other users eg the users associated with the other accounts for approval or further editing for example this is able to be the case if a user submits a newly created or newly edited existing plan with “payee editing allowed” alternatively the plan is able to be saved and immediately activated if the payer has disabled “payee editing” and submits a plan the plan involves no other parties as in a savings plan or the user approves a plan received from another user “as is” and resubmits it without making any changes in some embodiments when payee editing is allowed a plan is able to only be activated when all parties have approved it also when this mutual editing is allowed a dated history of changes is able to be emailed to both parties and available online as new edits are submitted this allows all users to easily see what details are being negotiated if any user edits any detail on an active plan with payee editing allowed the plan is able to be paused until both parties approve of the changesafter submitting a plan if the user is a payee heshe will see a success message and go directly back to the main menu otherwise if it is a savings plan or if it is a payment plan and the user is the payer heshe will see a success message in some embodiments the user is then routed to a timeline priority management center for payments and transfers page to see the newly submitted plan in a timeline context with all other scheduled plans and payments this page allows users to quickly reschedule transfers and plans to change the sequence or priority in which they will be executed specifically the user is able to hover over any payment or transfer plan to see its “projected transfer amount” according to hisher current financial snapshot and the evaluation of the conditions settings and transfer amounts of all active plans preceding it in the timeline changing the sequence by rescheduling plans and payments is able to drastically change projected transfer amounts throughout the timeline so this page is very helpful in providing contextual insight into how these events will interact

newly created or edited existing plan proposal from another user who wants to pay or be paid heshe will first login registering if necessary once the user is able to access the proposed plan heshe are able to have the opportunity to review the plan from the beginning going through all the pages as if heshe were setting it up for the first time except that all fields will already have values as last input or changed the only major difference in the process between users is that only the owner of the funding account is able to edit the manual confirmation contact details and only the payee will have the option to set payee notification preferences as long as the payee has permission both the payer and payee are able to edit which parts of the plan will require manual confirmation to release transfers in some embodiments where payee editing is not allowed the payee simply sets his or her own preferences for receiving funds and notifications of payments and is able to give the incoming payment plan a nicknamepath ddthe automatic bill pay plan enables a customized auto bill pay feature where bill pay is able to be stopped andor altered based on characteristics of the bill account balances andor other factors for example instead of a standard auto bill pay where an amount is deducted automatically the user is able to setup a condition that stops payment if the billed amount is wrong or out of the ordinary eg over a threshold amount or different than an expected amount andor if the funding account balance is insufficient or below a threshold amount thereby ensuring the user is not unwittingly overcharged by the autopay andor pays despite there being insufficient funds in the account according to the users definition of “insufficient funds” in some embodiments the first time a user selects to setup a bill pay rule heshe are able to setup hisher own preferred name phone number and the address payees will see when receiving payments further the user is able enter a

previous recipient or recognized corporation from the known recipient list all address and contact data on record for that recipient will be prepopulated into the fields below if the system does not recognize the users payee entry the payee name field is able to remain as manually entered and no other fields are prepopulated if the payee is not a previous or registered recipient the user is able to enter the payees address city state zip code and an account number if applicableif the payee is a registered partner company with a cooperating api to allow secure data exchange from its server the user is able to be asked for hisher login and password information to access the remote account this will allow the afm system to retrieve live data on amounts owed and bill due dates if the user is able to link to hisher remote account on the partner companys server and retrieve billing information the user is then be able to set up automatic bill payments according to actual payment due dates and amounts owed as a result the user is able to use live bill pay for the current bill only by choosing “automatically pay the amount owed” and then selecting “pay now” “pay when the bill is due” or “pay on a certain date” the user is then able to select a date to pay the bill if the user would like to use live recurring bill pay they are able to choose “pay these bills automatically” the user is then able to enter a start date an end date if desired and an interval such as once a week or once a month for future payments in some embodiments the user is also able to choose “pay whenever a new amount is due” instead of manually defining a start date and interval additionally whether or not a user is able to retrieve live billing data the user is able to have the option of “schedule or send a single fixed amount payment now” wherein the user is able to enter a payment amount and date and choose“send one time payment ” and the option of “set up recurring payments of fixed amounts” wherein the user is able to enter a payment amount and set a start date an end date if desired and an interval such as once a week or once a month for future payments if a user is linked to hisher remote account and live bill due dates are available heshe are able to choose “pay when a new bill is due” instead of manually defining a start date and intervalafter the default or base payment condition is defined like in paths aa bb and cc the user has the option to add one or more additional conditions in the same manner as in paths aa bb and cc in this case the bill pay plan condition types include but are not limited to i funding account balance ii recent income iii recent income from certain sources iv date of scheduled transfer v amount due vi bill due date and vii current deposit amount in some embodiments for options ii and iii above the user is able to next define an amount of time to go back and calculate “recent income” in some embodiments like above for iii the user is able to specify which income should be included by entering comma separated “tags” to use to search for certain funding account deposits to mark for inclusion in this income calculation in some embodiments options v and vi are available only if the user has successfully connected hisher account to a partner companys cooperating api conditional operators for the options above may include but are not limited to for all dollar amounts i is less than ii is less than or equal to iii is more than iv is more than or equal to v is between or equal to for dates of scheduled transfers i is before ii is on or before iii is after iv is on or after v is on or between vi is on and for bill due date i is past due and ii is coming up within a certain interval user enters an interval the user is then able to enter a dollar amount or two amounts in the case of defining a range along with a new action to take for each of the new conditions for example the new actions are able to be one or more of pay bill

or priority in which they are executed again the user is able to hover over any payment or transfer plan to see its “projected transfer amount” according to hisher current financial snapshot and the evaluation of the conditions settings and transfer amounts of all active plans preceding it in the timeline from the timeline priority management center for payments and transfers page the user can either expand and edit plans and payments or return to the main menupath eethe automatic save and purchase plan enables a user to not only set of an automatic savings ruleplan but also to automatically monitor the price of a desired itemservice and purchase the itemservice when the amount saved equals the current price in other words the save and purchase plan of path ee is like a dynamic layaway plan once partner estores eg websites integrate with the afm system  the system is able to provide “create a save  purchase plan for this itemcart” buttons or other features that are available to users when interacting with the estore website as a selectable option for creating a save and purchase plan for one or more itemsservices eg one or more items in a virtual shopping cart on the website specifically the afm system  is able to access needed price data shipping date payment data returns data andor other data necessary for automatically monitoring the price andor including shipping costs fees or other costs and subsequently purchasing the desired itemsfirst a user is able to access the website of an estore including the afm purchase feature and select one or more items andor services to purchase from the website then the user is able to select the “create a save  purchase plan for this itemcart” buttons or link on the website which enables the user to enter the purchasing andor shipping information eg shipping address shipping method alternatively the purchasing information is able to be omitted the user is then able to confirm the total price of one or more of the selected items eg the contents of the virtual shopping cart including shipping and the shipping address upon confirmation the user is presented with a link or button that directs the user to the afm product for setting up an purchasesave rule for the selected itemsservicesthe user is able to be directed to the system login or to create a new account if the user has not registered yet the order information accessed by the afm product from the partner estore is able to be temporarily saved in association with the users new account so that they are able to continue once they have both registered and logged in alternatively if the user is already registered the order information is able to be temporarily saved until the user is logged in so that they are able to continue once logged in the user is able to confirm that they would like to start a save and purchase plan for the selected itemsservices wherein the itemsservices the prices shipping data eg method address cost are presented to the user for review before the confirmation at this point the user chooses a funding account and is able to enter a name for a virtual savings bin that is created by the afm product for starting the plan the savings bin tracks money in a users account separate from all other funds eg keeps in a separate virtual bin thus even if the money is comingled with other money in one or more accounts the afm product is able to track how much of the money is “within” the virtual savings bin in some embodiments each save  purchase plan automatically generates its own dedicated savings bin which is deleted at the time of purchase alternatively the savings bin is able to be omitted any remaining funds in a savings bin associated with a completed save  purchase plan are able to be moved into the users main system account balance by default unless otherwise specified by the userthe user is then able to set up the savings rule for the purchase andor the savings bin this process is able to be substantially similar to the saving plan path aa except that the action is not merely the transfer of money into a savings account but rather transfer of the money as payment for an automatic purchase action upon the conditiontrigger pairs of the plan being satisfied thus the user is able to enter a nickname for the plan a transfer frequency or trigger event eg the clearing of a deposit into a selected account a start an end a transfer type one or more conditions and a transfer amount for each of the conditions the user is then also able to enter a maximum amount that they are willing to pay for the itemsservices specifically the user is able to enter the maximum amount heshe is willing to save for these items in total this field is useful for long term plans for which item or shipping prices may fluctuate over time if an item currently costs  with free shipping the user may enter  here just in case the price goes up a little in the future in this case the plan will save no more than  for this item if the user enters “” or leaves the maximum amount field empty the plan is able to have no limit and is able to remain active indefinitely until stopped by the user or until the goal of the plan is reachedfurther the user is able to specify a different action for the additional conditiontrigger pair of if the price exceeds the maximum amount specified for example the user is able to specify to keep saving until the amount saved reaches the maximum amount pause the plan and send a notification to the user to either resume the plan edit the plan or terminate the plan or just cancel the plan without notification to the user in the pausing action the notification to the user is able to present the user with the options of confirming or setting a new maximum amount and then continue savings until that amount is reached setting a new maximum amount stopping savings when that amount is reached notifying the user and asking what action to take next doing nothing and leaving the plan paused or canceling the plan in the canceling the plan action the user is presented with options of what to do with the money in the virtual savings bin specifically the user is able to choose between leaving it in this plans savings bin return it to the funding account or moving it to the users online system account balancefinally the user is presented with the option to require hisher manual confirmation before moving funds for all or any individual parts of the save and purchase plan this selection of a confirmation preference is substantially similar to the confirmation preference selection for path aa further in some embodiments the user then selects an answer to the question “when your plan has saved enough money to buy this item purchase it automatically” choices include no send me a notification and let me decide what to do at that time yes just buy the item and send it to me at the address i provided when i set up the plan or yes but send the item to me at a different address wherein the user then sets up an alternative address accordingly the user is then able to review the generated rule andor savings bin at the review page and look at data from the timeline priority management center for payments and transfers page in the same manner as described above for path aa until the process is completedpath ffthis path illustrates how to split money from an account or combined account into multiple accounts the process is substantially similar to setting one of the other types transfer planrule except that this plan simply allows for two or more receivingdestination accounts in this setup for each receiving account a user is able to be prompted to enter base transfer amounts add conditional rules and configure confirmation settings in the same manner as described above in some embodiments any number of conditional rules is able to be added for each individual receiving account plans to split income will include the option to be executed every time a deposit clears in a selected account and enable the user to specify deposit types that are counted for this purpose as described above in particular executing transfers at the time the deposits clear provides the benefit of allowing for funds to be distributed before they are able to be spent further manual confirmation is able to be enabled on all or any parts of the multiaccount plan this type of multiaccount transfer is able to be used to divide income from businesses with two or more partners direct income into multiple specific savings accounts or send allowances to multiple children for examplepath ggthis path is for generating a onetime paymenttransfer between accounts specifically a user is able to select a funding account and select or enter another user or third partys name as the recipient of the payment the user then is able to select the payment date eg today mar   a transfer type a base transfer amount andor one or more additional conditions similar to the steps of path aa eg streaming savings in some embodiments the user is also able to input an option note that is delivered to the payeerecipient with the payment next like the path aa the user sets the confirmation andor notification preferences and then reviews the details of the onetime payment at the review page andor the timeline priority managementcenter for payments and transfers page at that point the user is able to confirm the payment and submit it for actual payment on the specified payment datepath hhthis path is for generating a onetime bill payment setting up one time bill payments is able to be substantially similar to process of setting up recurring bill payments of path dd except that when scheduling the payment there is no interval or frequency option but only a choice to either “pay immediately” or set a date in the future to schedule a payment the first time a user sets up a bill payment heshe will set up hisher own preferred name phone number and the address payees will see when receiving payments further the user is able enter a nickname for the plan select a funding account from which the payment is to be debited select a payee type company or individual and enter payee information specifically the user is able to enter the payees name wherein names of any previous recipients or recognized corporations matching the users entry are able to appear in a selectable dropdown menu as the user types if the user selects a previous recipient or recognized corporation from the known

to remain as manually entered and no other fields are prepopulated if the payee is not a previous or registered recipient the user is able to enter the payees address city state zip code and an account number if applicableif the payee is a registered partner company with a cooperating api to allow secure data exchange from its server the user is able to be asked for hisher login and password
