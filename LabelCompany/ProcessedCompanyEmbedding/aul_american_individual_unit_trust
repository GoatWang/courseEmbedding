period in which aul receives the contract plus any amounts deducted for premium taxes allocation of premiums initial premiums will be allocated among the investment accounts of the variable account or

instructions at any time by giving proper notice of the change to aul at its home office and such allocation will continue in effect until subsequently changed any such change in allocation instructions will be effective upon receipt of the change in allocation instructions by aul at its home office changes in the allocation of future premiums have no effect on premiums already paid such amounts however may be transferred among the investment accounts of the variable account or the fixed account in the manner described in transfers of account value transfers of account value all or part of an owners contract value may be transferred among the investment accounts of the variable account or to the fixed account at any time during the accumulation period upon receipt of a proper written request by aul at its home office the minimum amount that may be transferred from any one investment account is  or if less than  the owners remaining contract value in the investment account provided however that amounts transferred from the fixed account to an investment account during any given contract year cannot exceed  of the owners fixed account value as of the beginning of that contract year if after any transfer the owners remaining contract value in an investment account or in the fixed account would be less than  then such request will be treated as a request for a

are currently imposed upon transfers aul reserves the right however at a future date to change the limitation on the minimum transfer to assess transfer charges to change the limit on remaining balances to limit the number and frequency of transfers and to suspend any transfer privileges if we determine that the transfers made by or on behalf of one or more owners are to the disadvantage of other owners we may restrict the rights of certain owners we also reserve the right to limit the size of transfers and remaining balances to limit the number and frequency of transfers and to discontinue telephone interactive voice response or internet based transfers any transfer from an investment account of the variable account shall be effected as of the end of the valuation date in

its procedures part of a contract owners fixed account value may be transferred to one or more investment accounts of the variable account during the accumulation period subject to certain limitations as described in the fixed account dollar cost averaging program owners who wish to purchase units of an investment account over a period of time may do so through the dollar cost averaging dca program the theory of dollar cost averaging is that greater numbers of accumulation units are purchased at times when the unit prices are relatively low  pbposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th than are purchased when the prices are higher this has the effect when purchases are made at different prices of reducing the aggregate average cost per accumulation unit to less than the average of the

federal income taxes on values under a contract on annuity payments and on the economic benefits to the owner the annuitant and the beneficiary or other payee may depend upon the type of qualified plan for which the contract is purchased and a number of different factors the discussion contained herein and in the statement of additional information is general in nature it is based upon auls understanding of the present federal income tax laws as currently interpreted by the internal revenue service irs and is not intended as tax advice no representation is made regarding the likelihood of continuation of the present federal income tax laws or of the current interpretations by the irs future legislation may affect annuity contracts adversely moreover no attempt is made to consider any applicable state or other laws because of the inherent complexity of such laws and the fact that tax results will vary according to the terms of the qualified plan and the particular circumstances of the individual involved any person contemplating the purchase of a contract or receiving annuity payments under a contract should consult a qualified tax adviser aul does not make any guarantee regarding the tax status of any contract or any transaction involving the contracts consult your tax advisor diversification standards treasury department regulations under section h of the code prescribe asset diversification requirements which are expected to be met by the investment companies whose shares are sold to the investment accounts failure to meet these requirements would jeopardize the tax status of the contracts see the statement of additional information for additional details in connection with the issuance of the regulations governing diversification under section h of the code the treasury department announced that it would issue future regulations or rulings addressing the circumstances in which a variable contract owners control of the investments of  pbposst�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�st a separate account may cause the contract owner rather than the insurance company to be treated as the owner of the assets held by the separate account if the variable contract owner is considered the owner of the securities underlying the separate account income and gains produced by those securities would be included currently in a contract owners gross income it is not clear at present what these regulations or rulings may provide it is possible that when the regulations or rulings are issued the contracts may need to be modified in order to remain in compliance aul intends to make reasonable efforts to comply with any such regulations or rulings so that the contracts will be treated as annuity contracts for federal income tax purposes and reserves the right to make such changes as it deems appropriate for that purpose taxation of annuities in general  nonqualified plans section  of the code governs taxation of annuities in general a contract owner is not taxed on increases in value under an annuity contract until some form of distribution is made under the contract however the increase in value may be subject to tax currently under certain circumstances see contracts owned by nonnatural persons below and diversification standards above  surrenders or withdrawals prior to the annuity date code section  provides that amounts received upon a total or partial surrender or withdrawal from a contract prior to the annuity date generally will be treated as gross income to the extent that the cash value of the contract determined without regard to any surrender charge in the case of a partial withdrawal exceeds the investment in the contract in general the investment in the contract is that portion if any of premiums paid under a contract less any distributions received previously under the contract that are excluded from the recipients gross income the taxable portion is taxed at ordinary income tax rates for purposes of this rule a pledge or assignment of a contract is treated as a payment received on account of a partial withdrawal of a contract similarly loans under a contract generally are treated as distributions under the contract  surrenders or withdrawals on or after the annuity date upon receipt of a lumpsum payment the recipient is taxed if the cash value of the contract exceeds the investment in the contract  amounts received as an annuity for amounts received as an annuity the taxable portion of each payment is determined by using a formula known as the exclusion ratio which establishes the ratio that the investment in the contract bears to the total expected amount of annuity payments for the term of the contract that ratio is then applied to each payment to determine the nontaxable portion of the payment that remaining portion of each payment is taxed at ordinary income rates once the excludible portion of annuity payments to date equals the investment in the contract the balance of the annuity payments will be fully taxable withholding of federal income taxes on all distributions may be required unless a recipient who is eligible elects not to have any amounts withheld and properly notifies aul of that election special rules apply to withholding on distributions from employee benefit plans that are qualified under section a of the internal revenue code  penalty tax on certain surrenders and withdrawals with respect to amounts withdrawn or distributed before the recipient reaches age   a penalty tax is imposed equal to  of the portion of such amount which is includible in gross income however the penalty tax is not applicable to withdrawals  made on or after the death of the owner or where the owner is not an individual the death of the primary annuitant who is defined as the individual the events in whose life are of primary importance in affecting the timing and amount of the payout under the contract  attributable to the recipients becoming totally disabled within the meaning of code section m or  which are part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments not less frequently than annually made for the life or life expectancy of the recipient or the joint lives or joint life expectancies of the recipient and his beneficiary the  penalty also does not apply in certain other circumstances described in code section  if the penalty tax does not apply to a surrender or withdrawal as a result of the application of item  above and the series of payments are subsequently modified other than by reason of death or disability the tax for the first year in which the modification occurs will be increased by an amount determined in accordance with irs regulations equal to the tax that would have been imposed but for item  above plus interest for the deferral period if the modification takes place a before the close of the period which is five years from the date of the first payment and after the recipient attains age   or b before the recipient reaches age   additional considerations  distributionatdeath rules in order to be treated as an annuity contract a contract must provide the following two
