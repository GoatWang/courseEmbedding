securitization of a portfolio of seasoned performing and reperforming firstlien residential mortgages the notes are backed by  loans with a total interestbearing principal balance of  as of the cutoff date april   the portfolio comprises  daily simple interest dsi loans and has an average original loan size of  the loans are approximately  months seasoned and all are current as of the cutoff date including  bankruptcyperforming loans approximately  of the mortgage loans have been zero times  days delinquent  x  based on the interest paid through date for the past  months under the mortgage bankers association mba delinquency methods approximately  of the loans have been modified  of which happened more than two years ago within the pool  mortgages have noninterestbearing deferred amounts as of the cutoff date which are not certificated into the rated notes and any recoveries on these will instead be payable to the holders of the class x notes as a result of the seasoning of the collateral none of the loans are subject to the consumer financial protection bureau abilitytorepayqualified mortgage rules an affiliate of bfa ivb depositor llc the depositor acquired the loans

opportunity master fund ivb lp the sponsor on the closing date the transferring trusts will assign the loans to the depositor who will contribute the loans to the trust the sponsor will acquire and retain a  eligible vertical interest in each class of securities to be issued to satisfy the credit risk retention requirements under section g of the securities exchange act of  and the regulations promulgated thereunder these loans were originated and previously serviced by citifinancial credit company as of the cutoff date all of the loans are serviced by bayview loan servicing llc there will not be any advancing of delinquent principal or interest on any mortgages by the servicer or any other party to the transaction however the servicer is obligated to make advances in respect of taxes and insurance reasonable costs and expenses incurred in the course of servicing and disposing of properties the transaction employs a sequentialpay cash flow structure principal proceeds can be used to cover interest shortfalls on the class a and class b notes and the related interestonly bonds but such shortfalls on more subordinate bonds will not be paid from principal in addition diverted interest from the mortgage loans will be used to pay down principal on the notes sequentially the lack of principal and interest advances on delinquent mortgages may increase the possibility of periodic interest shortfalls to the noteholders however principal proceeds used to pay interest to the notes sequentially and subordination levels greater than expected losses may provide for timely payment of interest to the rated notes the ratings reflect transactional strengths that include underlying assets that have generally performed well through the crisis an experienced servicer and strong structural features additionally a thirdparty due diligence review was performed on the portfolio with respect to regulatory compliance payment history data capture and title and lien review

representations and warranties framework that includes an unrated representation provider bayview opportunity master fund ivb lp with a backstop by an unrated entity bayview asset management llc and certain knowledge qualifiers mitigating factors include  significant loan seasoning and relatively clean performance history in recent years  thirdparty due diligence review  a strong representations and warranties enforcement mechanism including delinquency review trigger and  for representations and warranties with knowledge qualifiers even if the sponsor did not have actual knowledge of the breach the remedy provider is still required to remedy the breach in the same manner as if no knowledge qualifier had been made the enforcement mechanism for breaches of representations includes automatic breach reviews by a thirdparty reviewer for any seriously delinquent loans or any loans that incur loss upon liquidation resolution of disputes are ultimately subject to determination in an arbitration proceeding the dbrs ratings of aaa sf and aa sf address the timely payment of interest and full payment of principal by the legal final maturity date in accordance with the terms and
