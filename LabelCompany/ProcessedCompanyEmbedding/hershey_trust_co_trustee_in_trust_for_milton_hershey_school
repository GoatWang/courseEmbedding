mmmainjpg the pennsylvania office of attorney general is seeking the resignation of three longstanding board members of the milton hershey school trust according to a letter obtained by the inquirer file by christian alexandersen calexandersenpennlivecom update the pennsylvania office of attorney general is seeking the resignation of three longstanding board members of the milton hershey school trust according to a letter obtained by the inquirer the trust  which was established by chocolate magnate milton hershey  has been in an upheaval over the past couple years amid allegations that the charity has misused funds the attorney generals office  which has perviously investigated the trust  still has concerns about how the trust is being managed the hershey trust operates a  billion charity that owns hersheypark and has a controlling interest in the chocolate company in a complex arrangement the trust company is manged by a board of trustees who also serve as the directors for the milton hershey school in derry township a private boarding school for children from lowincome families a letter sent by mark pacella the chief deputy attorney general who oversees charitable organizations pointed to several issues the state agency still has regarding the hershey trust  phillycom reported that pacellas letter asked the hershey trust directors to reduce board compensation and requested that members personally bear the cost related to an internal conflictofinterest investigation pacella also said in the letter that the attorney general is seeking the resignation of board members who have served more than  years by july  according to the charitys website the three board members who have served for more than  years are velma redmond joseph senser and robert cavanaugh the request for resignations comes after three board members resigned in the past year board member john estey  a former aide to gov ed rendell  was fired recently after he was charged with scamming the fbi out of  in bribe money board spokesman kent jarrell said the hershey trust company and the milton hershey school boards have history of voluntarily and constructively working attorney generals office they are fully cooperating with the attorney generals charitable trusts and organizations sections recent inquiries  we expect to appropriately resolve outstanding concerns the office has concerning the interpretation of the  deed of milton s hershey where he outlined his wishes to provide a funding mechanism to provide the milton hershey school with sustainable financial resources in perpetuity jarrell said issues for the trust began with the  purchase of the wren dale golf course which later became hershey links by the trust  there were allegations that the trust bought the golf course at an inflated value to bail out one of their own that it sunk  million into the course for their own benefit that compensation for trustees has risen well above their service and that trustees family members benefited through business dealing with the school  all of which culminated with an investigation by the pennsylvania attorney generals office in  after two years of looking into the matter the attorney generals office released its findings  no harm no foul but also a slate of reforms on how the trust is governed the changes included a pay cut for board members a limit on how many trustees can sit on the boards of both the hershey co and hershey entertainment  resorts new processes for how the trust and school buy or sell land and a process for how trustees deal

milton hershey school opinionin  milton and catherine hershey established the milton hershey school a charitable institution funded by the milton hershey school trust   the deed of trust is the original agreement between the hersheys the hershey trust company as trustee and the managers of the trust   the deed as amended in  provides that the trust company and the board of managers which consists of members of the board of directors of the trust company are to administer the trust and have responsibility for all aspects of running the school and for managing the trusts assets   the deed also states “all children shall leave the institution and cease to be the recipients of its benefits upon the completion of the full course of secondary education being offered at the school”  in re milton hershey school  ad   pacmwlth quoting deed of trust november   at in  at milton hersheys direction school alumni and a former superintendent formed the milton hershey school alumni association   the association is composed mostly of school graduates though it includes honorary and associate members   the association is not a division of the school or trust company  it was not named in the deed of trust and is not an intended beneficiary of the trustaround  the association believed the trusts resources were being diverted from the purpose of helping orphaned children   the association contacted the attorney general which investigated and concluded the trust company was not acting consistent with the trusts intent   in  the attorney general the school and the trust company entered an agreement governing certain aspects of the administration of the trust and the schoolin  this agreement was modified essentially rescinding the  agreement   following the modification the association commenced an action in the orphans court seeking rescission of the  agreement reinstatement of the  agreement and appointment of a guardian ad litem and trustee ad litem   the school and the trust company filed preliminary objections alleging the association lacked standing to challenge the rescission of the  agreement  the trial court granted the preliminary objectionsthe commonwealth court en banc reversed in a fourtothree decision finding the association had a “special interest” in the complainedof actions of the trustee that supported its standing to seek enforcement of the trust   see in re milton hershey school at    the court observed the association was created at the direction of the trusts primary settlor with the purpose of promoting school interests and establishing and maintaining supplemental education programs and activities for students  id at    it also summarized the associations efforts to preserve school traditions and trust assets including prompting of the attorney general to address perceived improprieties and expending its own financial resources to aid that investigation  id at the court acknowledged standing generally requires a “ substantial direct and immediate interest” in the subject matter of the litigation   id at  quoting william penn parking garage inc v city of pittsburgh  pa   ad     it observed in charitable trusts courts have fashioned a “special interest” doctrine consistent with the restatement second of trusts  id at  quoting restatement second trusts §   “a suit can be maintained for the enforcement of a charitable trust by the attorney general or other public officer or by a cotrustee or by a person who has a special interest in the enforcement of the charitable trust․”  the court cited valley forge historical society v washington memorial chapel  pa   ad   approving standing of historical society to restrain trustees of memorial chapel from evicting society from chapel under special interest doctrine and wiegand v barnes foundation  pa   ad   citing restatement second trusts §    the court then implemented a fivepart test to determine special interest standing in the charitable trust setting which requires consideration of the extraordinary nature of the acts complained of and the remedy sought   the presence of fraud or misconduct on the part of the charity or its directors   the attorney generals availability or effectiveness   the nature of the benefited class and its relationship to the charity  and  subjective casespecific circumstancesin re milton hershey school at  quoting mary grace blasko et al standing to sue in the charitable sector  usf lrev      the court found this test struck the best balance preventing unnecessary litigation involving charities while assuring the philanthropic purposes underlying trusts are maintained idapplying this test the court found the circumstances here to be extraordinary citing the need for reform administration of trust assets the decrease in the number of children the school served vis à vis over  billion in trust assets and the associations instrumental role in addressing problems in the trusts administration  id at    the court delineated the year relationship between the association and the trust including their common founder the memberships successful participation in school affairs its ongoing bonds with students the location of the associations offices on trust lands the associations administration of studentrelated activities and graduate assistance programs and the associations intimate knowledge of the type of care provided at the school  idthe court indicated the risk of vexatious or unreasonable litigation was “virtually nonexistent” as the association only sought reasons why the  agreement was supplanted when such agreement had resulted from an extensive investigation by the attorney general funded in part by the association which concluded the trusts charitable purposes were being impeded  id the court also found the associations efforts neither vexatious nor unreasonable  id given the nature of the trust and its status as the largest residential childcare charity in the world the court concluded judicial scrutiny would advance the public interest in assuring the trust is operating efficiently and effectively  idpresident judge colins joined by judges cohn jubelirer and simpson dissented arguing the analysis should begin and end with the deed of trust which endows the board of managers and the trust company with responsibility for school management and trust administration and which does not name the association as an intended beneficiary   see in re milton hershey school at  colins pj dissenting “to now give the association legal rights that were expressly excluded by the settlor of the trust is a dangerous expansion of standing not supported by over  years of case law within the commonwealth”   the dissent pointed out that affording the association standing interferes with the performance of the attorney generals statutorily mandated duties  id at    the dissent also characterized the majoritys holding as “a quantum leap” away from historical concepts of standing   see id the facts are not in dispute   the commonwealth court found the trial court committed an error of law by granting the preliminary objections   id at   see also in re estate of bartol  ad   pacmwlth order sustaining preliminary objections affirmed unless trial court committed abuse of discretion or error of law   we are left to decide whether the commonwealth court committed an error of law in its standing analysis  crawford central school district v commonwealth  pa   ad      as this is a purely legal question our standard of review is de novo and scope of review is plenary  craley v state farm fire and casualty company  pa   ad   n   the core concept of standing is that “a party who is not negatively affected by the matter he seeks to challenge is not aggrieved and thus has no right to obtain judicial resolution of his challenge”  city of philadelphia v commonwealth  pa   ad      a litigant is aggrieved when he can show a substantial direct and immediate interest in the outcome of the litigation  william penn parking garage inc at    a litigant possesses a substantial interest if there is a discernable adverse effect to an interest other than that of the general citizenry  id at    it is direct if there is harm to that interest   id it is immediate if it is not a remote consequence of a judgment   id at  private parties generally lack standing to enforce charitable trusts  in re pruners estate  pa   ad      since the public is the object of the settlors beneficiaries in a charitable trust private parties generally have insufficient interest in such trusts to enforce them  id those who may bring an action for the enforcement of a charitable trust include the attorney general a member of the charitable organization or someone having a special interest in the trust   valley forge historical society at  citing millers estate  pa   ad     wiegand v barnes foundation  pa   ad     restatement second of trusts §    a person whose only interest is that interest held in common with other members of the public cannot compel the performance of a duty the organization owes to the public  id citing wiegand at    the question here is whether the association had such a special interest in the enforcement of the trustin in re francis edward mcgillick foundation  pa   ad   the settlor directed half of a foundations income be used to establish scholarships for catholics which a catholic bishop of pittsburgh and his advisory board selected  the other half was to be accumulated toward the establishment of a vocational school again with the participation of the bishop and his advisory board  id at    the pittsburgh diocese sued to remove the foundations trustees   we held the diocese had standing to bring the action because it had an “integral involvement ․ in the awarding of scholarships and its prerogative to participate in the establishment of a vocational school under the trust created an interest ․ which is immediate direct and substantial․” id at in re francis edward mcgillick foundation is distinguishable from the instant case on one key point  the hershey trust does not provide the association with any decisionmaking power or administration over it   the trust in in re francis edward mcgillick foundation specifically directed the bishop and his advisors to select scholarship recipients that were funded through the trust  thus the diocese was directly involved in the trusts administration   here the trust does not mention the association and excludes those who would be members of the association from benefiting from the trustthe association argues valley forge historical society is on point   there the washington memorial chapel sought to evict the valley forge historical society from its property   dr w herbert burk founded the chapel and the society although not by a written document called a “trust”   since its inception in  the society maintained its offices and its collection in the same building as the chapel and claimed a right to remain there based on a trust relationship   the society sought declaratory and injunctive relief  the chapel argued the society lacked standing to bring its action   we found a trust relationship existed and the society had special interest standing   valley forge historical society at    we noted dr burk intended for both the chapel and the society to develop patriotism one through religion and the other through education  id  the society contributed large sums of money to enlarging the chapel and from its origin was a real link to the washington memorial in valley forge  thus the society had a special interest distinguishable from any other historical society not designated by the trust  idvalley forge historical society is instructive but distinguishable from the instant case  valley forge involved a settlor creating two foundations which shared the same building since   we found a trust relationship existed   here the hersheys created the trust in  but the association was not created until  years later   if the hersheys intended for the association to have direct input on trust affairs they could have altered the trust but did not do so   the trust has not been so amendedmore importantly a written trust exists here specifically excluding school graduates from being recipients of the trusts benefits   the association is not mentioned in the trust and the bulk of the associations members are specifically excluded from receiving the benefits of the trust   to give the association “special interest” standing where the settlors of the trust specifically denied beneficiary status to its members would surely contravene the settlors intent expressed through their written trust   see in re milton hershey school at  colins pj dissenting we find the association did not have a special interest sufficient to vest it with standing   nothing in this litigation would affect the association itself  it loses nothing and gains nothing   the associations intensity of concern is real and commendable but it is not a substitute for an actual interest   standing is not created through the associations advocacy or its members past close relationship with the school as former individual recipients of the trusts benefits   the trust did not contemplate the association or anyone else to be a “shadow board” of graduates with standing to challenge actions the board takes   see in re francis edward mcgillick foundation at  grave doubt as to standing of stranger to object to waste of trust assets the attorney general is granted the authority to enforce charitable trusts  valley forge historical society at   see also  ps § c  current law allowed the association an outside group to urge the attorney general to enforce the trust   however the associations disagreement with the attorney generals decision to modify the  agreement does not vest the association with standing to challenge that decision in court   ultimately the associations dismay is more properly directed at the attorney generals actions and decisions  it is insufficient to establish standing herewe hold the association did not have standing to bring this action   order reversed   jurisdiction relinquishedjustice eakin chief justice cappy justices castille newman and baer join the
