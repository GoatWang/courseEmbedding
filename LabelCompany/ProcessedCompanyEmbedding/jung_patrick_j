of green bay and prairie du chien by dr patrick j jung marquette university french canadians began to settle in the state of wisconsin during the early s the two principal settlements in the state were at green bay and prairie du chien and the settlers at both locations laid out their farms in longlot fashion just as french canadians did in quebec along the st lawrence river the lots were usually several hundred yards in width and often extended miles in length at green bay the lots fronted the fox river while in prairie du chien they fronted the mississippi river most of the lots at both locations exceeded two hundred acres and few were even as large as six hundred acres most settlers used only a small portion of their lots for growing food the rest was used to harvest hay and forest products such as timber when the united states took control of the transappalachian west after the american revolution in  the region was dotted with many small frenchcanadian settlements at places such as green bay prairie du chien mackinac island detroit vincennes and st louis the federal government decided to recognize the settlers ownership of these lands and government commissioners went out and investigated individual land claims federal commissioners investigated the land claims at prairie du chien and green bay beginning in  and submitted their final report five years later in  the united states congress confirmed the commissioners findings and ordered the general land office to issue patents to those residents who met the proper residency requirements the patents issued by the government gave the settlers clear and undisputed ownership of their lands some residents had not lived at either location long enough to meet the residency requirements and they were not given patents however many of these residents presented individual petitions to congress and were later given patents to their lands shortly after receiving their patents many of the residents began to sell their lands to newlyarrived americans from new england and new york who wanted to lay out town sites at green bay an american trader from new hampshire named daniel whitney bought up much of this land and created the town of navarino many of the french canadian residents had fallen into debt with the american fur company which was owned by john jacob astor in lieu of payment astor took land from the residents and he also began a town site that he named astor john lawe a canadian of english descent began yet a third town site at green bay called munnomunee later all three of these towns were incorporated into the city of green bay the purchase of land was less frenzied at prairie du chien but a few persons still dabbled in land speculation particularly an american named james lockwood however the largest of owner of land was a french canadian named joseph rollette who already had a large amount of land that was confirmed to him by the federal commissioners and the united states congress he bought up even more land from his neighbors during the s and by  he owned more land at prairie du chien than any other person the maps that accompany this text were made by the federal commissioners who investigated the land claims at green bay and prairie du chien they are important historical documents for the study of early green bay and prairie du chien map of prairie du chien
