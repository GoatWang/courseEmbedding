research is the numerical simulation of flow processes current work is directed toward the fluid mechanics of nonnewtonian and viscoelastic liquids and their analysis by finite element methods mechanically these fluids are described by nonlinear constitutive equations of the differential and integral type the parameters modulus viscosity relaxation times which appear in these equations must be fitted from rheological data which in practice is incomplete a current project is directed at developing algorithms for optimal fitting with incomplete data modern manufacturing techniques are motivated by the need to rapidly produce prototypes of new products one method of rapid prototyping is controlled deposition of micro droplets which solidify to produce a threedimensional object layeruponlayer current technology limits the droplet materials to thermoplastic waxes and certain plastics the goal is to extend the technology to functional materials especially metals the simulation problem to be solved is the detailed description of droplet impact on a surface followed by solidification this work is being carried out in conjunction with experimental work at cornell university molten glass processing is modeled by treating the glass as a newtonian fluid with a strongly temperaturesensitive viscosity hence heat transfer including relative transfer is the controlling factor in the simulation of the processing of glass in the molten state for glasses with stratified refractive index the description of radiative transfer is being developed for application to the simulation of drawing of optical fibers background education and training phd stanford university  bs university of british columbia  bruce caswell maximus inc profile  biography  bloomberg feedback bruce
