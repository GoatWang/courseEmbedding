reit industry lagging in technology adoption over the last  years the real estate investment trust reit industry has seen meteoric growth reit market capitalizations grew from around  billion in  to  billion in  and surpassed  trillion in  in addition the average daily trading volume has nearly doubled in the last five years increasing from  billion in  to  billion in  despite its impressive growth the reit industry has lagged in adopting commercial real estate technology there are two reasons for this that immediately come to mind technology adoption is held back by the mindset that commercial real estate cre including reits is only about buildings and other physical structures in reality cre is about data  — the collection analyzing and sharing of vast amounts of data this realization is vital to being a leader in the competitive reit world many reits have been managed using a very entrepreneurial style instead of following a more traditional processoriented approach as a result operational efficiencies have not been realized through the adoption of more modern software currently the reit industry faces a number of challenges and complexities including stakeholder visibility – knowledgeable investors are demanding greater transparency and more information to better understand risk and make decisions manually gathering and aggregating this data can be timeconsuming but investment management and reporting solutions can alleviate this burden local and global requirements – the global growth of reits and the need to manage portfolios of properties from different countries forces commercial real estate companies to review available reit technology to accommodate local conditions and reporting requirements uncertain reit forecasts – nareit national association of real estate trusts believes that reit forecasts are favorable for  however they do cite a risk of interest rate increases as well as an unpredictable economic environment this uncertainty in reit forecasts does require more formalized modeling forecasting and planning potential regulatory changes – the tremendous growth of reits and the increase in reit conversions by investment companies has not gone unnoticed by regulatory bodies aside from minimal taxation changes under the path act of  very few new regulations have been introduced to impact reits directly over the last couple of years if tax laws change in the future the general consensus is that reits will still be treated favorably from a taxation perspective sustainability reporting – the sustainability movement is gaining a lot of traction and the impact is being felt in the reit environment investors environmental regulators and other interested parties are demanding green initiatives backed by data to prove their effectiveness the need to disclose sustainability data and performance adds to the reit’s reporting burden but green initiatives have been paying off and the right technology can help with monitoring and reporting why reits should invest in software navigating the reit environment can be a nightmare for cre professionals who don’t have the latest tools at their disposal reit management companies are beginning to realize that achieving greater operational efficiencies cost reductions and better risk management will be important differentiators reit technology and commercial real estate solutions promote the streamlining of processes through automation and centralization once reit technology has been implemented the focus of daytoday reit management moves away from pure real estate accounting financial data gathering and reporting to reit analysis planning reit forecasts financial modeling and running “what if” scenarios the result is a far more proactive tone in reit asset management combining superior decision making with operational effectiveness those reits employing uptodate integrated commercial real estate technology solutions are certain to have a competitive edge over their rivals learn more about improving data management for public reits in the ondemand webinar or sign up for our next live webinar to learn about automating reporting

dividend yields laurie kulikowski jun    am edt new york thestreet  real estate investment trusts that specifically invest in the retail sector have been challenged  to say the least  not only from lower overall consumer spending of late but online shopping continues to threaten brickandmortar stores yet there are still sound investments in the retail reit sector retail reits invest in shopping centers malls convenience stores and retail chains investors generally like reits for their strong dividend income among other factors as reits are required to pay out at least  of their income in the form of dividends to investors each year one potential boost to the retail reit sector is the transformation of stores as separate from their online counterparts its a growing strategy called omnichannel shopping and combines both online and instore experiences to allow the customer to purchase how and when she wants retail chains like apple aapl and macys m are forging ahead with socalled omnichannel shopping strategies and that could benefit retail reits wrote bank of america merrill lynch analyst jeffrey spector in a note to clients in december for retail reits with dominant assets
