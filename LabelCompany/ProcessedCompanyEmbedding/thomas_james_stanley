of thomas stanley st baron stanley and joan goushill a landed magnate of immense power particularly across the northwest of england where his authority went almost unchallenged even by the crown stanley managed to remain in favour with successive kings throughout the wars of the roses until his death in  his estates included what is now tatton park in cheshire lathom house in lancashire and derby house in the city of london now the site of the college of arms although the king for the early part of his career henry vi was head of the house of lancaster stanley’s marriage to eleanor daughter of richard neville th earl of salisbury a descendant of edward iii and sister of richard neville earl of warwick ‘warwick the kingmaker’ in the late s constituted a powerful alliance with the house of york this did him no harm however even after warwick was toppled from power and in  with the house of york now occupying the english throne he married his second wife lady margaret beaufort

titles including those of baron stanley and king of mann as well as his extensive lands and offices in cheshire and lancashire it was a formidable inheritance and gave him ample opportunity to gain experience in the leadership of men at the same time his fathers prominence in the kings household had provided him with an early introduction to court where he was named among the squires of henry vi in  nevertheless in the febrile and bloodthirsty circumstances of the wars of the roses it was a position fraught with danger as rival claimants for the throne – successively the houses of lancaster and york – demanded threatened or begged for the support of stanley and his followers lancaster vs yorkedit the stanleys had been among the earliest supporters of henry bolingbroke’s bid to win the english throne for the house of lancaster in  and stanley’s greatgrandfather sir john stanley had been richly rewarded for his assistance after some years of weak and ineffectual government led by the lancastrian henry vi a challenge from the house of york broke out into open warfare in the s in the war of the roses in  an accord between the lancastrian and the yorkist lords broke down and the conflict lapped at the borders of the stanleys’ sphere of influence with the earl of salisbury stanley’s fatherinlaw mobilising on behalf of the house of york queen margaret of anjou at lichfield ordered stanley to raise forces to intercept him however when the two armies met at the battle of blore heath in  though only a few miles away stanley kept his  men out of the fight his brother sir william stanley who was certainly in the yorkist army was subsequently attainted yet by  lord stanley had begun to cooperate with the yorkist lords who by this time had possession of the king and ruled in his name and he rapidly consolidated his association with the new regime in the early s he joined his brotherinlaw warwick in the campaigns against the lancastrian forces and stanley was confirmed in his fees and offices as the new king edward iv needed him to secure the northwest in the late s however the coalition that had brought the yorkist edward to the throne was fracturing and stanley found his loyalties divided once again “the dramatic shifts in political fortune between  and  and their impact on the tangled networks of affinity and allegiance are hard to unravel” when warwick fleeing before edward in  made his way to manchester in the hope of support stanley was not forthcoming but on warwicks return he lent him armed support in the restoration of the house of lancaster and of henry vi lord stanley was soon forgiven for his disloyalty after the restoration of edward iv in  he was appointed steward of the kings household and thereafter became a regular member of the royal council yet the death of his first wife eleanor neville at this period severed his connection with warwick and the nevilles and allowed in  a marriage of still greater political significance his new wife lady margaret beaufort dowager countess of richmond was the mother of henry tudor – potential heir of the house of lancaster militarily during this period and now a stalwart of the yorkist regime stanley led several hundred men in the expedition to france in  and in  served with a large company in the campaign of the duke of gloucester later richard iii in scotland playing a key role in the capture of berwick upon tweed after the unexpected death of edward iv in  and the accession of his twelveyearold son edward v stanley was among those who sought to maintain a balance of power between the young kings uncle richard duke of gloucester who was now lord protector and his maternal family the woodvilles stanley’s own son and heir george stanley lord strange was married to joan le strange whose mother was jacquetta woodville the dowager queen’s sister when gloucester attacked this group at a council meeting in june  stanley was wounded and imprisoned but at least spared the fate of lord hastings – that of summary execution that month parliament declared edward v and his younger brother richard duke of york the princes in the tower illegitimate on the grounds that their father edward ivs marriage to elizabeth woodville was bigamous by way of a prior precontract of marriage with eleanor butler the duke of gloucester was therefore declared king richard iii by public acclamation later confirmed by parliament under the act titulus regius apparently “in preparing the ground for the usurpation and in consolidating his position richard found it more expedient to appease than to alienate the house of stanley” thus lord stanley was soon at liberty and continued as steward of the royal household apparently flourishing at the heart of the new regime he bore the great mace at richards coronation while his wife carried the new queen’s train richard stripped stanleys wife margaret beaufort of all her titles and possession for her part in compassyng and doyng treason but transferred all her properties to stanley effectively negating much of the punishment he was also appointed to the order of the garter taking the stall vacated by the executed lord hastings this commitment bore further fruit in the autumn of  when a series of plots against the king coalesced into buckinghams rebellion a rising in southern and western england under the loose leadership of the duke of buckingham when richard rose to suppress the rebellion stanley and his brother william were at the kings side and were richly rewarded from the forfeited estates of the rebels and stanley was appointed to buckingham’s position as lord high constable of england whilst stanley might have had no other option than to act as richard’s loyal subject it is conceivable that he may himself have become involved in the uprising his wife margaret beaufort was a key conspirator having brokered the marriage alliance between edward iv’s daughter elizabeth of york and her son henry tudor indeed it was only by giving a solemn undertaking to richard to keep his wife in custody and to end her intrigues that stanley saved her from attainder and disgrace and presumably his own position at the same time richard was evidently well aware of the threat from this quarter since in the summer of  when stanley sought permission to leave the court and return to his northern fastness of lathom the king insisted that his son george stanley lord strange take his place at court as a token for his father’s good behaviour the battle of bosworthedit main article battle of bosworth field the stanleys had been communicating with the exiled henry tudor for some time and tudors strategy of landing in wales and heading east into central england depended on the acquiescence of sir william stanley as chamberlain of chester and north wales and by extension on that of lord stanley himself on hearing of the invasion richard ordered the two stanleys to raise the men of the region in readiness to oppose the invader however once it was clear that tudor was marching unopposed through wales richard ordered lord stanley to join him without delay according to the croyland chronicle although lord stanley excused himself on the grounds of illness the sweating sickness by now richard had firm evidence of the stanleys’ complicity after an unsuccessful bid to escape from court lord strange had confessed that he and his uncle sir william stanley had conspired with henry tudor richard proclaimed him as traitor and let it be known that strange’s life was hostage for his fathers loyalty in the coming conflict indeed richard allegedly issued orders for strange’s execution on the battlefield although in the event these were never carried out lord stanley’s response to richard’s threat was reportedly laconic “sire i have other sons” three armies followed each other into the midlands lord stanley and his forces then sir william stanley and finally henry tudor and a host comprising tudor retainers dispossessed lancastrian exiles and many men of wales and cheshire lord stanley may have secretly met with henry on the eve of the battle but when the stanleyites arrived south of the village of market bosworth on  august they took up a position independent of both the royal forces and the rebel army in effect the two brothers played similar roles to those they had played at the battle of blore heath over a quarter of a century earlier lord stanley took no direct part in the action but stood unmoving between the two armies and it was sir williams decisive intervention that gave henry the victory after the despatch of richard who had gone into battle crowned polydore vergil records that the fallen coronet was retrieved and placed by lord stanley on his stepson’s head before his cheering troops thereby emphasising the critical role the stanleys had played in bringing henry tudor to the throne further prizesedit henry demonstrated his gratitude to his “right dearly beloved father” by creating him earl of derby on  october  and the following year confirmed him in office as lord high constable of england and high steward of the duchy of lancaster besides granting him other estates and offices in  stanley also stood as godfather to henry’s eldest son arthur prince of wales even so at the time of the lambert simnel rising of  there may have been some concern that the stanleys were again hedging their bets and “there was relief in the royal host when the stanleyites came in at nottingham” the aftermath of the battle of stoke which crushed this rising brought still further rewards for stanley – notably the lands forfeited by viscount lovell sir thomas pilkington and sir thomas broughton in lancashire and elsewhere in  the stanleys again made a notable contribution to the army raised by henry to suppress a rising in yorkshire less successfully stanley’s brother william unwisely supported the later pretender perkin warbeck and was at last executed for treason in  dominance of northwest englandedit throughout his career alongside the main performance of national events the preservation and enhancement of stanley’s own role as regional magnate was a very important sideshow change of regime never really weakened his grip on the key offices of chester and lancaster and throughout his life stanley consolidated the legacy he had inherited from his father and extended his hegemony and that of his family across the northwest given the range of his officeholding both regionally and at court he did not need to draw ruinously on his own resources to dispense patronage on a grand scale and he was active in the arbitration of local disputes even state matters were regularly referred for his personal adjudication that said ‘good lordship’ also had its harder face and the stanleys brooked no opposition and tolerated few rivals in their areas of dominance involvement with the princes in the toweredit main article princes in the tower stanley was made constable of england by richard iii towards the end of  the year in which edward v and richard duke of york the princes in the tower disappeared from their confinement in the tower of london as constable originally a position which constituted command of the royal armies stanley was formally responsible for anyone who entered or left the tower – then the most secure of royal palaces in this capacity and as a loyal member of the ricardian regime at the time it can be argued that he was at least an accessory to the princes’ deaths since once they had entered the security of the tower they were never seen or heard of again that said since the duke of buckingham preceded stanley as constable of the tower stanley could realistically only have had such an opportunity after buckingham’s rebellion and execution in october and november  on becoming constable this would have given richard and buckingham – considered a far more likely contender for killer of the princes – ample opportunity to dispose of the princes between their confinement in may  and the rebellion in october also since buckingham’s uprising was expressly staged in favour of henry tudor’s claim to the throne – rather than that of the missing edward v – it seems reasonable to assume that buckingham knew the princes were already dead prior to his rebellion and hence stanley succeeding as constable however it has also been suggested that in view of his being the stepfather of henry tudor and deserting richard at bosworth it is not inconceivable that stanley was at least in part responsible for the princes death after henrys accession the princes still living would have presented just as much of a problem to henrys occupation of the throne as they did to richards more so in fact as henry in repealing titulus regius the act of parliament that declared the boys illegitimate and therefore not heirs to the throne made the elder of the two the lawful king deathedit stanley died at lathom lancashire on  july  and was buried in the family chapel in burscough priory near ormskirk in lancashire surrounded by the tombs of his parents and others of his ancestors he

political success amid the most challenging of circumstances he had not only escaped the bloody fate of so many of his political contemporaries including his brother but on top of the great patrimony he inherited from his father he acquired huge estates and national offices the garter and an earldom these and his closeness to successive royal families – whom he could count amongst his kith and kin by several different connections – made him a figure of great power and influence under his adroit leadership the northwest escaped the worst horrors of decades of civil war that devastated other parts of england and his family “helped bring a degree of cultivation and refinement to the northwest” their patronage underpinned the careers of a number of young lancashire men including william smyth hugh oldham and christopher urswick who went on to become pillars of the tudor church and state the senior line of the descendants of thomas stanley and eleanor neville continued to hold the earldom of derby until the death of james stanley th earl of derby in  the title then passed to a junior branch of the family the baronets stanley of bickerstaffe descended from sir james stanley

opportunity after buckingham’s rebellion and execution in october and november  on becoming constable this would have given richard and buckingham – considered a far more likely contender for killer of the princes – ample opportunity to dispose of the princes between their confinement in may  and the rebellion in october also since buckingham’s uprising was expressly staged in favour of henry tudor’s claim to the throne – rather than that of the missing edward v – it seems reasonable to assume that buckingham knew the princes were already dead prior to his rebellion and hence stanley succeeding as constable however it has also been suggested that in view of his being the stepfather of henry tudor and deserting richard at bosworth it is not inconceivable that stanley was at least in part responsible for the princes death after henrys accession the princes still living would have presented just as much of a problem to henrys occupation of the throne as they did to richards more

titles including those of baron stanley and king of mann as well as his extensive lands and offices in cheshire and lancashire it was a formidable inheritance and gave him ample opportunity to gain experience in the leadership of men at the same time his fathers prominence in the kings household had provided him with an early introduction to court where he was named among the squires of henry vi in  nevertheless in the febrile and bloodthirsty circumstances of the wars of the roses it was a position fraught with danger as rival claimants for the throne – successively the houses of lancaster and york – demanded threatened or begged for the support of stanley and his followers lancaster vs yorkedit the stanleys had been among the earliest supporters of henry bolingbroke’s bid to win the english throne for the house of lancaster in  and stanley’s greatgrandfather sir john stanley had been richly rewarded for his assistance after some years of weak and ineffectual government led by the lancastrian henry vi a challenge from the house of york broke out into open warfare in the s in the war of the roses in  an accord between the lancastrian and the yorkist lords broke down and the conflict lapped at the borders of the stanleys’ sphere of influence with the earl of salisbury stanley’s fatherinlaw mobilising on behalf of the house of york queen margaret of anjou at lichfield ordered stanley to raise forces to intercept him however when the two armies met at the battle of blore heath in  though only a few miles away stanley kept his  men out of the fight his brother sir william stanley who was certainly in the yorkist army was subsequently attainted yet by  lord stanley had begun to cooperate with the yorkist lords who by this time had possession of the king and ruled in his name and he rapidly consolidated his association with the new regime in the early s he joined his brotherinlaw warwick in the campaigns against the lancastrian forces and stanley was confirmed in his fees and offices as the new king edward iv needed him to secure the northwest in the late s however the coalition that had brought the yorkist edward to the throne was fracturing and stanley found his loyalties divided once again “the dramatic shifts in political fortune between  and  and their impact on the tangled networks of affinity and allegiance are hard to unravel” when warwick fleeing before edward in  made his way to manchester in the hope of support stanley was not forthcoming but on warwicks return he lent him armed support in the restoration of the house of lancaster and of henry vi lord stanley was soon forgiven for his disloyalty after the restoration of edward iv in  he was appointed steward of the kings household and thereafter became a regular member of the royal council yet the death of his first wife eleanor neville at this period severed his connection with warwick and the nevilles and allowed in  a marriage of still greater political significance his new wife lady margaret beaufort dowager countess of richmond was the mother of henry tudor – potential heir of the house of lancaster militarily during this period and now a stalwart of the yorkist regime stanley led several hundred men in the expedition to france in  and in  served with a large company in the campaign of the duke of gloucester later richard iii in scotland playing a key role in the capture of berwick upon tweed after the unexpected death of edward iv in  and the accession of his twelveyearold son edward v stanley was among those who sought to maintain a balance of power between the young kings uncle richard duke of gloucester who was now lord protector and his maternal family the woodvilles stanley’s own son and heir george stanley lord strange was married to joan le strange whose mother was jacquetta woodville the dowager queen’s sister when gloucester attacked this group at a council meeting in june  stanley was wounded and imprisoned but at least spared the fate of lord hastings – that of summary execution that month parliament declared edward v and his younger brother richard duke of york the princes in the tower illegitimate on the grounds that their father edward ivs marriage to elizabeth woodville was bigamous by way of a prior precontract of marriage with eleanor butler the duke of gloucester was therefore declared king richard iii by public acclamation later confirmed by parliament under the act titulus regius apparently “in preparing the ground for the usurpation and in consolidating his position richard found it more expedient to appease than to alienate the house of stanley” thus lord stanley was soon at liberty and continued as steward of the royal household apparently flourishing at the heart of the new regime he bore the great mace at richards coronation while his wife carried the new queen’s train richard stripped stanleys wife margaret beaufort of all her titles and possession for her part in compassyng and doyng treason but transferred all her properties to stanley effectively negating much of the punishment he was also appointed to the order of the garter taking the stall vacated by the executed lord hastings this commitment bore further fruit in the autumn of  when a series of plots against the king coalesced into buckinghams rebellion a rising in southern and western england under the loose leadership of the duke of buckingham when richard rose to suppress the rebellion stanley and his brother william were at the kings side and were richly rewarded from the forfeited estates of the rebels and stanley was appointed to buckingham’s position as lord high constable of england whilst stanley might have had no other option than to act as richard’s loyal subject it is conceivable that he may himself have become involved in the uprising his wife margaret beaufort was a key conspirator having brokered the marriage alliance between edward iv’s daughter elizabeth of york and her son henry tudor indeed it was only by giving a solemn undertaking to richard to keep his wife in custody and to end her intrigues that stanley saved her from attainder and disgrace and presumably his own position at the same time richard was evidently well aware of the threat from this quarter since in the summer of  when stanley sought permission to leave the court and return to his northern fastness of lathom the king insisted that his son george stanley lord strange take his place at court as a token for his father’s good behaviour the battle of bosworthedit main article battle of bosworth field the stanleys had been communicating with the exiled henry tudor for some time and tudors strategy of landing in wales and heading east into central england depended on the acquiescence of sir william stanley as chamberlain of chester and north wales and by extension on that of lord stanley himself on hearing of the invasion richard ordered the two stanleys to raise the men of the region in readiness to oppose the invader however once it was clear that tudor was marching unopposed through wales richard ordered lord stanley to join him without delay according to the croyland chronicle although lord stanley excused himself on the grounds of illness the sweating sickness by now richard had firm evidence of the stanleys’ complicity after an unsuccessful bid to escape from court lord strange had confessed that he and his uncle sir william stanley had conspired with henry tudor richard proclaimed him as traitor and let it be known that strange’s life was hostage for his fathers loyalty in the coming conflict indeed richard allegedly issued orders for strange’s execution on the battlefield although in the event these were never carried out lord stanley’s response to richard’s threat was reportedly laconic “sire i have other sons” three armies followed each other into the midlands lord stanley and his forces then sir william stanley and finally henry tudor and a host comprising tudor retainers dispossessed lancastrian exiles and many men of wales and cheshire lord stanley may have secretly met with henry on the eve of the battle but when the stanleyites arrived south of the village of market bosworth on  august they took up a position independent of both the royal forces and the rebel army in effect the two brothers played similar roles to those they had played at the battle of blore heath over a quarter of a century earlier lord stanley took no direct part in the action but stood unmoving between the two armies and it was sir williams decisive intervention that gave henry the victory after the despatch of richard who had gone into battle crowned polydore vergil records that the fallen coronet was retrieved and placed by lord stanley on his stepson’s head before his cheering troops thereby emphasising the critical role the stanleys had played in bringing henry tudor to the throne further prizesedit henry demonstrated his gratitude to his “right dearly beloved father” by creating him earl of derby on  october  and the following year confirmed him in office as lord high constable of england and high steward of the duchy of lancaster besides granting him other estates and offices in  stanley also stood as godfather to henry’s eldest son arthur prince of wales even so at the time of the lambert simnel rising of  there may have been some concern that the stanleys were again hedging their bets and “there was relief in the royal host when the stanleyites came in at nottingham” the aftermath of the battle of stoke which crushed this rising brought still further rewards for stanley – notably the lands forfeited by viscount lovell sir thomas pilkington and sir thomas broughton in lancashire and elsewhere in  the stanleys again made a notable contribution to the army raised by henry to suppress a rising in yorkshire less successfully stanley’s brother william unwisely supported the later pretender perkin warbeck and was at last executed for treason in  dominance of northwest englandedit throughout his career alongside the main performance of national events the preservation and enhancement of stanley’s own role as regional magnate was a very important sideshow change of regime never really weakened his grip on the key offices of chester and lancaster and throughout his life stanley consolidated the legacy he had inherited from his father and extended his hegemony and that of his family across the northwest given the range of his officeholding both regionally and at court he did not need to draw ruinously on his own resources to dispense patronage on a grand scale and he was active in the arbitration of local disputes even state matters were regularly referred for his personal adjudication that said ‘good lordship’ also had its harder face and the stanleys brooked no opposition and tolerated few rivals in their areas of dominance involvement with the princes in the toweredit main article princes in the tower stanley was made constable of england by richard iii towards the end of  the year in which edward v and richard duke of york the princes in the tower disappeared from their confinement in the tower of london as constable originally a position which constituted command of the royal armies stanley was formally responsible for anyone who entered or left the tower – then the most secure of royal palaces in this capacity and as a loyal member of the ricardian regime at the time it can be argued that he was at least an accessory to the princes’ deaths since once they had entered the security of the tower they were never seen or heard of again that said since the duke of buckingham preceded stanley as constable of the tower stanley could realistically only have had such an opportunity after buckingham’s rebellion and execution in october and november  on becoming constable this would have given richard and buckingham – considered a far more likely contender for killer of the princes – ample opportunity to dispose of the princes between their confinement in may  and the rebellion in october also since buckingham’s uprising was expressly staged in favour of henry tudor’s claim to the throne – rather than that of the missing edward v – it seems reasonable to assume that buckingham knew the princes were already dead prior to his rebellion and hence stanley succeeding as constable however it has also been suggested that in view of his being the stepfather of henry tudor and deserting richard at bosworth it is not inconceivable that stanley was at least in part responsible for the princes death after henrys accession the princes still living would have presented just as much of a problem to henrys occupation of the throne as they did to richards more

conflict lapped at the borders of the stanleys’ sphere of influence with the earl of salisbury stanley’s fatherinlaw mobilising on behalf of the house of york queen margaret of anjou at lichfield ordered stanley to raise forces to intercept him however when the two armies met at the battle of blore heath in  though only a few miles away stanley kept his  men out of the fight his brother sir william stanley who was certainly in the yorkist army was subsequently attainted yet by  lord stanley had begun to cooperate with the yorkist lords who by this time had possession of the king and ruled in his name and he rapidly consolidated his association with the new regime in the early s he joined his brotherinlaw warwick in the campaigns against the lancastrian forces and stanley was confirmed in his fees and offices as the new king edward iv needed him to secure the northwest in the late s however the coalition that had brought the yorkist edward to the throne was fracturing and stanley found his loyalties divided once again “the dramatic shifts in political fortune between  and  and their impact on the tangled networks of affinity and allegiance are hard to unravel” when warwick fleeing before edward in  made his way to manchester in the hope of support stanley was not forthcoming but on warwicks return he lent him armed support in the restoration of the house of lancaster and of henry vi lord stanley was soon forgiven for his disloyalty after the restoration of edward iv in  he was appointed steward of the kings household and thereafter became a regular member of the royal council yet the death of his first wife eleanor neville at this period severed his connection with warwick and the nevilles and allowed in  a marriage of still greater political significance his new wife lady margaret beaufort dowager countess of richmond was the mother of henry tudor – potential heir of the house of lancaster militarily during this period and now a stalwart of the yorkist regime stanley led several hundred men in the expedition to france in  and in  served with a large company in the campaign of the duke of gloucester later richard iii in scotland playing a key role in the capture of berwick upon tweed after the unexpected death of edward iv in  and the accession of his twelveyearold son edward v stanley was among those who sought to maintain a balance of power between the young kings uncle richard duke of gloucester who was now lord protector and his maternal family the woodvilles stanley’s own son and heir george stanley lord strange was married to joan le strange whose mother was jacquetta woodville the dowager queen’s sister when gloucester attacked this group at a council meeting in june  stanley was wounded and imprisoned but at least spared the fate of lord hastings – that of summary execution that month parliament declared edward v and his younger brother richard duke of york the princes in the tower illegitimate on the grounds that their father edward ivs marriage to elizabeth woodville was bigamous by way of a prior precontract of marriage with eleanor butler the duke of gloucester was therefore declared king richard iii by public acclamation later confirmed by parliament under the act titulus regius apparently “in preparing the ground for the usurpation and in consolidating his position richard found it more expedient to appease than to alienate the house of stanley” thus lord stanley was soon at liberty and continued as steward of the royal household apparently flourishing at the heart of the new regime he bore the great mace at richards coronation while his wife carried the new queen’s train richard stripped stanleys wife margaret beaufort of all her titles and possession for her part in compassyng and doyng treason but transferred all her properties to stanley effectively negating much of the punishment he was also appointed to the order of the garter taking the stall vacated by the executed lord hastings this commitment bore further fruit in the autumn of  when a series of plots against the king coalesced into buckinghams rebellion a rising in southern and western england under the loose leadership of the duke of buckingham when richard rose to suppress the rebellion stanley and his brother william were at the kings side and were richly rewarded from the forfeited estates of the rebels and stanley was appointed to buckingham’s position as lord high constable of england whilst stanley might have had no other option than to act as richard’s loyal subject it is conceivable that he may himself have become involved in the uprising his wife margaret beaufort was a key conspirator having brokered the marriage alliance between edward iv’s daughter elizabeth of york and her son henry tudor indeed it was only by giving a solemn undertaking to richard to keep his wife in custody and to end her intrigues that stanley saved her from attainder and disgrace and presumably his own position at the same time richard was evidently well aware of the threat from this quarter since in the summer of  when stanley sought permission to leave the court and return to his northern fastness of lathom the king insisted that his son george stanley lord strange take his place at court as a token for his father’s good behaviour the battle of bosworthedit main article battle of bosworth field the stanleys had been communicating with the exiled henry tudor for some time and tudors strategy of landing in wales and heading east into central england depended on the acquiescence of sir william stanley as chamberlain of chester and north wales and by extension on that of lord stanley himself on hearing of the invasion richard ordered the two stanleys to raise the men of the region in readiness to oppose the invader however once it was clear that tudor was marching unopposed through wales richard ordered lord stanley to join him without delay according to the croyland chronicle although lord stanley excused himself on the grounds of illness the sweating sickness by now richard had firm evidence of the stanleys’ complicity after an unsuccessful bid to escape from court lord strange had confessed that he and his uncle sir william stanley had conspired with henry tudor richard proclaimed him as traitor and let it be known that strange’s life was hostage for his fathers loyalty in the coming conflict indeed richard allegedly issued orders for strange’s execution on the battlefield although in the event these were never carried out lord stanley’s response to richard’s threat was reportedly laconic “sire i have other sons” three armies followed each other into the midlands lord stanley and his forces then sir william stanley and finally henry tudor and a host comprising tudor retainers dispossessed lancastrian exiles and many men of wales and cheshire lord stanley may have secretly met with henry on the eve of the battle but when the stanleyites arrived south of the village of market bosworth on  august they took up a position independent of both the royal forces and the rebel army in effect the two brothers played similar roles to those they had played at the battle of blore heath over a quarter of a century earlier lord stanley took no direct part in the action but stood unmoving between the two armies and it was sir williams decisive intervention that gave henry the victory after the despatch of richard who had gone into battle crowned polydore vergil records that the fallen coronet was retrieved and placed by lord stanley on his stepson’s head before his cheering troops thereby emphasising the critical role the stanleys had played in bringing henry tudor to the throne further prizesedit henry demonstrated his gratitude to his “right dearly beloved father” by creating him earl of derby on  october  and the following year confirmed him in office as lord high constable of england and high steward of the duchy of lancaster besides granting him other estates and offices in  stanley also stood as godfather to henry’s eldest son arthur prince of wales even so at the time of the lambert simnel rising of  there may have been some concern that the stanleys were again hedging their bets and “there was relief in the royal host when the stanleyites came in at nottingham” the aftermath of the battle of stoke which crushed this rising brought still further rewards for stanley – notably the lands forfeited by viscount lovell sir thomas pilkington and sir thomas broughton in lancashire and elsewhere in  the stanleys again made a notable contribution to the army raised by henry to suppress a rising in yorkshire less successfully stanley’s brother william unwisely supported the later pretender perkin warbeck and was at last executed for treason in  dominance of northwest englandedit throughout his career alongside the main performance of national events the preservation and enhancement of stanley’s own role as regional magnate was a very important sideshow change of regime never really weakened his grip on the key offices of chester and lancaster and throughout his life stanley consolidated the legacy he had inherited from his father and extended his hegemony and that of his family across the northwest given the range of his officeholding both regionally and at court he did not need to draw ruinously on his own resources to dispense patronage on a grand scale and he was active in the arbitration of local disputes even state matters were regularly referred for his personal adjudication that said ‘good lordship’ also had its harder face and the stanleys brooked no opposition and tolerated few rivals in their areas of dominance involvement with the princes in the toweredit main article princes in the tower stanley was made constable of england by richard iii towards the end of  the year in which edward v and richard duke of york the princes in the tower disappeared from their confinement in the tower of london as constable originally a position which constituted command of the royal armies stanley was formally responsible for anyone who entered or left the tower – then the most secure of royal palaces in this capacity and as a loyal member of the ricardian regime at the time it can be argued that he was at least an accessory to the princes’ deaths since once they had entered the security of the tower they were never seen or heard of again that said since the duke of buckingham preceded stanley as constable of the tower stanley could realistically only have had such an opportunity after buckingham’s rebellion and execution in october and november  on becoming constable this would have given richard and buckingham – considered a far more likely contender for killer of the princes – ample opportunity to dispose of the princes between their confinement in may  and the rebellion in october also since buckingham’s uprising was expressly staged in favour of henry tudor’s claim to the throne – rather than that of the missing edward v – it seems reasonable to assume that buckingham knew the princes were already dead prior to his rebellion and hence stanley succeeding as constable however it has also been suggested that in view of his being the stepfather of henry tudor and deserting richard at bosworth it is not inconceivable that stanley was at least in part responsible for the princes death after henrys accession the princes still living would have presented just as much of a problem to henrys occupation of the throne as they did to richards more so in fact as henry in repealing titulus regius the act of parliament that declared the boys illegitimate and therefore not heirs to the throne made the elder of the two the lawful king deathedit

political success amid the most challenging of circumstances he had not only escaped the bloody fate of so many of his political contemporaries including his brother but on top of the great patrimony he inherited from his father he acquired huge estates and national offices the garter and an earldom these and his closeness to successive royal families – whom he could count amongst his kith and kin by several different connections – made him a figure of great power and influence under his adroit leadership the northwest escaped the worst horrors of decades of civil war that devastated other parts of england and his family “helped bring a degree of cultivation and refinement to the northwest” their patronage underpinned the careers of a number of young lancashire men including william smyth hugh oldham and christopher urswick who went on to become pillars of the tudor church and state the senior line of the descendants of thomas stanley and eleanor neville continued to hold the

northampton                elizabeth de bohun                        elizabeth badlesmere             legacyedit at his death lord stanley could look back on a career of fortyfive years of remarkable political success amid the most challenging of circumstances he had not only escaped the bloody fate of so many of his political contemporaries including his brother but on top of the great patrimony he inherited from his father he acquired huge estates and national offices the garter and an earldom these and his closeness to successive royal families – whom he could count amongst his kith and kin by several different connections – made him a figure of great power and influence under his adroit leadership the northwest escaped the worst horrors of decades of civil war that devastated other parts of england and his family “helped bring a degree of cultivation and refinement to the northwest” their patronage underpinned the careers of a number of young lancashire men including william smyth hugh oldham and christopher urswick who went on to become pillars of the tudor church and state the senior line of the descendants of thomas stanley and eleanor neville continued to hold the earldom of derby until the death of james stanley th earl of derby in  the title then passed to a junior branch of the family the baronets stanley of bickerstaffe descended from sir james stanley younger brother of thomas stanley nd earl of derby this branch still holds the title today edward stanley born  became th earl of derby in  john stanley a younger brother of thomas stanley st earl of derby was the ancestor of the barons stanley of alderley references in shakespeareedit in the ‘history plays’ of william shakespeare lord stanley features in a pivotal role throughout the play richard iii as an initially loyal but troubled royal servant whose misgivings as to richard’s ‘true’ nature lead him towards collaboration with his stepson henry tudor and active assistance in placing him on the throne richard iii is believed to have been written over – at this time it is thought shakespeare may already have been writing for lord stranges men the company of ferdinando stanley lord strange later th earl of derby certainly his actors were members of the company and shakespeare himself is formally listed as a member by  as such the stanleys would effectively have been patrons of this work this was a relationship that may have been continued as a midsummer nights dream is thought to have been possibly first performed at the wedding celebrations of william stanley th earl of derby in
