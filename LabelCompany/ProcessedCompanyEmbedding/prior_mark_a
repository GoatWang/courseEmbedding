final registration certificate from the uspto however assuming you eventually secure the registration for your trademark your protection starts as of the date of filing not the date of issue thus you

filed at either the state or federal level state trademarks protect your mark in a specific state while federal trademarks normally protect your mark in all the states state trademarks generally provide far less legal protection than federal trademarks businesses operating in only one state should trademark in that state however businesses operating in interstate commerce may file for a federal trademark obviously a business intent on expanding nationally or internationally should conduct a trademark search and file a federal trademark as soon as possible  what is interstate commerce to secure a federal trademark you must be conducting business in interstate commerce this means you must be i conducting business across state lines which means doing business in two or more states or ii conducting business internationally which means between at least one us state and one foreign country additionally simply having a web site is not generally considered conducting business more appropriately conducting business should be interpreted to mean making an actual sale of your good or service businesses such as local businesses who are not conducting business in interstate commerce should file for a state trademark because they are not yet eligible for a federal trademark the one exception to this if you intend to conduct business in interstate commerce in the near future in such instance it may be appropriate to file an intent to use federal trademark application  federal intent to use applications are effectively name reservations pending future use  do i have to be currently using a trademark in order to file no if you are using the trademark in interstate commerce you can file an actual use application and provide the date of first use such use must be actual and not merely the advertisement or promotion of the mark prior to the availability of the product or service for which the mark is being used if you have a bona fide intent to use the mark in interstate commerce but have not yet begun to use the mark then you can file and intent to use application while the costs associated with these filing these two types of trademark applications are identical the intent to use applicant must later file a statement of use together with an additional filing fee of  per class this statement of use will notify the uspto and the world of your actual date of first use when and if you use the mark in interstate commerce  what is a common law trademark mere use of a trademark in interstate commerce is enough to create a common law trademark if the trademark is distinctive and has created a secondary meaning common law trademarks should used with either the tm or sm symbol to notify the world of the owners intent to protect his or her trademark rights in a particular mark please note that while the common law does afford the trademark owner some minimum level of trademark protection it should not be considered a valid alternative to the federally registered trademark which offers the greatest protection  should i file a federal trademark if i have common law rights yes a federal trademark establishes a presumption of ownership in a court of law owners of common law trademarks have to prove they use and own the trademark  sometimes on a countybycounty basis this can be expensive and time consuming to prove in court financially the only one who benefits would be the lawyers  who may file an application to register a trademark any person corporation or partnership may apply you shorten the procedure by using trademarkcom to guide you through the process the many kinds of marks you can use what is available at a state and federal level and what may be best for your particular business  what is the benefit of a trademark search it is important to know the full extent of the use of your mark prior to filing our comprehensive search includes a search of the federal database the state databases the common law database as well as the internet domain name database click here for specific information regarding trademark searches note if your trademark has already been federally registered then you will not be able to register your trademark federally for the same or similar goods and services if your mark is already being used in interstate commerce ie a common law mark you must determine the full extent of the use  especially if you want unrestricted national trademark protection your rights only extend to afterusers if someone used it before you then your rights are limited to the extent they have already used it  what if some other company is  already using my trademark if both companies offer the same or similar goods and services and the other company has already registered the trademark federally then you are likely out of luck it may be best to find another name to trademark if they have not trademarked but they used the name first and they use the name nationally and pervasively then you are probably still out of luck depending on the scope of their use however if they only use the trademark on a local basis then you may be able to register the trademark federally and use it in those areas where they do not and have not used it before example lets assume they have a trademark in california and have only ever done business in california you can still register the trademark at the federal level and use it nationally however you cannot use it in the state of california  if my trademark search shows a valid registered trademark but the owner of the trademark is no longer using the mark can i still file not if the owner has assigned or sold the trademark to another party or if the trademark is only not being used on a temporary basis however if the company is no longer using the trademark and has not been using the trademark for a substantial period of time generally  years then you may be able to successfully challenge their mark in court because of this they may be interested in selling the trademark to you inexpensively but be warned the minute you contact them they may immediately start using the mark  can i register a trademark in the us if i live outside the

the right to prevent others from selling tshirts using a trademark which is the same or similar to your trademark also others may use your trademark to sell unrelated goods  like car tires or bottled water you would only be protected for tshirts additionally federal trademark protection only extends to companies selling goods or services in the us or between a foreign country and the us your competitors may still have the right to sell the same or similar goods or services between  or more foreign countries for this reason many companies register their trademarks internationally as well

applications afford manufacturers and merchants novel ways to launch new trademarks companies are no longer limited to affixing a mark directly on a product or its packaging to support a finding of trademark use in commerce moreover the use of trademarks on the internet in association with the sale of products and the provision of services has extended traditional concepts of trademark use beyond geographic boundaries in jurisdictions that maintain strong trademark use requirements such as the united states and canada it is therefore important for foreign applicants to ensure that the manner in which their marks are used will support a finding of use in commerce with their goods andor services united states trademark rights in the united states stem from use rather than registration indeed since a federal trademark registration does not generally issue without showing real use of the mark in the ordinary course of trade questions concerning how a trademark applicant can establish use are important  usc §  the us patent and trademark office and us courts have interpreted this requirement flexibly so as to encompass various genuine but less traditional trademark uses test markets and sample sales it is becoming more and more common for a manufacturer or merchant to promote the sale of its product or service well before even a “beta” version is available to the public in the united states a trademark applicant may not file a trademark application claiming actual use of the mark if the use was merely presale advertising or promotion of the goods or services era corp v electronic realty associates inc  uspq   ttab  cited in cake divas v charmaine jones opposition no  ttab feb   not precedential the rules change however where two parties dispute which has priority in the united states “use analogous to trademark use” including advertising campaigns to announce the launch of a new product or taking orders for a product that will soon be on the market can sometimes be “tacked” onto actual use for the purposes of establishing priority the key is that the trademark owner must show this kind of prior use created an association in the minds of the purchasing public between the mark and the goods tab systems v pactel teletrac  fd  fed cir  the issue is more complex with the promotion of a service mark in aycock engineering inc v airflite inc  uspqd  fed cir  the us court of appeals for the federal circuit held that the use in commerce requirement is not met when an applicant uses a service mark in the preparatory stages of a service’s development but never offers the service to the public the court observed that the trademark act “makes plain that advertisement and actual use of the mark in commerce are required mere preparations to use a mark in commerce are insufficient to constitute use in commerce rather the mark must be actually used in conjunction with the services described in the application for the mark” the court thus held that the application was void ab initio pharmaceutical trademarks however present the classic example of special circumstances given the market realities within the pharmaceutical industry a pharmaceutical product cannot be sold commercially without approval by the us food and drug administration however before the drug is put on the market it will undergo clinical trials and testing that are very much a part of ordinary business indeed the house judiciary committee noted that … “the ordinary course of trade” varies from industry to industry thus…a pharmaceutical company that markets a drug to treat a rare disease will makea few sales in the ordinary course of its trade the company’s shipment to clinical investigators during the federal approval process will also be in its ordinary course of trade… hr rep no  th cong d sess   thus us courts have indicated that shipping a drug to a clinical investigator for use in clinical trials during the food and drug administration approval process can constitute use sufficient to file a trademark application with the uspto see gd searle  co v nutrapharm inc no  sdny oct   this understanding has been consistently upheld by us courts in automedx inc v artivent corp  uspqd  ttab  the trademark trial and appeal board held that the sale of medical ventilators for testing and before the food and drug administration’s approval of the ventilators for human use was a bona fide sale for a legitimate commercial purpose unlawful use although the board in automedx held that use of a mark in association with the sale of a medical device before the fda approved it for commercial sale was trademark “use” trademark applicants should tread lightly in grounding trademark rights on sales of products and services that have not yet crossed all legal hurdles as a general rule use of a mark must be legal use to establish trademark rights this principle would clearly apply for instance if the goods or services were themselves illegal—such as an application to register a mark for use on illicit drugs in such cases us courts will generally apply the unlawful use doctrine preventing a trademark owner from securing trademark rights from unlawful sales of goods or services a recent case involving the unlawful use doctrine is zao gruppa predpriyatij ost v vosk international co opposition no  ttab aug   the defendant in that case alleged that the opposer’s use of its trademark on soft drinks was unlawful because its labels violated fda regulations the board however maintained a narrow application of the doctrine trademark use would be considered unlawful under a regulatory act only if the issue of compliance was previously determined by a court or government agency having competent jurisdiction under the statute involved zao gruppa has recently been appealed to the united states district court for the western district of washington trademark “use” and the internet use of trademarks on the internet can raise questions concerning whether “use” has actually occurred at all and if so the territorial reach of the trademark rights while mere advertising or promotion of a trademark on a web page is not “use in commerce” a website page that displays the trademark the product and a means to buy the product is considered to be “use in commerce” see in re sones  fd   uspqd  fed cir  there must be a means of ordering the goods directly from the web page such as a telephone number for placing orders or a pulldown menu for online ordering in re quantum foods inc  uspqd   ttab  the question of a trademark’s territorial reach based on internet use was recently considered in the case of dudley v healthsource chiropractic inc no cv wdny aug   in this case a federal court declined to grant a broad territorial reach based on commonlaw trademark use over the internet while the court was satisfied that the plaintiff was the senior user of the commonlaw trademark healthsource chiropractic for chiropractic services the plaintiff’s rights were limited to his use in the greater rochester new york area the judge reasoned “the rights of concurrent users would be substantially harmed if one user were able to monopolize the internet to the exclusion of other lawful users of the same mark if as the plaintiff suggests a senior common law user could claim exclusive use on the internet then it would undermine the benefits and security provided by federal registration” canada in canada the concept of trademark “use” and therefore what constitutes “use” is an important consideration when filing applications when opposing another trader’s application and when seeking to maintain registrations once issued however the issue of what constitutes actual trademark “use” in canada is not always clear and there are some “gray” areas that can lead to difficult judgment calls test markets and sample sales generally test shipments or sample sales do not constitute trademark “use” in canada in the “ordinary course of trade” and would not likely support a usebased application or an opposition claiming prior use or provide a defense to a nonuse attack however canadian courts have in some instances acknowledged that sample shipments or testmarketing sales of products could constitute trademark use in the normal course of trade if it appears that test marketing is part of the normal business practice of the trademark owner and is done in advance of or to further sales in the normal course of trade bfe inc v broadcast designs ltd   cpr d  tmob thomas j lipton inc v dial corp   cpr d  tmob fetherstonhaugh  co v conagra inc   cpr th  fctd the jurisprudence in this area is fairly fact and industryspecific and accordingly trademark owners should exercise caution when relying on premarket activities to support trademark use in canada in the ordinary course of trade for example it is not clear whether use of a mark in clinical trials in the pharmaceutical industry would constitute trademark use in the ordinary course of trade while there are strong arguments in favor of this interpretation relying on such use to support an application or registration is not without risk unlawful use it is generally accepted that trademark use in canada whether to support a usebased application to maintain a registration or as a ground of opposition must be a lawful use mccabe v yamamoto  co america inc   cpr d  fctd the opposition board has held in several instances that an application for registration of a trademark in canada can be successfully opposed where the opponent has established a prima facie case that the applicant’s use of the mark was in violation of a federal statute e remy martin  co sa v magnet trading corp hk ltd   cpr d  tmob cooperative union of canada v teledirect publications inc   cpr d  tmob absent such prima facie evidence however an applicant is presumed to act legally hence in cadbury confectionery canada inc v valliantsaunders   cpr th  tmob use of the trademark cannabis crunch was not prohibited in association with chocolate bars containing cannabis seeds as it was established that certain types of cannabis seeds were legal and it was reasonable to assume that the applicant would comply with the law trademark use and the internet use of trademarks on the internet in crossborder and international commerce has had a significant impact on the concept of trademark use in canada in the ordinary course of trade canadian courts increasingly have moved away from traditional notions of territoriality and trademark rights and have found various ancillary activities many conducted via the internet to support a finding of trademark use in canada doctor’s associates inc v american multicinema inc   cpr th  tmob canadian courts have held that if a company responds to canadian inquiries via its website andor displays the mark in its catalogues from which canadian customers can order products andor are shipped products from the united states such activity would constitute trademark “use” with “retail services” in canada even without a “bricks and mortar” retail store in canada provided that there is at least some level of “interactivity” with potential customers in canada lapointe rosenstein llp v the west seal inc  tmob  tmho unreported saks  co v canada registrar of trade marks   cpr d  fctd mccarthy tetrault v autozone parts inc   cpr th  tmob similarly “railway passenger services” was understood to include “train reservation and ticketing services” without the actual operation of a train in canada venice simplonorientexpress inc v société nationale des chemins de fer français sncf   cpr th  fctd aff’g   cpr d  tmho and use of a trademark for “reservation services” in canada was held to support use of the mark for “automobile rental and leasing services” in canada even though the actual automobile rentals were not provided in canada advantage car  truck rentals v advantage rentacar inc   cpr th  tmob in the hotel industry however use of a mark in association with various ancillary services such as reservation services will not necessarily support trademark use with actual hotel accommodation services in a  decision of the opposition board the concept of “hotel services” was interpreted broadly and the board found that there was trademark “use” with “hotel services” based on the provision of reservation services even without the presence of a hotel facility in canada borden ladner gervais llp v westcoast hotels inc   cpr th  tmho however in a november  decision of the opposition board the hearing officer distinguished the facts of the westcoast decision and held that use of a mark merely with hotel reservation services did not constitute trademark “use” with hotel accommodation services the decision may yet be appealed which would clarify the issue in the hotel industry georgio stamatis maillis oa bellagio limousines against registration nos tma and tma for the trademark bellagio in the name of mirage resorts incorporated  tmob  summary with new ways of going to market and the increasing importance of the internet in manufacturers’ marketing plans traditional concepts of trademark “use” in commerce are being tested by courts in both canada and the united states often with surprisingly novel and flexible outcomes where there is a sufficient nexus between the trademark and the local consumer use of the mark in other countries and via the internet may support a claim to trademark use in canada or the united states without an actual physical presence there however this very flexibility is leading to uncertainty in many industries as to what exactly constitutes “use” of a mark in commerce it is increasingly important for foreign applicants to carefully evaluate the manner in which their marks are used to ensure that such use will support a finding of actual trademark use   although every effort has been made to verify
