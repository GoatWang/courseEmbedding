and the two other blackstone limited partnerships will each sell all of their interest in prime to loewen if either they or loewen elect such a sale  pursuant to an agreement with golder dated june   defendant blackstone the two other blackstone limited partnerships and loewen would have forfeited their right to acquire prime if they had not met certain deadlines for consummating the acquisition  prior to the consummation of the acquisition on august   loewen did not file notification and report forms for its acquisition of voting securities of prime with the federal antitrust agencies loewen eventually filed notification and report forms on or about october  more than a month after the acquisition was consummated on march   loewen agreed to pay civil penalties to settle federal charges that its failure to file a notification and report form prior to the acquisition had violated the hsr act united states v the loewen group inc civ action no   trade cas cch �  ddc march   violation by defendant blackstone  the allegations contained in paragraphs  through  are repeated and realleged as though fully set forth herein  defendant blackstone was required by the hsr act to submit a notification and report form and observe the acts waiting period before it acquired in excess of  million of the securities of prime on june   blackstone management associates ii llc filed on behalf of defendant blackstone a notification and report form june  premerger filing for the acquisition by defendant blackstone of voting securities of prime  defendant blackstone submitted no documents responsive to item c with the june  premerger filing  at the time of the june  premerger filing defendant blackstone had in its possession an internal decisionmaking document responsive to item c entitled project blackrose investment committee memorandum investment committee memorandum which had been prepared for a may   meeting of defendant blackstones investment committee investment committee the investment committee had the ultimate authority to approve or disapprove defendant blackstones acquisition of an interest in prime  a memorandum to the investment committee is routinely prepared prior to major investments by defendant blackstone  information in the investment committee memorandum formed the basis of the investment committees decision to proceed with the acquisition of an interest in prime therefore at the time of the june  premerger filing the investment committee memorandum was one of the most central documents in defendant blackstones possession relating to its acquisition of an interest in prime  each of the four officials responsible for defendant blackstones acquisition of an interest in prime had participated in writing the investment committee memorandum and had a copy of the investment committee memorandum in his files at the time of the june  premerger filing  the investment committee memorandum identified loewen as an operator of cemeteries and funeral homes and contained substantial information concerning those operations in addition the investment committee memorandum described the collateral agreement described in paragraph  above pursuant to which loewen was likely to obtain complete ownership and control of prime which also operated cemeteries and funeral homes  the investment committee memorandum had the characteristics of a document required to be submitted in response to item c of the notification and report form those characteristics are enumerated in the instructions to the notification and report form as described in paragraph  above specifically the investment committee memorandum was prepared by or for individuals exercising functions similar to those of officers and directors of corporations in addition the document described inter alia a market shares for both loewen and prime in funeral homes and cemeteries b the nature of competition in the death care industry c barriers to entry into that industry and d the trend toward concentration in the industry blackstone was required to submit the investment committee memorandum in response to item c of the notification and report form before consummating its acquisition of voting securities of prime  as a result of defendant blackstones failure to submit the investment committee memorandum with the june  premerger filing as required by item c of the notification and report form defendant blackstone did not comply with the reporting and waiting requirements of the hsr act and rules  defendant blackstones failure to submit the investment committee memorandum with the june  premerger filing hindered the ability of the federal antitrust agencies to analyze the competitive effects of the acquisition prior to its consummation the notification and report forms submitted by defendant blackstone and golder prior to the acquisition did not reveal that loewen like prime was an operator of cemeteries and funeral homes as described in paragraph  loewen itself failed to submit a notification and report form prior to the acquisition on the basis of the notification and report forms submitted prior to the acquisition neither the federal trade commission nor the department of justice ascertained that loewens acquisition of an interest in prime was an acquisition between competitors and therefore that the acquisition raised potential antitrust concerns  as a consequence of the failure of defendant blackstone to submit the investment committee memorandum with the june  premerger filing neither the federal trade commission nor the department of justice investigated the acquisition before it was consummated neither the federal trade commission nor the department of justice issued pursuant to the hsr act requests for additional information and documentary material second requests prior to the acquisition on july   the federal antitrust agencies granted defendant blackstone early termination of the day waiting period for its acquisition of voting securities of prime  the parties to the acquisition knew that the federal antitrust agencies were likely to investigate the acquisition if they learned that loewens acquisition of an interest in prime was an acquisition of one operator of cemeteries and funeral homes by another operator of cemeteries and funeral homes  by consummating the acquisition before the federal antitrust agencies investigated it defendant blackstone and loewen avoided the risk that the acquisition would be delayed by a premerger antitrust investigation any such delay could have jeopardized the acquisition  in october  when loewen submitted a notification and report form in connection with another transaction the premerger office of the federal trade commission discovered that loewen should have submitted a notification and report form prior to its acquisition of an interest in prime thereafter loewen belatedly submitted that notification and report form  included with loewens notification and report form was a copy of a document that was also addressed to defendant blackstone the document appeared to be one that defendant blackstone had been required to submit with its june  premerger filing in response to item c of the notification and report form sometime between october   and october   the premerger office of the federal trade commission asked defendant blackstone for an explanation of why this document had not been submitted with the june  premerger filing  on november   defendant blackstone filed a supplementary notification and report form recertifying the june  premerger filing filed with this supplementary notification and report form were eight documents responsive to item c including the investment committee memorandum  on november   the federal trade commission issued second requests to defendant blackstone loewen and golder with respect to the acquisition  the hsr act waiting period for defendant blackstones acquisition of voting securities of prime expired on may   twenty days after compliance with the second requests  usc � ae  defendant blackstone was in continuous violation of the hsr act from august   when it acquired in excess of  million of the voting securities of prime until may   when the waiting period expired violation by defendant lipson  the allegations contained in paragraphs  through  are repeated and realleged as though fully set forth herein  defendant lipson was the blackstone executive responsible for negotiating defendant blackstones acquisition of an interest in prime the three other blackstone executives who worked on the acquisition reported to defendant lipson  defendant lipson knew that the federal antitrust agencies were likely to investigate the acquisition if they learned that loewens acquisition of an interest in prime was an acquisition of one operator of cemeteries and funeral homes by another operator of cemeteries and funeral homes he also knew that any significant delay of the acquisition might have jeopardized its consummation  defendant lipson was fully aware of the existence and the importance of the investment committee memorandum he was one of the authors of that memorandum he was a member of the investment committee to which the memorandum was addressed he attended the meeting of the investment committee at which the memorandum was discussed he knew that the memorandum contained the detailed information described in paragraph  concerning competition in markets for cemeteries and funeral homes he had a copy of the memorandum in his own files  defendant lipson provided to the staff of the federal trade commission inconsistent and contradictory explanations for the failure to submit the investment committee memorandum with the june  premerger filing  defendant lipson signed the certification of the june  premerger filing as described in paragraph  above he attested in the certification to the fact that the june  premerger filing was to the best of his knowledge true correct and complete  defendant lipson knew or should have known that his certification of the june  premerger filing was inaccurate because the premerger filing itself was not true correct and complete  defendant lipson was in continuous violation of the hsr act from august   until may   when the waiting period expired prayer wherefore plaintiff prays  that the court adjudge and decree that the august   acquisition by defendant blackstone of voting securities of prime was in violation of the hsr act  usc � a and that defendant blackstone was in violation of the hsr act each day from august   through may    that the court adjudge and decree that the signing by defendant lipson of the certification of the june  premerger filing was in violation of the hsr act  usc � a and that defendant lipson is liable for a civil penalty for each day that defendant blackstone was in violation of the hsr act  that the court
