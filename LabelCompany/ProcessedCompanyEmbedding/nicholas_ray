never heard of the wrinkle secret has been reserved for high paying celebrity clientsuntil now consumers have reported throwing away thousands of dollars on expensive anti aging products or dangerous surgical procedures that make big promises that often do far more harm than good as a result a few weeks ago this simple solution was shared this anti aging miracle was reportedly found when multiple celebrity friends were hoping for a solution to look younger to prolong their career without going in for surgery “she looked  years younger in literally  weeks” they were reported to have been thrilled when after months and months of pain staking tests and research the team came across  products that when combined supposedly took  to  years off women’s appearance in just a month more shockingly it is safe and costs next to nothing to try the two products are oveena anti aging cream and lumaglow instant lifting cream “possbily the best anti aging discovery of the decade” so what is it  key ingredients for anti aging  vitamin c  hyaluronic acid these are both natural ingredients that work together to erase wrinkles and fine lines at the cellular level – below the surface of the skin – which is why they’re so effective vitamin c the st youth discovery the first piece of the anti aging puzzle discovered was vitamin c vitamin c is a secret anti aging trick” vitamin c penetrates deep into damaged skin and stimulates new collagen – a protein which makes skin appear plump and firm its all the rage in beauty circles much in part because of a  study stating applying

vitamin c in the right consistency and dosage hyaluronic acid the second piece when combined properly with vitamin c can make your face look two decades younger in weeks hyaluronic acid works by binding to moisture it can hold up to  times its weight in water making it an excellent natural skin plumper hyaluronic acid helps your skin repair and regenerate itself after suffering from dryness

acid do is get rid of all the old dead layers of skin and help your skin generate fresh new ones our research shows that you can erase almost  to  years off your face in less than  days but the key is to choose the creams and serums that contain the highest and purest quality ingredients since they’re not all the same the only two we found during our research was oveena anti aging cream and

anti aging cream and lumaglow instant lifting cream these two products both contain high concentrations of pure vitamin c and hyaluronic acid in just the right concentrations his team is also reported to have discovered that they contain all sorts of antioxidants an ingredient called dermaxyl also known as facelift in a jar and esterc the active antiaging compound in vitamin c “getting older is rough for an actress i feel like a new woman” put to the test as excited as we were we wanted to find an example of real usage of these type of products we found one test where a volunteer from the

door  and in a lonely place —both starring humphrey bogart—put him on the map even as his shaky personal life threatened to destroy him yet even rays penchant for alcohol coupled with a growing number of exwives couldnt dampen the success of s rebel without a cause his only oscarnominated film but rebel was the beginning of the end and while ray had later limited success bizarre onset behavior made him a virtual hollywood pariah until his death in  mcgilligan meticulous in the details too often plods through the material without imbuing it with any of the directors signature flair july milwaukee

a clear and balanced portrait of a most complex man born raymond nicholas kienzle in wisconsin ray soon drifted toward community theater then radio then the leftist experimental theater that flourished in his youth one of his teachers in chicago was thornton wilder and ray who soon moved to hollywood seemed to have met and befriended and often betrayed just about every showbiz notable in the third quarter of the th century including elia kazan john houseman gloria grahame howard hughes james dean joan crawford natalie wood john wayne richard burton gore vidal charlton heston and myriad others he was temporarily an acolyte of frank lloyd wright and worked with alan lomax pete seeger and others in the folkmusic scene although he never had total control of a film he still

glorious failure of an american director by patrick mcgilligan it books copyright   patrick mcgilligan all right reserved isbn  chapter one nicholas ray was a kind of human jigsaw puzzle the pieces of his mystery scattered and lost over time many of his films were haunted by bruised young people threatened damaged or twisted by events beyond their control their suffering often begins in youth its source a secret buried there mementos of childhood crop up in rays films like missing pieces of the puzzle sports trophies line the top of a dresser in the room of an embittered detective in on dangerous ground a brokendown rodeo champion finds a rodeo handbill cap pistol and tobaccocan bank squirreled away in a crawl space under his old homestead in the lusty men i was looking for something i thought i lost he tells an oldtimer carrying a shotgun who interrupts his search sprawled drunkenly on the ground james dean pulls a scrappaper blankie over a cymbalbanging monkey toy during the opening credits of rebel without a cause can i keep it he pleads when arrested even so the source of hurt is private and vague and remotenot as in the case of another wisconsin filmmaker as knowable as a certain rosebud sled in his films ray tended to load the blame on mother and father figures the parents in rebel without a cause are fundamentally clueless the drug addicted father in bigger than life tries to use a scissors to sacrifice his young son to god fathers are faulted the most in rays films while mothers linger in the shadows blurry and complicit his unorthodox heroes the drugaddicted father is one are destined to fail the obstacles they face are nothing compared to their own neuroses they are burdened above all by their integrity rays intense searching visual style mirrored his personal struggles his best filmsa list that would arguably include they live by night in a lonely place on dangerous ground the lusty men johnny guitar rebel without a cause bigger than life bitter victory and party girlcant easily be categorized they owe something to hollywood where he never quite fit in and everything else to his iconoclastic sensibility first to the influential french critics of cahiers du cinéma and positif in the s and to every succeeding generation of film fans since ray has become a symbol of artistic purity and tragic flaws a test case of auteurist worship in his life as in his films everything began at homehope and trouble strength and fissures  home sweet home for nicholas ray was an all american city that was rugged and beautiful as ideal on the surface as an airbrushed portrait of the director at the peak of his fame christened as a furtrading post in  la crosse was settled on the eastern banks of the mississippi river at the confluence of the black and la crosse rivers along what would become the border of wisconsin which became a state in  and minnesota which followed in  from a handful of houses the town swiftly multiplied into a booming gateway to the west for merchants and adventurers germans and norwegians swarmed in on packed trains and cattle cars from milwaukee by  la crosse had grown into the fourthlargest community in wisconsin here is a town declared the former steamboat pilot samuel clemens aka mark twain in his  talltale memoir and travelogue life on the mississippi with electric lighted streets and blocks of buildings which are stately enough and also architecturally fine enough to command respect in any city it is a choice town and a choice setting with its lush greenery and majestic bluffs spared by the ice age surrounding fertile farmlands crystalline rivers and lakes dense forests and plentiful hunting and fishing the area was hailed locally as gods country by the early s members of a german clan named kienzle had reached gods country nicholas rays germanborn grandparents stopped briefly in the teutonic stronghold of milwaukee before heading to la crosse where they would eventually raise a brood of three sons and five daughters their oldest son raymond nicholas kienzle was born in milwaukee in  he would wed twice the first time at a tender age in milwaukee before meeting nicholas rays mother kienzles second marriage in la crosse in  didnt last much longer than the first though it produced two daughters who continued to live near their father after their parents divorced an enigmatic forbidding figure raymond n kienzle was as ray himself recalled him in his earliest photographs he wears an ironic smile but later in life a walrus mustache and the el producto cigar invariably lodged in his mouth gave him the gravitas of a successful tradesman the kienzles were building contractors specializing in masonry brick and stonework for public edifices and luxurious homes for rich clientele and in the s raymond the oldest son took over the family business late in that decade kienzle got a big job renovating gale college a presbyterian institution recently absorbed by the lutheran ministry in the town of galesville about twentyfive miles north of la crosse while there he met a quiet and kindhearted woman eleven years his junior slender and bespectacled olene toppen known as lena had been raised on a nearby farm one of nine children born to parents who were natives of norway the couple married in  and soon moved onto four acres near galesville their land included a brickyard factory where kienzle employed a handful of workers kienzle took local commissions including a cement archway entrance to galesvilles high cliff park but also jobs that took him away for weeks elsewhere in the midwest and as far as the deep south all four of the couples children were born in the small town of galesville three girlsalice b  ruth b  helen b and at last a son raymond nicholas kienzle jr came bawling into the world on time he would drop the name kienzle reverse the order of his first and middle names and adopt nicholas ray as his identity after he turned fifty raymond sr decided to cut back on his factory work and travel he put the trappings of his businessthe brick machines molders and sanders kiln sheds and tools and the galesville land itself up for sale and in stages moved his family back to la crosse purchasing a series of houses coowned or shared by kienzle relatives by  the kienzles had landed in a house at  west avenue north near the corner of vine facing west toward downtown and just about a mile away the river the indians called the father of waters  especially after rebel without a cause the mythology surrounding nicholas ray tended to highlight stories of a misspent youth complete with drinking truancy car thievery brushes with the police and flirtations with his fathers mistresses in many ways however his boyhood offers a scrapbook of an american idyll galesville wasnt far from la crosse and in the early years the kienzles made regular trips to the bigger city for shopping holidays and visits to relatives it was the citys firstrate public schools that eventually lured the family to return there permanently although the countryside was still dotted with a few tepees and scattered steamboats continued to roam the mississippi by  mark twains choice town had transformed itself from prairie way station to glittering metropolis la crosses streets were lit with electricity and paved with stone whizzing with automobiles and streetcars most neighborhoods had sidewalks and garbage collection and thousands of households had telephones la crosse had cause for civic pride though the lives of its citizens were subject to the whims of extreme weather the wind whipped across the mississippiperhaps not quite like emery cloth tearing across their faces as rené hardy wrote of the searing ghibli in bitter victory but turbulently in the summers and frigidly in the winters those winters which brought snow and ice before thanksgiving most years were the real endurance test yet la crossians embraced the season with skiing and skating and an annual winter carnival that featured dozens of floats and furwrapped marching bands and employee clubs representing local businesses ray must have remembered the strong wind for it often blew dramatically through key scenes of his filmssending up a murderous sandstorm in bitter victory howling outside as mercedes mccambridge makes her grand entrance in johnny guitar blowing back the hair of the mourning teenage rebels standing cliffside in rebel without a cause the kienzles lived on a street with several other kienzle aunts and uncles in a twostory house that was large but not architecturally fine a big yellow barn remembered ferdinand sontag a neighbor and classmate of rays the living room featured a parquet floor and an italian marble fireplace antlered heads decorated the walls and the familys shelves were crammed with books there was a separate piano room lena kienzle played violin and all her children learned to play at least one instrument for supper the dining room was set with linen and lace for parties and holidays the house filled with relatives friends and flowers by  rays father was semiretired but he still took small jobs as a bricklayer cement man and plasterer he was active in the chamber of commerce while his wife earned plaques volunteering with the red cross and community chest though raised as a catholic raymond sr had been excommunicated after his first divorce for a time he joined the congregational church but eventually drifted away from organized religion his wife brought up as a strict lutheran trended toward methodism and faithfully took her children to ser vices and sunday school ray jr had been steeped in the bible long before the temerity of his film king of kings ray jr was a boy scout a good boy who delivered patriotic speeches in grade school on election day in  as president calvin coolidge faced off against democratic candidate john w davis and wisconsin progressive robert m la follette sr the thirteenyearold eighthgrader urged his lincoln junior high school classmates to remind their parents to vote all three of rays sisters doted on their young brother the only boy in the family his siblings were all pretty with wavy hair like their mothers goodhumored but seriousminded anxious to leave home and la crosse they also nursed ambitions beyond marriage the eldest alice had already graduated from nursing school by the time of her young brothers election day speech after exchanging vows in the kienzle living room she moved with her husband to madison the college town that was swiftly surpassing la crosse in size and prospects and glamour the nextoldest sister ruth was on the verge of departing for chicago one by one the girls leftwith ray jrs favorite helen closest to him in age the last to go ray felt particularly close to helenclose enough that in one of his autobiographical jottings he confessed that his first crush was on her ever since i was four and she was nine ive wanted to make it with my sister helen he noted wryly because she was my sister years later reflecting on some of his adult relationships he would joke about a history of similar improprieties and feeling bent towards incest with other peoples children and wives exwives and daughters and such by the time ray was a freshman at la crosse central high school helen too had graduated and was planning her escape the table settings dwindled at home ray felt abandoned and lonesome and this loneliness which was with him from earliest memory never abated it was fundamental to his character and the themes of his filmswhich were often preoccupied with the loneliness of man he noted peopled by characters who suffer much agony and much searching culminating in a private despair in youth and manhood alike ray too was a soulsearcher in tortured colloquy with himself  his mother lavished attention on the girls but when it came to ray jr she deferred to her husband raymond n kienzle sr was tall his size and erect carriage lending him a largerthanlife air the filmmaker romanticized his father later in life once boasting that raymond sr had built levees docking areas for steamboats and dykes against floods as well as colleges creameries whorehouses cathedrals and breweries beyond his success as a contractor his father had other positive qualities raymond sr loved music and literature politically a republican he was known to speak out against racial prejudice at the dinner table in  he may even have voted for the spoiler la follette who carried only one statewisconsin but raymond sr cast a formidable shadow his sons delinquency started as early as his boy scout years by which time he was already smoking and drinking and playing hooky a stern disciplinarian the father had an iron fist punishing his son physically for his indiscretions and there was something else as the director put it once he was raised under the lash of alcoholism though lena kienzle was a teetotaler her husband was a dedicated alcoholic drinking was one way to imitate his father all during childhood and prohibition the filmmaker recalled years later there was booze in the house and on the street at home it was for stealing i stole my first pint at ten on the street it was for buyinggrain alcohol mixed with sugar and hot waterwith money stolen from home    i learned about aqua velva long before i started shaving no i didnt drink it i poured it over the sheets or into the bathtub to clear the smell of my puke the household was filled with tension rays parents slept in separate bedrooms and after dinner raymond sr often disappeared prowling a city that despite prohibition was flush with speakeasies and saloons sometimes he didnt come home until the next day if he had the guts to knock mom cold once jim stark  james dean muses harshly in rebel without a cause then maybe shed be happy and stop picking on him continues excerpted from nicholas ray

 verified purchaselike many cinephiles im a fan of nick rays film oeuvre this book does much to illuminate the trajectory of his life and career placing it clearly and insightfully in the proletarian mindset of the s depression it does a lot to flesh out the enormous network of artists actors directors and leftwing provocateurs that were influential in and part of his life he knew and worked with literally dozens if not hundreds of people that are considered consecrated contributors to that zeitgeist also i came to the reading of this book feeling closer than a mere film students appreciation having known some of the people that were part of rays entourage when he was in spain and italy in the s  members of the extended family surrounding his wife betty uitti the correct finnish spelling not uttey the mispelling propagated in the book  as well as having heard ray speak during his chicago  trial days a key draw for film students is mcgilligans development of the history of the production of rays first film they live by night mcgilligan succeeds in making it an epic tale of artistic triumph over not just studio mammon but production code censorship as well as weaving it tightly into the framework of rays life to that pointi do not agree with the authors conclusion in the subtitle that ray was a failure he was emphatically not a failure he just never won an oscar and

toward community theater then radio then the leftist experimental theater that flourished in his youth one of his teachers in chicago was thornton wilder and ray who soon moved to hollywood seemed to

reserved isbn  chapter one nicholas ray was a kind of human jigsaw puzzle the pieces of his mystery scattered and lost over time many of his films were haunted by bruised young people threatened damaged or twisted by events beyond their control their suffering often begins in youth its source a secret buried there mementos of childhood crop up in rays films like missing pieces of the puzzle sports trophies line the top of a dresser in the room of an embittered detective in on dangerous ground a brokendown rodeo champion finds a rodeo handbill cap pistol and tobaccocan bank squirreled away in a crawl space under his old homestead in the lusty men i was looking for something i thought i lost he tells an oldtimer carrying a shotgun who interrupts his search sprawled drunkenly on the ground james dean pulls a scrappaper blankie over a cymbalbanging monkey toy during the opening credits of rebel without a cause can i keep it he pleads when arrested even so the source of hurt is private and vague and remotenot as in the case of another wisconsin filmmaker as knowable as a certain rosebud sled in his films ray tended to load the blame on mother and father figures the parents in rebel without a cause are fundamentally clueless the drug addicted father in bigger than life tries to use a scissors to sacrifice his young son to god fathers are faulted the most in rays films while mothers linger in the shadows blurry and complicit his unorthodox heroes the drugaddicted father is one are destined to fail the obstacles they face are nothing compared to their own neuroses they are burdened above all by their integrity rays intense searching visual style mirrored his personal struggles his best filmsa list that would arguably include they live by night in a lonely place on dangerous ground the lusty men johnny guitar rebel without a cause bigger than life bitter victory and party girlcant easily be categorized they owe something to hollywood where he never quite fit in and everything else to his iconoclastic sensibility first to the influential french critics of cahiers du cinéma and positif in the s and to every succeeding generation of film fans since ray has become a symbol of artistic purity and tragic flaws a test case of auteurist worship in his life as in his films everything began at homehope and trouble strength and fissures  home sweet home for nicholas ray was an all american city that was rugged and beautiful as ideal on the surface as an airbrushed portrait of the director at the peak of his fame christened as a furtrading post in  la crosse was settled on the eastern banks of the mississippi river at the confluence of the black and la crosse rivers along what would become the border of wisconsin which became a state in  and minnesota which followed in  from a handful of houses the town swiftly multiplied into a booming gateway to the west for merchants and adventurers germans and norwegians swarmed in on packed trains and cattle cars from milwaukee by  la crosse had grown into the fourthlargest community in wisconsin here is a town declared the former steamboat pilot samuel clemens aka mark twain in his  talltale memoir and travelogue life on the mississippi with electric lighted streets and blocks of buildings which are stately enough and also architecturally fine enough to command respect in any city it is a choice town and a choice setting with its lush greenery and majestic bluffs spared by the ice age surrounding fertile farmlands crystalline rivers and lakes dense forests and plentiful hunting and fishing the area was hailed locally as gods country by the early s members of a german clan named kienzle had reached gods country nicholas rays germanborn grandparents stopped briefly in the teutonic stronghold of milwaukee before heading to la crosse where they would eventually raise a brood of three sons and five daughters their oldest son raymond nicholas kienzle was born in milwaukee in  he would wed twice the first time at a tender age in milwaukee before meeting nicholas rays mother kienzles second marriage in la crosse in  didnt last much longer than the first though it produced two daughters who continued to live near their father after their parents divorced an enigmatic forbidding figure raymond n kienzle was as ray himself recalled him in his earliest photographs he wears an ironic smile but later in life a walrus mustache and the el producto cigar invariably lodged in his mouth gave him the gravitas of a successful tradesman the kienzles were building contractors specializing in masonry brick and stonework for public edifices and luxurious homes for rich clientele and in the s raymond the oldest son took over the family business late in that decade kienzle got a big job renovating gale college a presbyterian institution recently absorbed by the lutheran ministry in the town of galesville about twentyfive miles north of la crosse while there he met a quiet and kindhearted woman eleven years his junior slender and bespectacled olene toppen known as lena had been raised on a nearby farm one of nine children born to parents who were natives of norway the couple married in  and soon moved onto four acres near galesville their land included a brickyard factory where kienzle employed a handful of workers kienzle took local commissions including a cement archway entrance to galesvilles high cliff park but also jobs that took him away for weeks elsewhere in the midwest and as far as the deep south all four of the couples children were born in the small town of galesville three girlsalice b  ruth b  helen b and at last a son raymond nicholas kienzle jr came bawling into the world on time he would drop the name kienzle reverse the order of his first and middle names and adopt nicholas ray as his identity after he turned fifty raymond sr decided to cut back on his factory work and travel he put the trappings of his businessthe brick machines molders and sanders kiln sheds and tools and the galesville land itself up for sale and in stages moved his family back to la crosse purchasing a series of houses coowned or shared by kienzle relatives by  the kienzles had landed in a house at  west avenue north near the corner of vine facing west toward downtown and just about a mile away the river the indians called the father of waters  especially after rebel without a cause the mythology surrounding nicholas ray tended to highlight stories of a misspent youth complete with drinking truancy car thievery brushes with the police and flirtations with his fathers mistresses in many ways however his boyhood offers a scrapbook of an american idyll galesville wasnt far from la crosse and in the early years the kienzles made regular trips to the bigger city for shopping holidays and visits to relatives it was the citys firstrate public schools that eventually lured the family to return there permanently although the countryside was still dotted with a few tepees and scattered steamboats continued to roam the mississippi by  mark twains choice town had transformed itself from prairie way station to glittering metropolis la crosses streets were lit with electricity and paved with stone whizzing with automobiles and streetcars most neighborhoods had sidewalks and garbage collection and thousands of households had telephones la crosse had cause for civic pride though the lives of its citizens were subject to the whims of extreme weather the wind whipped across the mississippiperhaps not quite like emery cloth tearing across their faces as rené hardy wrote of the searing ghibli in bitter victory but turbulently in the summers and frigidly in the winters those winters which brought snow and ice before thanksgiving most years were the real endurance test yet la crossians embraced the season with skiing and skating and an annual winter carnival that featured dozens of floats and furwrapped marching bands and employee clubs representing local businesses ray must have remembered the strong wind for it often blew dramatically through key scenes of his filmssending up a murderous sandstorm in bitter victory howling outside as mercedes mccambridge makes her grand entrance in johnny guitar blowing back the hair of the mourning teenage rebels standing cliffside in rebel without a cause the kienzles lived on a street with several other kienzle aunts and uncles in a twostory house that was large but not architecturally fine a big yellow barn remembered ferdinand sontag a neighbor and classmate of rays the living room featured a parquet floor and an italian marble fireplace antlered heads decorated the walls and the familys shelves were crammed with books there was a separate piano room lena kienzle played violin and all her children learned to play at least one instrument for supper the dining room was set with linen and lace for parties and holidays the house filled with relatives friends and flowers by  rays father was semiretired but he still took small jobs as a bricklayer cement man and plasterer he was active in the chamber of commerce while his wife earned plaques volunteering with the red cross and community chest though raised as a catholic raymond sr had been excommunicated after his first divorce for a time he joined the congregational church but eventually drifted away from organized religion his wife brought up as a strict lutheran trended toward methodism and faithfully took her children to ser vices and sunday school ray jr had been steeped in the bible long before the temerity of his film king of kings ray jr was a boy scout a good boy who delivered patriotic speeches in grade school on election day in  as president calvin coolidge faced off against democratic candidate john w davis and wisconsin progressive robert m la follette sr the thirteenyearold eighthgrader urged his lincoln junior high school classmates to remind their parents to vote all three of rays sisters doted on their young brother the only boy in the family his siblings were all pretty with wavy hair like their mothers goodhumored but seriousminded anxious to leave home and la crosse they also nursed ambitions beyond marriage the eldest alice had already graduated from nursing school by the time of her young brothers election day speech after exchanging vows in the kienzle living room she moved with her husband to madison the college town that was swiftly surpassing la crosse in size and prospects and glamour the nextoldest sister ruth was on the verge of departing for chicago one by one the girls leftwith ray jrs favorite helen closest to him in age the last to go ray felt particularly close to helenclose enough that in one of his autobiographical jottings he confessed that his first crush was on her ever since i was four and she was nine ive wanted to make it with my sister helen he noted wryly because she was my sister years later reflecting on some of his adult relationships he would joke about a history of similar improprieties and feeling bent towards incest with other peoples children and wives exwives and daughters and such by the time ray was a freshman at la crosse central high school helen too had graduated and was planning her escape the table settings dwindled at home ray felt abandoned and lonesome and this loneliness which was with him from earliest memory never abated it was fundamental to his character and the themes of his filmswhich were often preoccupied with the loneliness of man he noted peopled by characters who suffer much agony and much searching culminating in a private despair in youth and manhood alike ray too was a soulsearcher in tortured colloquy with himself  his mother lavished attention on the girls but when it came to ray jr she deferred to her husband raymond n kienzle sr was tall his size and erect carriage lending him a largerthanlife air the filmmaker romanticized his father later in life once boasting that raymond sr had built levees docking areas for steamboats and dykes against floods as well as colleges creameries whorehouses cathedrals and breweries beyond his success as a contractor his father had other positive qualities raymond sr loved music and literature politically a republican he was known to speak out against racial prejudice at the dinner table in  he may even have voted for the spoiler la follette who carried only one statewisconsin but raymond sr cast a formidable shadow his sons delinquency started as early as his boy scout years by which time he was already smoking and drinking and playing hooky a stern disciplinarian the father had an iron fist punishing his son physically for his indiscretions and there was something else as the director put it once he was raised under the lash of alcoholism though lena kienzle was a teetotaler her husband was a dedicated alcoholic drinking was one way to imitate his father all during childhood and prohibition the filmmaker recalled years later there was booze in the house and on the street at home it was for stealing i stole my first pint at ten on the street it was for buyinggrain alcohol mixed with sugar and hot waterwith money stolen from home    i learned about aqua velva long before i started shaving no i didnt drink it i poured it over the sheets or into the bathtub to clear the smell of my puke the household was filled with tension rays parents slept in separate bedrooms and after dinner raymond sr often disappeared prowling a city that despite prohibition was flush with speakeasies and saloons sometimes he didnt come home until the next day if he had the guts to knock mom cold once jim stark  james dean muses harshly in rebel
