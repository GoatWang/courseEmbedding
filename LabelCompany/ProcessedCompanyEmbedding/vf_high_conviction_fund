effect of gst last updated  june  the magellan high conviction fund seeks to invest in outstanding companies at attractive prices while exercising a deep understanding of the macroeconomic environment to manage investment risk                                                                       magellan perceives outstanding companies to be those that are able to sustainably exploit competitive advantages in order to continually earn returns on capital that are materially in excess of their cost of capital while magellan is extremely focused on fundamental business value it is not a typical ’value’ investor the magellan high conviction fund will invest in companies that have relatively high pricetoearnings and pricetobook multiples provided that their businesses are outstanding and their shares are trading at an appropriate discount to their assessed intrinsic value equities that appear undervalued on the basis of a low pricetoearnings or pricetobook multiples will often prove to be poor investments if the underlying business is fundamentally weak and exhibits poor returns on capital magellan focuses on riskadjusted returns rather than benchmarkrelative returns as a result the magellan high conviction fund’s investment process is designed to generate an unconstrained highlyconcentrated portfolio of highquality companies the magellan high conviction fund’s will comprise of  to  investments with the portfolio weighted towards magellan’s highestconviction ideas the fund may also hedge some or all of the capital component of its foreign currency exposure arising from investments in overseas markets back to australian dollars  the magellan high conviction fund leverages off the magellan global fund’s investment process which integrates three key disciplines intensive bottomup stock analysis and industry research broad and detailed macroeconomic insight rigorous portfolio construction and risk discipline intensive bottomup stock analysis and industry research is undertaken in order to identify outstanding companies this involves the assessment of potential investments against key quality criteria as well as assessments of their intrinsic value magellan uses a proprietary ranking tool the magellan conviction scoring matrix to rank these companies based on these factors this process enables the portfolio to be weighted towards higher conviction ideas on a riskadjusted basis magellan’s detailed macroeconomic analysis is overlayed during portfolio construction alongside the application of both fixed and dynamic risk limits this process ensures that the portfolio is not overly exposed to aggregation risk risk which arises from correlated portfolio positions or macroeconomic event risk macroeconomic event risk can be a significant source of negative returns for investors magellan will make significant changes to the portfolio if it believes that macroeconomic events could lead to significant and sustained loss in value for investors such events would include a financial crisis a sustained oil price shock a global pandemic or a major global conflict performance chart fund performance distribution history growth
