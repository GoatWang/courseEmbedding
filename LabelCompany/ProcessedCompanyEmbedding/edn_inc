seeds questionanswerare your seeds organic and nongmo yes you can trust us to only provide you with the best organic seeds we are on a mission to bring healthy food to peoples homes questionansweris produce from ēdn gardens just as nutritious as organic store bought foods your greens will be just as nutritious as their store bought counterparts  most likely even more questionansweris ēdn committed to sustainability absolutely we are a green antiwaste company that builds products out of sustainable and recyclable material plants questionanswerwhat plants can i grow in the gardens of ēdn you can grow almost any type of flower herb or vegetable plant in our gardens if you choose to plant seeds of a larger plant keep in mind that you might need to repot the plants when they outgrow your ēdn garden questionanswerhow do plants grow with leds did you know you could even grow plants with candle light admitted it wouldnt be too efficient our leds provide your plants with an enhanced light spectrum that is optimized for your plants growth questionanswerhow do plants grow in the soilless gardens our awesome dirtfree soil is inspired by nasa technology and provides an optimal living environment for plants the soil ensures that theres always enough room for your plants to breathe and to retrieve the right amount of water and plant food questionanswerhow often do i need to water the plants youll only need to refill the water reservoir when you plant the seeds and then recurringly around every two weeks youll know when to refill the water when the blue led lights up questionanswercan i overwater the plants please dont add more than  pitchers of water overwatering happens when plants cant breath via the soil when it is submerged in water our gardens provide just enough water from below minimizing the chance of overwatering your plants questionanswerwhat kind of water should i use please only use standard tap water with a normal ph level or distilled water never use hard water which is common tapwater in the southwestern states your plants might turn yellow or wont grow well when you use the wrong water type because the dissolved minerals in the water
