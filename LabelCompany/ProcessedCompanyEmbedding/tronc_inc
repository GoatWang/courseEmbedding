content and evoke the company’s effort to ‘pool’ technology and content resources tribune publishing’s new name tronc functions as an acronym of sorts for tribune online content the chairman has also said the phrase is a british term for the box in which tips are collected at a restaurant and are later doled out to staff an analogy for how tronc will pool technology and content resources photo associated press by lukas i alpert lukas i alpert the wall street journal biographylukas i alpert lalpert lukasalpertwsjcom june    pm et  comments tribune publishing co  the yearold brand that owns the los angeles times and chicago tribune newspapers is changing its name to tronc inc in a nod to the publisher’s transformation into a more digitally focused company the new moniker announced on thursday functions as an acronym of sorts for tribune online content the business is being described as “a content curation and monetization company focused on creating and distributing premium verified content across all channels” it’s just the latest shakeup under michael w ferro jr  who bought a stake in the company and became chairman in february he has since unveiled a new digitalfirst strategy brought on new investors and board members and rebuffed a takeover offer from gannett co gci  that carried a  premium mr ferro first revealed the name tronc last month on an earnings call with analysts when he used it to describe the new digital platform he was building that would use artificial intelligence and “machine vision” technology to revolutionize how information reaches readers at the time he said the phrase was a british term for the box in which tips are collected at a restaurant and are later doled out to staff according to some dictionaries “tronc master” refers to the person who distributes those pooled tips at a restaurant or hotel “our industry requires an innovative approach and a fundamentally different way of operating” mr ferro said in a statement “our rebranding to tronc represents the manner in which we will pool our technology and content resources to execute on our strategy” there is a long history of brands particularly in media adjusting their names after a split usually to avoid confusion with the sister company but tribune publishing has carried the same branding since it was spun off in  from broadcast holdings that became tribune media when gannett separated the digital and broadcast division changed its name to tegna which it said was a nod to gannett’s more than year history—presumably because tegna included the same letters as gannett and after news corp   the owner of the wall street journal split in two the television and film side of the business took the name st century fox  the nomenclature change led to frequent mixups at the studio which is still called th century fox a century behind its parent company time warner cable famously went the other route licensing the “time warner” name ever since its  spinoff from time warner inc that led to mass confusion over the years with time warner inc ceo jeff bewkes frequently getting missives from angry cable customers targeting the wrong company and protesters showing up at the wrong offices that headache is soon fading away as the time warner cable name is phased out after its sale to charter communications  one of the more famous headscratcher rebrandings in recent years was kraft foods which changed its name to mondelēz international inc pronounced mohndahleez in  it was meant to evoke the idea of a “delicious world” “monde” comes from the latin word for “world” and “delēz” is a “fanciful expression of ‘delicious’” kraft executives explained at the time in some places like russia however the name elicited a level of embarrassment as it sounded very close to a very dirty russian slang phrase the name change to tronc will become effective on june  when the company’s stock will cease trading on the new york stock exchange under the ticker tpub and will be moved to the nasdaq with the new symbol trnc write to lukas i alpert at lukasalpertwsjcom content from our sponsor deloitte cmo insights and analysis from deloitte smart collaboration in
