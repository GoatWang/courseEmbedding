selected an area located in san luis arizona to pursue the construction of their innovative green renewable energy downdraft tower facility critical accounting policies and estimates financial reporting release no  published by the sec recommends that all companies include a discussion of critical accounting policies used in the preparation of their financial statements while all these significant accounting policies impact our consolidated financial condition and results of operations we view certain of these policies as critical policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements and require management to use a greater degree of judgment and estimates actual results may differ from those estimates we believe that given current facts and circumstances it is unlikely that applying any other reasonable judgments or estimate methodologies would cause a material effect on our consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in this report general the companys consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles which require management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities net revenue if any and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources senior management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates with the board of directors management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable however actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the consolidated financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements basic and diluted net loss per share we utilize asc  earnings per share for calculating the basic and diluted loss per share in accordance with asc  the basic and diluted loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding diluted net loss per share is computed similar to basic net loss per share except that the denominator is adjusted for the potential dilution that could occur if stock options warrants and other convertible securities were exercised or converted into common stock potentially dilutive securities were not included in the calculation of the diluted net loss per share as their effect would be antidilutive income taxes the company utilizes asc  income taxes which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns under this method deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each yearend based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income temporary difference between taxable income reported for financial reporting purposes primarily relate to the recognition of debt costs and stock based compensation expenses the adoption of asc  income taxesdid not have a material impact on the companys consolidated results of operations or financial condition revenue recognition the company has generated no revenues to date it is the companys policy that revenue from product sales or services will be recognized in accordance with asc determination of criteria  and  are based on managements judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the collectability of those amounts provisions for discounts and rebates to customers estimated returns and allowances and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded the company will defer any revenue for which the product was not delivered or is subject to refund until such time that the company and the customer jointly determine that the product has been delivered or no refund will be required the company has not yet generated any revenue as of to date fair value of financial instruments the company adopted the provisions under fasb for fair value measurements which define fair value for accounting purposes establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure requirements regarding fair value measurements the companys adoption of these provisions did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements fair value is defined as an exit price which is the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid upon transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities generally correlates to the level of pricing observability financial assets and liabilities with readily available actively quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing observability and require less judgment in measuring fair value conversely financial assets and liabilities that are rarely traded or not quoted have less price observability and are generally measured at fair value using valuation models that require more judgment these valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency of the asset liability or market and the nature of the asset or liability the company has categorized its financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value into a threelevel hierarchy in accordance with these provisions in january  the fasb issued update no  compensationstock compensationescrowed share arrangements and presumption of compensation   reasserts that the staff of the securities exchange commission the sec staff has stated the presumption that for certain shareholders escrowed share represent a compensatory arrangement  further clarifies the criteria required to be met to establish a position different from the sec staffs position the company does not believe this pronouncement to have any material impact on its financial position results of operations or cash flows accounting for derivatives in  and  we issued convertible notes payable that contained certain conversion features which we identified as embedded derivatives therefore in accordance with asc  we reclassified the fair value of the conversion feature from equity to a liability at the date of issuance subsequent to the initial issuance date we are required to adjust to fair value the derivative as an adjustment to current period operations new accounting pronouncements there are various updates recently issued most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not expected to a have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows results of operations comparison of the year ended december   to the year ended december  revenue the company has not generated

equipment other incomeexpense interest expense for year ended december   we incurred  as interest expense relating to our issued notes payable as compared to  for the same period last year in connection with the issuances we incurred noncash charge to interest of  during the year ended december   due to the excess of fair value of the conversion feature over the note proceeds compared to

year ended december   from a working capital deficit current liabilities in excess of current assets of  at december   to a working capital deficit of  at december   the increase in working capital deficit for the year ended december   is due to a combination of reasons of which the significant factors include � cash had a net decrease from working capital by  for the year ended december   the

accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which contemplate continuation of the

the company is in a predevelopment and does not have any revenues from operations and will be dependent on funds raise to satisfy its ongoing capital requirements for at least the next  months the company will require additional financing in order to execute its operating plan and continue as a going concern the company cannot predict whether this additional financing will be in the form of equity or debt or be in another form the company may not be able to obtain the necessary additional capital on a timely basis on acceptable terms or at all in any of these events the company may be unable to implement its current plans for expansion or respond to competitive pressures any of these circumstances would have a material adverse effect on its business prospects financial condition and results of operations management expects that global economic conditions will continue to present a challenging operating environment through  to the extent permitted by working capital resources management intends to continue making targeted investments in strategic operating and growth initiatives working capital management will continue to be a high priority for  while we have been able to manage our working capital needs with the current credit facilities additional financing is required in order to meet our current and projected cash flow requirements from operations we cannot predict whether this new financing will be in the form of equity or debt we may not be able to obtain the necessary additional capital on a timely basis on acceptable terms or at all additional investments are being sought but we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain such investments financing transactions may include the issuance of equity or debt securities obtaining credit facilities or other financing mechanisms however the trading price of our common stock and the downturn in the us stock and debt markets could make it more difficult to obtain financing through the issuance of equity or debt securities even if we are able to raise the funds required it is possible that we could incur unexpected costs and expenses fail to collect significant amounts owed to us or experience unexpected cash requirements that would force us to seek alternative financing further if we issue additional equity or debt securities stockholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our common stock if additional financing is not available or is not available on acceptable terms we will have to curtail our operations our independent registered public accounting firms report dated march   on our december   consolidated financial statements included in this form k states that our difficulty in generating sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations and sustain operations raise substantial doubts about the our ability to continue as a going concern the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result should the company be unable to continue as a going concern inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business financial condition or results of operations if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations offbalance sheet arrangements we do not maintain offbalance sheet arrangements nor do we participate in any nonexchange traded contracts requiring fair value accounting treatment other than the operating leases as disclosed in item  properties and notes to

bold new approach to overcome the current limitations of conventional wind energy sources solar wind energy inc offers a bold new approach to overcome the current limitations of conventional wind energy sources follow us overview patents the tower firsttomarket hybrid solarwind energy technology   the solar wind downdraft tower is the first hybrid solarwind renewable energy technology in the market the patented structure is comprised of a tall hollow cylinder with a water injection system near the top and wind tunnels containing turbines near the bottom   to start a series of pumps deliver water to the tower’s injection system at the top where a fine mist is cast across the entire opening the water introduced by the injection system then evaporates and is absorbed by hot dry air which has been heated by the solar rays of the sun  as a result the air becomes cooler denser and heavier than the outside warmer air and falls through the cylinder at speeds up to and in excess of  mph this air is then diverted into wind tunnels surrounding the base of the tower where turbines inside the tunnels power generators to produce electricity in geographic areas where atmospheric conditions are conducive the exterior of the tower may be constructed with vertical “wind vanes” that capture the prevailing wind and channel it to produce supplemental electrical power this dual renewable energy resource greatly enhances its clean energyproducing capability and productivity   solar wind energy’s tower is unique in that it does not have any operational limitations in terms of time it’s capable of operating around the clock  hours per day and seven days per week whereas there are operational limitations with solar collectors that work only when the sun shines and with wind turbines that work only when the wind blows   it also has the ability to be operated with virtually no carbon footprint fuel consumption or waste production it generates clean cost effective and efficient electrical power without damaging effects proprietary global energy generation calculator   to complement its renewable energy technology and aid in its expansion efforts solar wind energy  developed a proprietary software based analytical program to determine the energy generation capabilities of its towers based on the climate in geographic locations around the world and has taken the appropriate steps to protect its intellectual property invention this essential tool applies “known” scientific meteorology data of a specific area to the tower’s variables in order to determine and project energy outputs on a daily basis advancements in the scientific community over the last decade make it possible to predict and pinpoint specific weather conditions and have provided significant insights into the tool’s development process and direction   solar wind energy’s analytical tool combined with its proprietary technology and existing core patents provide it with a unique opportunity to plan and target the global positioning of its towers to help meet the world’s energy needs solar wind energy can now rapidly respond to a request from virtually any country reasonably suitable to host a project and determine specifically where the tower should be located the size of it and the amount of electricity it can produce abundant clean economical energy production   through consistent innovation the company has successfully managed to economize the tower reducing capital costs while enhancing projected financial performance this development was made possible by utilizing its global energy generation calculator software which can calculate and predict energy production of the towers given a projected location and incorporating that locations’ local weather data by feeding weather data of its future site location into the program the tower’s height and diameter can be adjusted along with the amount of water required as fuel to create a desired amount of energy the outcome dictates the optimum size of each tower   under the most recent design specifications the tower designed for a site near san luis arizona has a gross production capacity on an hourly basis of up to  megawatt hours due to lower capacities during winter days the average hourly output per day for sale to the grid for the entire year averages approximately  megawatt hourshr   each tower will be constructed on location using conventional materials equipment and techniques associated industries as well as local workers in the surrounding town or city each location will benefit significantly from the creation of professional manufacturing construction and transportation jobs in addition to having a high efficiency energy resource close by – providing clean renewable energy at a cost more favorable than nuclear plants with no negative impacts to the environment the company has filed numerous patent applications with the us patent and trademark office to protect its intellectual property  the company has been awarded two patents and currently has two other patent applications which have been designated with a “notice of allowance” and is awaiting issuance of the actual patent documents the company has judiciously pursued the patent applications that it feels are instrumental to the core development of its technology and project patent   issued    “efficient energy conversion devices  methods”   this patent covers a novel hydraulic system capable of maintaining high efficiency hydraulic to electric conversion under a wide variance of wind speeds as coupled to a plurality of wind turbines in wind tunnels patent   b issued  “atmospheric energy extraction devices  methods”   this patent covers a structure for producing electricity specifically a tower capable of adding moisture at the top of the structure to hotdry air so as to generate a downdraft of wind within the interior of the tower vanes coupled to the exterior of the tower that at least partially define a plurality of elongated pockets to the exterior of the tower and flaps located to redirect the incident wind downwards into tunnels to convert wind to electricity patent   b issued  “efficient energy conversion devices  methods”   this patent enhances and broadens previously issued patent  patent   b issued  “atmospheric energy extraction devices  methods”   this patent claims are targeted to represent the advantages of the new tower structural shape the configuration of the tower walls their composition as well as the wall thicknesses for a given height along with more efficient construction methodology and enhanced wind force resistance over prior tower designs the demonstration to the left depicts the tower in operation the color of the arrows represent the current internal temperature of the air which transitions from hot near the top of the tower to cold as the air rapidly races towards its base please feel free to leave a comment or question on the company’s youtube

suppliers leadership  winners subscribe enewsletter subscription digital issues update on the giant solar wind energy tower august   paul dvorak   commentthe solar wind downdraft tower swet and structure is said to be capable of producing abundant inexpensive electricity to meet the world’s increasing demand the company recently issued an update on the execution of company’s business plan and development of its tower project in san luis arizona the downdraft tower will theoretically generate moving dense air through wind turbines at the base the focus of the company’s business plan has been to secure the proprietary and intellectual property necessary to enable development of its hybrid solarwind clean energy solution  the utility scale downdraft tower swet’s revenue model is based on charging developmental fees to potential developers of the towers and the receipt of long term recurring royalties defined by the amount of energy produced by the structures the company has assembled a team to pursue its business plan and achieve the necessary patents to facilitate the successful development once the initial tower is constructed it will be a source of abundant economically competitive clean power through its subsidiary arizona green power llc agp swet has been pursuing and contributing significant resources both manpower and capital to development of its first tower project in san luis arizona called the agp tower project the business model objective is for agp to acquire necessary approvals for the project and identify an appropriate teaming partner to further develop the project thereby ensuring that in exchange for the rights to use the company’s intellectual property and proprietary knowhow to develop other towers swet will receive the appropriate development and royalty fees “we believe sufficient accomplishments and entitlements are in hand to enable us to attract an entity to team with agp and provide the necessary resources to pursue the development of the san luis az tower project” says ron pickett ceo of swet “recently we announced the engagement of hanover international to vet the potential market and introduce swet to the appropriate bankers and to assist the company with defining its place in the market hanover diligently undertook the vetting process and introduced swet to many interested potential firms our selection process is now complete” through its banker agp is seeking sufficient capital to pay swet the development fee and take the san luis project to commencement of construction transferring development responsibilities to agp will satisfy the capital requirements for swet and eliminate the need for swet to continue short term convertible note borrowings solar wind energy tower inc solar
