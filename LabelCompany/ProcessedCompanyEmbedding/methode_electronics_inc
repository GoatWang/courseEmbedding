of  per share related to the bankruptcy of a large automotive safety system supplier for the six months sales amounted to  million up  from  million last year net income was  per share as compared to  prior to the bad debt charge last year until the irs approves methodes plan for a taxfree spinoff of stratos lightwave inc methode continues to operate in two separate and distinct business segments  the optical and the electronic chairman bill mcginley said our optical business continues its solid high growth pattern set over the last several years the electronic segment despite a recent poor earnings performance in the automotive interconnect and controls business continues as methodes primary cash generator sales for the second quarter for the optical segment were  million nearly double last years second quarter sales of  million with pretax profits up to  million from  million last year the performance of our optical segment includes the results of stratos lightwave inc and additional other methode optical business units which were not transferred to stratos but will be retained by methode of the optical segments sales of  million stratos accounted for about  million with second quarter pretax earnings of  million before minority interest up eightfold from  million a year ago stratos sales order backlog continued to strengthen to a record of  million as of october   for more details concerning the operations of stratos lightwave see its separate news release dated november   at httpwwwstratoslightwavecom  methode previously indicated its intention to spin off its approximate  ownership of stratos to methode shareholders once it receives a favorable ruling concerning the taxfree nature of such distribution from the internal revenue service methode can neither provide assurance that it will receive a favorable ruling nor control the irs timing for the issuing such ruling under the requested ruling methode shareholders will receive just under  shares of stratos lightwave inc for every share of methode electronics owned as of the record date the cash raised at the time of the public offering  million remaining at october  will be retained by stratos and will not be available to methode electronics dale phillips methodes chief financial officer commented on the electronic segment sales of electronic interconnect devices connectors controls and various cable assemblies were  million up  from  million last year representing  of methodes consolidated shipments while methodes connector and interconnect business in the telecommunications and computer markets experienced solid performance improvements poor earnings performance in the automotive interconnect and controls business resulted in pretax profits for the electronics segment of  million compared to  million last year connector and interconnect devices sold to telecommunications and computer markets continued to enjoy improved sales and earnings as compared to a year ago the three leading business units in this group  duel systems adam technologies and methode singapore  all reported solid improvements on a combined sales increase of  and a pretax earnings increase of  compared to a year ago the datamate business continued to strengthen its relationship with intel and its oem customers in the quarter datamate began providing its coppermine terminator to dell hewlettpackard and ibm in this quarter annual sales estimates for the coppermine are now expected to reach  million in addition datamate is the first terminator supplier to qualify for intels next generation processor this terminator is anticipated to achieve annual sales of    million datamate is currently working on designs for the next several generations of intel processors commenting on the underperformance in the automotive interconnect and controls businesses mr phillips stated it has been an interesting and active quarter for the automotive business while sales increased  to  million from  million several factors contributed to a disappointing earnings performance and a subsequent change in leadership for the business first startup costs for our reynosa mexico plant ran approximately  million higher than anticipated for the quarter second we launched over  new product lines in our carthage and golden plants this summer compared to five new product launches in fiscal year  this aggressive launch schedule resulted in at least  million higher than anticipated operating expenses for these products third an intense united auto workers organizing campaign affected productivity levels at both carthage and golden mr phillips further stated the initial steps to enhance profitability of this business have already been taken first any further product transfers to reynosa have been frozen until next spring this step will allow us to better train and develop the growing work force of over  newlyhired workers in that plant we expect substantial improvements in productivity and quality from that unit in the next three to six months second recent internal management changes at the carthage and golden plants are expected to renew focus on production details for the newly launched product lines and the employee relations issues generated over the last two years these initial steps were taken in order to return to productivity levels more in line with methodes historical performance in this business finally the uaw withdrew its organizing petition from the national labor relations board on november   looking forward we are concerned that some of these nearterm productivity gains may be overshadowed by current industry trends after a year and a half of increasing interest rates the automotive industry has slowed based on recent production cuts by methodes major customers we currently anticipate flat to modestly down third quarter automotive revenues and flat to modestly up fourth quarter automotive revenues our longerterm projections still reflect reasonably strong growth for fiscal  over fiscal  based on current estimates from our customers when these results are overlaid with the rest of methode we anticipate total third and fourth quarter revenues including stratos to continue to increase with earnings modestly up in the third and fourth quarters while the current automotive estimates are fluid at best they do however reflect planned customer announcements regarding production requirements that we expect will be made in the next week to ten days any further announcements from detroit beyond this time frame may cause us to institute a midquarter business trend call at that time methode as previously announced will conduct an earnings meeting and conference call led by its executive vice president and chief financial

completely shutdown on aug   this page provides access to the last available data dump read more data dumps are a downloadable version of the data in freebase they constitute a snapshot of the data stored in freebase and the schema that structures it and are provided under the same ccby license the freebasewikidata mappings are provided under the cc license freebase triples freebase deleted

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in milliseconds creator deletiontimestamp unix epoch time in
