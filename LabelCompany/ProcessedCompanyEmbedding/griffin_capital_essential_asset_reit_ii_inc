operationsunaudited      our management believes that historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient in order to provide a more complete understanding of the operating performance of a reit the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” promulgated a measure known as funds from operations “ffo” ffo is defined as net income or loss computed in accordance with gaap excluding extraordinary items as defined by gaap and gains and losses from sales of depreciable operating property adding back asset impairment writedowns plus real estate related depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of nonreal estate assets and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships joint ventures and preferred distributions because ffo calculations exclude such items as depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and gains and losses from sales of operating real estate assets which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar conditions based on historical cost accounting and usefullife estimates they facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other reits as a result we believe that the use of ffo together with the required gaap presentations provides a more complete understanding of our performance relative to our competitors and a more informed and appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating financing and investing activities it should be noted however that other reits may not define ffo in accordance with the current nareit definition or may interpret the current nareit definition differently than we do making comparisons less meaningful the investment program association “ipa” issued practice guideline  the “ipa mffo guideline” on november   which extended financial measures to include modified funds from operations “mffo” in computing mffo ffo is adjusted for certain nonoperating cash items such as acquisition fees and expenses and certain noncash items such as straightline rent amortization of inplace lease valuations amortization of discounts and premiums on debt investments nonrecurring impairments of real estaterelated investments marktomarket adjustments included in net income loss and nonrecurring gains or losses included in net income loss from the extinguishment or sale of debt hedges foreign exchange derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from or deconsolidation to equity accounting and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures with such adjustments calculated to reflect mffo on the same basis management is responsible for managing interest rate hedge and foreign exchange risk to achieve our objectives we may borrow at fixed rates or variable rates in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on certain financial instruments if any we may enter into interest rate cap agreements or other hedge instruments and in order to mitigate our risk to foreign currency exposure if any we may enter into foreign currency hedges we view fair value adjustments of derivatives impairment charges and gains and losses from dispositions of assets as nonrecurring items or items which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized and which are not reflective of ongoing operations and are therefore typically adjusted for when assessing operating performance additionally we believe it is appropriate to disregard impairment charges as this is a fair value adjustment that is largely based on market fluctuations assessments regarding general market conditions and the specific performance of properties owned which can change over time no less frequently than annually we evaluate events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of real estate and related intangible assets may not be recoverable when indicators of potential impairment are present we assess whether the carrying value of the assets will be recovered through the future undiscounted operating cash flows including net rental and lease revenues net proceeds on the sale of the property and any other ancillary cash flows at a property or group level under gaap expected from the use of the assets and the eventual disposition investors should note however that determinations of whether impairment charges have been incurred are based partly on anticipated operating performance because estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property including estimated future net rental and lease revenues net proceeds on the sale of the property and certain other ancillary cash flows are taken into account in determining whether an impairment charge has been incurred we adopted the ipa mffo guideline as management believes that mffo is a beneficial indicator of our ongoing portfolio performance and ability to sustain our current distribution level more specifically mffo isolates the financial results of the reit’s operations mffo however is not considered an appropriate measure of historical earnings as it excludes certain significant costs that are otherwise included in reported earnings further since the measure is based on historical financial information mffo for the period presented may not be indicative of future results or our future ability to pay our dividends by providing ffo and mffo we present information that assists investors in aligning their analysis with management’s analysis of longterm operating activities mffo also allows for a comparison of the performance of our portfolio with other reits that are not currently engaging in acquisitions as well as a comparison of our performance with that of other nontraded reits as mffo or an equivalent measure is routinely reported by nontraded reits and we believe often used by analysts and investors for comparison purposes as explained below management’s evaluation of our operating performance excludes items considered in the calculation of mffo based on the following economic considerations revenues in excess of cash received net most of our leases provide for periodic minimum rent payment increases throughout the term of the lease in accordance with gaap these contractual periodic minimum rent payment increases during the term of a lease are recorded to rental revenue on a straightline basis in order to reconcile the difference between accrual and cash basis accounting as straightline rent is a gaap noncash adjustment and is included in historical earnings ffo is adjusted for the effect of straightline rent to arrive at mffo as a means of determining operating results of our portfolio in addition when applicable in conjunction with certain acquisitions we may enter into a master escrow or lease agreement with a seller whereby the seller is obligated to pay us rent pertaining to certain spaces impacted by existing rental abatements in accordance with gaap these proceeds are recorded as an adjustment to the allocation of real estate assets at the time of acquisition and accordingly are not included in revenues net income or ffo this application results in income recognition that can differ significantly from current contract terms by adjusting for this item we believe mffo is reflective of the realized economic impact of our leases including master agreements that is useful in assessing the sustainability of our operating performanceamortization of inplace lease valuation acquired inplace leases are valued as abovemarket or belowmarket as of the date of acquisition based on the present value of the difference between a the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the inplace leases and b managements estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding inplace leases over a period equal to the remaining noncancelable term of the lease for abovemarket leases the abovemarket and belowmarket lease values are capitalized as intangible lease assets or liabilities and amortized as an adjustment to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases as amortization of inplace lease valuation is a noncash adjustment and is included in historical earnings ffo is adjusted for the effect of the amortization to arrive at mffo as a means of determining operating results of our portfolioacquisitionrelated costs we were organized primarily with the purpose of acquiring or investing in incomeproducing real property in order to generate operational income and cash flow that will allow us to provide regular cash distributions to our stockholders in the process we incur nonreimbursable affiliated and nonaffiliated acquisitionrelated costs which in accordance with gaap are expensed as incurred and are included in the determination of income loss from operations and net income loss for property acquisitions accounted for as a business combination these costs have been funded with cash proceeds from our primary offering or included as a component of the amount borrowed to acquire such real estate if we acquire a property after all offering proceeds from our primary offering have been invested there will not be any offering proceeds to pay the corresponding acquisitionrelated costs accordingly unless our advisor determines to waive the payment of any thenoutstanding acquisitionrelated costs otherwise payable to our advisor such costs will be paid from additional debt operational earnings or cash flow net proceeds from the sale of properties or ancillary cash flows in evaluating the performance of our portfolio over time management employs business models and analyses that differentiate the costs to acquire investments from the investments’ revenues and expenses acquisitionrelated costs may negatively affect our operating results cash flows from operating activities and cash available to fund distributions during periods in which properties are acquired as the proceeds to fund these costs would otherwise be invested in other real estate related assets by excluding acquisitionrelated costs mffo may not provide an accurate indicator of our operating performance during periods in which acquisitions are made however it can provide an indication of our ongoing ability to generate cash flow from operations and continue as a going concern after we cease to acquire properties on a frequent and regular basis which can be compared to the mffo of other nonlisted reits that have completed their acquisition activity and have similar operating characteristics to ours management believes that excluding these costs from mffo provides investors with supplemental performance information that is consistent with the performance models and analysis used by managementgain or loss from the extinguishment of debt we use debt as a partial source of capital to acquire properties in our portfolio as a term of obtaining this debt we will pay financing costs to the respective lender financing costs are presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability consistent with debt discounts and amortized into interest expense on a straightline basis over the term of the debt we consider the amortization expense to be a component of operations if the debt was used to acquire properties from time to time we may cancel certain debt obligations and replace these canceled debt obligations with new debt at more favorable terms to us in doing so we are required to write off the remaining capitalized financing costs associated with the canceled debt which we consider to be a cost or loss on extinguishing such debt management believes that this loss is considered an event not associated with our operations and therefore deems this write off to be an exclusion from mffounrealized gains losses on derivative instruments these adjustments include unrealized gains losses from marktomarket adjustments on interest rate swaps and losses due to hedge ineffectiveness  the change in fair value of interest rate swaps not designated as a hedge and the change in fair value of the ineffective portion of interest rate swaps are noncash adjustments recognized directly in earnings and are included in interest expense  we have excluded these adjustments in our calculation of mffo to more appropriately reflect the economic impact of our interest rate swap agreements for all of these reasons we believe the nongaap measures of ffo and mffo in addition to income loss from operations net income loss and cash flows from operating activities as defined by gaap are helpful supplemental performance measures and useful to investors in evaluating the performance of our real estate portfolio however a material limitation associated with ffo and mffo is that they are not indicative of our cash available to fund distributions since other uses of cash such as capital expenditures at our properties and principal payments of debt are not deducted when calculating ffo and mffo the use of mffo as a measure of longterm operating performance on value is also limited if we do not continue to operate under our current business plan as noted above mffo is useful in assisting management and investors in assessing our ongoing ability to generate cash flow from operations and continue as a going concern in future operating periods and in particular after the offering and acquisition stages are complete however ffo and mffo are not useful measures in evaluating nav because impairments are taken into account in determining nav but not in determining ffo and mffo therefore ffo and mffo should not be viewed as a more prominent measure of performance than income loss from operations net income loss or to cash flows from operating activities and each should be reviewed in connection with gaap measurements neither the sec nareit nor any other applicable regulatory body has opined on the acceptability of the adjustments contemplated to adjust ffo in order to calculate mffo and its use as a nongaap performance measure in the future the sec or nareit may decide to standardize the allowable exclusions across the reit industry and we may have to adjust the calculation and characterization of this nongaap measure our calculation of ffo and mffo is presented in the following table for the three months ended march   and  dollars in thousands     three months ended march      net income
