proposed for investment using fundamental and quantitative analysis we evaluate them according to their growth profitability and value characteristics based on measures including revenues earnings cash flow dividend payout and return on equity these are standard yardsticks used to measure stocks we look carefully at a company’s business its history and its industry in an effort to assess the company’s prospects for growth  having identified those companies that we believe offer the strongest prospects for future growth we typically construct stock portfolios holding stocks in varied industries although we cannot eliminate the risk of stock ownership we believe that diversification across multiple industries is important to reduce risk buy discipline peninsula asset management’s buy discipline for individual equities is primarily bottomup fundamental growth at a reasonable price however we do consider value investments when favorable opportunities present themselves equity databases are filtered using proprietary computer screening methodologies to identify the most attractive investment opportunities the focus of this part of the process is on earnings cash flow dividend trends and valuation indepth fundamental security analysis is then performed on the computergenerated short list of attractive investment opportunities we concentrate on issues of earnings

committee are then added to individual client portfolios on a casebycase basis risk management and control is maintained through sector and subsector diversification active monitoring of risk exposures and strict adherence to clientspecific investment policy guidelines for objectives and constraints sell discipline we recognize that all stocks including those of highquality companies tend to go through cycles that include periods of relative weakness these periods of weakness may often be viewed as buying opportunities rather than selling triggers there are four cases where we may sell a stock in client portfolios intrinsic value attained the price target has been reached and we cannot make a case for further multiple expansion raising earnings estimates or additional investment catalysts opportunity cost at a specific point in time another security looks more attractive on a riskreward basis thus our clients would incur a potential opportunity cost if we failed to make the switch deterioration in fundamentals or the thesis clearly not coming to fruition visible degradation in company or industrywide fundamentals for example we would sell if sales growth unexpectedly and materially slowed the sales mix deteriorated pricing power was adversely impacted anticipated product introductions were delayed bellwether competitors or supplier fundamentals were hinting at a degrading situation in the future for our target company etc additionally if the rationale underpinning our investment thesis no longer seems reasonable then we sell stock price rolling over price performance is degrading relative to peer group comparables andor the industry relative strength rolls over compared to the broader benchmark when this occurs we then go back and do further investigation primarily fundamental analysis rechecking news and information in the public domain etc if the adverse price trend continues we may sell bringing it all together implementation of the

contact us investment philosophy we believe that client investment objectives can best be achieved through appropriate asset allocation and diversification to help control the level of risk we believe that financially sound companies with solid operating histories and increasing dividend payouts can be excellent investments for longerterm growth we are not shortterm traders or market timers as we believe that these strategies have limited potential for longerterm success we seek to produce aboveaverage returns consistent with the level of risk taken we measure our success by the progress made toward achieving each client’s investment goals and relative performance to various market benchmarks along the way at peninsula stocks are selected for longterm capital appreciation potential and secondarily for income bonds and other incomeoriented securities such as preferred stocks are purchased to produce income and help maintain principal stability cash is managed for liquidity stability and income we are dedicated to capital appreciation and income production adhering to a philosophy of using highquality investments peninsula invests in individual stocks of larger established companies that have demonstrated consistent and sustainable longterm growth of earnings  companies with an extensive history of consistent and increasing dividends are preferred companies must be financially strong and have the strategy the flexibility and products in place that ensure continued growth  peninsula may also invest in exchangetradedfunds or exchangetradednotes often referred to as etf’setn’s when appropriate for diversification into midcap and smallcap stocks international equities commodities and real estate portfolios with a balanced or incomeorientation may also contain us treasury securities government agency bonds corporate bonds and preferred stocks depending upon a client’s tax situation taxexempt municipal bonds may also be included our portfolios typically consist of bonds with intermediateterm maturities such as those in the  to  year range these maturities provide predictable cash flow and are not subject to the high levels of principal risk associated with longterm bonds should interest rates rise only investment grade bonds are purchased as determined by one or more of the rating services we avoid investment strategies based largely on forecasting interest rates or market timing because they often lead to extreme volatility in absolute returns and inconsistent relative returns home our philosophy our process faqslinks contact us all

best judgment and an analysis of your personal financial situation structure an investment portfolio designed to accomplish the goals that you and one of our portfolio managers agree upon at the time

meet operating or living needs is more important than is longterm growth of capital the portfolio will be designed to produce a steady secure stream of income if growth is more important income will
