unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case and could result in potential rating actions on the

to increased defaults and credit losses showing a potential downgrade of one or two categories under fitchs moderate x base case loss scenario especially for the subordinate bonds the notes could experience downgrades of up to three or more rating categories under fitchs severe x base case loss scenario key rating drivers and rating sensitivities are further described in the accompanying
