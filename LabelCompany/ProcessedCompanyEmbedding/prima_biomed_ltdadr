projects which scientists at the austin research institute a medical research facility then associated with melbournes austin hospital and that merged with the burnet institute in  were working on in the late s these projects were packaged together and taken public in july  on the asx in a reverse takeover of a defunct mineral explorer called prima resources the most advanced of these projects is what became cvac main article cvac cvac was taken into the phase ii can study in epithelial ovarian cancer in july  in september  prima reported topline interim data from this trial which showed no observed difference between treatment and control group in terms of progressionfree survival pfs however in may  when prima reported final data from can it was able to show median pfs for cvac patients in second remission of  months versus  months for the control group this result had statistical significance p after this data was received prima sought to alter its clinical trial protocols in order to recruit second remission patients however in february  the company announced that it was no longer recruiting into its cvac studies prima reported final overall survival numbers for cvac in may  showing that median survival number for second remission cvac patients had still not been reached at  months versus the median for the treatment group of  months the p value for this comparison was  immutep acquisitionedit since february  primas main focus has been on the programs that it acquired with immutep prima had announced the acquisition of immutep in october  and completed the transaction in december  the final purchase price was usm immutep which had been founded in  by professor frédéric triebel had been built on lag an immune checkpoint molecule known to play a role in switching off an immune response triebel had discovered lag in  and over the course of the next decade as part of a collaboration between institut gustave roussy and merck serono triebel et al established lag’s mechanism of action in t cells and dendritic cells immutep had called its soluble lag immune system activation technology immufact short for immunostimulatory factors and its lag antagonist antibody technology immutune it also developed a technology platform called immuccine which involved covalently linking an antigen to imp in a fusion protein in order vectorise the antigen to dendritic cells currently prima biomed are only focus on the immufact and immutune platforms impedit imp lagig is a soluble dimeric recombinant form of lag being a fusion protein with immunoglobulin designed to activate antigen presenting cells immutep established in  that the product could induce activation of dendritic cell and monocytes resulting in t cell expansion phase iia data in metastatic breast cancer generated in  has suggested that imp works as a chemoimmunotherapeutic where chemotherapy creates tumour debris and imp increases activation of apcs as they take up that debris in that study imp increased the response rate according to the recist criteria from the  rate expected for paclitaxel to over  at the sixmonth mark there is also evidence invivo that imp at low doses can be used as a t cell adjuvant for cancer vaccines prima has initiated a phase iib study  of imp in hormone receptorpositive metastatic breast cancer as of february update prima has registered a phase i study in conjunction with an existing approved checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab impedit imp is a depleting antibody for autoimmune disease that targets lag activated t cells gsk

imp antibody prima announced a single digit million dollar milestone related to gsk’s commencement of a phase i study in psoriasis in january  there is evidence in the tuberculininduced dth model in primates that a single injection of a depleting lag monoclonal antibody can prevent thdriven skin inflammation impedit imp is an antilag antibody which blocks lagmediated immune downregulation the
