about vision work with us philosophy services contact investment philosophy your partner to financial success tactical investing in today’s environment of more volatile markets tactical investing can be an important tool in an investor’s portfolio while the practice of buying and holding quality companies for the longterm should always remain the goal monitoring and adjusting “what you own” have become essential strategies to achieving longterm investment success at ncm the tenets of our philosophy are strategic asset allocation provides an appropriate balance between risk and return especially during challenging market conditions investing in lowcost taxefficient and transparent investments is a proven approach the investments and securities that we use are all publiclytraded priced daily and highly liquid market timing is not an effective longterm investment strategy investing in proprietary products often benefits the advisor or firm not necessarily the client we feel that advisors often make investing far more complex than it needs to be we try to be value investors for our clients choosing fair or underpriced securities rather than chasing the latest fad or investment bubble we utilize lowcost taxefficient and transparent investments such as ➢ exchangetraded funds etf’s➢ individual bonds ➢ individual securities➢ options ➢ index funds➢ managed futures fact most active managers do not beat their index benchmark over time it is further true that hedge funds private equity or other complex structured products are not appropriate for most investors in short we stay diversified in our portfolios while maintaining the flexibility to underweight or overweight in a particular asset class when it is appropriate we stand ready to add to positions that are more attractive in relative terms just as we are prepared to step away from an investment that may have appreciated in value and is at a level above our criteria for what dictates a fair price
