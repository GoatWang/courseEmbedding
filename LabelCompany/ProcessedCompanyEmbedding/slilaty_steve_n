referencefield of the invention the present invention relates generally to the field of transcriptome analysis and particularly to identification of rna transcripts generated from dna obtained from a population of cells background of the invention the central dogma of molecular biology defined a general pathway where expression of genetic information stored in dna is transcribed into transient mrna and decoded on ribosomes with the help of adapter trna to produce proteins which in turn perform all cell functions according to this view rna plays an accessory role in view of this scientists have been collecting dna sequence information from different organisms for decades the highlight of this quest has undoubtedly been the joint international effort of the human genome project to sequence identify and determine the structure regulation and function of the estimated  genes and their products therefore once the human genome sequence was decoded the field of proteomics which is the study of all proteins within a cell has recently gained enormous attention as the tool for advancing our understanding of the molecular basis of life and disease however over  years ago the discovery of the catalytic properties of the rna subunit of ribonuclease p and the selfsplicing activity of group i introns stark et al  suggested that the functions of rna go beyond a passive role in the expression of proteincoding genes in this regard genomic analysis shows that when the complexity of an organism increases the proteincoding contribution of its genome decreases szymanski  barciszewski  it is estimated that  of the transcriptional output of eukaryotic genomes is rna that does not encode proteins mattick  including introns and transcripts from nonprotein coding genes with the latter accounting for  of all transcription in higher eukaryotes mattick  gagen  therefore in recent years the importance of these non coding rnas ncrna that do not encode proteins but have cellular functions on their own or in complex with proteins has begun to be addressed to date a functional classification of these ncrna includes two general categories housekeeping ncrnas and regulatory ncrnas examples of housekeeping ncrnas include transfer rna trna ribosomal rna rrna small nuclear rna snrna including spliceosomal rnas implicated in premrna splicing small nucleolar snorna some involved in rrna processing but most in rrna modification elceiri  some housekeeping genes are transcribed from their own promoter and terminator signals by rna polymerase ii ie u u u or by rna polymerase iii ie rnase p and mrp rnas but the large majority are excised from introns of premrna almost all fall into  families the “cd box” which uses base complementarity to guide sitespecific rrna ′oribose methylations kisslaszlo et al  nicoloso et al  tycowski et al  and the “haca” which guides rrna pseudouridylations ganot et al  ni et al  catalytic function seems to be provided by enzymes associated to the snornas and the specificity of the target base on the rrna is provided by base complementarity to the snorna lafontaine  tollervey  wenstein  steitz  additional examples of housekeeping ncrna include rnase p rna which is involved in maturation of ′ ends of pretrna telomerase rna implicated in telomeric dna synthesis s rna in bacteria and its eukaryotic counterpart sl rna which are mediators of protein export tmrna involved in transtranslation and rnase mrp which functions in mitochondrial rna processing regulatory ncrnas are mainly synthesized by rna polymerase ii and are polyadenylated and spliced erdmann et al  they may be divided into  groups the transcriptional regulators and the posttranscriptional regulators transcriptional regulators are involved in chromatin remodeling associated with xchromosome inactivation dosage compensation in eukaryotes ie rox xisttsix and in regulation of expression of imprinted genes ie hi ipw lit i posttranscriptional regulators are implicated in repression or stimulation of translation of regulated mrnas in eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells via antisense rnarna interaction ie dsra micf lin let micrornas hfe ljplpiv modulation of protein function via rnaprotein interactions ie s rna oxy s sra and regulation of rna and protein distribution ie xlsirt hsrω as the number of known regulatory ncrna continued to increase they have been grouped in families like small noncoding rnas sncrna micro rnas mirna a putative translational repression regulatory gene family small temporal rnas strna ie lin and let in c elegans and small interfering rnas sirna doublestranded rna cleaved into  nt that degrades homologous mrna and leads to a lossoffunction phenotype by antisense complementarity elbashir et al  hunter  carthew  sharp  vance  vaucheret  gene identification is mainly based on  methods cdna cloning and expressed sequence tags est sequencing of polyadenylated mrnas liang et al  ewing  green  identification of conserved coding exons by comparative genome analysis roest crouillis et al  and computational gene prediction international human genome sequencing consortium  venter et al  however these methods work best for large highly expressed evolutionary conserved proteincoding genes and thus certainly underestimate the number of other genes including small mrna since they are discarded by size from the rna fraction used for preparing ests or cdna and they do not work for ncrna which produce transcripts that function directly as structural catalytic or regulatory rnas eddy   erdmann et al a b additionally many rna identification techniques rely on polyadenylation a feature many biologically important rnas lack early detection of ncrnas was limited to biochemically abundant species and by chance for example some ncrna are associated with ribonucleoproteins and were discovered when these proteins were immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies ie u u u u and u snrna lerner  steitz  yu et al  burge et al  others were isolated biochemically sometimes deliberately like snorna from nucleoli elcieri  others by chance as when fractions of ribonucelase p were found to contain essential rnas stark et al  or when the signal recognition “protein” was in fact found to contain a s rna and was subsequently called “signal recognition particle” lewin  walter  blobel  an example of serendipitous identification of a ncrna gene by genetics is that of lin regulatory rna in c elegans identified in a screen for mutations that affect the timing and sequence of postembryonic development horvitz  sulston  subsequently another ncrna with similar function was discovered the small let rna also thought to be a posttranscriptional negative regulator reinhart et al  later on more systematic approaches were pursued and a pioneer study found a few new rna genes and orfs in the yeast by doing northern blots probed for expression transcripts in very large intergenic regions and by searching for consensus sequences of rna polymerase iii promoters olivas et al  recent studies have carried out ncrna gene identification screens along  main lines the first type of screen for ncrna gene identification is with the use of specially designedcdna cloning screens for very small rnas to identify mirna for example lau et al  produced and sequenced a c elegans cdna library enriched for tiny rna with ′monophosphate and ′hydroxyl termini lee and ambros  used a sizeselected c elegans cdna library in addition to a computational approach to look for conserved sequences that can be folded into a stem loop similar to the lin and let precursors and lagosquintana et al  used sizeselected cdna libraries in humans and drosophila the second type of screen for ncrna gene identification is by the use of a general ncrna genefinding approach using computational comparative genomics for example argaman et al  computationally analyzed intergenic regions in e coli to identify loci that have promoter consensus sequences recognized by the major rna polymerase σ factor within a  nucleotide nt distance of a terminator and which are significantly conserved in other bacterial genomes in other approaches wassarman et al  looked for intergenic regions conserved in different genomes and their separation from the orfs the presence of putative promoter and terminator signals and significant rna expression detected on whole genome highdensity oligoprobes arrays while rivas et al  developed an algorithm to identify regions that conserve some particular type of rna structure the third type of screen for ncrna gene identification is by cdna cloning and sequencing tailored to find new ncrnas in this approach termed experimental rnomics total rna was isolated and size selected ie  on denaturing page eluted and reverse transcribed for cdna by tailing with ctp using polyapolymerase to generate specialized cdna libraries tang et al  huttenhofer et al  following amplification by pcr they were spotted in highdensity arrays of filters hybridized with radiolabeled oligonucleotides directed against the most abundant known ncrna the clones exhibiting the lowest hybridization scores were sequenced and those that did not map to any previously annotated genes were considered as potential ncrna candidates to analyze its expression northern blots were done using oligonucleotides complementary to the respective rna sequence although these methods have been useful in identifying new ncrna they also have important limitations for example computational identification of ncrna is hampered by a lack of orfs to aid in detection further relying only on known conserved sequencestructural motifs will unlikely yield the complete set of ncrna within a given organism searches limited to intergenic regions may be limited too because a number of hypothetical orfs might not actually encode a protein but a ncrna in addition ncrna encoded by antisense transcripts located within known protein genes or ncrna overlapping an orf also would be missed when computer searches are limited to intergenic regions those based on the consensus sequence of major factors like σ will miss other factors like stressspecific transcription factors andor alternative σ factors even though experimental rnomics may be able to overcome some of the problems faced by computational analysis this approach also contains limitations of its own since screens only comprise rnas ranging from  nt however sizes of ncrna range from very large ie  kb for xist brown et al  to extremely small  nt ambros  and many would be missed by this method in addition the size of the ncrnas determined by northern blot analysis were in many instances larger compared to the sizes of the cdna either due to the strategy used to construct the libraries which interferes with cloning at the ′ends of the novel ncrnas or to the fact that rna structure or modification impeded a complete conversion of the ncrna into cdna therefore there is a need for a new method to identify rnas missed in such conventional genetic screens including ncrna and small mrna further to provide a more realistic picture of rna transcripts generated in vivo there is need for developing a method which uses wild type rna polymerases from the cell populationtissue in which rna transcript generation is to be analyzed summary of the invention this invention provides a method for identifying rna transcripts generated from dna obtained from a cell population the method comprises the steps of obtaining a dna sample from a cell population preparing segments of dna such that each segment has only  promoter allowing transcription to occur and identifying and sequencing the resulting rna transcripts the dna sample may be a genomic library or a portion of a genomic library because each segment of dna has an endogenous promoter the identification of transcripts that are driven by the respective promoters provides identification of potential rna transcripts that are expected to be generated in vivo particularly if a wild type rna polymerase also endogenous to the source of the cell population is used in one embodiment the present method can be used identify catalog andor map rna transcripts that can be generated in a cell population this analysis can be carried out to obtain development

rna can be read in the ′ to ′ direction from the bottom of the gel according to the lanes labeled “a u g c” the sequence of the transcript is given vertically on the bottom right of the figuredetailed description of the invention this invention provides a method for indirect transcriptome analysis in a cell population thus a method is provided for identifying rna transcripts generated from dna obtained from a cell population dna fragments are generated such that each fragment contains only one rna polymerase promoter because each fragment of dna has an endogenous promoter the identification of transcripts that are driven by the promoter provides identification of possible rna transcripts that are expected to be generated in vivo particularly if a wild type rna polymerase also endogenous to the source of the cell population is used in one embodiment the method enables the determination of the sequence of rna transcripts not normally detected by conventional rna detection means such as by cdna generation this determination is achieved because the method allows identification of all types of rna transcripts that can be generated in vivo rather than being limited to amplified transcripts with particular characteristics such as polyadenylated tails typically required for generation of cdna libraries in another embodiment the method of the invention enables the determination of the sequence of a complete set of possible rnas transcribed in an organism otherwise known as the transcriptome for the purposes of the specification and claims herein a “wild type rna polymerase” or “wild type polymerase” means an rna polymerase that has not been genetically engineered meaning the amino acid sequence of the polymerase has not been experimentally altered rna polymerases used in the method of this invention may be any wild type rna polymerases examples of suitable rna polymerases are those found in bacteriophages such as t t or sp prokaryotes such as e coli eukaryotic microbes such as saccharomyces cerivisiae and mammals further the wild type polymerase may be provided in the form of a purified polymerase a partially purified polymerase or in a transcriptionally active cell extract tace purified rna polymerases are available commercially for example bacteriophage polymerases can be obtained from stratagene® la jolla calif or promega® madison wis e coli rna polymerase holoenzyme can be purchased from epicentre® madison wis usa some preparations of tace are commercially available for example tace prepared from rabbit reticulocytes can be purchased from promega® madison wis novagen® madison wis or ambion® austin tex tace prepared from human hela cells can be purchased from promega® madison wis desired tace preparations not commercially available can be prepared using previously described methods eg manley et al  sambrook et al  blow  veenstra et al  dna samples for use in the method of the invention can be obtained from any population of prokaryotic cells or any population of cells obtained from any organism and prepared by a variety of methods known to those skilled in the art for example dna samples representing the entire genome or portions of the genome of an organism can be obtained by construction of shotgun libraries andersson et al  bacteriophage libraries bacterial or yeast artificial chromosomes and other suitable dna vectors see generally sambrook et al  further genomic libraries from various organisms are available commercially such as from clontech® in a preferred embodiment the dna sample is a genomic library or a portion of a genomic library divided into samples such that each sample comprises only one rna polymerase promoter according to the method of the invention once a complete or partial genomic dna library or other suitable dna sample such as a polymerase chain reaction amplification product is obtained it is subjected to transcription reactions or transcription sequencing reactions using a wild type rna polymerase obtained from the same type of organism for example if the dna sample was obtained from a population of cells from a eukaryote a wild type eukaryotic rna polymerase may be used so long as the polymerase is able to recognize and drive transcription from a promoter endogenous to the population of cells from which the dna is obtained in another embodiment the wild type polymerase is obtained from an organism of the same species from which the dna sample is obtained for example if the dna sample is obtained from a population of e coli cells the wild type rna polymerase used would also be obtained from e coli in another embodiment the wild type polymerase is obtained from the same population of cells from which the dna sample is obtained for example if the dna sample is obtained from a population of cells from an individual human such as a tissue sample the wild type polymerase is also obtained from a sample of that tissue further the method of the invention can be used to detect alterations in genomic dna that result in the expression of different rna transcripts between different populations of cells for example a wild type rna polymerase obtained from an individual could be used to transcribe dna from two different populations of cells ie cancerous tissue compared to normal the method disclosed herein would identify transcripts having different sequences when obtained from the cancerous rather than normal cells due to alterations in the dna that is transcribed determination of the sequence of the rna transcripts can be achieved in a variety of ways in one embodiment labeled rna transcripts are produced using the method of the invention for use in hybridization assays for example commercially available radiolabeled ribonucleotides can be used in a transcription reaction to label the rna transcript a typical example of a radiolabeled ribonucleotide so used is αputp alternatively the transcripts can be labeled with commercially available fluorescently labeled nucleotides such as those available from promega® using methods known to those skilled in the art the labeled transcripts can be hybridized to commercially available chips or dna microarrays wherein the genome or a portion of the genome of the organism is represented on the chip of the array such dna microarrays are available from for example affymetrix inc when hybridization between the labeled transcript and a location on the chip is detected the sequence of the rna can be determined by comparison with the sequence of the dna at that location of the chip wherein the rna sequence is determined from the complementary with that dna sequence similarly the labeled transcripts can be used in hybridization assays to commercially available genomic library filters wherein the location of hybridization is correlated with the sequence of dna at the hybridization location and the sequence of the rna transcript is determined from its complementarity with the dna to which is has hybridized in another embodiment a population of rna transcripts produced from a dna sample obtained from an organism can be identified using rna sequencing reactions performing rna sequencing on a dna sample from a promoter endogenous to the organism from which the dna sample is taken using a wild type polymerase is disclosed herein for the first time accordingly this embodiment differs from that of us pat no  which discloses the use of polyamines to accelerate rna polymerase activity but does not demonstrate rna sequencing the synthesis of rna transcription termination products for use in determining the sequence of an rna transcript can be achieved by using ribonucleoside ′triphosphates ntps such as adenosine triphosphate atp guanosine triphosphate gtp cytosine triphosphate ctp and uracil triphosphate utp in combination with terminator nucleotides ′deoxynucleoside triphosphates ′dntps in a chainterminating technique similar to that used in standard dideoxy dna sequencing reactions the term “′dntp” collectively refers to ′datp ′dgtp ′dctp and ′dutp the ′dntps are useful in the method of the invention because incorporation of a ′deoxyribose at the ′ end of an elongating transcription product results in termination of transcription termination occurs because the formation of a subsequent phosphodiester bond at the ′ position is precluded as a result a series of truncated chains are generated that are each terminated by the ′dntp at each of the four possible nucleotide positions occupied by the corresponding base in the dna sample separation of the terminated products according to their lengths molecular weight indicates the positions at which the base occurs in the dna sample acting as the transcription template once obtained the transcription termination products are separated according to their relative molecular weights and the rna transcript is identified by determining its sequence from the separated products the separation of transcription termination products can be performed by any method which enables the separation of molecules having different molecular weights examples of such methods include gel electrophoresis and high pressure liquid chromatography detection of the separated rna transcription termination products can be facilitated by using labeled ′ribonucleoside ntps the label can be fluorescent or radioactive electrophorectically separated rna transcription termination products having incorporated label can be visualized by a variety of methods such as by exposure to film or analysis by phosphorimager when the label is radioactive when the label is fluorescent the termination products can be detected using automated polynucleotide sequencers such as an abi  once the sequence of the rna is determined the sequence can be used to locate the region of dna that serves as the transcription template for the rna transcript as well as for rna polymerase promoter sequences for example the sequence of the rna transcript can be used to search through a database comprising the genomic sequence of the organism from which the dna sample was obtained identification of a complementary location in the dna determines the location of the coding region in the dna which corresponds to the rna transcript further dna sequences upstream of the transcriptional start site can be analyzed for homology with known promoter sequences or further analyzed to identify previously unknown promoters using standard molecular biology techniques the method of the present invention is demonstrated by the following examples which are not meant to be limiting in any way example  this example demonstrates the identification of an rna transcript using commercially available genetically engineered bacteriophage polymerases pts transcription sequencing by t or t rna polymerase materials included with cuga sequencing kit purchased from nippon genetech® toyama japan was performed according to manufacturers instructions briefly  to  pmol of pts dna were incubated in a mixture containing mncl t or t enzyme solution fluorescentlabeled nucleotide triphosphate ntpterminator mixture and reaction buffer the reaction was incubated at ° c for  h after which the labeled rna was separated from the unbound material by adding  μl of  m edta and  ethanol for  min at room temperature following centrifugation the supernatant was discarded and the rnacontaining pellet washed with  ethanol after drying the pellet  μl of tsr buffer was added and the labeled rna sequenced using an abi prism®  genetic analyzer for which matrix standards were setup according to manufacturers instructions using the dt pop program from dye terminator fskit briefly each standard was reconstituted in  μl of tsr a × cm capillary was used for sequencing on the abi prism®  analyzer the sequencing results are presented in fig  which shows the predicted and experimental dna sequence of pts seq id no transcribed by t polymerase the top line of nucleotides shows the predicted dna sequence the bottom line indicates errors found in the experimentally obtained sequence where shaded nucleotides represent mismatches nucleotides in italics indicate insertions and nucleotides in bold designate deletions as can be seen the experimental sequence is remarkably similar to the expected sequence with approximately  errors including the insertions deletions or mismatches the sequence was accurate up to approximately  nucleotides after which the number of errors increased a similar result was obtained when transcription controlled by t polymerase was tested and is provided in fig  which has mismatches insertions and deletions designated as in fig  the experimental sequence for t sequencing seq id no was  accurate with respect to the sequence predicted for a nucleotide chain length of about  in both cases the majority of the errors were mismatch of c to t example  this example demonstrates that e coli rna polymerase can be used to transcribe an e coli gene from an e coli promoter in vitro in the presence and absence of terminating nucleotides βlactamase or lacz transcription controlled by e coli rna polymerase was performed as follows plasmid puc which contains both the βlactamase and the βgalactosidase lacz genes was linearized with either hindiii for βlactamase rna expression or sspi for βgalactosidase rna expression transcription was done essentially as described above in example  with slight modifications as follows  to  units of e coli rna polymerase were used incubation times ranging from  to  hours were used and × e coli rna polymerase buffer containing  m trishcl  m kcl  mm mgcl and  triton x with or without  mm dtt was utilized the results of the transcription reactions are depicted in fig  the figure is a photographic representation of an electrophoretic separation of transcription products through an agarose gel the lanes show transcription and control reaction using linearized puc digested for transcription of βgalactosidase lanes  and  or βlactamase lanes   and  which were incubated in the presence lanes   and  or the absence lanes  and  of  units of e coli rna polymerase these incubations were performed in either the presence lanes    and  or the absence lane  of ntpterminator mixture for  hs at ° c in lane  pts dna was incubated in the presence of t enzyme and ntpterminator mixture following ethanol precipitation lanes  and  reaction products were run on an agarose gel the arrow marks the rna transcription products as shown in this figure transcription products can be detected for both βlactamase and βgalactosidase on agarose gels which is absent when no enzyme is included thus demonstrating that e coli polymerase can be used to transcribe a gene endogenous to e coli under the control of an e coli promoter example  this example demonstrates that the method of the invention can be used to identify an rna transcript using a wild type polymerase to perform a transcription sequencing reaction on a dna sample that contains an rna promoter and gene endogenous to the organism from which the wild type polymerase is obtained puc dna new england biolabs was linearized using hindiii new england biolabs to inactivate the βgalactosidase promoter in order to drive rna transcription only from βlactamase promoter e coli rna polymerase holoenzyme was purchased from epicentre this preparation is  saturated with sigma subunit σ and thus initiates rna synthesis specifically at promoter sequences on native bacterial or bacteriophage dna all four ′deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates were obtained from trilink biotechnology san diego calif αputp of specific activity  cimmol was purchased from perkin elmer unlabeled ribonucleotide triphosphates were obtained from epicentre transcription reactions were carried out in  μl reaction volume a master mix for  reactions was prepared containing  μl of e coli

treating aggressive cancer ceocfo how are you attacking the problem dr slilaty topoisomerase ii is an enzyme that aggressive cancer cells make too much of when the cell is able to make a lot of the topoisomerase ii enzyme it becomes able to proliferate and metastasize so if you can inhibit or destroy the activity of topoisomerase ii you would then be able to prevent cancer cells from spreading ceocfo are there other treatments now or is this a new way of looking at the problem dr slilaty there are treatments there is a drug that is considered to be a topoisomerase ii inhibitor but it actually doesnt work as such our drug advaa is ten times more effective than any drug on the market for treating aggressive cancer ceocfo where are you in the process of development dr slilaty we have done a lot of preclinical testing and we are now positioned to begin doing animal studies and immediately after begin stage i clinical trials ceocfo is there a particular type of cancer that you are targeting first and why dr slilaty initially we are working on the socalled multidrug resistant breast cancer in a certain group of breast cancer patients as well as over time in a lot of cancer

study is prostate cancer and as with breast cancer our drug has proven to be very effective in treating aggressive forms of prostate cancer that would be a second indication ceocfo is here a similarity between the two types of cancer dr slilaty the similarity is that different types of cancer cells make different amounts of this topoisomerase ii enzyme the more topoisomerase ii the cell makes the more effective our drug is at killing that cell what that means is when prostate cancer become metastatic which is when the cell starts making a lot of topoisomerase ii is when our drug becomes very effective in treating that cancer there are other types of cancer like small cell lung cancer where initially or right at the point of diagnosis of this type of cancer the cell is already
