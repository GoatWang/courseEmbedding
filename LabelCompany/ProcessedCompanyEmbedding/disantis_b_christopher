chris disantis theres a little “good will hunting” in chris disantisyou know the story a kid from a workingclass neighborhood is found to be a genius and ultimately rises above his environment to do great things thats mr disantis — though he didnt wait quite as long as will did to have his talents discovered mr disantis dad knew his son had brains all along and he wasnt about to let him squander them “he was a bit of a perfectionist” mr disantis said of his father “whether you were washing the car or getting as it had to be perfect” the elder mr disantis worked his way up the hard way starting as a mechanic and eventually becoming a project manager at a company that converted old us navy vessels into stateoftheart warships in the familys hometown of philadelphia he made things a little easier for his son who at a young age was proving himself worthy of the effort and investment his family put into him chris disantis became the first student from his high school to get into the ivy leagues when he was accepted by dartmouth “the standards were so much higher i struggled the first yearandahalf” mr disantis said he turned it around however ultimately graduating summa cum laude with a tough double major after a stint in investment banking a yearold mr disantis went to work for a client who had a group of manufacturing companies headquartered in pittsburgh his first task was to close a factory in michigan but after being there a month he had other plans “i said to him i think were about to make a very bad mistake i dont think we should shut this plant down its just had bad management in the past ” then he went a step further and told his boss “i think you should make me president and let me turn it around” it worked not only for mr disantis but for the workers at the plant who ultimately kept their jobs three years later mr disantis called his boss with worse news than usual another plant the boss wanted turned around was in mr disantis opinion not worth saving fine his boss told him — you fire those people personally “he was teaching me a lesson” mr disantis said “the lesson was that once you have to do that youll do whatever you have to do to not have to do it again” today mr disantis is president and chief operating officer of hawk corp a major maker of brake pads and other friction materials for aircraft and heavy equipment he has sold three divisions of the company in nine years as part of a mission to refocus the company on its core business and he doesnt plan on leaving anytime soon “theres a lot more to be done here” he said
