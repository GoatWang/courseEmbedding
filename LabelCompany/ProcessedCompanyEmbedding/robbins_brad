tony robbins   it’s an interesting and crazy thing…being a personality brand people want to know everything about you what your shoe size is what you had for breakfast you don’t have any privacy ever so that’s the notsothrilling things but the value of a brand is extraordinary once you have a brand you have the most valuable commodity on earth if you have a brand that has fame attached to it it adds another level of energy so to speak there are going to be people that are threatened by a brand when there’s a personality attached to it it’s hard to be threatened by a coke but with a personality someone can say “oh my god he change my life” or they can say “oh he’s a piece of crap” without ever knowing who i am people have impressions of who they think you are because of what they’ve made up based on your celebrity they’ve never met me never talked to me never been to an event of mine it just comes with the territory the other challenge with being a celebrity brand is that people want that “physical celebrity” so scalability becomes a challenge it’s a pretty amazing thing i wake up every morning and halfamilion people have for the first time opened up one of my books audio or video program i’ve had million people attend my live seminars it didn’t happen just because i thought about it and hoped people would show up i became a brand because i innovated and marketed continuously and i still do if i had my choice as a business person i would just build a brand i wouldn’t build a celebrity brand because it would give me frankly more freedom but for me i never went into this for business i got into this to change lives i did it when i had no agent and was near bankrupt i do it now when i’m financially free it fulfils me so in my case i look at my “celebrity brand” and i know it opens doors people already have an opinion about me whether it’s negative or positive there’s an energy to it it allows me to touch more lives without it i wouldn’t touch as many lives and that is why i love “branding” it’s the “branding” that allows me to touch lives around the world subscribe to itunes subscribe to stitcher share subscribe note the above links are affiliate

robbins  a brand analysis september   introduction  baskin robbins baskinrobbins is a global chain of ice cream parlours founded by burt baskin and irv robbins in  from the merging of their respective ice cream parlours in glendale california headquartered in canton mass baskinrobbins is part of the dunkin’ brands inc family of companies it claims to be the worlds largest ice cream franchise with more than  locations  of which are located in the united states baskinrobbins sells ice cream in  countries including canada japan mexico bahrain the united kingdom the united arab emirates egypt saudi arabia australia the philippines thailand vietnam indonesia malaysia china bangladesh south korea india pakistan panama taiwan and the united arab emirates the baskin robbins story in india began in  when the first store opened in mumbai today it is spread across the country with more than  outlets in  cities baskin robbins also caters to other premium channels like star hotels leading airlines malls multiplexes and top retail chains across india baskin robbins is one of the diverse businesses of the graviss foods pvt ltd it has an exclusive franchise for the saarc region our brand analysis is subjected to strategies of baskin robbins in india only but the brand has a global presence where it maintains a similar brand strategy yet with some small differences  ice cream industry in india the ice cream market growth in india picked up after dereservation of the sector in  of the total size of rs bn around  is in the hands of organized sector valued at rs bn rest all is with the unorganized sector the indian government adopted a lot of policy changes for the liberalization regarding the ice cream industry also and it is since then that this sector has shown an annual growth ranging from   per annum for last   year in the budget  excise duty has been waived off on ice creams in rural areas kulfis  ice creams made by small  cottage industry are popular the market for organized sector is restricted to large metropolitan cities in small towns and villages there are chapter introduction thousands of small players who produce ice creams  kulfis in their home backyard and cater to the local market almost  of the ice creams sold in the country are consumed in the western region with mumbai being the main market followed by  in the north and  in the south   baskin robbins  a brand analysis september  in india the ice cream industry is dominated by a few players this has made the global giants look at india to drive their growth american icecream retailer snowberry has announced that it would invest  million by  to start its business in india to be known as snowberry india private limited the sale of ice cream in india is seasonal and the ice cream makers always bet on the summer sales for amul the summer season contributing about  per cent of the companys overall sales furthermore to take advantage of the demand during summer the ice cream makers increase the price of the products marginally most of the companies are adding that new and innovative products that keep the consumers excited  segmentation and branding the major volume growth for branded icecream players will come from the takehomesegment rather than consumption at icecream boutiques and parlours this is the key inference of a survey conducted by retail research india rri the survey attributes this shift in consumer priority to the fact that icecream eating is becoming more of a weekend pastime for families rather than a leisure activity during outstation trips or picnics the consumer perception audit reveals that branded icecreams as a product category is now being perceived as a product for the family rather than just as an indulgence during outing exercises in terms of leveraging brand presence the branded icecream players need to focus more on innovative retail initiatives like pointofsale merchandising and danglers to attract consumer attention the retail initiatives need to be given priority in comparison to the usual brand promotion exercise that is carried out in the massmedia the icecream players have to confront secondary competition in the form of branded chocolates and biscuits along with that they also face competition from unbranded icecream players who operate on mobile cart wheelsit is believed that as a strategy to combat competition from products across the impulse segment the need is to have innovative modes of merchandising that can enhance the display value for icecream brands consumers from the impulse market make a consumption choice on the basis of the instant attention that brands can grab by their innovative displayfurther with clutter in the mass media such initiatives at the shop floor level can play the dual role of initiating brand awareness as well as triggering consumption for the brand chapter introduction with secondary competitors from the branded players segment undertaking mega retail exercises branded icecream players will start witnessing consumer lapse if they are unable to consolidate their retail presence   baskin robbins  a brand analysis september  also in terms of leveraging the brand through icecream parlours and vending machines there is the need to communicate the propositions through neon posters and vinyl signage especially at specific consumer eating spots it is believed that some of the players may use such communication exercises outside the parlours but the need is to strategically evaluate consumer congregation points the retail material should communicate the brand proposition through these materials at strategically evaluated points since it can capture the consumers’ eye more than the usual exteriors of retail shops and icecream outletseven in these avenues there are a host of other products that are jostling for consumer attention hence the need is to move away from these crowded venues in parlours and retail shelves and specifically communicate the brand proposition in the spots where there is less fragmentation yet a lot of consumer activity thats why like kwality walls amul too wants to take its frozen and ambient platter on the road through push carts and smaller outlets it plans to supply freezers to bakeries and chemists to mom andpop shops and even std booths even hll has been trying hard to create excitement around its brands its kwality walls max for children was relaunched with offerings like rainbow and twister supported by a new look max lion  new segments between kids and youth on the streets and adults at home a large chunk of ice cream sales gets taken care of impulse purchase from youth and kids accounts for  per cent of the market family consumption adds another  per cent fifteen per cent of the market is inparlour sale — a new segment that has showed up in the last few years this is dominated by niche regional players like naturals in the west nirula’s in the north and premium players like baskin robbins and the home grown italiano gelato  mnc in india the reason that the mncs indicate for their presence in india is “it has the right climate for ice cream consumption the country has a very low per capita consumption which means large untapped potential and our ability to maintain competitive pricing  all these reasons make us want to be in india but mnc weren’t successful in india mainly due to the pricing pressure and margin squeeze despite chapter introduction being a hot country with a young population india has never made icecream culture its own unlike in the west   baskin robbins  a brand analysis september   infrastructure worries there are genuine problems too since the demand for ice cream is seasonal and it also requires specific infrastructure any retailer with a tub full of ice can sell soft drinks but for ice cream he has to have proper refrigeration for that one requires proper power supply which is erratic in india transporting ice cream across india requires massive infrastructure because of which “supplies over long distances are irregular”  consumption pattern the market for icecreams in india was estimated at us million in – growing at the rate of – per cent however the per capita consumption of icecream in india is relatively low when compared to developed countries per capita consumption of icecream is around  ml per annum as against  litres in the us  litres in australia  litres in sweden and  litres in the ukthe per capita consumption of icecreams in india is a paltry  ml per annum while the average global consumption is  litres  ice cream flavours indian ice cream market can be segmented in three different ways namely on the basis of flavours on the basis of stock keeping units  packaging and on the basis of consumer segments on the basis of flavours the market today has a number of flavours like vanilla strawberry chocolate mango chapter introduction butterscotch a number of fruit flavours dry fruit flavours traditional flavours like kesar pista kaju draksh etc the market is totally dominated by vanilla strawberry and chocolate which together account for more than  of the market followed by butterscotch and other fruit flavours   baskin robbins  a brand analysis september   distribution channel ice cream distribution in india typically involves a distributor wholesaler and retailer most domestic brands have small regional operations with plants situated near their major markets due to the lack of costeffective cold chain facilities national brands have owned or leased cold storage facilities in major metropolitan areas which ship to distributors or direct to retailers some major brands have begun serving smaller cities by acquiring smaller plants and improving distribution networks distributors margins are about  there are an estimated  retail ice cream outlets in india including both fixed shops and mobile vendors  pushcarts tricycles and threewheelers chapter introduction   baskin robbins  a brand analysis september   competitor analysis  competitors on a telephonic conversation the zonal managersouth of baskin robbins mr muthukumar told us that baskin robbins doesn’t have any direct competition as they are a premium player he also told us that theirs is not a volume based business but he also accepted the fact that there is indirect competition from domestic brands and other local parlours let us have a look at the competition in india for baskin robbins hindustan unilever which is owned  per cent by unilever has a  per cent share of the  million litres and rs crore per annum ice cream market which makes it the second largest player after amul  per cent market share the gap is no less than  percentage points chart market share of ice cream brands in india market leader amul has a huge emotional connection with indian consumers as it was the nerve centre of the white revolution in india its ice cream is available in no less than  stores across the country — a number it plans to raise to  in the next one year its growth target for the year is  per cent the market has grown at  per cent per annum in the last five years vadilal the third largest player in the ice cream market with a share of  per cent and a strong player in western india maharashtra goa and gujarat has drawn up aggressive growth plans chapter competitor analysis mother dairy market share eight per cent has fanned out from its stronghold of north india to the eastern and western parts of the country in the last few years its strength is the  pushcarts out on the streets of the country at all times as a large category of consumers buy ice cream on impulse this fleet has helped mother dairy grow  per cent this summer mother dairy by the   baskin robbins  a brand analysis september  way has developed a strong portfolio of local flavours which could work well in the upcountry markets  competition in parlours with the advent of modern trade baskin robbins now covers  modern retail stores along with its retail foot print of  outlets baskin robbins will add  retail outlets during the year and also grow our modern trade footprint modern trade now contributes to  per cent of their overall revenues and they see this growing to  per cent in the next couple of years baskin robbins has established its leadership in the premium ice cream category in the modern trade channel but competition is in no mood to give up without a fight amul too entered the segment this year with its scooping parlours where it serves sundaes thick shakes and an exclusive range of ice cream it plans to have  franchises by the end of the financial year up from the current  and thereon add  every year for the next five years and expects retail to contribute to  per cent of amul’s ice cream revenue in the next three to five years  changing times across the world consumers have turned healthconscious they want to cut down calorie intake because of the alarming spread of lifestyle ailments and india is no different — it has the largest population of diabetics anywhere in the world consumers have begun to look for health and goodness in whatever they consume and ice cream is no exception baskin robbins offers  vegetarian ice creams and it also offers low fat ice creams too here the lead has been taken by amul it has developed a portfolio on the health and wellness platform with its probiotic and sugarfree category last year its sugarfree probiotic frozen food contains  per cent less fat and half the calories than normal ice cream “we expect this category to account for ten per cent of the ice cream market in the next three years” says sodhi hindustan unilever too has got in to the act this year with the launch of its selection range which comes with just  calories in  ml this in fact is a segment where the company can draw on the chapter competitor analysis expertise of its parent unilever with growing health consciousness heartbrand is developing products that are lower in fat sugarfree lactosefree as well as lowcarb options and those with more nutritional goodies like calcium and fruit it has come out with new pack sizes which allow lower consumption about  per cent of the research budget goes to enhance properties of health and wellness clearly there is nothing better than a wellstocked parent   baskin robbins  a brand analysis september   customer analysis baskin robbins is one of the premium ice cream brands in the world its differentiating strategy from other ice cream brands or their brand identity is providing customers with  different varieties of flavour and its premium quality but how the customers perceive the brand is different and was evaluated by an interview process around thirty customers were interviewed who had already experienced or come across the brand also two us customers were included in these twenty customers we went for an interview process because we found that many had only an aided recollection of the brand when asked about it the questions asked during the interview are a how often do you have ice cream in a month b how do you experience having ice cream in baskin robbins store c in your opinion what attribute is differentiating baskin robbins from other ice cream brands d did you ever come across the brand name in some promotions or ads or any other communication medium e what will come to your mind immediately if you hear the name baskin robbins some of the inferences and key opinions extracted from this process are most of the customers want ice cream parlour or store to be a better hang out place they would like to have ice creams with different flavours during chat with their colleagues or girl friends and spend some time in a high end sophisticated premium parlours they consider tasting a variety of ice creams as a great experience the key insight derived from probing the customers is “i want to taste unique treats in a premium ambience” baskin robbins’ proposition fits into this customer insight but after the analysis we found that they provide premium offerings with different world class flavours but not the experience customers who go there for repeat purchase is due to the addiction to the flavour taste but in providing experience of having ice cream in their parlour is really pathetic most of the customers don’t value chapter customer analysis the store as a premium store which baskin robbins claims some of the attributes which customers think of baskin robbins are premium young feminine an influence from pink colours they project soft tender and different flavours customers would like to take young colleagues or girlfriends who are very peppy to this ice cream store even though this brand lives for more than sixty years they maintain youthfulness in the brand which is amazing the   baskin robbins  a brand analysis september  essence which customers expect from the brand is that “different premium offerings daily” customers want to show or communicate to the world that they are different and premium communication happens when the customer meets the brand it came out that there is not frequent communication in the form of tv ads or print ads or any other promotions it’s mostly by word of mouth and the purchasing point store where the customers come across this brand before coming to the store customers make up their mind to try different taste daily and hang out in the store which is premium they communicate that they are different but store is lacking a premium ambience this goes in a negative way of communication to the customer most of the store is located in high class residential area customers think baskin robbins did not leverage in terms of store ambience as most of the stores are so cramped and do not have a place to sit and have the ice cream this is a sort of negative communication which should be immediately addressed since other ice cream brands have started eyeing the modern retail format chapter customer analysis   baskin robbins  a brand analysis september   communication strategy baskin robbins is a youthful dynamic brand and they are open to good ideas if theres a property or event or opportunity that has the potential to capture the fancy of todays generation they are ready to advertisesponsor the outlets sport a funky and vibrant look to attract young people in india apart from the sales of ice creams baskin robbins enjoys great patronage among high end institutional clients ranging from the best fivestar hotels in the country to the premier airlines high end retailers corporate parks and campuses cruise companies the best restaurants and clubs and of late all the multiplexes which is fast becoming a separate business channel in this country around  of their sales are from institutional sales in the coming years the brand plans to aggressively penetrate into the smaller towns apart from consolidating its present market in the major cities and metros  promotions  the spiderman  campaign the summer of  witnessed an innovative tieup of baskin robbins with spiderman  movie in india baskin robbins promoted spiderman  by means of a creative promotion this not only added visibility but also enhanced customer interactivity with the brand the highlight of the promotion was the cobranded tvc which was aired on key kids’ channels the promotion extended to creating three new trendy flavours keeping in tune with the characters of the movie web slinger sand storm and green gobbler the elements of the promotion included poster standee cup design bags tshirts tags shelf talker and a spiderman  comic free with every single scoop of ice cream  the paanchvi pass campaign baskin robbins successfully captured the attention of the kids by entering into a tieup with ‘paanchvi pass’ a popular reality show telecast in  by star plus and hosted by shahrukh khan a special paanchvi pass flavour was created chapter communication strategy to make it appealing to the customers and add excitement to the entire campaign a gift was assured to any customer who walked into the store and purchased a panchvi paas flavour and  lucky draw winners got a chance to meet the biggest bollywood star shahrukh khan the promotion helped star plus take its message to niche audience across the country the activity provided tremendous on ground visibility for star plus and baskin robbins in terms of wall visuals tent cards   baskin robbins  a brand analysis september  danglers posters tshirts cups shelf talkers and a quiz book besides it got good publicity and generated enthusiasm among the kids  the drona campaign baskin robbins has become an attractive partner for production houses to promote movies better among its target audiencethe youth this is done by means of appealing visuals and colorful displays like banners posters standees etc drona a magical adventure movie based on the warrior ‘drona’ tied up with baskin robbins to promote the movie among the teenagers visual displays for the promotion of the movie using baskin robbins as a brand included posters standees bags shelftalker drop box and banner cappuccino nibs was named the drona flavour also known as the flavour of magic to get the touch and feel of the movie the drona promotion gives kids across the country a chance to meet abhishek bachchan through a lucky draw  mtv roadies  mtv roadies a cult following among youth has now associated with baskin robbins for promotion of the programme and for the integration of the brand with its content the promotion makes a lot of sense for both the brands because the target audience of roadies is synonyms with the target audience for baskin robbins the audition promotion was done in selected cities in india where the roadies audition was carried outmumbai delhi bangalore kolkatta ahemdabad chandigarh jtq‘jump the queue’ passes were given to those lucky draw winners who purchased baskin robbins ice cream worth rs  promotion was done through posters banners standees and the jtq passes interactive games during the auditions were incorporated which included wild games centered on ice cream  the love story  campaign the movie was unique in the sense that for the first time introduced the time machine concept in the indian film industry and therefore there was a big hype around the movie baskin robbins built on this hype and therefore associated chapter communication strategy itself with love story  the publicity for the movie was done using posters standees banners and shelf talkers the flavour was called the  flavour with a taglinethe taste of the future is here the promotion offered a chance to the lucky draw winners to meet the debutant actor harmen baweja and priyanka chopra and a chance to win a boo a character from the movie with every  flavour   baskin robbins  a brand analysis september   other promos  baskin robbins national level junior cricket s tournament  ‘yo yo masters road show’ for delhi’s children and adults organised by cartoon network enterprises was held in baskin robbins store in connaught place delhi on july   sponsored lucky coupons for ‘monsoon masti’ festival organized by rajiv gandhi international airport limited hyderabad held on july   distributed free passes for “amaze ” bschool fest organised by the indian institute of planning and management iipm in bangalore  sold tickets for rock concert rock ’n india designed along the lines of international rock festivals held in bangalore in march   recently in march  pizza hut  baskin robbins launched an offer that provides pizza hut patrons an opportunity to sample a range of baskin robbins ice creams on placing pizza delivery orders  change in communication strategy the eventsmovies sponsored by baskin robbins have been not so effective in creating visibility for the brand this is because the brand seems to get lost in the array of other brands sponsoring the events say in launch of spiderman  baskin robbins was one among  brands to sponsor also when sponsoring mtv roadies we felt that the brand doesn’t communicate its value properly because roadies is an adventure reality show which depicts a tough person which is opposite to that of baskin robbins’ core identity of fun and soft tender nature conveyed by the brand as such from our interviews we found that around  people had only an aided recollection of the brand all these interviewees would rightly fit into the target segment of baskin robbins also we inferred that almost invariably all our interviewees never had any other interaction with the brand apart from the stores so the brand has to enhance its visibility through strategic advertising and promotions where it could reach its target segment better frequently interesting thing that came up was that baskin robbins has strong customer retention but new customer acquisition is not much only wordof chapter communication strategy mouth publicity has made the brand growing at least in the southern parts of india also we would want the brand to communicate its premium status in all its touch points with the customer please have a look at the following photograph of a bill given at a baskin robbins kiosk in forum mall bangalore the bill is handwritten and is not even a printed one as a customer of a premium brand we would really feel bad when such an experience occurs though this might seem irrelevant on a side we have to acknowledge a fact that the customer goes for a premium brand with some expectations it is these small things like these which give the customer the brand’s identity   baskin robbins  a brand analysis september  chapter communication strategy a photograph of bill given at a baskin robbins kiosk at forum mall bangalore   baskin robbins  a brand analysis september   brand baskin robbins from the customer analysis communication strategy and the telephonic conversation had with the zonal managersouth of baskin robbins we conclude with the following  brand strategy trends few trends that favour the brand strategy in india are  increasing disposable income of young indians  increasing health consciousness of indianslow fat ice creams vegetarian ice creams customer motivations the customer motivations that could support the growth of the brand are  flavours unique to baskin robbins  i want to be seen as a premium consumer  i need variety in my life  brand positioning “taste different flavours everyday”baskin  robbins the younger generation in india now seek variety in their fast paced lives they want to try something new every day positioning baskin robbins in the minds of such consumers would be easy and effective for the brand we suggest to have a bridged positioning of baskin robbins means treat  brand personality product related characteristics softtender user imagery fun loving youth  children sponsorships events that attract today’s generation youth  children age  years  still young symbol baskin robbins logorich  inviting  brand identity chapter brand baskin robbins core identity variety in flavours  percent vegetarian quality the zonal manager whom we interviewed said that baskin robbins focuses on providing very high quality ice creams that even a  months old baby can consume it without any harm extended identity ambience of storesparlours packaging regional flavours   baskin robbins  a brand analysis september   value proposition “where the fun is unending  flavour is king” the value proposition is strongly supported by the offerings from baskin robbins just there needs to be an improvement in store ambience to provide that “fun” element  brand logo evolution the brand logo has evolved over the years without losing out its core identity of the “original  flavours” chapter brand baskin robbins   baskin robbins  a brand analysis september   conclusion baskin robbins is doing well with excellent quality offerings all that has to be changed is the communication strategybaskin robbins has to create more touchpoints for the prospective customers to interact with the brand but caution has to be taken that the premium brand doesn’t get depicted as a mass market brand selective advertisements in premium magazines lifestyle television channels malls airports etc would do well the brand can position itself as a premium alternative to other mass market brands like kwality walls vadilal amul etc also more visibility can be created by maintaining premium ice cream parlours with excellent ambience that would generate wordofmouth the most powerful form of positioning the brand chapter conclusion   baskin robbins  a brand analysis september   references  mr muthukumar zonal managersouth baskin

new brand of mindfulness mind  meaning the new brand of mindfulness posted by kerry song have you had any experience with eastern philosophy or have you ever been to a yoga class actually have you ever just browsed through instagram then chances are you’ve heard the word “mindful” perhaps many times it’s use has grown tremendously over the past decade with a sharper increase starting about  years ago but what exactly does it mean to be mindful like many definitions it all depends on who you ask for some it’s about living in a meditative state that is one that is thoughtful and calm for others it’s more about being present and not judging others in the world around you but the common thread that runs through every definition is that mindfulness is an ideology for me the importance is about putting that ideology into action and doing so in a way that is practical because ethos and ideology are the perfect backdrop to living in a beautiful state but if you don’t have conventional ways to apply it to everyday life then it’s all for naught so what is the conventional wisdom for practicing mindfulness how do you apply it to everyday life try asking yourself these simple questions and you’ll begin to see how making such small shifts in your life can lead to big results what’s in your medicine cabinet open your medicine cabinet and take a look at the products you use on a daily basis do you know what their ingredient list is do you know where they come from or how they were made it’s easy to shop blindly – to purchase a product based on the prominence of the brand or the appeal of the label but so many of the sprays makeup gels lotions and formulas we are putting on our bodies on a regular basis may actually be doing more harm than good toxins and chemicals are a big part of the problem from parabens to phthalates and aluminum the chemicals used in a number of common health products are leeching into our bodies and wreaking havoc know what is in your shampoo find out what your shower gel and shaving cream are made out of that lotion you use to moisturize – does it have any harmful chemicals what about your deodorant or your lipstick or aftershave you can also be mindful by asking what went into developing the product you are using sadly despite the big steps we’ve made in the past  years to reduce animaltesting an inhumane practice that perpetuates suffering a number of companies still use it i personally do not want to purchase a product that in any way supports this cruelty i want to live in a world that chooses compassion and kindness over anything else so i choose brands that are in alignment with those values as well you can find out which companies do not use animal testing here where does your food come from this part of mindfulness isn’t about restriction or reduction and it’s not about saying “be mindful of that piece of cake you are eating ask yourself if you are really hungry or are trying to comfort yourself” while i can appreciate the ideology behind that sometimes you just want to indulge everything in moderation right this is about knowing what is in your food and where it comes from are you eating processed food loaded with additives and preservatives or are you nourishing your body with whole foods that are truly clean are you buying organic and local or are your foods treated with pesticides make it a point to read the ingredients label and take note of what you are putting into your body this will make you more intuned with your habits and patterns and help you make better decisions when it comes to how you fuel and energize your body what does your body need exercise should be a vital part of your day even if only for  minutes it not only has a number of wellknown physical benefits it can also enhance your mental and emotional state but being mindful doesn’t mean pushing yourself to go allout on the treadmill or pressuring yourself to bike  miles when you are exhausted it means paying attention to your body and asking yourself what you really need when i need to energize myself i opt for a brisk run outside if cardio sounds like too much for my body that day but i still have energy i’ll choose a challenging yoga class or when i’m feeling a little more subdued and my body is asking for a recovery day i’ll take a walk then there are still some other days where stress and restlessness beg to be released with a really intense cardio session being mindful isn’t about forcing yourself to work out every day it’s about taking note of how your body feels and giving it what it needs make it a point to assess your physical state every morning not only will you become more in tune with your needs you will be able to take care of yourself in an entirely new way how do you feed your mind do you get news updates on your phone how often do you stream live news coverage on your computer does morning and evening news bookend your day while it’s important to be aware of what’s happening in the world around you it’s also important to be mindful of what type of news you are consuming odds are the news you are reading and listening to revolves around death destruction and devastation after all there’s a phrase about the news – “if it bleeds it leads” because bad news sells but it’s important to take note of what this constant exposure to violence and negativity is doing to your mental and emotional state british psychologist dr graham davey told the huffington post that exposure to negative and violent media could actually have longlasting psychological effects in fact davey maintains that “viewing negative news means that you’re likely to see your own personal worries as more threatening and severe and when you do start worrying about them you’re more likely to find your worry difficult to control and more distressing than it would normally be” tony tells us to constantly strive to feed our minds he tells us that every single day we must stand guard at the doors to our mind and take a proactive approach to what we allow in what’s wrong is always available but so is what’s right – educational podcasts biographies of great men and women personal development programs every opportunity you have whether it’s in the car on the way to work or unplugging  minutes before sleep opt to feed your mind with something that empowers educates and enlightens you will be amazed at what a difference it can make in the long run are you being compassionate with yourself be gentle with yourself there are enough external forces in the world that are simply out of our control and there is enough negativity to overcome without bringing it on ourselves yet so many of us are our own worst critics we see flaws when we look in the mirror we beat ourselves up for not having accomplished enough we get down on ourselves for not performing as well as we believe we should have but by focusing on the negative we only exacerbate the problem and by compounding the issue at hand we disempower ourselves take note of what you say to yourself when you look in the mirror take a moment to reflect on how hard you are on yourself and when you find yourself becoming your own worst enemy stop and make the mental shift immediately change your words thoughts and patterns into something positive and empowering by finding a new direction that is more productive you will find new opportunities for growth take care of yourself be gentle with your words your thoughts and your actions is it love or ego throughout the day be mindful of where your thoughts feelings words and actions are coming from ask yourself is this coming from my ego that is my need to be special better and unique or is it coming from a place of love if it is coming from a place of love then this is your authentic self is it love or is it ego this question can be applied for everything from why you want to pursue a certain goal to how you react when your partner does something you don’t agree with either way it will help you shed the layers that mask your authentic self and help you understand who you truly are on a more intimate level   header image  my good
