deal to sell the company he founded  texasbased hn distribution  to ricebran tech for an undisclosed sum  hn copacks natural products and supplements for internet retailers and multilevel marketers supplying customers in the us and overseas while ricebran has built a business around arresting the enzymatic reaction that causes raw rice bran a byproduct of ricemilling to deteriorate after milling such that it can stabilize the bran and produce valueadded ingredientsi’ve been working with natural products for  years and have never seen this kind of responsethe two companies started talking about getting together after orders of nutritional drinks formulated by hn using ricebran tech’s ingredients started to really take off said mcknight who will join ricebran tech’s senior management team after the deal goes through  “it makes sense we’re good at formulating delicious healthy natural products and ricebran has the raw materials we want to work with “i’ve been working with natural

protein content of the rice endosperm is more like we’ve seen real success lately for protein drinks and healthy fiber drinks the rice bran proteins blend really well with other proteins but also work alone said mcknight during ricebran techs latest quarterly earnings call ceo john short said “we’re never satisfied we want to grow much more and we want to grow faster but one of the things we’re seeing is that growth is faster in the human ingredient side of the business than in the animal nutrition side of the business” “we’ve seen real success lately for protein drinks and healthy fiber drinks but there is also a lot of interest in fiberprotein combinations and lots of opportunities in bars shots energy drinks and other readytodrink beverages”short said the deal to acquire hn “not
