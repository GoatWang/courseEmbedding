breithorn capital management delivers letter to the board of directors of kulicke  soffa breithorn capital management delivers letter to the board of directors of kulicke  soffa industries outlining recommendations for unlocking significant shareholder value dec    et from breithorn capital management llc historical klic share price vs net cash per share     facebook twitter pinterest historical klic share price vs net cash per share new york dec   prnewswire  breithorn capital management breithorn a private investment manager and long term shareholder of kulicke  soffa industries ks or the company nasdaq klic with beneficial ownership of approximately  of the companys outstanding common stock announced that it has delivered a letter to the companys board of directors in the letter breithorn expressed that it believes ks is deeply undervalued and that there are clear opportunities for the company to unlock significant value for shareholders breithorn also stated that it believes the company should not make additional acquisitions and instead should immediately focus on further share repurchases the full text of the letter follows  december  garrett e pierce chairman kulicke and soffa industries inc a serangoon north avenue   ks corporate headquarters singapore  dear members of the board breithorn capital management breithorn beneficially owns approximately  of the outstanding shares of kulicke  soffa industries inc ks or the company breithorn is a valueoriented investment manager with a longterm investment horizon and has been a shareholder of ks since april  we have conducted extensive research on ks and the markets in which it competes and we appreciate the time and cooperation of the ks management team during the process we have concluded that the companys stock trades at a deep discount to its intrinsic value we believe this is due in part to misconceptions by investors regarding the companys core wire bonding business and to lack of appreciation for the companys growth potential in advanced packaging however we suspect that investors are also applying a valuation discount due to a lack of confidence in the ability of management and the board of directors board to allocate capital in an optimal manner in this regard we believe a clear opportunity exists within the companys control to unlock significant shareholder value in our opinion ks is a very attractive business given its dominant market share in wire bonding equipment and high historical returns on invested capital over the cycle as we shared in our presentation dated october   wwwbreithorncom we estimate the company currently has normalized earnings power of approximately  per share in addition we think it has significant growth potential in the advanced packaging market specifically we believe the companys new thermocompression products could ultimately generate an incremental  of earnings per share separately ks has a massively overcapitalized balance sheet as of the fiscal year ended october   the company held  million of net cash management estimates that the company requires an operating cash balance of only  million to run the business and manage downcycles this implies that the company holds excess cash of  million or  per share which amounts to  of its current market capitalization we believe ks stock is currently trading far below its intrinsic value after subtracting  per share of excess cash from the stock price of  ks trades at a mere x our normalized earnings power estimate for the existing business and x our estimated earnings power including growth from thermocompression given the high quality of this business we believe the fair value for ks stock is nearly double its current price ks stock has a depressed valuation for several reasons first we believe there is an unfounded fear that the companys core business is in secular decline the concern is that wire bonding the dominant interconnection technology used in semiconductor packaging for over  years will be supplanted by newer alternatives such as flip chip bonding we see little evidence that wire bonding is in decline wire bonding continues to grow on an absolute basis and maintains a dominant unit market share of roughly  due to significant cost advantages which we expect will persist in the future accordingly we are convinced that the companys recently reported yearoveryear decline in wire bonding equipment sales is cyclical rather than secular second we believe the companys stock price does not reflect its growth opportunity in advanced packaging  the company has established a broad foothold in the advanced packaging and advanced surface mount technology markets which could enable growth in excess of the semiconductor capital equipment market furthermore ks has developed a next generation thermocompression bonder that compares favorably to the competition based on our research together we believe these initiatives have the potential to significantly expand the companys earnings power and mitigate the risk of market share loss in the wire bonding business  third we believe the stock price does not adequately reflect the value of the companys excess cash in our opinion this is due to a pervasive fear that management will either squander this cash on poor acquisitions or indefinitely hoard cash without good reason as the chart below illustrates over the last  years the companys share price has exhibited only modest appreciation despite significant earnings power improvement and dramatic cash accumulation management deserves credit for excellent operational execution during this period as ks market share in wire bonding has increased and profit margins have expanded in contrast the companys approach to capital allocation has left much to be desired photo  httpphotosprnewswirecomprnh regarding capital allocation management has repeatedly expressed that its primary focus is on making acquisitions for reasons including diversification we strongly disagree with this approach given the risk of capital misallocation and lack of attractive targets moreover we do not believe that managements acquisition track record inspires confidence while it is too early to definitively assess the recent  million acquisition of assembléon netherlands bv assembléon early results are not encouraging the posttransaction decline in assembléons revenue runrate suggests that this acquisition was poorly timed and that stated earnings accretion and revenue growth goals will not be achieved if management is intent on diversifying the business we see ample opportunity to do so through organic growth of the companys broad product line given the current valuation of ks we think it is extremely unlikely that any acquisition could generate a return comparable to repurchasing the companys depressed shares and we struggle to understand why management and the board have not acted more aggressively to unlock value for shareholders by doing so perhaps if management and the board owned more than a trivial amount of the companys stock they would be better aligned with the interests of shareholders who have endured subpar returns for years we believe further large share repurchases would be in the best interest of shareholders in our view ks has the capacity to repurchase  million in stock without impairing its financial position or strategic flexibility to avoid repatriation taxes on foreign cash repurchases could be funded with debt raised in the us as we illustrated in our presentation we believe that at the current share price this would result in immediate earnings accretion and stock price appreciation without assuming any multiple expansion separately we believe multiple expansion is likely once management demonstrates improved capital allocation discipline another option for the board to consider is a sale of the company to a strategic buyer with foreign operations not subject to repatriation taxes who can pay full value for the companys cash this could achieve managements goal of diversification in a more shareholderfriendly manner provided that an acquirer pays a very large premium to the current share price to offer fair value to existing shareholders we anticipate ks will become an increasingly attractive acquisition candidate as its new advanced packaging products gain traction we look forward to hearing back from management and the board regarding their plan to unlock shareholder value in ks sincerely breithorn capital management
