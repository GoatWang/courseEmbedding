consider the following risk factors and the factors set forth under risk factors in the accompanying prospectus in deciding whether to purchase the notes of any class payment priorities increase risk of loss or delay in payment to certain notes based on the priorities described under the notes payments of interest and the notes payments of principal in this prospectus supplement classes of notes that receive payments particularly principal payments before other classes will be repaid more rapidly than the other classes in addition because principal of each class of notes will be paid sequentially so long as no event of default has occurred classes of notes that have higher ie  being higher than  sequential numerical class designations will be outstanding longer and therefore will be exposed to the risk of losses on the receivables during periods after other classes have been receiving most or all amounts payable on their notes and after which a disproportionate amount of credit enhancement may have been applied and not replenished because of the priority of payment on the notes the yields of the class a notes the class a notes and the class a notes will be relatively more sensitive to losses on the receivables and the timing of those losses than the class a notes accordingly the class a notes will be relatively more sensitive to losses on the receivables and the timing of those losses than the class a notes the class a notes will be relatively more sensitive to losses on the receivables and the timing of those losses than the class a notes and the class a notes and the class a  notes will be relatively more sensitive to losses on the receivables and the timing of those losses than the class a notes the class a notes and the class a notes if the actual rate and amount of losses exceed your expectations and if amounts in the reserve account are insufficient to cover the resulting shortfalls the yield to maturity on your notes may be lower than anticipated and you could suffer a loss classes of notes that receive payments earlier than expected are exposed to greater reinvestment risk and classes of notes that receive principal later than expected are exposed to greater risk of loss in either case the yields on your notes could be materially and adversely affected credit scores and historical loss experience may not accurately predict the likelihood of losses on the automobile loans information regarding credit scores for the automobile loans obtained at the time of origination of the related receivables is presented in the receivables characteristics of the receivables general in this prospectus supplement a credit score purports only to be a measurement of the relative degree of risk a borrower represents to a lender ie that a borrower with a higher score is statistically expected to be less likely to default in payment than a borrower with a lower score neither the depositor the sponsor nor any other party makes any representations or warranties as to any obligor s current credit score or the actual performance of any receivable or that a particular credit score should be relied upon as a basis for an expectation that a receivable will be paid in accordance with its terms recently the united states has experienced a period of economic slowdown that may adversely affect the performance and market value of your notes rising unemployment and the continued lack of availability of credit may lead to increased default rates this period may be accompanied by decreased consumer demand for automobiles and declining values of automobiles securing outstanding automobile loan contracts which weakens collateral coverage and increases the s amount of a loss in the event of default significant increases in the inventory of used automobiles during periods of economic slowdown may also depress the prices at which repossessed automobiles may be sold or delay the timing of these sales while certain economic factors have improved recently other factors such as unemployment have not yet improved if the economic downturn worsens or continues for a prolonged period of time delinquencies and losses with respect to automobile loans generally could increase again see prepayments delinquencies repossessions and net credit losses delinquency repossession and credit loss information and static pool information in this prospectus supplement for delinquency and loss information regarding certain automobile loans originated and serviced by nissan motor acceptance corporation geographic concentration of the states of origination of the receivables may increase the risk of loss on your investment as of the statistical cutoff date nissan motor acceptance corporation s records indicate that the addresses of the originating dealers of the receivables were most highly concentrated in the following states percentage of aggregate statistical cutoff date principal balance texas  california  florida  new york  illinois  no other state based on the addresses of originating dealers accounted for more than  of the total principal balance of the receivables as of the statistical cutoff date economic conditions or other factors affecting these states in particular could adversely affect the delinquency credit loss repossession or prepayment experience of the issuing entity prepaid simple interest contracts may affect the weighted average life of the notes if an obligor on a simple interest contract makes a payment on the contract ahead of schedule the weighted average life of the notes could be affected this is because the additional payment will be treated as a principal prepayment and applied to reduce the principal balance of the related contract and the obligor will generally not be required to make any scheduled payments during the period for which it has paid ahead during this prepaid period interest will continue to accrue on the principal balance of the contract as reduced by the application of the additional payment but the obligor s contract would not be considered delinquent while the servicer may be required to make interest advances during this period no principal advances will be made furthermore when the obligor resumes his required payments the payments so paid may be insufficient to cover the interest that has accrued since the last payment by the obligor this situation will continue until the regularly scheduled payments are once again sufficient to cover all accrued interest and to reduce the principal balance of the contract the payment by the issuing entity of the prepaid principal amount of the notes will generally shorten the weighted average life of the notes however depending on the length of time during which a prepaid simple interest contract is not amortizing as described above the weighted average life of the notes may be extended in addition to the extent the servicer makes advances on a prepaid s simple interest contract that subsequently goes into default the loss on this contract may be larger than would have been the case had advances not been made because liquidation proceeds for the contract will be applied first to reimburse the servicer for its advances nissan motor acceptance corporation s portfolio of retail installment contracts has historically included simple interest contracts that have been paid ahead by one or more scheduled monthly payments there can be no assurance as to the number of contracts in the issuing entity that may become prepaid simple interest contracts as described above or the number or the principal amount of the scheduled payments that may be paid ahead risk of loss or delay in payment may result from delays in the transfer of servicing due to the servicing fee structure you may suffer losses due to receivables with low annual percentage rates because the servicing fee is structured as a percentage of the principal balance of the receivables the amount of the servicing fee payable to the servicer may be considered insufficient by potential replacement servicers if servicing is required to be transferred at a time when much of the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the receivables has been repaid due to the reduction in the servicing fee as described in the foregoing it may be difficult to find a replacement servicer consequently the time it takes to effect the transfer of servicing to a replacement servicer under those circumstances may result in delays andor reductions in the interest and principal payments on your notes the receivables may include receivables that have annual percentage rates that are less than the interest rates on the notes if that is the case interest paid on the higher coupon receivables and collections related to the yield supplement overcollateralization amount will compensate for the lower coupon receivables excessive prepayments on the higher coupon receivables may adversely impact your notes by reducing the amount of interest available in the future to make payments on your notes a reduction withdrawal or qualification of the ratings on your notes or the issuance of unsolicited ratings on your notes could adversely affect the market value of your notes andor limit your ability to resell your notes the ratings on the notes are not recommendations to purchase hold or sell the notes and do not address market value or investor suitability the ratings reflect the rating agency s assessment of the creditworthiness of the receivables the credit enhancement on the notes and the likelihood of repayment of the notes there can be no assurance that the receivables andor the notes will perform as expected or that the ratings will not be reduced withdrawn or qualified in the future as a result of a change of circumstances deterioration in the performance of the receivables errors in analysis or otherwise none of the depositor the sponsor or any of their affiliates will have any obligation to replace or supplement any credit enhancement or to take any other action to maintain any ratings on the notes if the ratings on your notes are reduced withdrawn or qualified it could adversely affect the market value of your notes andor limit your ability to resell your notes the sponsor has hired two rating agencies and will pay them a fee to assign ratings on the notes the sponsor has not hired any other nationally recognized statistical rating organization or nrsro to assign ratings on the notes and is not aware that any other nrsro has assigned ratings on the notes however under newly effective sec rules information provided to a hired rating agency s for the purpose of assigning or monitoring the ratings on the notes is required to be made available to each nrsro in order to make it possible for such nonhired nrsros to assign unsolicited ratings on the notes an unsolicited rating could be assigned at any time including prior to the closing date and none of the depositor the sponsor the underwriters or any of their affiliates will have any obligation to inform you of any unsolicited ratings assigned after the date of this prospectus supplement nrsros including the hired rating agencies have different methodologies criteria models and requirements if any nonhired nrsro assigns an unsolicited rating on the notes there can be no assurance that such rating will not be lower than the ratings provided by the hired rating agencies which could adversely affect the market value of your notes andor limit your ability to resell your notes in addition if the sponsor fails to make available to the nonhired nrsros any information provided to any hired rating agency for the purpose of assigning or monitoring the ratings on the notes a hired rating agency could withdraw its ratings on the notes which could adversely affect the market value of your notes andor limit your ability to resell your notes potential investors in the notes are urged to make their own evaluation of the creditworthiness of the receivables and the credit enhancement on the notes and not to rely solely on the ratings on the notes lack of liquidity in the secondary market may adversely affect your notes the secondary market for assetbacked securities could be experiencing and may in the future experience significant reduced liquidity this period of illiquidity may continue and may adversely affect the market value of your notes see risk factors you may have difficulty selling your notes andor obtaining your desired price due to the absence of a secondary market in this prospectus supplement the rate of depreciation of certain financed vehicles could exceed the amortization of the outstanding principal amount of the loan on those financed vehicles which may result in losses there can be no assurance that the value of any financed vehicle will be greater than the outstanding principal amount of the related receivable new vehicles normally experience an immediate decline in value after purchase because they are no longer considered new as a result it is highly likely that the principal amount of the related receivable will exceed the value of the related vehicle during the earlier years of a receivable s term defaults during these earlier years are likely to result in losses because the proceeds of repossession are less likely to pay the full amount of interest and principal owed on the receivable the frequency and amount of losses may be greater for receivables with longer terms because these receivables tend to have a somewhat greater frequency of delinquencies and defaults and because the slower rate of amortization of the principal balance of a longer term receivable may result in a longer period during which the value of the financed vehicle is less than the remaining principal balance of the receivable the frequency and amount of losses may also be greater for obligors with little or no equity in their vehicles because the principal balances for such obligors are likely to be greater for similar loan terms and vehicles than for obligors with a more significant amount of equity in the vehicle additionally although the frequency of delinquencies and defaults tends to be greater for receivables secured by used vehicles the amount of any loss tends to be greater for receivables secured by new vehicles because of the higher rate of depreciation described above and the recent decline in used car prices especially lightduty truck and sport utility vehicles prices s you may have difficulty selling your notes andor obtaining your desired price due to the absence of a secondary market the issuing entity will not list the notes on any securities exchange therefore in order to sell your notes you must first locate a willing purchaser the absence of a secondary market for the notes could limit your ability to resell them currently no secondary market exists for the notes we cannot assure you that a secondary market will develop the underwriters intend to make a secondary market for the notes by offering to buy the notes from investors that wish to sell however the underwriters are not obligated to offer to buy the notes and may stop making offers at any time in addition the underwriters offered prices if any may not reflect prices that other potential purchasers would be willing to pay were they given the opportunity there have been times in the past where there have been very few buyers of assetbacked securities and thus there has been a lack of liquidity there may be similar lack of liquidity at times in the future the amounts received upon disposition of the financed vehicles may be adversely affected by discount pricing incentives marketing incentive programs and other factors as a result of the foregoing restrictions and circumstances you may not be able to sell your notes when you want to do so or you may not be able to obtain the price that you wish to receive discount pricing incentives or other marketing incentive programs on new cars by nissan north america inc or by its competitors that effectively reduce the prices of new cars may have the effect of reducing demand by consumers for used cars additionally the pricing of used vehicles is affected by the supply and demand for those vehicles which in turn is affected by consumer tastes economic factors including the price of gasoline the introduction and pricing of new car models and other factors the reduced demand for used cars resulting from discount pricing incentives or other marketing incentive programs introduced by nissan north america inc or any of its competitors or other factors may reduce the prices consumers will be willing to pay for used cars including vehicles that secure the receivables as a result the proceeds received by the issuing entity upon any foreclosures of financed vehicles may be reduced and may not be sufficient to pay the underlying receivables s the issuing entity general the nissan auto receivables a owner trust the issuing entity  is a delaware statutory trust governed in accordance with
