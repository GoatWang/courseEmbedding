alphasign in  join nowgo»media analytics corp this email promoted stock may leave investors in the dustdec  about media analytics meda investor protection association short onlysummarywe have received numerous emails touting meda from various stock promotersthe timing of the emails promoting meda coincides with what seems to be an abnormal rise in price and trading volume of the stockthe recent financials of the company appear to be very bleak due to zero revenue and negative incomeshares of the company have been issued for next to nothing and are ready to be dumped into the marketwe have contacted the company via email and are waiting for a response regarding the claims in the articlenote this article is about a nanocap stock also referred to as a penny stock while all investments are risky nanocap stocks are among the most risky among nanocap stocks the most risky stocks are those which are subject to promotional campaigns such as meda they are also among the most illiquid stocks usually having a large spread between the bid and offer at any given moment quite often it occurs that the illiquidity of these stocks does not allow a trader to rapidly close or open a position meda is no exception to that meda is a nanocap stock which is traded on the otc markets and priced well below the  mark the readers of this article should be highly aware of the aforementioned facts prior to undertaking any action based on the content of this article introduction media analytics corp otcpkmeda is a company trading at a price that has recently run from a low of  to a high of  during a single trading session in this article we will outline the facts which are in our opinion related to the sudden increase in the price and trading volume of this usually thinly traded low volume stock the promotion let us analyze the recent price action and trade volume of meda the trading volume and price of meda have both literally exploded on december  the date when the first promotional email was received it is quite obvious that the email being sent out and the sudden rise in volume and price of the stock are interconnected events emails received on meda meda chart editors note meda closed trading wednesday up  or  to close at  the reality zero revenue negative income bright future as often happens with aggressively promoted companies a glimpse at the balance sheet is often enough to reveal a grim and bleak picture it seems media analytics corp is no exception to that rule in our opinion it is clear that the price of meda has nothing in common with the stocks true value if we were to take a look at medas income statement we would see that the companys revenue has remained exactly zero while the companys income has been negative during the entire year of  moreover if we were to take a look at the latest q form filed on  we would see that shares of the company have previously been issued at nexttonothing prices  to insiders of the company with all these factors taken into account it should come as no surprise that according to the same q form filed on  the company is actually classified as a going concern and has accrued net losses since inception with all the attendant circumstances it is based on the aforementioned data that we firmly believe that medas current line of business involves having its shares promoted and sold at overinflated prices rather than delivering or attempting to deliver a true product to the market but why you ask the reason why would any company need to have its stock ticker advertised that is the most important question an investor should ask himself prior to buying a promoted stock the answer for this hides of course in the small print let us have a look at the disclaimer found in the promotional emails touting meda which weve received or or in simple plain english someone  maybe the promoter sending out the email message or a third party who might have paid the promoter in cash for sending the message  is holding shares of meda and plans to get rid of them dump them in the open market therefore our conclusion is that the promotional emails sole purpose was to have unsuspecting investors buy the stock at artificially heightened prices while the promoters or third party unload their shares upon them conclusion it is based on the aforementioned facts and analysis presented in this article we hold the opinion that meda shares are essentially worthless we believe that the recent increase in the price of the stock has been a direct result of email messages being sent out by stock promoters in massive quantities and touting investors to buy the stock this practice is well known see pump and dump and is done exclusively for one reason only  so the insiders can unload dump their shares which they had previously acquired for almost free in the free market onto unsuspecting investors while taking advantage of the stocks inflated price in view of that we hold the opinion that any investor who had purchased shares of the company should consider liquidating his entire position immediately even a small weakness in price could mean that the dump is nearing our view he that lives upon hope will die fasting  benjamin franklin for longs if you are long the stock we believe you should consider getting out immediately it is with full confidence we say that every upward movement in the stocks price is likely to be temporary as it will never repeat its previous highs we believe meda has a price target of around  which it is likely to reach in the upcoming weeks or months at most if you have already accrued losses on the stock it may be a good idea to sell now so as to avoid additional losses do not persuade yourself into thinking the stock price will come back to its previous highs do not have hope leaving you holding the bag as it has happened to far too many we believe medas stock price will drop  or more in the following weeks it may be the right decision to minimize your losses by selling now profit is sweet even if it comes from deception  sophocles for shorts bearing the aforementioned facts in mind we believe sophisticated investors will quickly comprehend the idea that shorting meda may be a lucrative opportunity as we are convinced that the potential downside for meda is substantial if you are able to locate borrows we believe shorting meda may prove to be profitable as its price may prove to be highly inflated disclosure the author has no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next  hours the author wrote
