lockup expiration  quiet period expiration  cik  we expect to receive total estimated net proceeds of approximately  million based on the initial public offering price after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses of this offering that are payable by us if the underwriters exercise their overallotment option in full we estimate that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately  million after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses of this offering that are payable by us as of june   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately  we currently expect that we will use the net proceeds from this offering together with a fully drawn down € million principal amount bridge financing we entered into on may   with nbfpii a fully drawn down  million principal amount additional bridge financing we entered into on august   with bvf forward an affiliate of bvf partners lp which is itself affiliated with certain of our principal shareholders and cash and cash equivalents on hand as follows • approximately  million for the clinical development of fp for the treatment of rrms • approximately  million to fund the exploitation and protection of our intellectual property rights including in connection with oppositions and interference cases • approximately  million for the clinical development of fp for the treatment of psoriasis • approximately  million for execution of our preclinical program for our manufacturing activities and for related phase  clinical trials and • the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes our expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our current intentions based upon our present plans and business condition where we expect to incur up to  million of costs associated with research and development in our fiscal year ending december   subject to timing of our development activities as of the date of this prospectus we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering or the amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above the amounts and timing of our actual use of net proceeds will vary depending on numerous factors including our ability to obtain additional financing the relative success and cost of our research preclinical and clinical development programs and whether we enter into collaborations with third parties in the future as a result management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds and investors will be relying on our judgment regarding the application of the net proceeds of this offering in addition we might decide to postpone or not pursue other clinical trials or preclinical activities if the net proceeds from this offering and our other sources of cash are less than expected at present we believe that the expected net proceeds of this offering the bridge financings we entered into on may   and august   and our current cash and cash equivalents will allow us to initiate a phase  clinical trial program for fp in rrms including the opening of approximately  investigational sites and the enrolment of approximately  subjects we further anticipate that the net proceeds would also enable us to complete the initial phase  trial in psoriasis however we anticipate that we will require substantial additional capital to complete our development activities in rrms and psoriasis we also anticipate that the net proceeds would be insufficient to allow for the market authorization and commercialization of fp we further note that it is difficult to predict our future liquidity requirements given the uncertainty around the requirements associated with the development and commercialization of new drugs and we could exhaust our capital resources earlier than we currently expect pending their use we plan to invest the net proceeds from this offering in short and intermediateterm interestbearing obligations and certificates of deposit we are engaged in segments of the pharmaceutical and biotechnological industries that are highly competitive and rapidly changing large pharmaceutical specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies academic institutions governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations are commercializing or pursuing the development of products that target immune disorders including the same diseases we are targeting if fp is approved for the treatment of rrms we expect it will face intense and increasing competition as new products enter the rrms markets and advanced technologies become available fp will face competition based on its safety and effectiveness the timing and scope of regulatory approvals the availability and cost of supply marketing and sales capabilities reimbursement coverage price patent position and other factors our competitors may succeed in developing competing products before we do obtaining regulatory approval for products or gaining broader acceptance in the ms market we are targeting we believe that our key competitor in the dmf space is biogen biogens tecfidera® was approved by the fda for the treatment of rrms on march   tecfidera® generated global sales of  billion from launch in april  through june   other companies have also developed alternative therapeutic approaches for the treatment of rrms these include novartis ag whose gilenya® is a once daily oral dose drug to treat rrms approved in september  and genzyme corporation a subsidiary of sanofi sa which developed aubagio® a rrms drug approved in september  we also face competition from potential new entrants into the rrms market for example receptos inc has a product candidate rpc in phase  testing which if successfully approved and launched would be a once daily oral treatment for rrms as we pursue the development of and fp is approved for the treatment of psoriasis we will similarly face intense competition in the psoriasis market this will include competition from products which have already been commercialized and have gained market acceptance as well as from products based on new and advanced technologies company description forward pharma as is a danish biopharmaceutical company preparing to initiate a phase  clinical trial using fp a proprietary formulation of dimethyl fumarate or dmf for the treatment of multiple sclerosis or ms patients since our founding in  we have worked to advance unique formulations of dmf an immune modulator as a therapeutic to improve the health and wellbeing of patients with immune disorders including ms fp our clinical candidate is a dmf formulation in a delayed and slow release oral dose which we plan to advance for the treatment of relapsing remitting ms or rrms and other immune disorders such as psoriasis our focus on dimethyl fumarate or dmf oral drugs employing dmf as an active pharmaceutical ingredient or api have been in use for over half a century today dmf is the api found in tecfidera® which biogen idec inc or biogen began selling for the treatment of rrms following approval by the us food and drug administration or fda in march  and approval by the european commission or ec in february  tecfidera® which is an oral dose of  mg of dmf daily  mg twice daily generated global sales from launch in april  through june   of  billion dmf is also an api found in fumaderm® which has been sold for the treatment of psoriasis since  in germany in  a private swedish company aditech pharma ab collectively with its successorininterest a swiss company aditech pharma ag or aditech controlled by nordic biotech general partner aps an affiliate of one of our largest shareholders assessed the potential for dmf to become a significant global product aditech specifically focused on the development of an innovative delayed and slow release formulation of dmf with the goal of limiting side effects typically associated with dmf treatment we were founded in  for the purpose of exploiting a patent family aditech filed relating to among other things its delayed and slow release formulation for dmf and in  we acquired this patent family from aditech under our agreements with aditech we obtained among other things aditechs patents and associated knowhow related to dmf formulations the patent family that we acquired from aditech included an international patent application filed on october   disclosing among other things formulations of dmf that provide for its slow release in the small intestine where we believe that dmf has its immunomodulatory impact this international application became the basis for a family of national patent applications which were subsequently filed relating to dmf two european patents one from the original aditech patent family and one from a patent family of ours involving erosion matrix formulations of dmf with a thin enteric coating have been granted and both are now the subject of opposition proceedings ie special proceedings heard by the european patent office or epo where one or more third parties request that the patent or a part thereof be revoked which have been instigated by multiple third parties in the us our erosion matrix patent application has been allowed and we have pending patent applications that we believe will soon be allowed ie will meet the statutory requirements of patentability one of which claims particular uptitration schedules eg increasing the dose over a specified number of weeks of using dmf to treat ms and the other of which claims treating ms using particular compositions containing dmf and that also specifies levels of a dmf metabolite called mono methyl fumarate or mmf in the bloodstream these claims are substantially the same as the respective claims in two other applications that the us patent and trademark office or uspto examiner recently found allowable but which we elected to abandon ie voluntarily requested to be irrevocably removed from the uspto docket of active patent applications in another of our patent applications us patent application no  the uspto examiner has found our claims directed to methods of treating ms using a  mg dose of dmf to be allowable and has recommended that an interference be declared against biogens us patent no  and a uspto official has indicated that we will be designated as the socalled senior party an interference is an administrative proceeding at the uspto that is used to determine which party is the first to invent a common invention claimed by the parties the party with the earliest effective filing date to the common invention is designated senior party and is entitled to the presumption that it is the first inventor once an interference has been suggested a supervisory examiner refers the suggested interference to the patent trial and appeal board or ptab an administrative patent judge at the ptab declares the interference and administers the proceeding during the interference each party can dispute the patentability of the other parties claims challenge the senior party designation and present proof of dates of invention prior to the effective filing date in an initial motions phase a three judge panel at the ptab decides the patentability and senior party issues raised and if that decision does not resolve the interference then after priority proofs are submitted in a second priority phase enters final judgment on priority ie who is first to invent on august   an administrative law judge at the ptab returned our us application no  to the patent examining group within the uspto or the examining group in which our uspto examiner is assigned based on an earlier discussion with a uspto official we believe the return is to address formal matters however we do not know whether the return has any accompanying communication to the examining group and we cannot rule out the possibility that the return was made for substantive reasons which may adversely affect delay or prevent our planned interference proceeding in order to assess fps safety profile for human use we have performed  preclinical studies on dmf since  gathering data through animal testing and in certain cases in vitro testing of dmf in cells on its pharmacological activity toxicity profile and on dosing level effects all preclinical studies apply to both ms and psoriasis development beginning in  we commenced a set of phase  clinical trials followed by a phase  clinical trial to investigate among other things safety and dosing tolerability of fp we have successfully completed all of these clinical studies collectively involving over  psoriasis patients and healthy volunteers and gathering substantial positive safety and dosing data importantly as of the date hereof we have conducted no clinical trials involving patients with ms to advance fp for use as a drug to treat rrms in the us we held a preinvestigational new drug or ind application meeting with the fda in august  prior to this preind meeting we submitted a briefing book to the fda which included our highlevel description of a proposed week phase  trial which we expect will include up to  rrms patients we intend to compare fp to an active beta interferon or ifn comparator drug the primary efficacy endpoint for the proposed phase  trial will be the annualized relapse rate or arr the key secondary efficacy endpoint will be the sustained accumulation of disability or sad based on repeated assessments of the expanded disability status scale or edss further secondary endpoints are based on magnetic resonance imaging or mri markers edss has been recognized by the ema as the most widely used and known scale to assess disability in rrms patients edss scores are measured periodically generally in intervals of three to six months based on a standard neurological examination of seven major functional systems and observations concerning gait and use of assistive devices edss is reported using a scale ranging from  to  in  unit increments that each represent higher levels of disability sad is defined as a specified increase from baseline in edss that persists for at least  weeks consistent with our preind meeting and submissions we filed our ind for rrms on april   and expect to be able to submit the protocol and draft statistical analysis plan or sap for our phase  study in the fourth quarter of  following completion of our planned phase  trial we intend to submit our nda for fp to treat rrms approval by the fda of a new drug application or nda is dependent on a number of factors a final decision as to whether the program we shared with the fda in advance of our preind meeting is sufficient for approval including the sufficiency of our proposed single phase  trial and whether a favorable effect on sad or other secondary endpoints will need to be demonstrated by us at the time of our nda submission can only be made by the fda once it has reviewed our full nda package we expect that patient enrollment for the phase  trial we are contemplating will take at least  months with completion of the final patients initial week treatment period after a total of  months when the last patient dosed has completed the week treatment period we expect that we will have a substantial number of patients with two years of data which we believe will allow us to complete an analysis of the effects of fp on sad which can be provided to the fda when we submit our nda as a result we believe that any requirement by the fda for data on edsssad will not delay a decision on whether to approve fp for the treatment of rrms we intend to submit our nda for fp to treat rrms under section b of the us federal food drug and cosmetic act or fdc act based on preclinical and clinical data we have and will have developed and independently own section b of the fdc act prescribes how a product may be submitted for approval by the fda as a new drug based on clinical trial data and other information independently developed and owned by the party making the nda submission or obtained from a thirdparty with a right of reference in europe we have held preliminary discussions concerning marketing authorization for fp in moderate to severe psoriasis with the federal institute for drugs and medical devices bundesinstitut für arzneimittel und medizinprodukte or bfarm in germany and more recently in november  held a scientific consultation on fp for the treatment of ms with the european medicines agency or ema we expect to apply for a european union or eu marketing authorization for fp to treat rrms we also intend to pursue the development of fp for the treatment of psoriasis and expect to commence a phase  clinical trial program for psoriasis including the commencement of dosing of patients by early   we are a danish public limited liability
