how to rebuild manufacturing this is a short speech given during the  conference on the renaissance of american manufacturing it  touches on many of the main themes of this section mercantilism manufacturing and a political problem  huffington post may  manufacturing often derided as a relic of the past is back in fashion however actually doing something to change the downward trajectory of american manufacturing will require overcoming a significant political problem making corporate actions visible huffington post march  this article describes the importance of the actions of major

trade on technical progress and the gains and losses from outsourcing with william j baumol oxford handbook of offshoring and global employment may  this is the published version of the new america leture “ricardo revisited” listed two paragraphs below trade education and innovation prospects for the us economy with william j baumol journal of policy modeling july   reliance on the doctrine of mutual gains from trade even in the face of mercantilist practices can be a significant mistake efforts to advance innovation without considering the retention of the economic activity and jobs created by the innovation will not ensure continued prosperity this calls for the rethinking of trade policy by the united states and other developed nations if they are to ensure continued economic growth ricardo revisited sinoamerican trade and economic conflict with william j baumol public lecture given at the new america foundation january   we describe what a very standard model the ricardo model shows about the impact on a developed nation such as the us of the economic development of a trading partner such as china we show that  there is a dominant and dominated relation possible between the two countries that is good for the dominant one and bad for the dominated one  a country can attain a dominant position either by having a naturally undeveloped trading partner or by mercantilist actions that destroy the partner’s industries  while a country cannot gain a dominant position solely by building up its industries it can avoid a dominated position by developing its own industries and not allowing them to be destroyed globalization country and company interests in conflict with william j baumol journal of policy modeling  the same theory that shows that free trade is beneficial also shows that globalization can be harmful to at least one of the trading countries moreover with globalization the interests of a country and its companies may diverge these conclusions emerge from some of the oldest and most time honored models in economics we identify some of the key policy issues that must be addressed in today’s interdependent world global trade and conflicting national interests book with william j baumol mit press cambridge ma  this book provides in a more accessible form many of the results on trade conflicts described below it deals with the conflicts that can appear in models with economies of scale and with those that can appear in models with linear production functions when countries change their productivities the book is divided into two parts the first for interested noneconomists and the second for economists national trade conflicts caused by productivity change the analysis with full proofs with william j baumol c v starr economic research report new york university november  rr   this combines in one report the central results on both economies of scale models and linear production models it contains the full proofs of these results in addition it provides several new results such as proving that the linear programming boundaries of the individual country regions have single peaks and obtaining exact formulas for the boundaries in many situations analysis of linear trade models and relation to scale economies with william j baumol proceedings of the national academy of sciences usa  vol   pp  we show that the exact boundary of the region of equilibria can be obtained by an integer programming calculation this result applies to models with small numbers of industries as well as to those having the large number of industries such as the models already discussed below it also describes the close connection of equilibria from a single economies model to the maximal productivity equilibria of a family of linear models productivity differences worldmarket shares and conflicting national interests in linear trade models with william j baumol japan and the world economy international journal of theory and policy elsevier science publishers bv north holland   pp  this paper amplifies and explains the nas proceedings note described below and shows that conflict in the interests of countries can arise with the usual linear production functions it uses the standard ricardo equilibrium model with linear productivities it obtains multiple equilibria by considering all productivities in the two trading countries that do not exceed some given technological limits we show that the resulting regions of equilibria have the same characteristic shape as those produced by economies of scale we discuss the inherent conflict in the interests of the two trading countries due to the fact that the best equilibria for one country are usually poor ones for its the trading partner inefficient and locally stable trade equilibria under scale economies comparative advantage revisited with william j baumol kyklos international review for social sciences switzerland  vol  fasc  pp  in a world of scale economies market forces can easily maintain inefficient equilibria we introduce the concept of degree of efficiency and of local efficiency to bring structure into the concept of efficiency in the presence of scale economies a linear ricardo model with varying parameters with william j baumol proceedings of the national academy of sciences usa  vol   pp  this note shows that if we consider all possible productivities that is all productivities that do not exceed some given technological limits in the standard linear ricardo model that the resulting multiple equiibria form regions having the same characteristic shape and economic consequences as the regions produced by the multiple equilibria resulting from economies of scale scale economies the regions of multiple trade equilibria and gains from acquisition of industries with william j baumol c v starr economic research report new york university june  rr   this positions the economies of scale model into the background of the existing literature it also describes the transition from the traditional linear model to the economies of scale model as more of the industries of the model are allowed to have economies of scale ricardo model with economies of scale journal of economic theory april  volume  no  pp  this carefully develops the methods and results summarized in the proceedings note below it shows that the shape of the region of equilibria for large numbers of industries is obtained by a linear programming calculation it also discusses the consequences of the regional shape in particular the inherent conflict that can exist between the interests of the trading nations a ricardo model with economies of scale proceedings of the national academy of sciences usa  vol  issue  pp  this introduces the standard equilibrium model of international trade ricardo model changed only in there are economies of scale in the production function  it shows that the multiple equilibra that then result form a well

and received his phd in mathematics from princeton university in  gomory then served in the navy  and then was a higgins lecturer and assistant professor of mathematics at princeton before joining ibms newly formed research division in  as a research mathematician in his student and graduate student years williams cambridge princeton gomory did research on nonlinear differential equations but his years in the navy turned his attention to the applied mathematics of operations research back at princeton he obtained the first general cuttingplane algorithms which established the field of integer programming it remains an active area of research today at ibm research in the early s gomory published papers with paul gilmore on the knapsack traveling salesman and cuttingstock problems and with t c hu on flows in multiterminal networks and continua in the late s he developed the asymptotic theory of integer programming and introduced the concept of corner polyhedra in the early s he collaborated with ellis johnson in investigating subadditive functions related to corner polyhedra that could also play a role in producing cuttingplanes gomory served as chairman of ibm researchs mathematical sciences department from  and  during an important period of its growth and evolution this period saw the beginning of samuel winograds work on limits of algorithms and of benoit mandelbrots work on fractals gomory became director of research for ibm in  with line responsibility for ibms research division during his  years as director of research the research division made a wide range of contributions to ibms products to the computer industry and to science the zurich research laboratory did the work that resulted in two successive nobel prizes in physics yorktown heights research was the birthplace of what is now known as risc architecture and san jose was the birthplace of the concept theory and first prototype of relational databases gomory who had become the ibm senior vice president for science and technology retired from ibm in  and became president of the alfred p sloan foundation during his tenure as president he led the foundation into a long list of fields relevant to major national issues the foundation pioneered in the field of online learning supporting this work before there was even a public internet and then supported its growth to more than three million people taking courses for credit they started the now widespread program of industry studies and engaged a major program advocating a more flexible workplace the foundation developed a novel and successful approach to the problem of producing minority phds in scientific and technical fields the foundation was early in perceiving the threat of bioterrorism and was active in that area for years before the events of  on the scientific side the foundation supported the widely recognized sloan sky survey which has made major contributions to the problem of dark energy and initiated a major worldwide effort to survey life in the oceans known as the census of marine life in december  after  years as president gomory became president emeritus gomory has served in many capacities in academic industrial and governmental organizations he was a trustee of hampshire college from  and of princeton university from  he served on the presidents council of advisors on science and technology pcast from  to  and again from  to  he served for a number of terms on the national academies committee on science engineering and public policy cosepup he has recently joined step the board on science technology and economic policy of the national academies gomory has been a director of a number of companies including the washington post company and the bank of new york he is currently a director of lexmark international inc and of a small startup company he was named one of americas ten best directors by directors alert magazine in  gomory has been elected to the national academy of sciences the national academy of engineering and the american philosophical society he was subsequently elected to the councils of all three societies he has been awarded eight

the navy he shifted his focus to applied mathematics in operations research among his mathematical achievements were founding contributions to the field of integer programming an active area of research to this day he was higgins lecturer and assistant professor at princeton university  he joined the research division of ibm in  in  he was appointed ibm fellow in  gomory became director of research with line responsibility for ibms research division during his tenure ibm researchers made major contributions to the understanding of memory devices dennard scalling made major advances possible in highdensity storage devices and produced advanced silicon processing methods they also invented the relational database codd and the risc computer architecture his researchers also won two successive nobel prizes in physics and it was at ibm research that benoit mandelbrot created the now widely accepted concept of fractals he continued in a leadership role for the next  years eventually becoming ibm senior vice president for science and technology after reaching the mandatory retirement age of  for corporate officers at ibm gomory became president of the alfred p sloan foundation in  during his tenure as president he led the foundation’s effort to sponsor research in numerous fields relevant to major national issues the foundation’ work in the field of online learning predated the public internet its continued support has resulted in nearly seven million people taking online courses for credit as of  the foundation started the nowwidespread program of industry studies and launched a program advocating a more flexible workplace it developed an approach to overcoming the problem of underrepresented minority phd’s in scientific and technical fields among scientific achievements the foundation supported the widely recognized sloan digital sky survey which has made major contributions to the problem of dark energy and initiated a worldwide effort to survey life in the oceans known as the census of marine life under gomorys leadership the alfred p sloan foundation also supported programs on public understanding of science and the development of the professional science masters designed to allow students to pursue advanced training in science or mathematics while simultaneously developing workplace skills in december  after  years as president of the sloan foundation gomory became president emeritus and joined the stern school of business at new york university as a research professor currently he focuses his work on addressing the increasing complexities of the globalized economy and the differing goals of countries and companies his  book cowritten with professor william baumol global trade and conflicting national

ibm research’s mathematical sciences department director of research for ibm president of the alfred p sloan foundation and research professor at nyu’s leonard n stern school of business  earlier he spent a pivotal summer at rand and was an andrew dickson white professor at cornell he has been elected to the national academy of sciences the national academy of engineering and the american philosophical society and to the councils of all three societies  in addition to his major contributions to operations research he has written on the nature of industrial research and on global tradegomory originally studied physics at williams college but was drawn to mathematics there and wrote a princeton phd thesis on nonlinear differential equations  after completing his phd he joined the us navy as an officer and was assigned to the physics branch of office of naval research in dc  there he discovered the operations research group org and learned linear programming from alan goldman he remained with org as a consultant after joining the princeton faculty traveling to washington to consult on navy problems  one of these dealt with lp solutions that proposed such oddities as fractional aircraft carriers  he discovered that constraints could be added to the problem that cut away fractional solutions incorporated this cuttingplane approach into an algorithm and proved that it converged to an integer optimum in a finite number of steps his appointment as ibm’s director of research reduced his own research output but he continued to explore the geometry algebra computation and economics of integer programming with new contributions more than  years after his original cuttingplane paperthrough his exposure to org gomory learned of or as “mathematics applied to everyday problems problems of a company scheduling problems etc” and thought “oh that’s what i want to do”  later at ibm he collaborated with coauthors including michel balinski paul gilmore tc hu alan hoffman and others on papers that tackled many core or problems such as the knapsack traveling salesman cutting stock network flow machine sequencing lot size and inventory problems  with gilmore he visited a number of ibm customer sites to understand their problems  at paper mills they hit upon the problem of minimizing waste in cutting a large standardsized roll of paper into a mix of smaller rolls ordered by customers their solution to this practical problem won the lanchester prize in   this work together with his contributions to the theoretical underpinnings of or earned gomory the  john von neumann theory prize awarded by informs he became an ibm fellow the highest honor a scientist engineer or programmer can achieve at the company and moved into management first of the mathematical sciences department and then all of ibm research  during his  year tenure as research head the research division made such technology advances as the singletransistor memory cell highdensity storage devices silicon processing methods the relational database and the risc computer architecture his researchers also won two successive nobel prizes in physicsduring his eighteen years as sloan foundation president the foundation pioneered work on the threat of bioterrorism online learning underrepresented minorities in science and technology the sloan sky survey the census of

writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in
