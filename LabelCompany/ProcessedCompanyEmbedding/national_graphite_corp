closes private placement will the graphite industry take off graphite companies announce spherical graphite test facility begins operations northern advances purification technology natural graphite is the solution for tesla learn about graphite the demand is just getting started future demand for graphite is not dependent on just one technology  there are a number of new applications which are commercial now and which are expected to experience strong growth lithium ion batteries expandable graphite fuel cells vanadium redox batteries pebble bed nuclear reactors what management thinks about graphite pricesprices for large flake graphite increased from about  per tonne in  to approximately  in  due to the growth in china and other emerging economies  they have since declined to about  due to the slow down in china and its steel industry a lack of growth in the us europe and japan and a strengthening us dollar  further price declines are unlikely as many uneconomic mines have closed and a number of chinese mines have been shut down for environmental reasons  demand from lithium ion batteries is growing at over  per year and has already caused a significant rise in lithium prices  it now accounts for about a third of the graphite market and we are getting close to the point where batteries and not steel will drive graphite prices graphite supplychina produces over  of the world’s graphite  its industry is very fragmented with many labor and environmental issues and mines that are getting older deeper and higher cost  china is modernizing and consolidating much of its mining industry to provide for more professional management of its resources recently over  of chinese flake graphite production was shut down either because it was uneconomic or for environmental reasons  also china wants to export value added products not raw materials and therefore it has an export licensing system and resource nationalism is an increasing concern  for these reasons chinese graphite production and exports are likely to decline in the future and stable secure sources of high quality supply in the west are needed recently china announced that it is going to build a flake graphite stockpile equal to  of annual production by  graphenegraphene is one of the top research topics in the world with billions of dollars of funding committed  at present there is no process for making commercial quantities of graphene and there are no commercial products based on graphene   dozens if not hundreds of organizations are working on these challenges and once solved the results could revolutionize the way we work and live  natural graphite is one source of graphene and will probably supply the lower technology applications such as conductive inks and coatings and composite materials  there are up to three million layers of graphene in a one millimeter thickness of graphite so a little goes a long wayhow graphene might change the world electric vehiclesevs are not going to replace the internal combustion engine  however there are many uses and markets where they make sense including short range commuting city driving taxis and delivery vehicles  evs only need to become modestly successful to have a big effect on the graphite market  if one per cent of the new car market about  cars were evs world flake graphite production would have to increase by about  and multiple new mines would be required  the proposed tesla “gigafactory” requires up to six new mines  china alone plans on having five million evs by  new marketsexpandable graphite is one of the fastest growing markets along with li ion batteries  it involves treating xl flake graphite with a dilute acid solution and heating it to cause the flakes to split apart and increase hundreds of time in volume  this material is pressed into sheets which can be cut into shapes and used in many applications including thermal management in consumer electronics advanced building materials heat and corrosion resistant gaskets fuel cells and flow batteries  fuel cells are already a billion dollar industry with commercial buses forklift trucks standby power plants etc already in operation  there are commercial fuel cell cars now and many observers expect them to become more popular more quickly than evs interviews with northern graphite ceo – greg bowes investorintel northern graphite’s greg
