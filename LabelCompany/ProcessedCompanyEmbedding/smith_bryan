angry with me  we all have ideas that we tell ourselves about god and how he works in our lives some are truebut many are false james bryan smith believes those thoughts determine not only who we are

to put your ideas to the test to see if they match up with what jesus himself reveals about god once youve discovered the truth in scripture smith leads you through a process of spiritual formation that includes specific activities aimed at making these new narratives real in your body and soul as well as your mind  at the end of each chapter youll find an opportunity for soul training engaging in spiritual practices that reinforce the biblical messages on your mind and heart because the best way to make a complete and lasting change is to go through the material in community small group discussion questions also accompany each chapter those who are leading apprentice groups will also find additional help and opportunities to interact with other leaders at the apprentice website  this
