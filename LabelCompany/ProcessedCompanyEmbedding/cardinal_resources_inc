cardinal resources cdnl hunter straus longterm horizon growth longshort equitysummarycardinal resources was recently featured in a paid advertisement in the wall street revelatorthe companys financials are weak and indicate that the company needs to raise funds immediatelya third party paid  for the advertisementthe company recently switched its name from jh designs where it claimed to be involved in interior decoratingbackground recently the wall street revelator published a paid promotion for cardinal resources inc otccdnl the promotion essentially claimed that cdnl is going to make it possible for fresh clean water to be available throughout thirdworld countries and that the company will make a fortune from it however the presentation has an important disclaimer that indicates it is a paid advertisement and if you look at the companys financial situation and past history its evident that you would be better off leaving this one alone business as mentioned before cdnl claims to be developing water treatment systems from the companys plan of operations section in its most recent q it reads our plan of operations is focused on becoming the global preferred provider of sustainable water treatment systems using a distributed architecture to meet this goal our plans call for the company to expand our financial management technical implementation staff and market development part of our plan is to continue to expand our technologies and approaches as well beginning with distributed waste water treatment in terms of expansion our plan is to first have implementation well underway for our three large contracts in cameroon nigeria and senegal we can then move aggressively to close on other opportunities in our pipeline and expand into our next targets of india panama and southeast asia however just over a year ago the company was called jh designs inc it changed its name on january   its business is described below as follows we provide home staging and interior design services to sellers of residential properties real estate agents are our primary customers we define home staging is the act of preparing the interior appearance of a private residence for sale in the real estate marketplace by the placement of furnishings including furniture artwork and accessories in the residence for the purpose of enhancing the appeal of the residence to potential purchasers of the residence our home staging strategy is twofold we use the interior furnishing of a residence as a device to i visually emphasize the best qualities of the interior design of a residence and ii make the residence appeal to the highest number of potential purchasers a residence successfully staged by us will improve the ability of a seller to sell a residence and obtain a higher price of the residence than if the residence were not staged our home staging techniques focus on improving a propertys appeal by transforming it into a welcoming attractive product that anyone might want nowhere in any of the companys filings is there any reason or explanation for the sudden change of businesses  how does a company transition from doing interior design work to providing water purification systems where is the motivation for such a change in many of the companies that i have covered quick business and name changes are notable red flags and this company is no exception promotion most stock promotions are done via simple onepage email promotions but this one has a page paid promotion from the wall street revelator which also recently promoted ifan financial inc otcpkifan the front page of the advertisement features a picture of matt damon with his head through a toilet seat and the content of the promotion tries to take advantage of the recent ebola crisis which has ravaged africa make no mistake though the claims are bourne from fiction other ridiculous imagery includes a cardinal sitting on a stack of  bills and countless pictures of people holding one dirty glass of water and one clean glass of water beyond the outlandish claims and bombastic nature of the advertisement which claims that cardinal resources inc is going to turn sand and salt into hundreds of millions of dollars its important to skip to the end and read the disclaimer once this is read its much more clear what is going on the disclaimer in part reads disclaimer do not base any investment decision upon any materials found in this report… individuals should assume that all information contained herein about cdnl and other companies is not trustworthy unless verified by their own independent research the wall street revelator andor its publisher andrew  lynn carpenter dba the wall street revelator has received a total amount of thirty thousand dollars in cash compensation to assist in the writing of this advertisement as well as potential future subscription and advertising revenues the amount of which is not known at this time with respect to the publication of this advertisement and future publications resources kingdom limited paid six hundred seventy thousand dollars to marketing vendors to pay for all the costs of creating and distributing this advertisement including printing and postage in an effort to build investor and market awareness if successful the advertisement will increase investor and market awareness which may result in increased numbers of shareholders owning and trading the common stock of cardinal resources  increased trading volumes and possibly increased share price of the common stock of cardinal resources  resources kingdom limited was paid by nonaffiliate shareholders who fully intend to sell their shares without notice into this advertisementmarket awareness campaign including selling into increased volume and share price that may result from this advertisementmarket awareness campaign the nonaffiliate shareholders may also purchase shares without notice at any time before during or after this advertisementmarket awareness campaign… there is more to the disclaimer but the important part is highlighted in bold the wall street revelator is being paid to advertise this stock and admits that the information in the report is not trustworthy additionally a third party resources kingdom limited paid  for the advertisement and finally resources kingdom was paid by shareholders who fully intend to sell their shares without notice into this advertisementmarket awareness campaign additionally there is no link evident between cardinal resources and resources kingdom limited that is disclosed in any of its filings  if one does a google search for resources kingdom limited the only results refer to the promotion done in the wall street revelator if thats not a series of major red flags i dont know what is however no analysis is complete without looking at the financials to see if the companys claims are at least plausible in a perfect world financials according to the companys most recent qa filed on december   the balance sheet shows  in cash and  million in receivables making up for  million in current assets the liabilities section lists  million in current liabilities and the company has an accumulated deficit of  million as far as penny stocks go this one has the greatest amount of assets relative to its market cap  million at the time of this writing however if we look at the companys statement of cash flows its apparent that the company has major nearterm financial problems its operations lost  in the nine months ended september   given the companys cash burn rate its important to note that there is a going concern clause in the qa which reads these consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and the discharge of liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future however as of september   the company had an accumulated deficit and a working capital deficit in addition the company currently has limited liquidity and has not completed its efforts to establish a stabilized source of revenues sufficient to cover operating costs over an extended period of time these factors raise substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern while the financials are not as bad as some of the penny stocks that i have covered they are not in great shape the company is going to need additional funding in order to continue its existence insider ownership the companys latest k shows that there is substantial insider ownership as the top three holders own  of the outstanding shares  while this is a lot im really interested in how many shares resources kingdom limited owns as they paid  for the stock promotion unfortunately there are no filings that indicate how many shares this entity owns recent price activity im not much of a chart technician but i think its important to note that since the promotion initially came out last week the price of the stock has tanked from a price of  on january th to a close of  on january th on substantially higher volume somebody is selling heavily following the promotion but it looks like a lot of the people receiving the promotional material are not buying into it however it is an expensive promotional campaign and i think that we will see further promotional material in the coming weeks conclusion compared to many of the stock promotions that i have covered cardinal resources inc has something tangible in its financials although it is bleeding cash and will need additional funding in order to continue operating the paid promotion reads like a piece of fantasy fiction and explicitly claims that there are thirdparty individuals that want to pump up the price of the stock in order to benefit additionally there is substantial insider ownership and while there is no clear link disclosed in the companys filings between the company and the promoters or resources kingdom limited its a major red flag that needs to be clarified by management furthermore the quick name and business changes are troubling and are a common characteristic common to many penny stock schemes at this time its hard to see who is pulling the strings but id definitely stay away from this one
