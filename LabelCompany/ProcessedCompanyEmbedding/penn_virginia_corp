taken advantage of in investments related to oil and gas there are two types of investment losses in oil and gas securities that are potentially recoverable through the firna arbitration process or via lawsuit unsuitable investment recommendations in oil and gas stocks bonds master limited partnerships and mutual funds negligence based unsuitable investment recommendations in oil gas and energy related companies make up a majority of the cases we’ve handled for investors for example brokers at full service brokerage firms recommended oil and gas stocks master limited partnerships and other related investments heavily to investors between  and  with the massive slide in oil prices in  and  caused by the jump in domestic oil stockpiles due to new highly efficient drilling techniques like horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracking techniques companies affiliated with the oil industries have lost substantial value resulting in devastating investment losses for many investors unfortunately many small oil and gas producers have lost a majority of their value in  and  these companies have heavy debt loads that simply couldn’t be maintained with the oil price slide dozens of master limited partnerships have declined in value in  and  the  billion masterlimitedpartnership sector is the sausage maker of the investment world buyers love the yields — now averaging about  — but many know little about how the yields are generated the bullish pitch by brokers in favor of the investments centered around the highyielding way to participate in the booming us energy infrastructure buildout unfortunately the investments while providing generous yields masked the substantial high risks of these investments many of these investments were pitched to elderly and conservative investors because of the relatively high dividends and yields that the investments paid out these losses are potentially recoverable through either finra arbitration claims against the brokerage firms whose brokers recommended the investments or lawsuits against the promoters of the investments fraud based claims the second type of oil and gas actions deal with fraud based claims oil and gas investments take many forms including limited partnership interests master limited partnerships ownership of fractional undivided interests in leases and general partnerships risk level tax consequences and investor liability vary according to the type of program drilling partnerships have always been a gamble but unfortunately many oil and gas scams have been perpetrated by bad actors in the securities industry although some of the con artists moved on to more lucrative venues since the oil boom ended in the mids many continued to linger on in the oil field and the results of their actions are being felt now fraudulent oil and gas deals are frequently structured with the limited partnership or other legal entity in one state the operation and physical presence of the field in a second state and the offerings made to prospective investors in states other than the initial two states thus there is less chance of an investor dropping by a well site or a nonexistent company headquarters such a structure also makes it difficult for law enforcement officials and victims to identify and expose the fraud our securities law firm holds financial advisors accountable brokers at major brokerage firms like linsco lpl ubs merrill lynch raymond james citgroup and stifel nicolaus also sometimes engage in an activity called “selling away” when a broker sells a customer an “investment” outside the investment products offered by the brokerage firm and outside the client’s account there may be a selling away issue these investments known as private securities often involve investments in oil and gas related limited partnerships privately held companies private placements promissory notes and other similar investments sometimes they are real investments other times they are completely bogus and used as a means for the advisor to convert client funds unfortunately unscrupulous oil promoters and stockbrokers frequently use the internet and “boiler room” offices with banks of phones manned by salespeople with little or no background in energy exploration but plenty of experience in highpressure sales their techniques include repeated unsolicited phone calls to potential investors hyping the profitability of the deal and promises of safe but secure returns some examples of these pitches include • you will have an interest in a well that cannot miss • the risks are minimal • a geologist has given the salesperson a tip • the broker or salesperson has personally invested in the venture • the promoter has “hit” on every well drilled so far • there has been a tremendous “discovery” in an adjacent field • a large reputable oil company like chevron is operating or planning to operate in the area • only a few interests remain to be sold and you should immediately send in your money in order to assure the purchase of an interest • this is a special private deal open only to a lucky chosen few investors oil gas and energy deals we are

through taxation status with the irs this allows c corporation owners to avoid double taxation on their business income are there any restrictions on who can file to form a c corporationoutside of some statespecific regulations that require individuals to be  to own a business there are no restrictions on who can form a corporation however if a corporation decides to elect for c corporation status there are several restrictions placed on who can become part of the organizations ownership they are as follows• all c corporation shareholders must be legal citizens of the united states • c corporations are only able to distribute one uniform class of stock • c corporation are limited to  different shareholders • subsidiary organizations may not have an ownership interest in a c corporation all shareholders must be individuals what are the tax implications of a c corporationone of the most common reasons that business owners elect to form a c corporation is that the structure

distributed and reflected on their personal income tax returns are there a required number of individuals needed to form a c corporationmost states only require one director in order to start a c

gas producers have lost a majority of their value in  and  these companies have heavy debt loads that simply couldn’t be maintained with the oil price slide dozens of master limited partnerships have declined in value in  and  the  billion masterlimitedpartnership sector is the sausage maker of the investment world buyers love the yields — now averaging about  — but many know little about how the yields are generated the bullish pitch by brokers in favor of the investments centered around the highyielding way to participate in the booming us energy infrastructure buildout unfortunately the investments while providing generous yields masked the substantial high risks of these investments many of these investments were pitched to elderly and conservative investors because of the relatively high dividends and yields that the investments paid out these losses are potentially recoverable through either finra arbitration claims against the brokerage firms whose brokers recommended the investments or lawsuits against the promoters of the investments fraud based claims the second type of oil and gas actions deal with fraud based claims oil and gas investments take many forms including limited partnership interests master limited partnerships ownership of fractional undivided interests in leases and general partnerships risk level tax consequences and investor liability vary according to the type of program drilling partnerships have always been a gamble but unfortunately many oil and gas scams have been perpetrated by bad actors in the securities industry although some of the con artists moved on to more lucrative venues since the oil boom ended in the mids many continued to linger on in the oil field and the results of their actions are being felt now fraudulent oil and gas deals are frequently structured with the limited partnership or other legal entity in one state the operation and physical presence of the field in a second state and the offerings made to prospective investors in states other than the initial two states thus there is less chance of an investor dropping by a well site or a nonexistent company headquarters such a structure also makes it difficult for law enforcement officials and victims to identify and expose the fraud our securities law firm holds financial advisors accountable brokers at major brokerage firms like linsco lpl ubs merrill lynch raymond james citgroup and stifel nicolaus also sometimes engage in an activity called “selling away” when a broker sells a customer an “investment” outside the investment products offered by the brokerage firm and outside the client’s account there may be a selling away issue these investments known as private securities often involve investments in oil and gas related limited partnerships privately held companies private placements promissory notes and other similar investments sometimes they are real investments other times they are completely bogus and used as a means for the advisor to convert client funds unfortunately unscrupulous oil promoters and stockbrokers frequently use the internet and “boiler room” offices with banks of phones manned by salespeople with little or no background in energy exploration but plenty of experience in highpressure sales their techniques include repeated unsolicited phone calls to potential investors hyping the profitability of the deal and promises of safe but secure returns some examples of these pitches include • you will have an interest in a well that cannot miss • the risks are minimal • a geologist has given the salesperson a tip • the broker or salesperson has personally invested in the venture • the promoter has “hit” on every well drilled so far • there has been a tremendous “discovery” in an adjacent field • a large reputable oil company like chevron is operating or planning to operate in the area • only a few interests remain to be sold and you should immediately send in your money in order to assure the purchase of an interest • this is a special private deal open only to a lucky chosen few investors oil gas and energy deals we are investigating cushing royalty

through taxation status with the irs this allows c corporation owners to avoid double taxation on their business income are there any restrictions on who can file to form a c corporationoutside of some statespecific regulations that require individuals to be  to own a business there are no restrictions on who can form a corporation however if a corporation decides to elect for c corporation status there are several restrictions placed on who can become part of the organizations ownership they are as follows• all c corporation shareholders must be legal citizens of the united states • c corporations are only able to distribute one uniform class of stock • c corporation are limited to  different shareholders • subsidiary organizations may not have an ownership interest in a c corporation all shareholders must be individuals what are the tax implications of a c corporationone of the most common reasons that business owners elect to form a c corporation is that the structure is eligible for passthrough taxation under this special tax status the corporation is never taxed on its income instead each individual owner is taxed on the companys profits and losses as they are distributed and reflected on their personal income tax returns are there a required number of individuals needed to form a c corporationmost states only require one director in order to start a c corporation however some states impose a minimum number of directors based on the number of shareholders the company has this required number is typically never lower than three and there is no

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed
