company about us history our team business areas code of ethics technology overview advanced materials nanomedicine investors news  media whats new media overview press releases contact history the story of manhattan scientifics begins with the holographic research component of the company in the late s the microelectronics  computer corporation mcc invested approximately  million in holographic data storage research the research produced no conclusive results however manhattan scientifics ceo marvin maslow fascinated by the potential of holographic storage was reluctant to give up believing that eventually its time would come he decided a more intense and focused research effort with new expertise might eventually produce the longsought results meanwhile in august  maslow visited los alamos national laboratory lanl to investigate new technologies with commercialization potential lanls civilian industrial technology program office functioning in the capacity of matchmaker introduced maslow to robert hockaday a lanl physicist who had taken entrepreneurial leaveofabsence to refine a patented microfuel cell technology he had been developing with his own funds maslow recognized that the holographic project might benefit from the expertise of los alamos national laboratory materials science experts and combined with the microfuel cell technology would be a solid foundation for a technology incubator to commercialize leadingedge technologies knowing that fledgling companies can flounder during the standard capitalization process of protracted analysis and negotiations and that getting a new technology to market quickly is crucial to success maslow deployed what he calls a guerrilla financing strategy in a period of approximately four months he formed manhattan scientifics inc raised the capital hockaday estimated he needed to begin intensive development of a working prototype and took the company public on january   by means of a reverse merger

exclusive rights to the key patents and ip and will soon be positioned to enter into manufacturing and licensing agreements nano titanium manhattan scientifics nanostructured metal technology is based on over  years of highly focused research and development nanostructured metals and alloys possess significantly enhanced mechanical properties that include for example increased strength without concurrent losses in ductility and significantly increased resistance to fatigue fracture nanostructured commercially pure grades of titanium have proven to also possess excellent machinability as well as high toughness and strength manhattan scientifics has developed unique processing methodology for producing nanostructures in a wide range of ductile metals and alloys and is now commercializing this new and revolutionary technology enhanced strength and fatigue resistance nanostructured metals and alloys offer many advantages for a wide range of structural applications application areas include biomedical structures sports structures aerospace and chemical structures among others nanomedicine manhattan scientifics and senior scientific llc have announced that they have begun cooperative work to commercialize senior scientifics nano medicine cancer detection technology manhattan scientifics acquired senior scientific along with all its patents and ip in the emerging field of nano medicine specifically dr flynns work in biomagnetic detection of cancer and other diseases through magnetic field sensors these sensors make it possible to identify and image small clusters of cancer cells substantially increasing the sensitivity for finding cancer at an earlier stage than is currently available and without the use of ionizing radiation or large magnetic fields the biomagnetic sensor method is applicable to breast ovarian leukemia prostate melanoma and other cancers dr flynns research has been funded by the national institute of health nih management intends to identify one or more appropriate fortune industrial partners in the big pharma group to bring product to the market under royalty bearing licenses to learn more about senior scientific and the technologies being developed please visit wwwseniorscientificcom about nanomedicine the term nanomedicine is commonly used to describe the convergence of nanotechnology and pharmacology it has been defined as the science and technology of diagnosing treating and preventing disease and traumatic injury or relieving pain and of preserving and improving human health using molecular tools and molecular knowledge of the human body by the european science foundation european science foundation nanomedicine will soon be used for diagnosing and treating cancer musculoskeletal and inflammatory diseases neurodegenerative diseases diabetes and infectious diseases in general nanotechnology has the incredible potential to improve patient outcomes what does this mean patients will be living longer with a greater quality of life in the fight against cancer nanotechnology introduces unique approaches to diagnosis and treatment that could not even be imagined with conventional technology new tools engineered at sizes much smaller than a human cell will enable researchers and clinicians to detect cancer earlier treat it with much greater precision and fewer side effects and possibly stop the disease long before it can do any damage understanding nanotechnology nanotechnology is the development and engineering of devices so small that they are measured on a molecular scale this emerging field involves scientists from many different disciplines including physicists chemists engineers information technologists and material scientists as well as biologists nanotechnology is being applied to almost every field imaginable including electronics magnetics optics information technology materials development and biomedicine the size of things nanoscale devices are one hundred to ten thousand times smaller than human cells they are similar in size to large biological molecules biomolecules such as enzymes and receptors as an example hemoglobin the molecule that carries oxygen in red blood cells is approximately  nanometers in diameter nanoscale devices smaller than  nanometers can easily enter most cells while those smaller than  nanometers can move out of blood vessels as they circulate through the body because of their small size nanoscale devices can readily interact with biomolecules on both the surface and inside cells by gaining access to so many areas of the body they have the potential to detect disease and deliver treatment in ways unimagined before now share structure authorized shares  million  as of march   there were  shares of common stock
