treat newproduct development as a monolithic process but it can be more rationally divided into two parts an early stage that focuses on evaluating prospects and eliminating bad bets and a late stage that maximizes the remaining candidates’ market potential recognizing the value of this approach eli lilly designed and piloted chorus an autonomous unit dedicated solely to the early stage this article demonstrates how segmenting development in this way can speed it up and make it more costeffective two classes of decisionmaking errors can impede npd the authors say first managers often ignore evidence challenging their assumptions that projects will succeed as a result many projects go forward despite multiple red flags some even reach the market only to fail dramatically after their introduction second companies sometimes terminate projects prematurely because people fail to conduct the right experiments to reveal products’ potential most companies promote both kinds of errors by focusing disproportionately on latestage development they lack the early truthseeking functions that would head such errors off in segmented npd however the earlystage organization maintains loyalty to the experiment rather than the product whereas the latestage organization pursues commercial success chorus has significantly improved npd efficiency and productivity at lilly although the unit absorbs just onetenth of lilly’s investment in earlystage development it delivers a substantially greater fraction of the molecules slated for late phase ii trials—at almost twice the speed and less than a third of the cost of the standard process sometimes shaving as much as two years off the usual development time companies often treat newproduct development as a monolithic process but it can be more rationally divided into two distinct stages a truthseeking early stage focused on evaluating novel products’ prospects and eliminating bad bets and a successseeking late stage focused on maximizing the value of products that have been cleared for development recognizing the potential of this approach in  eli lilly designed and piloted chorus an autonomous experimental unit dedicated solely to earlystage drug development chorus looks for the most likely winners in a portfolio of molecules most of which are destined to fail recommending only the strongest candidates for costly latestage development the unit has evaluated  drug candidates  of which are still being assessed by the end of  chorus had completed work on seven molecules recommending that four enter into fullscale clinical development and that the other three go no further although chorus absorbs just onetenth of lilly’s investment in earlystage development it has recently delivered a substantially greater fraction of the molecules slated for late phase ii trials—at almost twice the speed and less than a third of the cost of the standard process in some cases shaving  to  months off the usual development time the success of chorus represents the ideal match of an innovationmanagement problem and solution the model is well suited to drug development because although it may postpone the scaleup of successful products it reduces risk in an environment where development costs and failure rates are extremely high indeed any company that needs to absorb a lot of risk in earlystage development—for instance in the chemical biotechnology medical devices hightechnology and semiconductor industries—could probably benefit from adopting the chorus model the model would make less sense for companies that have low development costs and failure rates and are therefore well served by concurrent engineering or rapidprototyping approaches that promote fast scaleup at relatively low risk consider for example how two different molecules were evaluated in early development in  lilly had begun work on a drug candidate for treating psychosis that we’ll call molecule x three years later human brainimaging studies showed that little of the drug actually reached the central nervous system—in all likelihood not enough to have a therapeutic effect nonetheless the development team kept the project alive arguing that only minute amounts of the molecule should be necessary to get results fastforward to  after five years of conventional development it was still unclear whether x had any clinical promise frustrated by the lack of definitive information lilly managers handed the molecule over to chorus for evaluation chorus undertook a new set of smallscale clinical experiments and in just seven months demonstrated that x had no therapeutic benefit this put an end to years of costly procrastination the resolution was quick decisive and obviously costeffective meanwhile lilly managers turned to chorus to reevaluate a second drug—ab for short—that had looked promising for certain neurological disorders but had been abandoned prior to clinical testing because similar molecules were found to affect vision at therapeutic doses tapping a network of inhouse scientists and external academics chorus identified a novel biomarker to help in testing the compound’s efficacy the unit then ran several small trials finding that ab did not cause visual problems and was likely to be of clinical benefit chorus’s new data put ab back in the running motivating largescale investment in further clinical testing the drug is now in late phase ii trials and preliminary data suggest that it is both safe and effective chorus delivered these results by focusing on what should be the only objective of earlystage development reducing uncertainty about a drug candidate’s clinical promise—or lack thereof—quickly and effectively kill or persist the examples of x and ab illustrate two classes of decisionmaking errors that can impede traditional drug development and newproduct development npd in general one type occurs when managers ignore evidence challenging their assumption that a project will succeed there are many reasons for this sort of failure including the power of champions to stir up collective faith in a project’s promise and the human tendency to seek only evidence that supports our beliefs projects like x that survive despite multiple red flags are the outcome some of them even reach the market only to fail dramatically after their introduction the other type of error occurs when a project is terminated prematurely for lack of evidence that it could succeed such mistakes result from a failure to conduct the right experiments to reveal a product’s potential sometimes because of organizational or personal biases against the project or because of a shortage of resources halting the development of ab falls into this category indeed some of the pharmaceutical industry’s biggest blockbusters such as prozac narrowly escaped cancellation due to this kind of error neither class of error is unique to pharmaceutical development the first type ignored evidence abounds in industries ranging from chemicals to building materials to entertainment where new products with questionable viability—remember rca’s videodisk—are propelled to market by a dogmatic successseeking mentality for more examples see isabelle royer “why bad projects are so hard to kill” hbr february  and many mature companies cancel promising projects too early for lack of adequate data xerox for example abandoned projects that went on to drive the success of documentum and com any company in an industry that relies on npd for growth must avoid both kinds of errors this requires encouraging what may seem like contradictory instincts a willingness to kill a product early and a willingness to persist until its potential is realized management consultants and portfolio theorists have offered a range of opinions on the shortcomings of npd in large organizations but none have managed to address how to avoid both types of decisionmaking errors simultaneously that’s because most organizations promote both kinds of errors by focusing disproportionately on latestage development they lack the early truthseeking functions whose explicit job is to head off such errors the latestage model—which in drug development is designed for massive pre and postlaunch activities—imposes a rigid bureaucracy that encourages largescale experiments conducted to maximize the likelihood of launch for many large companies this approach comes naturally because their npd objectives incentives processes and workflows are geared toward seeking success but this makes it hard to expose the truth about risky prospects quickly and costeffectively because a latestage mindset dominates most innovation companies creating an earlystage organization with its own objectives governance and operations often requires a fundamentally new way of thinking building an earlystage organization chorus defines “early stage” as the work of determining proof of concept poc for a drug candidate researchers must show—in small highly focused clinical trials—that the drug is likely to be effective and not to have obvious serious side effects establishing poc reduces uncertainty about the product’s prospects for commercialization and measurably affects the probability of launch determining probability of launch here are alternative plans for developing a single painrelief drug candidate the upper chart represents typical latestageoriented successseeking behavior the lower one shows an earlystage truthseeking approach—the kind chorus employs at eli lilly companies with a separate organization for earlystage development can determine more quickly and less expensively— and with a similar level of probability—whether a product will launch the chevrons represent segments of work and the vertical bars indicate the associated costs the effect of ongoing work in each plan is to either increase or decrease the probability of launch typically the clinical test of safety and efficacy the “clinical studies” chevron far right has the greatest impact on launch probability in a successseeking program expensive and lengthy largescale manufacturing and longterm animal studies are often initiated before critical data from the earlystage safety and efficacy studies are available so in this hypothetical case in the standard successseeking path an extensive effort the “drug formulation” chevron is made to manufacture a sustainedrelease tablet to clinically test effects on pain—the crucial experiment in the truthseeking plan minimal work is conducted to support the crucial experiment instead of being delivered as a manufactured sustainedrelease tablet the drug is repeatedly administered as a suspension in degassed sprite which mimics the effects of sustained release in a fraction of the time and at much lower cost in addition measuring the drug’s effect on a surrogate marker reduces both the cost of the crucial experiment and the time needed unlike the latestage organization’s portfolio which consists of products headed toward launch chorus’s portfolio is made up of experiments conducted primarily to resolve uncertainty about a drug candidate’s promise and thus substantially increase or decrease the probability that the candidate will launch see the exhibit “the two faces of pharmaceutical newproduct development” changing this probability involves first identifying key attributes that would affect commercialization for example does the drug occupy and affect its biological target does it show efficacy does it have undesirable side effects and then designing small experiments to establish whether these attributes exist as data flow from the experiments chorus managers modify the experimental plan weekly or even daily in order to discover the intrinsic attributes of a candidate as efficiently as possible the two faces of pharmaceutical newproduct development the early and late stages of newproduct development require fundamentally different goals strengths and approaches because experiments are valued according to their impact in determining the probability of launch whether they increase it is immaterial to chorus the staff cultivates loyalty to the experiment not to the product failure then is not only acceptable but periodically expected and rewarded reducing uncertainty quickly and inexpensively is the goal that drives the chorus process which consists of defining what data are required to change the probability of success designing the simplest clinical trials that will provide such data executing the trials costeffectively evaluating the data objectively and delivering a recommendation to either continue or terminate development although chorus’s approach is novel the notion of pursuing such highyield “killer” or critical experiments is not new about  years ago p roy vagelos then the ceo of merck lamented the fear that such trials inspire in an interview in harvard business review november–december  vagelos observed “there is one sure road to failure that i have seen many wander down some people become so afraid of failing that they are unable to do a critical experiment…merck has missed out on some major opportunities because people were unwilling to take that truthtelling step—to conduct the experiment that would show once and for all if what they had spent so many years studying would actually produce a new drug” efficiency also requires avoiding large fluctuations in resource utilization the bane of newproduct development in general and early pharmaceutical development in particular to prevent idle capacity chorus taps a network of  external experts who advise on topics such as experimental design and drug delivery and  external vendors who provide most of the manufacturing toxicology and clinical work the unit requires this frees chorus’s staff of   of whom are senior scientists to focus on the evidence generated by the trials as a result  of chorus’s annual expenditures are dispersed through the network the remaining  are the fixed costs of running the unit in addition to providing flexible capacity such outsourcing reinforces truthseeking by injecting dispassionate outside perspectives the considerably complex job of managing the work of vendors and outside experts with minimal inhouse staff is facilitated by a suite of software tools developed for the chorus enterprise at the level of the portfolio the software suite known as voice tracks the impact of different experiments on probability of launch at the level of planning it integrates the opinions of external content experts and at the level of operations it organizes work according to subject area clinical toxicology manufacturing and so on and distributes tasks and associated documents throughout the network a choice of models the chorus model can help companies improve the efficiency of their innovation processes by establishing proof of concept early and reducing project attrition downstream particularly in the later and more expensive phases of drug development however such truth seeking does have a cost it may impede parallel processing or concurrent engineering and defer scaleup and commercialization of products that will ultimately prove successful for example in a chorus experiment it is possible to use a test molecule made through an unoptomized process that would not be adequate for largerscale trials and commercialization but waiting until chorus delivers a poc before starting the time and resourceintensive optimization could delay launch and hinder commercial success nonetheless the net benefit may be substantial in large pharmaceutical firms  to  of drug candidates that enter clinical trials will never launch therefore early investment in largescale processes usually does not pay off while no company has replicated the chorus approach precisely there are examples of its principles at work in nonpharmaceutical industries at one global chemicals company for example npd suffered from both types of decisionmaking errors ignoring evidence that challenged assumptions and abandoning candidates too early to fix the problem the company implemented carefully staged decision making rigorous progress reviews and strict timelines for npd projects but skillful project champions would invariably marshal whatever numbers and materials were needed to win support at reviews for their projects as a result npd’s failure rate didn’t improve after the new processes were put in place then recognizing the need for different mindsets in early and latestage development management altered its recruitment strategy working with hr to identify truthseeking personalities for the early stage and successseeking types for the late stage that simple change improved npd productivity in another case a global semiconductor manufacturer—realizing that its reward systems created a disincentive for killing dicey projects early—redefined its systems to promote fast evidencebased failure in other words to encourage truth seeking this company too experienced improvements in npd productivity—although as we’ve noted speed to failure is only one ingredient of successful npd to gauge whether a model like chorus’s would make sense in your organization determine whether your npd process can be rationally segmented into earlystage development in which you absorb risk by culling poor prospects and latestage development in which you maximize the probability of launch as a rule of thumb in a good riskbased segmentation  to  of all assets such as drug candidates or projects make it to the late stage and  to  of those end up having successful market launches a good segmentation also yields a perasset cost ratio of between  and  that is moving an asset or project through the early stage costs onefifth to onefiftieth as much as moving it through the late stage see the exhibit “when a separate early stage makes sense” when a separate early stage makes sense you may be able to increase your chances of success in newproduct development by dividing the process into early and late stages in the former the goal is to quickly eliminate poor candidates and absorb risk in the latter it is to increase the probability of launch this segmented approach is a good bet for your company if  to  of candidates would be eliminated at the early stage and  to  of the rest would go on to have successful market launches—and if per project the early stage would cost between onefifth and onefiftieth as much as the late stage ranges are approximate they reflect potential for a separate early stage in most situations consider the segmentation of drug development if the early stage comprises phase i and early phase ii clinical trials and the late stage is made up of late phase ii and phase iii trials postpoc studies then about  of all candidates entering earlystage development will move on to the late stage and about  of those will have successful market launches typically the latestage cost per candidate is about  times the earlystage cost thus the relationship between risk absorption and cost places pharmaceutical npd within the bounds of good segmentation other industries where npd would meet the criteria for good segmentation include biotechnology and medical devices in industries that have a higher probability of technical success at the outset—such as cell phones software and consumer products in general—early poc and segmentation may do little more than extend cycle times companies that could benefit from an earlystage npd unit like chorus need to be aware that the approach is not just a form of process reengineering they will have to create a new separate organization that focuses on truth seeking a small team must be selected to plan implement and manage that organization the team builds the infrastructure and recruits both internal staff and consultants who as discussed may bring essential expertise and objectivity to the project being able to ask the right questions and design the critical experiments to rule in or rule out a product’s key attributes are essential skills for people in chorus teams within the unit are small and fluid composed of individuals motivated by intellectual curiosity each team member works on several products simultaneously and of course no one will follow any of the products into later stages—a rule created to promote objective truth seeking as the earlystage organization develops its unique capability it will work in parallel with the established npd operation it offers additional capacity but does not replace existing npd functions the goal for any earlystage organization and indeed for rd overall should be to head off
