  organization the “company” was incorporated on december   date of inception under the laws of the state of nevada as cubescape inc   the company filed a registration statement on form s which was declared effective by the us securities and exchange commission on october   the form s allowed the company to solicit investors for investment in a direct public offering of  twenty six  investors invested at a price of  per share for the entire offering which closed on december     nature of operations the company is developing a branded product that utilizes panoramic vinyl wall graphics generated on a proprietary interactive design portal the proprietary interactive portal is designed to assist the consumer or enduser in creating wall or cubicle panel art upgrading andor enhancing plain home office and cubicle work space with a new approach to workplace aesthetics the company’s product will consist of high resolution wall graphics made from professional art designs stockphotos andor user consumer provided images that are integrated into unique backdrop graphics will be constructed of quality vinyl and lowtack adhesive for ease of application and replacement but durable on june   a change in control occurred a sixty percent  ownership interest was obtained by american rebel inc from our former officer and director and founder the company intends to continue with the cubescape business as well as acquire the business of its control shareholder   interim financial statements september   unaudited and basis of presentation the accompanying unaudited interim financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap” for interim financial information and with the rules and regulations of the united states securities and exchange commission the “sec” set forth in article  of regulation sx accordingly they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by us gaap for complete financial statements the unaudited interim financial statements furnished reflect all adjustments consisting of normal recurring accruals which are in the opinion of management necessary to a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented unaudited interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full fiscal year these financial statements should be read along with the annual report filed on form k of the company for the period ended december   and notes thereto contained   year end the company’s yearend is december    cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statements of cash flows all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents the carrying value of these investments approximates fair value   revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the product or service has been provided to the consumer  the amount of fees to be paid by the consumer is fixed or determinable and  the collection of our fees or product revenue is probable   the company will record revenue when it is realizable and earned and product has been shipped to the consumers or that our service has been rendered to the consumer   advertising costs advertising costs are anticipated to be expensed as incurred however there were no advertising costs for the three or nine months ended september   and  respectively   fair value of financial instruments fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of december   and september   unaudited respectively the respective carrying value of certain onbalancesheet financial instruments approximated their fair values these financial instruments include cash deferred offering costs and accounts payable fair values were assumed to approximate carrying values for cash and payables because they are short term in nature and their carrying amounts approximate fair values or they are payable on demand        level    the preferred inputs to valuation efforts are “quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities” with the caveat that the reporting entity must have access to that market information at this level is based on direct observations of transactions involving the same assets and liabilities not assumptions and thus offers superior reliability however relatively few items especially physical assets actually trade in active markets   level  fasb acknowledged that active markets for identical assets and liabilities are relatively uncommon and even when they do exist they may be too thin to provide reliable information to deal with this shortage of direct data the board provided a second level of inputs that can be applied in three situations   level  if inputs from levels  and  are not available the financial accounting standards board the “fasb” acknowledges that fair value measures of many assets and liabilities are less precise the board describes level  inputs as “unobservable” and limits their use by saying they “shall be used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available” this category allows “for situations in which there is little if any market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date” earlier in the standard fasb explains that “observable inputs” are gathered from sources other than the reporting company and that they are expected to reflect assumptions made by market participants   stockbased compensation the company records stock based compensation in accordance with the guidance in asc topic  and  which requires the company to recognize expense related to the fair value of its employee stock option awards this eliminates accounting for sharebased compensation transactions using the intrinsic value and requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fairvaluebased method the company recognizes the cost of all sharebased awards on a graded vesting basis over the vesting period of the award    the company accounts for equity instruments issued in exchange for the receipt of goods or services from other than employees in accordance with fasb asc  and the conclusions reached by the fasb asc  costs are measured at the estimated fair market value of the consideration received or the estimated fair value of the equity instruments issued whichever is more reliably measurable the value of equity instruments issued for consideration other than employee services is determined on the earliest of a performance commitment or completion of performance by the provider of goods or services as defined by fasb asc    earnings per share the company follows asc topic  to account for earnings per share basic earnings per common share “eps” calculations are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year diluted earnings per common share calculations are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common share equivalents outstanding during periods when common stock equivalents if any are antidilutive they are not considered in the computation   income taxes the company follows asc topic  for recording provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based upon the difference between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted marginal tax rate applicable when the related asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled deferred income tax expense or benefit is based on the changes in the asset or liability for each period if available evidence suggests that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized a valuation allowance is required to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized future changes in such valuation allowance are included in the provision for deferred income tax in the period of change   deferred income tax may arise from temporary differences resulting from income and expense items reported for financial accounting and tax purposes in different periods deferred taxes are classified as current or noncurrent depending on the classification of assets and liabilities to which they relate deferred taxes arising from temporary differences that are not related to an asset or liability are classified as current or noncurrent depending on the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse   the company applies a morelikelythannot recognition threshold for all tax uncertainties asc topic  only allows the recognition of tax benefits that have a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities as of december   and september   unaudited the company reviewed its tax positions and determined there were no outstanding or retroactive tax positions with less than a  likelihood of being sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities therefore this standard has not had a material effect on the company   the company does not anticipate any significant changes to its total unrecognized tax benefits within the next  months         the company classifies taxrelated penalties and net interest as income tax expense for the nine month periods ended september   and  respectively no income tax expense has been recorded   use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ significantly from those estimates   recent pronouncements the company evaluated recent accounting pronouncements through september   and believes that none have a material effect on the company’s financial statements except for the following   in june of  fasb issued accounting standards update “asu”  “elimination of certain financial reporting requirements including an amendment to variable interest entities guidance in topic  consolidation ” amendments in asu  remove the definition of a development stage entity from the master glossary of the accounting standards codification thereby removing the financial reporting distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from us gaap in addition the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities to  present inceptiontodate information in the statements of income cash flows and shareholder equity  label the financial statements as those of a development stage entity  disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged and  disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been in the development stage the company adopted the provisions of asu  for the period ending september   the adoption of asu  did not have an impact on our results of operations financial condition or cash flow   in august  fasb issued asu no  presentation of financial statements  going concern subtopic  disclosure of uncertainties about an entities ability to continue as a going concern  the standard is intended to define managements responsibility to decide whether there is substantial doubt about an organizations ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures the standard requires management to decide whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entitys ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued the standard provides guidance to an organizations management with principles and definitions that are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of disclosures that are commonly provided by organizations in the footnotes the standard becomes effective for the annual period ending after december   with early application permitted the adoption of this pronouncement is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements managements evaluations regarding the events and conditions that raise substantial doubt regarding the companys ability to continue as a going concern are disclosed in note  below   in august  fasb issued asu  revenue from contracts with customers deferral of effective date  in  fasb issued asu  revenue from contracts with customers which provided a framework for addressing revenue recognition issues and replaces almost all existing revenue recognition guidance in current us gaap the core principle of asu  is for companies to recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services asu  also resulted in enhanced disclosures about revenue provide guidance for transactions that were not previously addressed comprehensively and improve guidance for multipleelement arrangements the amendments in asu  defer the effective date of the new revenue recognition guidance to annual reporting periods beginning after december   including interim periods within that reporting period early adoption is permitted to the original effective date december   including interim periods within that reporting period management is evaluating the future impact of this guidance on the company’s financial statements and notes thereto   in august  fasb issued asu  presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs associated with lineofcredit arrangements  the company previously reported that in april  the fasb issued asu  simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs  which simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring that debt issuance costs related to a recognized liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability consistent with debt discounts the amendments in asu  address the absence of authoritative guidance within asu  for debt issuance costs related to lineofcredit arrangements such that the sec staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the lineofcredit arrangement regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the lineofcredit arrangement asu  and asu  are effective for financial statements of public business entities issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the companys financial position results of operations or cash flows        in september  the fasb issued asu  business combinations simplifying the accounting for measurementperiod adjustments  the amendments in this asu require that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date for public business entities the amendments in this asu are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods within those fiscal years the amendments in this asu should be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not been issued the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows   amendments clarifying guidance in topic  risks and uncertainties are applicable to entities that have not commenced planned principal operations which we have commenced recently   note  – going concern   the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern which contemplates the recoverability of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business as noted above the company is in the development stage and accordingly has not yet generated revenues from operations since inception the company has been engaged in financing activities and executing its business plan of operations and incurring costs and expenses related to its planned direct public offering as a result the company incurred net income losses for the nine month period ended september   and  of  and  respectively the company recognized a onetime debt forgiveness of  the company’s had an accumulated deficit of as of september   and  as of december   additionally the company’s development activities since inception have been primarily sustained through debt financing and the deferral of payments on accounts payable and other expenses   the company recently entered into a convertible debt instrument with a shareholder of its largest shareholder in the amount of  of this amount  was then loaned to the company’s largest shareholder as working capital to pay its operating expenses including legal accounting product development brand expansion and marketing costs the majority shareholder also used the proceeds of these loans to purchase inventory of its initial product scheduled to launch second quarter of    the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to raise capital from the sale of its equity and ultimately the achievement of operating revenues management believes sufficient funding can be secured through the obtaining of loans as well as future offerings of its preferred and common stock to institutional and other financial sources however no assurance can be given that the company will obtain this additional working capital or if obtained that such funding will not cause substantial dilution its shareholders if the company is unable to secure such additional funds from these sources it may be forced to change or delay its business plan rollout   these financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty   note  – intangible assets   intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful life the company monitors conditions related to these assets to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining amortization period the company tests its intangible assets with finite lives for potential impairment whenever management concludes events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable the original estimate of an assets useful life and the impact of an event or circumstance on either an assets useful life or carrying value

percent  ownership interest was obtained by american rebel inc from our former officer and director and founder the company intends to continue with the cubescape business as well as acquire the business of its control shareholder interim financial statements march   unaudited and basis of presentation the accompanying unaudited interim financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap for interim financial information and with the rules and regulations of the united states securities and exchange commission the sec set forth in article  of regulation sx accordingly they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by us gaap for complete financial statements the unaudited interim financial statements furnished reflect all adjustments consisting of normal recurring accruals which are in the opinion of management necessary to a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented unaudited interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full fiscal year these financial statements should be read along with the annual report filed on form k of the company for the period ended december   and notes thereto contained year end the companys yearend is december  cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statements of cash flows all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents the carrying value of these investments approximates fair value revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the product or service has been provided to the consumer  the amount of fees to be paid by the consumer is fixed or determinable and  the collection of our fees or product revenue is probable the company will record revenue when it is realizable and earned and product have been shipped to the consumers or that our service has been rendered to the consumer    advertising costs advertising costs are anticipated to be expensed as incurred however there were no advertising costs for the three months ended march   and  respectively   fair value of financial instruments fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of december   and march   unaudited respectively the respective carrying value of certain onbalancesheet financial instruments approximated their fair values these financial instruments include cash deferred offering costs and accounts payable fair values were assumed to approximate carrying values for cash and payables because they are short term in nature and their carrying amounts approximate fair values or they are payable on demand level  the preferred inputs to valuation efforts are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities with the caveat that the reporting entity must have access to that market information at this level is based on direct observations of transactions involving the same assets and liabilities not assumptions and thus offers superior reliability however relatively few items especially physical assets actually trade in active markets level  fasb acknowledged that active markets for identical assets and liabilities are relatively uncommon and even when they do exist they may be too thin to provide reliable information to deal with this shortage of direct data the board provided a second level of inputs that can be applied in three situations level  if inputs from levels  and  are not available the financial accounting standards board the fasb acknowledges that fair value measures of many assets and liabilities are less precise the board describes level  inputs as unobservable and limits their use by saying they shall be used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available this category allows for situations in which there is little if any market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date earlier in the standard fasb explains that observable inputs are gathered from sources other than the reporting company and that they are expected to reflect assumptions made by market participants stockbased compensation the company records stock based compensation in accordance with the guidance in asc topic  and  which requires the company to recognize expense related to the fair value of its employee stock option awards this eliminates accounting for sharebased compensation transactions using the intrinsic value and requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fairvaluebased method the company recognizes the cost of all sharebased awards on a graded vesting basis over the vesting period of the award   the company accounts for equity instruments issued in exchange for the receipt of goods or services from other than employees in accordance with fasb asc  and the conclusions reached by the fasb asc  costs are measured at the estimated fair market value of the consideration received or the estimated fair value of the equity instruments issued whichever is more reliably measurable the value of equity instruments issued for consideration other than employee services is determined on the earliest of a performance commitment or completion of performance by the provider of goods or services as defined by fasb asc  earnings per share the company follows asc topic  to account for earnings per share basic earnings per common share eps calculations are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year diluted earnings per common share calculations are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common share equivalents outstanding during periods when common stock equivalents if any are antidilutive they are not considered in the computation  income taxes the company follows asc topic  for recording provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based upon the difference between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted marginal tax rate applicable when the related asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled deferred income tax expense or benefit is based on the changes in the asset or liability for each period if available evidence suggests that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized a valuation allowance is required to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized future changes in such valuation allowance are included in the provision for deferred income tax in the period of change   deferred income tax may arise from temporary differences resulting from income and expense items reported for financial accounting and tax purposes in different periods deferred taxes are classified as current or noncurrent depending on the classification of assets and liabilities to which they relate deferred taxes arising from temporary differences that are not related to an asset or liability are classified as current or noncurrent depending on the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse the company applies a morelikelythannot recognition threshold for all tax uncertainties asc topic  only allows the recognition of tax benefits that have a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities as of december   and march   unaudited the company reviewed its tax positions and determined there were no outstanding or retroactive tax positions with less than a  likelihood of being sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities therefore this standard has not had a material effect on the company   the company does not anticipate any significant changes to its total unrecognized tax benefits within the next  months the company classifies taxrelated penalties and net interest as income tax expense for the three month periods ended march   and  respectively no income tax expense has been recorded use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ significantly from those estimates recent pronouncements the company evaluated recent accounting pronouncements through march   and believes that none have a material effect on the companys financial statements except for the following in august  fasb issued asu no  presentation of financial statements  going concern subtopic  disclosure of uncertainties about an entities ability to continue as a going concern  the standard is intended to define managements responsibility to decide whether there is substantial doubt about an organizations ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures the standard requires management to decide whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entitys ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued the standard provides guidance to an organizations management with principles and definitions that are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of disclosures that are commonly provided by organizations in the footnotes the standard becomes effective for the annual period ending after december   with early application permitted the adoption of this pronouncement is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements managements evaluations regarding the events and conditions that raise substantial doubt regarding the companys ability to continue as a going concern are disclosed in note  below  in august  fasb issued asu  revenue from contracts with customers deferral of effective date  in  fasb issued asu  revenue from contracts with customers which provided a framework for addressing revenue recognition issues and replaces almost all existing revenue recognition guidance in current us gaap the core principle of asu  is for companies to recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services asu  also resulted in enhanced disclosures about revenue provide guidance for transactions that were not previously addressed comprehensively and improve guidance for multipleelement arrangements the amendments in asu  defer the effective date of the new revenue recognition guidance to annual reporting periods beginning after december   including interim periods within that reporting period early adoption is permitted to the original effective date december   including interim periods within that reporting period management is evaluating the future impact of this guidance on the companys financial statements and notes thereto in august  fasb issued asu  presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs associated with lineofcredit arrangements  the company previously reported that in april  the fasb issued asu  simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs  which simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring that debt issuance costs related to a recognized liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability consistent with debt discounts the amendments in asu  address the absence of authoritative guidance within asu  for debt issuance costs related to lineofcredit arrangements such that the sec staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the lineofcredit arrangement regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the lineofcredit arrangement asu  and asu  are effective for financial statements of public business entities issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the companys financial position results of operations or cash flows in september  the fasb issued asu  business combinations simplifying the accounting for measurementperiod adjustments  the amendments in this asu require that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date for public business entities the amendments in this asu are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods within those fiscal years the amendments in this asu should be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not been issued the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the companys financial position results of operations or cash flows in august the fasb issued asu no  topic  statement of cash flows  classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments update no   the amendments in the asu address eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice as the issues are either unclear or do not have specific guidance under current gaap asu  will be effective on january   the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements amendments clarifying guidance in topic  risks and uncertainties are applicable to entities that have not commenced planned principal operations which we have commenced recently note   going concern   the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern which contemplates the recoverability of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business as noted above the company is in the development stage and accordingly has not yet generated revenues from operations since inception the company has been engaged in financing activities and executing its business plan of operations and incurring costs and expenses related to its planned direct public offering as a result the company incurred accumulated net losses for the three month periods ended march   and  of  and  respectively in addition the companys development activities since inception have been sustained through debt financing and the deferral of payments on accounts payable and other expenses the company recently entered into a convertible debt instrument with shareholders of its largest shareholder in the amount of  of this amount  was loaned to the companys largest shareholder as a working capital loan to pay its operating expenses including legal accounting product development brand expansion and marketing costs the majority shareholder also used the proceeds to purchase inventory for its product launch scheduled for the second quarter of   the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to raise capital from the sale of its equity and ultimately the achievement of operating revenues management believes sufficient funding can be secured through the obtaining of loans as well as future offerings of its preferred and common stock to institutional and other financial sources however no assurance can be given that the company will obtain this additional working capital or if obtained that such funding will not cause substantial dilution its shareholders if the company is unable to secure such additional funds from these sources it may be forced to change or delay its business plan rollout these financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty note   intangible assets intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful life the company monitors conditions related to these assets to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining amortization period the company tests its intangible assets with finite lives for potential impairment whenever management concludes events or changes

using blackscholes and the following assumptions   expected volatility was based primarily on historical volatility historical volatility was computed using daily pricing observations for recent periods the companys common stock has not traded so the volatility computation was based on other similarly situated companies the company believes this method produced an estimate that was representative of the companys expectations of future volatility over the expected term which due to their maturity period as expiry it was three years the company had no reason to believe future volatility over the expected remaining life of these common stock equivalents was likely to differ materially from historical volatility expected life was based on three years due to the expiry of

statement reader should read our risk factors in full our plan to continue as a going concern is to reach the point where we begin generating sufficient revenues from our web based businesss or services to meet our obligations on a timely basis the company has not yet acquired or internally fully developed any services we may not be able to acquire or internally develop any services in the future because of a lack of available funds or financing to do so in order for us to develop or acquire any services we must be able to secure the necessary financing beyond just the proceeds of our recently completed direct public offering in the early stages of our operations we will continue to keep costs to a minimum the cost to develop our business plan as currently outlined will be in excess of  we have no established current sources of funds to undertake the business plan as outlined until we obtain funding if ever we will keep our operating costs as low as possible with our founder and ceo providing substantially all of the work on his own without any cash compensation this methodology would result in our development stage extending for at least two to three years if we are unable to obtain adequate funding or financing the company faces the ultimate likelihood of business failure there are no assurances that we will be able to raise any funds or establish any financing program for the companys growth  business there is no way of accurately predicting when product development will progress to the point of generating any revenue the timing of development is a function of having sufficient working capital there is no way of knowing when or if we will be able to raise the funds necessary if we do services could be ready within three to nine months following when the necessary funds have been secured if we do not raise sufficient financing revenue producing activities of any kind will most likely not commence for at least  months if ever we are building a company that provides cubicle and office wall covering solutions we are developing a proprietary website system design portal that provides customization of an extensive library of art and stock photography our design portal will enable consumers to create custom wall coverings that create an atmosphere that transcends the normal cubicle environment the user will have access to diverse categories of art and they will be able to input their own cubicle dimension and layout oriented the art to view points with precise fit to their cubicle walls our intended design portal ecommerce system and drop ship services outline a threestep method for providing users with what we believe to be a comprehensive approach to office and cubicle design we believe this approach will provide an experience in office design that will become the new way to empower cube jockeys with a sense of satisfaction from their work space valued by both employees and management we believe this acceptance in office work space will provide rapid growth and popularity we will create a system that easy to use and promotes creativity this approach will additionally help us in creating longlasting return customer relationships our business operations is comprised of two segments a design portal for internet users and b integration services for the office furnishings market we are developing the design portal middleware and backoffice framework with the assistance of an established software development firm the software development firm with which the company has been working with is utilized on an as needed basis we developed the initial design portal framework and coding through both internal and outside sources we have not yet formalized relationships with manufacturers of our product drop ship partners or resellers that we intend to use the company intends to seek the help of outside sales representatives and marketing consultants to develop a professional sales and marketing strategy to capitalize on these technologies we intend to pursue this strategy with further financing and hire an inhouse web design and support group the company continues to work on the development of its design portal through the management and skills of its founder and ceo as well as through a web development firm which has been working with us on an as needed basis and as our budget allows to date no commercial website or services have been developed through these efforts   the company believes our customer will come primarily from social media advertising word of mouth and specific technology conferences and conventions our plan to continue as a going concern is to reach the point where we begin generating sufficient revenues from our web based businesss or services to meet our obligations on a timely basis the company has not yet acquired or internally fully developed any services we may not be able to acquire or internally develop any services in the future because of a lack of

to generate revenues earlier than the corporate direct sales once developed if at all if we are unable to obtain adequate funding or financing the company faces the ultimate likelihood of business failure there are no assurances that we will be able to raise any funds or establish any financing program for the companys growth  industry overview privacychallenged office workers may find it hard to believe but openplan offices and cubicles were invented by architects and designers trying to make the work space world a better place who thought that to break down the social walls that divide people you had to break down the real walls as well early th century modernist architects such as frank lloyd wright saw walls and rooms as downright fascist in their presentation the spaciousness and flexibility of an open plan they thought would liberate homeowners and office dwellers from the confines of their boxes businesses took up the idea less out of a democratic ideology than a desire to pack in as many workers as they could the typical openplan office during the first half of the th century contained long rows of desks occupied by office clerks in a whitecollar assembly line cubicles were interior designers attempt to bring some soul back in to the office space in the s a german design firm broke up the rows of desks assembly line into organic groupings with partitions for privacy  what it called the bürolandschaft or office landscape in  famous furniture design company herman miller introduced the action office system this offered such improvements as greater surfaces and multiple desk heights in  herman miller began to sell its system in modular components with the unfortunate consequence of businesses cherrypicking the spacesaving aspects of these designs leaving out the humanizing touch herman miller designer robert propst was tasked to find problems outside the furniture industry and conceive solutions for them probsts nickname the father of the cubicle is a misnomer when probst designed the action office system cubicle farms or the very notion of it were not his intent his own research into developing the action office philosophically was contrary to the actual cubicle in many ways the action office system was designed to promote productivity privacy and health at the expense of inefficient use of space cubicles are now typically designed to maximize the efficient use of space the efficient cubicle became popular in office design mostly because of the movable wall in the action office ii system this saved money in construction and development costs after their introduction into the marketplace the action office ii and other office furniture systems were modified to pack in as many employees as possible into an office space this progression was contrary to probsts vision probst stated that the cubiclizing of people in the modern corporation is monolithic insanity during this era businesses began to shift their employees not only clerks but all into openplan offices which maximized space today companies are reverting to precubicle rows of desks now called pods to make them sound vaguely futuristic which will still need our individualist wraparound wall coverings although open plans foster ambient awareness and teamwork an article published in a major asian health journal found that open plans cause conflict high blood pressure and increased staff turnover the next wave of idealistic office furniture planning may strive to achieve aesthetically pleasing and healthy alternatives for cube jockeys who spend eight to ten work hours per day living in based on industry reports online sales of graphic wall coverings of which cubicle work spaces are a large part of in the united states may surpass  million per annum over the next five years this represents more than  million in sales which represents a significant increase to current spending of wall covering graphics and other byproducts direct sales are hard to predict year over year we believe the confluence of a need for large nonpermanent graphic art in combination with the recent advances of printing printing substrates adhesives and online customization present an opportunity for us to position our business to introduce our products and services to new consumers office space planning and design are vital components to achieving optimal office space plans to achieve desired goals most planners work with professionals that are both knowledgeable in the art and science of computer aided design cad these skills are an invaluable asset and an effective tool office space planning consultants with whom we plan to work with should be able to assist us in need and planning of our products to be integrated in successful office space projects which we will make available to them this relationship building with office planning and design professionals should be helpful in suggesting our products and services for aesthetically pleasing cubicle design coverings competitive focus we believe the following will assist us in exploiting the expected growth in custom designed wraparound cubicle and wall covering market  scalability  we believe our design portal and services will become scalable a solution designed to serve the underserved fragmented office cubicle design market  sticky consumer relationships  our business model will provide a solution that is designed to act as a competitive barrier and keep the user engaged with our design portal   expertise in aesthetics  our founder has extensive experience art and aesthetics which comes from his vast experience in the game development industry we will seek to capitalize on that expertise  speed to implementation  we believe that a fullydeveloped design portal and vertical distribution system will provide immediate insight into the usage and behavior of our customers assets growth strategy key elements of our growth strategy shall include  core products  we plan to enhance our core products through user interface and functionality with our design portal as well as progressive and relevant new features and offerings as soon as reasonably practicable  focus  we intend to organically grow market penetration by a securing contracts with office designers in various markets b exploiting social networks c leveraging development opportunities and d adding solutions to professionals in the market  strategic alliances  we plan to team with other businesses that have complementary features to our products when fully developed thereby reducing our development cost and introducing us to consumers and endusers  international expansion  we intend to expand internationally through partnerships and alliances business objective our objective is to become a provider of cubicle panel and nonpermanent wall coverings we are perusing the following strategies to achieve this object  initiating website development and ecommerce function identifying service offerings promoting and advertising through social media campaigns  create a national media presence through social media  we will seek to create and enhance a national awareness and aggressively market our products through social media outlets  identify and develop strategic relations with our drop ship partners  utilize partners high volume distribution facility to create highly efficient low cost production model aesthetically pleasing cubicle environments we believe contribute to an employees overall productivity and sense of wellbeing cubicle environments can convey a sense of mission reinforcing a business culture that an employer worked hard to develop we will provide a comprehensive selection of coverings that can be themed oriented or business branded enhancing that culture and productivity every cubicle may not have a spectacular window view but with cubescapes product offerings we can provide a view to vistas for the occupant cubescape products can transform any neutral cubicle space into an inspirational space for all to enjoy not just the occupants we believe that clients and contractors visiting offices decked out in cubescape products will instantly recognize our business mission depictions of communities are displayed in a variety of graphic form printed wall murals large photographic panels along with artistic window graphics can reinforce what any business is all about this report includes very limited market and industry data and forecasts that we obtained from internal research publicly available information and industry publications and surveys the industry in which we operate is subject to a high degree of uncertainty and risk due to a variety of factors including those described in the section entitled risk factors the following timeline outlines the steps that we intend to take each step outlines the metrics or performance that we must accomplish in order to move forward with our business plan step one qq  est costs website development work with established webhosting businesses and web developer to stand up cubescapebiz website test edi functionality to drop ship partners and financial institutions  step two qq  est costs ecommerce finalize strategic relations with ecommerce provide to integrate back office functionality between website selected ecommerce system servers step three qq  est costs drop ship partners establish ordering system between website and drop ship partners verify system functionality with ecommerce solution providers test entire order process through to shipment verification step four q  est costs direct sales develop direct sales strategy with consultants work with consultants to identify and approach manufacturers and corporate design specialist as mentioned above our steps are predicated upon the company obtaining financing either through additional equity or debt beyond our recently completed direct public offering if we are not able to obtain the financing as determined by the above steps we will not be able to meet or achieve any of the timeline objectives if we complete    or even  of our additional financing objectives we will not be able to pursue any of our action steps in that case the company will be forced to proceed on a piecemeal basis using the services of our founder and ceo and the very limited use of outside contractors when and if limited funds are obtained our founder and ceo currently devotes in excess of  hours a week to our continued business efforts there is no realistic way to predict the timing or completion in that scenario without additional financing we will not be able to pursue our business plan or its timeline objectives and the company may fail entirely it is our plan to seek additional financing from either equity financing or through debt instruments companys management has through relationships and partnerships begun the necessary work on some of our intended products our founder and ceo has primarily provided these services through the date of this report our business plan requires further completion of these tasks which require the hiring of employees andor outside contractors with the level of sophistication and expertise of our founder and ceo as well as other various professionals that he knows the company should make progress in its development planned product but currently no specific timeframe can be provided most if not all of these actions are predicated on the company obtaining the necessary financing to accomplish these steps if financing is not available on terms reasonable to the company and its shareholders then the progression steps of this business plan will not occur as planned and may never occur we currently have no sources of financing and no commitments for financing there are no assurances that we will obtain sufficient financing or the necessary resources to enter into contractual agreements with outside developers or sales or marketing firms we currently do not have any cash or other resources to commence the use of outside service providers if we do not receive any funding or financing our business is likely to be maintained with limited operations for at least the next  months because our founder and ceo will continue to provide his services without consideration we have no formal agreement in place with our founder and ceo covering his services our founders and ceos plan is to do all of the administrative and planning work as well as programming and marketing work on his own without consideration while he continues to seek other sources of funding for the company other as a corporate policy we will not incur any cash obligations that we cannot satisfy with known resources of which there are currently none except as described in liquidity below or elsewhere in this report we believe that the perception that many people have of a public company make it more likely that they will accept restricted securities from a public company as consideration for indebtedness to them than they would from a private company we have not performed any studies of this matter our conclusion is based on our own observations however there can be no assurances that we will be successful in any of those efforts even if we become a public entity additionally the issuance of restricted shares will dilute the percentage of ownership interest of our stockholders  results of operations for the three month period ended march   expenses expenses for the three month period ended march   and  were  and

month period ended march   was  we recorded no provision for federal or state income taxes we have not generated any revenues liquidity we paid all costs related to our recently completed direct public offering which was approximately  our operating expenses will be paid as and when necessary or otherwise accrued absent the ability to pay current obligations from available funds we will need to seek out financial assistance from shareholders or various third parties who may agree to loan us the funds to cover outstanding professional and related fees to the extent that such liabilities cannot be extended or satisfied in other ways we may seek outside financing or loans if and when loaned these loans most likely will be evidenced by noninterestbearing unsecured notes treated as loans until repaid if and when the company has the financial ability to do so no formal written arrangement exists with respect to anyones commitment to loan us funds for this purpose since acquiring our business plan most of our resources and work have been devoted to executing the business plan limited writing and testing of software code testing and mockup of our internet portal and smartphone app to be used with our intended product implementing systems and controls and completing the registration statement with the registration statement completed we our refocusing our work on product and service offerings as well as the development of our proprietary software for internal use we believe the development work needed to initiate and complete software development attract developers and initiate our marketing plans including the development of a saleable product will range between  and  if outside contractors and experts are used if we are able to secure funding to outsource these procedures of which there can be no assurance we can commence the launch of our intended product and services to the end user or consumer if we are only able to use internal resources only primarily consisting of the services of our founder and ceo the process will take much longer and our initial launch may be limited to a much smaller target market if we are unable to raise any funds the development costs would have to be provided by our founder and ceo to the extent that he is capable and willing to provide such funds while we have engaged the services of a software development firm which we use on an as needed basis their function and assistance is limited our goal would be to have product and our internet portal available sales channels and a comprehensive website up and running within one year but there is no way of estimating what the likelihood of achieving that goal would be private capital will be solicited from business associates of our founder and ceo or through private investors referred to us by those same business associates to date we have not sought any funding source and have not authorized any person or entity to seek out funding on our behalf if a market for our shares ever develops of which there can be no assurances we may use restricted shares of our common stock to compensate employees consultants and independent contractors whenever possible we cannot predict the likelihood or source of raising capital or funds needed to complete the development of our product and the stages as outlined above  we have embarked upon an effort to become a public company and by doing so have incurred and will continue to incur additional significant expenses for legal accounting and related services once we become a public entity subject to the reporting requirements of the exchange act of  we will incur ongoing expenses associated with professional fees for accounting legal and a host of other expenses including annual reports and proxy statements if required we estimate these costs to be in excess of  per year and may be higher if our business volume or business activity increases significantly our current estimate of costs does not include the necessary expenses associated with compliance documentation and specific reporting requirements of section  as we will not be subject to the full reporting requirements of section  until we exceed  million in market capitalization or we decide to optout of the emerging growth company as defined under the jobs act this exemption is available to us under the jobs act or until we have been public for more than five years these obligations we believe reduce our ability and resources to expand our business we hope to be able to use our status as a public company to increase our ability to use noncash means of settling obligations ie issuance of restricted shares of our common stock and compensate independent contractors who provide professional services to us although there can be no assurances that we can be successful in any of those efforts we will reduce compensation paid to management if and when we do compensate management which for the foreseeable future is limited if there is insufficient cash generated from operations to satisfy these costs we do not have any current plans to raise funds through the sale of securities except as set forth herein we hope to be able to use our status as a public company to enable us to use noncash means of settling obligations and compensate persons or firms providing services to us although there can be no assurances that we can be successful in any of those efforts we believe that the perception that many people have of a public company make it more likely that they will accept restricted securities from a public company as consideration for indebtedness to them than they would from a private company we have not performed any studies of this matter our conclusion is based on our own beliefs and the advice that we have received from various business professionals issuing shares of common stock to such persons instead of paying cash to them may increase our chances to establish and expand our business and business opportunities having shares of our common stock may also give persons a greater feeling of identity with us which may result in referrals however these actions if successful will result in dilution of the ownership interests of existing shareholders may further dilute common stock book value and that dilution may be material such issuances may also serve to enhance existing managements ability to maintain control of csi because the shares may be issued to parties or entities committed to supporting existing management csi may offer shares of its common stock to settle a portion of the professional fees incurred in connection with its registration statement no negotiations have taken place with any professional and no assurances can be made as to the likelihood that any professional will accept shares in settlement of obligations due them as of march   we owed approximately  in connection with software development costs incurred consulting services and other expenses we have not entered into any formal agreements written or oral with any vendors or other providers for payment of services or expenses there are no other significant liabilities as of march   since

events that raise substantial doubt about the entitys ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued the standard provides guidance to an organizations management with principles and definitions that are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of disclosures that are commonly provided by organizations in the footnotes

addressing revenue recognition issues and replaces almost all existing revenue recognition guidance in current us gaap the core principle of asu  is for companies to recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services asu  also resulted in enhanced

issued asu  simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs  which simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring that debt issuance costs related to a recognized liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability consistent with debt discounts the amendments in asu  address the absence of authoritative guidance within asu  for debt issuance costs related to lineofcredit arrangements such that the sec staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the lineofcredit arrangement regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the lineofcredit arrangement asu  and
