description this invention relates to device for heating water and more particularly to a hot water heater employing as a fuel either gas natural or artificial gasoline or fuel oil a general object of the invention is to improve gas hot water heaters now in general use and the invention consists in the combination and arrangement of parts as hereinafter more specifically set out being illustrated in the drawings described in the accompanying specification and as specifically pointed out in the appended claim the invention together with its objects and advantages will be best understood from a study of the following description taken in connection with the accompanying drawings wherein figure  is a vertical sectional view through the heater figure  is a horizontal sectional view taken substantially on the line  of figure  figure  is a bottom plan view of the heater referring to the drawings by reference numerals it will be seen that the hot water heater comprises a casing having an outer jacket  of insulating material an upper elongated heating chamber ii and a lower shorter chamber  legs  of any suitable type may be provided for the heater at the top of the chamber ii there is manifold chamber  to which is connected a flue pipe 5 extending through the top of the casing arranged in the chamber i i and opening at one end into the chamber  and at an opposite or upper end into a manifold chamber  are vertically disposed suitably arranged heating coils  through which the hot gases from the chamber  pass upwardly to exit through the flue 5 and for the purpose of heating the water within the chamber  extending downwardly into the water chamber  through the top of the heater and terminating in spaced relation to the bottom of the chamber  is a cold water supply pipe  a hot water pipe  for drawing off the hot water from the chamber ii has an end extending through the top of the heater and connected with the top or dome of the chamber ii as shown in figure  thus it will be seen that cold water entering the chamber ii through the pipe  will be heated and can be drawn off through the pipe  suitably mounted within the chamber  immediately beneath the bottom of the chamber i i is a water coil 9 one end of which is connected with a vertical intake pipe  that extends upwardly into the chamber  through the bottom of the chamber i while the other end of the coil 9 is connected with a longer pipe  that also extends upwardly into the chamber ii through the bottom thereof thus it will be seen that certain of the water from the chamber ii may circulate through the coil 9 entering the coil through the pipe  and returning to the chamber  through the pipe  thus adding to the capacity of the heater while hot water drawn from the chamber ii through the pipe  may be used for heating purposes hot water may also be drawn from the chamber i for other domestic use through the medium of a pipe a coil  connected with the pipe and faucets not shown connected with the coil  in this connection it will be noted that one end of pipe a is tapped into the heater to communicate or connect with the chamber i while the other end of the pipe a exteriorly of the heater is connected with one end of the coil  the coil  is arranged in the chamber  of the heater between the coil 9 and the gas burner  connected with the coil  is a water distributing line w serving to connect the coil with faucets throughout the house or building thus it will be seen that water will pass from the chamber ii through the pipe  to circulate through the coil  where it is heated and passing from the coil be carried off to the faucets the gas burner  may be of any suitable construction and is provided with the usual valve  access may be had to the burner  for igniting the same through a door or the like not shown provided for the chamber  this chamber  as clearly shown in figure  is also provided with a bottom a equipped with a suitable draft damper 5 of the butterfly type for controlling the passage of air into the chamber  to promote combustion from the above it will be apparent that a heater comprising the features of the present invention can be economically constructed and maintained and that the water heated thereby may be utilized for heating purposes and for other domestic uses having thus described the invention what is claimed as new is in a hot water heater a casing provided with a water compartment a manifold chamber above the water compartment and a burner compartment below the water compartment an exit flue extending from the top of said

the burner chamber and upper ends opening into the manifold chamber a burner in said burner compartment a water coil in said burner compartment above the burner piping connecting one end of said coil with the water compartment said coil having an opposite end adapted to be connected to faucets or the like for drawing off heated water from the coil a second coil arranged within the burner compartment long and short pipes respectively disposed vertically within the water compartment each of said pipes having a lower end extending into the burner compartment and the lower end of one of
