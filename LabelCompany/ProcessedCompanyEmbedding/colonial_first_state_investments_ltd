need to speak to your employer you can also get in touch with the australian tax office ato around any information about choosing a super fund check with your current employer to find out if you choose your own fund there is also information available on government websites about choosing your own fund if you can choose your own fund your employer will supply a standard choice form when you

taxed at the maximum rate this also ensures your super account is easy to findthere are some things to look out for when comparing the merits of various super funds these includefees how much a fund charges in fees is very important to know as it can have a big impact on how much superannuation you ultimately receive in your retirementinvestment options make sure you are comfortable with the kinds of investment options the superannuation fund offers such as acceptable returns without too much riskperformance choose a fund that has been performing consistently well over the last five years or soinsurance look at what insurance options the fund offers and whether they represent good value for moneyextra benefits sometimes your employer could make additional contributions for you above the  threshold this means more money in your super accountcustomer service get in touch with the customer service centre or browse its website to see what other benefits they offerif you are comparing superannuation funds because you are thinking about switching to a new fund bear in mind that there may be hidden penalties for doing so before switching make sure that the exit fees from your old fund don’t cancel out the benefits of your new fund also consider any forms of insurance you may have with your old fund if you lose this cover by switching funds it may be harder to get equivalent

accumulation funds or defined benefit fundsaccumulation fundsaccumulation funds grow your money over time in an accumulation fund you bear the risk that your super will payout will be lower if financial markets drop your final payout figure is determined byhow much you and your employer have contributedhow much you have earned from investmentshow much your fund has charged you in fees over the yearsthe investment option you choosehow much you receive in bonus contributionsdefined benefit fundsdefined benefit funds are determined by fund rules in a defined benefit fund your employer or the fund generally takes on the investment risk be aware that defined benefit funds can be affected by market downturns and some employers or funds may have difficulty taking on the market risk your final superannuation payout is determined byhow much you and your employer have contributedhow long you have worked for your employeryour final salary when you retiredefined benefit funds are less common than accumulation funds and are often only available to public sector or corporate employees the majority of superannuation funds these days are accumulation funds which are usually available to everyonetipnever leave a defined benefit fund unless youre very sure that you will be better off some of them are very generousthe seven basic types of superannuation funds are as followsmysuper many super funds offer an account called mysuper and these will eventually replace default accounts default super accounts and automatically chosen by your employer if you dont select one mysuper accounts offer lower fees simple features and single or life stage investment optionsretail funds retail funds are run by financial institutions for a profit and are the most common type of superannuation fund available membership is open to everyone and they offer a large variety of investment options but they also charge fees for their servicesindustry funds industry funds are sometimes open to everyone but membership is often restricted to those working in a particular industry they are usually lowfee funds because industry funds are notforprofit all profits are reinvested in the fundpublic sector funds public sector funds restrict membership to federal and state government employees like industry funds they are usually lowfee funds and the profits are returned into the fund for the benefit of members corporate funds corporate funds are arranged by companies for their employees they may be run by the company itself in which case the profits will be reinvested or they may be run by an outside retail fund in which case some profits will be retained by that fund selfmanaged super funds smsf selfmanaged super funds are set up by individuals often to gain more control over their superannuation members of an smsf must also be trustees unless a corporate trustee is appointed and they are ultimately responsible for the management of the fund including investment and taxation complianceeligible rollover funds erf an eligible rollover fund is a holding account for lost or inactive members with low account balances these funds often have low investment returns and may charge high fees your money is likely to grow faster if you merge your erf with your active super fundsuperannuation for individualsindividuals can grow their superannuation in four main waysemployer contributions this is the main source of money paid into an individual’s superannuation account according to the superannuation guarantee an employer must pay at least  of an employee’s gross salary into their superannuation account every quarteremployee contributions an individual can also make extra contributions over and above what their employer contributes the government may match employee contributions but they are capped at  per year after which the tax rate jumps from  to  this is to prevent high income earners from using superannuation as a cheap form of investmentsalary sacrifice this is similar to employee contributions except that it involves making a pretax rather than posttax contribution to your superannuation which effectively increases your contribution while reducing your taxable income however salary sacrifice still counts towards the  capgovernment contributions you may be eligible for either the super cocontribution or the lowincome super contribution lisc or both meaning the government will add to your super you dont need to apply for lisc or the cocontribution if youre eligible have lodged your tax return and your fund has your tfn the government will pay it to your fund automatically the governments contribution is a maximum of  as of more on salary sacrificeyouve heard this term before but what does it mean if you earn more than  you may want to consider salary sacrificing due to tax benefits by choosing to sacrifice a portion of your beforetax salary into your super fund you get taxed at  if your marginal income tax rate is more than  this could provide benefits salary sacrifice will boost your superdue to the benefits the government has imposed a limit on how much you can sacrifice per year most can salary sacrifice up to  inclusive of the existing  guaranteed contribution there are higher caps for people aged over  this amount is  inclusive of the  keep track of your super by regularly going online and monitoring the performance of your super fund superannuation is an investment and with any investment comes some risk so if you want to be sure that your super is still performing well check your fund regularlywhat are the tax benefits of supersuper has become one of the most cost effective ways to save towards retirement because of the tax benefits favourable tax rates mean that the maximum tax rate on your employers contribution and on the income you earn from the investments made via the fund will be  contributions made through salary sacrifice are taxed at  once you reach the age of  you should be able to withdraw your super benefits tax free either as a lump sum or as an income stream you may even be able to enjoy tax benefits if you are contributing to the super of your spousetax offsetfor those who receive income from a super fund source you could be entitled to these tax offsets of the taxed element of the untaxed elementyour payment summary will show how much tax offset is available to youif youre under  years of age youre not entitled to tax offsets from a super fund source unless its coming from adisability super benefitdeath benefit income streamdeath benefit income streamif youre under  years of age youre not entitled to tax offsets from a super fund source unless its coming from aa death benefit income stream and the deceased died after they turned  years oldsuperannuation for employersas an employer you have an obligation to pay your employees  of their gross salary into their super fund every quarter this minimum amount is called the super guarantee sg employees include contractors if you are paying them mostly for their labour and also temporary australian residents the super fund must be one nominated by the employee or if they have no preference one nominated by you or a default fund it must be a complying super fund and you will be required to supply the fund with your employee’s tfnif you do not pay the required amount for each employee into their fund by the due date in each quarter you will be required to pay a super guarantee charge which is effectively a late payment penalty you will be charged interest on what is owed as well as an administration fee records you will need to keep regarding employee superannuation payments include a record of how much super was paid for each employee how that amount was calculated and evidence that employees were offered the choice of which superannuation fund they wished to contribute toin summary you need to pay super unless this situation applies to youyoure a nonresident employe working outside of australiayoure a foreign executive who holds certain visas or entry permitsyoure an employees paid under the community development employment programyoure a member of the army naval or air forceyoure an employee temporarily working in australia covered by a bilateral super agreement youll need to keep a copy of the employees certificate of coverage to verify the exemptionhow to maximise your supermany people usually ignore superannuation and dont want to look after it this is not smart there are some very straightforward steps that will help you maximise your super here are five actions that you should consider doingaccept more risk one of the best ways to get more from your super involves adopting an agebased investment strategy this includes working out how much risk you can afford to take based on your years to retirement age is crucial because if you have more years to your retirement youll have more time to recover from a major setback you can also use more years to contribute more to your super as for older australians those in retirement often become obsessed with avoiding investment loses and so increase their risk of getting poor returns and running out of money try to avoid this common errordump your fund if necessary make sure you are constantly monitoring your funds performance especially the longterm performance if the investment option is performing poorly its time to do something you may be able to switch investment options but sometimes you will have to change super funds entirely its also important to check insurance fees and not just the funds performance most employees have the right to switch super funds but this is not for everyoneset up a selfmanaged super fund smsf if youre prepared to put in the effort as well as take on responsibility for managing your super its worth considering setting up an smsf having an smsf can help you get more out of your super in a range of ways including saving fees although an smsf may cost more to start with youll have the option of controlling how your super is investedmaximising your tax breaks contributions to super made by or on behalf of employees and which are financed out of pretax income are taxed in effect at  this generates a valuable tax saving for most people since most employees have a marginal tax rate of at least  direct part of your pretax salary into your super and this is a smart way to maximise your savingsstart early make more starting to save from an early age can make a huge difference to how much you have when you retire mainly due to the power of compounding for example if someone saved  a year for  years while someone else saved the same amount for  years both earning a return of  a year the  year compounding amount would generate  and the  year saver would generate   more than three times as muchare selfmanaged super funds smsf right for methere has been a growing trend in recent years for individuals who are frustrated with the way their superannuation is being managed to start their own super fund managing your own superannuation gives you greater control over where your money is invested and provides access to less conservative investment opportunities than those available to the average retail fund such as shares direct property and alternative asset classes however with this greater freedom comes greater risk most conventional superannuation funds concentrate on conservative options for the majority of their investments which may only produce moderate returns but are also relatively lowrisk putting your super funds into higher risk investments may produce higher returns but it could also lead to disaster if you don’t know what youre doing because of this smsfs are more suited to those with the time and financial and legal expertise to manage a fund so that opportunities are maximised and exposure is kept to a minimum selfmanaged super funds can also be very costly to run because the members are also trustees they are solely responsible for all aspects of the fund including legislative compliance and taxation an smsf can have one to four membersduties and obligations of an smsf trusteethese include but are not limited toensuring that the fund is run solely for the purpose of providing retirement benefits to its membersmanaging investments in accordance with the law and in the best interests of fund membersensuring that personal and fund business affairs are kept entirely separate from each otherarranging an annual audit of the fund by an approved smsf auditor and reporting to the ato on the fund’s managementcarry out the role of trustee or director which imposes important legal duties on youset and follow an investment strategy that ensures the fund is likely to meet your retirement needsimportant note if you decide to set up an smsf you are personally liable for all the decisions made by the fund even if you get help from a professional

example their age and retirement needshow do i find my lost superanother trend in recent years has been the search for lost and unclaimed superannuation because people tend to move around a lot more than they used to both between jobs and residential addresses many super accounts have become lost or been left behind to sit in funds and gather dust while still attracting fees consequently the government has undertaken an awareness campaign to remind people that there are literally billions of dollars in unclaimed superannuation out there and some of it may be yours the ato has created an online search platform known as superseeker which people can use to search for any superannuation associated with their name or tax file number if any old superannuation accounts are found the ato will give you the details of the fund in question and provide information on how to go about rolling this super into your current super fund having several superannuation accounts scattered around in different places all attracting their own set of fees and charges could be seriously reducing your overall super investment by rolling them all into one fund you will then know exactly where your money is and will only pay one set of feesrollover superhow many super statements did you receive this year is it hard to keep track of your different super accounts here are some of the benefits of putting your super into one accountyou save costs by paying only one set of feesyou reduce your paperworkyou make it easier to keep track of your superif youve located an old super account and now wish to roll it into one fund these are the steps to takecomplete a rollover initiation request form nat  and send it to the superannuation fund that has your old account requesting them to transfer your super to your nominated fundthe superannuation fund that has your old account will usually process your request within three working daysonce the transfer has been completed you will be sent a rollover benefits statement which you should check carefully and retain for your recordstell your employer and make sure they know where to pay your super and how to correctly identify you to the fundbefore deciding which fund to roll your super into you need to consider which one offers the best options and what penalties may be imposed by other funds for closing old accounts things to look at includewhich fund offers the lowest feeswhich fund has the best investment track recordwhat exit and entry fees may applywhether you will lose any insurance cover that would be hard to replaceas with any financial decision if you are at all uncertain about your options regarding rollover super seek professional advice before making any decisions that may affect your retirement nest egghow much you will need for your retirementmany people ask themselves how much they are going to need for their retirement but this question is difficult to answer because there are so many different factors to take into consideration if you are still relatively young the cost of living could be far higher by the time you retire you also need to consider possible changes to your circumstances which will also factor into how much you need for your retirement some of the things that you need to consider in terms of expenses when you retire includehow much you will need for accommodation you may be one of the lucky ones who will be living in your home with the mortgage all paid off by the time you retire on the other hand you may be in rented accommodation and will therefore still have to factor rental costs into your income needsmaintenance costs if you live in rented accommodation many of the costs related to home maintenance will already be covered by your landlord however if you plan to be living in your own home you will need to ensure that you have money available to deal with any maintenance costsbills and rates when you retire you still have to pay bills and rates you should think about the different bills and rates that you will need to cover when you retirefood and clothing other essentials that you will need to consider when working out what your outgoings will be when you retire include food and clothingvehicle maintenance if you plan to be independent and travel in your own vehicle when you retire youll also need to think about the cost of running and maintaining a vehicle which includes the cost of petrol tax insurance and any repairs and servicing that may be requiredhealthcare and medical expenses its a sad fact but our health tends to deteriorate as we get older even if you are healthy now you still need to think about covering the cost of health care and medical expenses when you retireinsurance cover you may have a range of insurance policies that you need to stay on top of when you retire such as vehicle insurance home insurance medicalhealth insurance and life insurance although the individual premiums may not be huge the costs can mount upother costs youll also need to think about the things you may want to do when you retire unless you plan to spend your retirement sitting in the house looking at four walls you need to think about the cost of entertainment how much you might need if you are planning to travel and even the cost of enjoying more time with your loved ones such as visiting relatives or taking the grandkids out you may also want to consider putting money aside to help your loved ones as many grandparents these days like to provide financial assistance to their grownup kids or grandkidsthe general rule of thumb is that you should aim for around  of your preretirement income in order to enjoy a comfortable retirement although this will depend on the financial commitments and outgoings you think you will have by the time you retirewhen can i withdraw my supersuper benefits are subject to rules to protect your entitlements sometimes youll be able to withdraw your super early but there are preservation rules that prevent you from accessing your benefits until you satisfy a condition of release there are several preservation rules and your super may include one or more of the following categories of benefitspreserved benefits these include all contributions and all earnings for the period after  june  preserved benefits can only be paid to you if you meet a condition of releaserestricted nonpreserved benefits these include all contributions you made between  july  and  june  as with preserved benefits these can only be paid to you if you meet a condition of releaseunrestricted nonpreserved benefits these include money held in your fund that you can access at any time if your funds rules allow itsuper laws provide specific rules for when you can access your super these are called conditions of release in addition the trust deed of your super fund may set out more restrictive rules around payment of benefits you can access your super when you meet these conditions of releasereach your preservation age and retirereach your preservation age and choose to begin a transition to retirement income stream while you are still workingare  years old even if you have not retiredsuperannuation contributionswhether you work on a fulltime basis a parttime basis or even on a casual basis if you earn  or more per month you will be entitled to superannuation guarantee contributions this is where your employer must contribute  of your salary as super this must be paid at least quarterly and your employer should inform you of the contributions that have been made towards your super its important to remember that you can also make personal voluntary contributions to your super which is highly recommended if you want to enjoy a more comfortable retirement its best to do this through what is known as salary sacrifice where the money comes out of your pretax salary this is because you will then benefit from the lower contribution tax rate of  rather than being taxed at your personal tax rate which could be up to  in short the contributions that go towards your super can come from the following sourcescompulsory contributions made by your employersalary sacrifice contributions made from your pretax paypersonal contributions that you make from your taxed incomegovernment contributions through the cocontribution or liscwithdrawing preserved funds from your superthe basic idea behind your superannuation fund is that you build up a retirement nest egg through the investments made by the trustees who manage the funds on behalf of members therefore under normal circumstances you cannot get your hands on the preserved funds from your super until you retire however there are other extenuating circumstances under which you may be able to withdraw your preserved funds such aswhen you retire your preserved funds are generally made available when you retire which could be between the ages of  and  depending on your date of birthtotal and permanent disability you may be able to withdraw your preserved contributions if you suffer total and permanent disabilityterminal illness you can withdraw on preserved funds if you are under  years old and have a terminal illnessdeath if you pass away your preserved funds are paid out to the person you named as a beneficiary if you did not name a beneficiary the trustees of the fund will usually determine who will receive the benefits in the event of your deathfinancial hardship you may be able to withdraw preserved contributions if you can prove financial hardship or other compassionate grounds this is a decision that would be made by the trustees of the super fund based on your situation and your circumstanceshow can i protect my super fundfor many people their super is their main security for the future in terms of finances which is why so many people want to ensure that everything is in order with their fund and that their retirement funds are safe and secure whilst the fund is controlled by the trustees many people want to keep on top of information relating to their superannuation fund for peace of mind as this way they can ensure that they are up to speed on what is actually happening with their finances there are a number of areas that you may want to know more about in order to enjoy greater peace of mind over the protection and safety of your super fund and some of the common concerns that superannuation fund holders may have are outlined belowcan money from your super fund be used by your employerif youre worried about your employer

covering funeral costs  serious financial hardship including to cover reasonable immediate living expenses for your family such as loan repayments rent arrears car repairs medical costs and overdue bills  in the event of you being temporarily or permanently incapacitated  if you are diagnosed with a terminal disease or injury in the meantime in case you may want to reconsider looking for a lender who might offer you a loan please check this page though the amount you can borrow and your approval would be on a case by case basis depending on the lender so best to get in touch with them
