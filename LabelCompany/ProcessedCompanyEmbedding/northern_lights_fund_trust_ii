objectives policies and restrictions allow it to invest in the underlying funds as well as in various other assets that may or may not be securities under the  act the fund of funds purchases shares of the underlying funds and the underlying funds sell their shares to the fund of funds in reliance on section dg of the  act and rule d under the  act section dg and rule d do not provide for the fund of funds to invest in assets that might not be securities under the  act your letter requests assurance that we would not recommend enforcement action to the commission under sections da and b of the  act against the fund of funds or an underlying fund if the fund of funds’ investment in the underlying funds meets all of the provisions of section dg of the  act and rule d under the  act except for rule da to the extent that it restricts the fund of funds from investing in assets that might not be securities under the  act ii  analysis section da of the  act in relevant part prohibits the fund of funds from purchasing or otherwise acquiring securities issued by an underlying fund if immediately after the acquisition the fund of funds owns more than  of the outstanding voting stock of the underlying fund has more than  of its total assets invested in the underlying fund or has more than  of its total assets invested in the underlying fund and all other investment companies section db of the  act in relevant part prohibits an underlying fund from knowingly selling its securities to the fund of funds if the sale will cause the fund of funds to own more than  of the underlying fund’s total outstanding voting stock or if the sale will cause more than  of the underlying fund’s total outstanding voting stock to be owned by investment companies sections da and b were designed to prevent certain abuses that might arise when investment companies invest in other investment companies such potential abuses generally include the pyramiding of control and undue influence the layering of fees and complex fund of funds structures that are difficult for investors to understand section dg of the  act in relevant part provides a conditional exemption from the limits in sections da and b for certain fund of funds arrangements within the same group of investment companies such as the fund of funds one of the conditions in section dg which was enacted in  limited a fund of funds’ other investments to government securities and shortterm paper in  the commission adopted rule d to permit a fund of funds relying on section dg to invest among other things in any types of securities that are consistent with its investment policies the commission noted that allowing such greater flexibility for a fund of funds to meet its investment objectives did not present any additional concerns that section dg was intended to address in  the commission proposed amendments to rule d to permit among other things a fund of funds relying on section dg to invest in assets such as real estate futures contracts and other financial instruments that might not qualify as securities under the  act the commission noted that it had issued exemptive orders providing such relief and that such greater flexibility did not appear to present any additional concerns that section dg was intended to address the larger rulemaking of which the proposed amendments to rule d were a part remains on the commission’s regulatory flexibility agenda as a potential rule reproposal the commission has continued to issue exemptive orders providing the relief that would have been codified in the rule d amendments the commission has conditioned such exemptive orders on compliance with all of the provisions of rule d except for paragraph a to the extent that it restricts a fund of funds from investing in assets that might not be securities under the  act    consistent with the rationale behind these exemptive orders and the commission’s proposed amendments to rule d you request
