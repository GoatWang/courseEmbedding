umbrella fund with a series of different subfunds tracking the inverse or two times the performance on an index on a daily basis mirae asset horizons leveraged and inverse series is different from conventional exchange traded funds as it seeks leveraged or inverse investment results relative to the index and only on a daily basis this product is not intended for holding longer than one day as the performance of this product over a longer period may deviate from and be uncorrelated to the leveraged performance of the index over the period certain funds are subject to concentration risk as a

are more susceptible to fluctuations in value of the underlying indices resulting from adverse conditions in that single country region or sector certain funds invest in asian emerging markets and are therefore subject to greater risk of loss compared with investments in developed markets due to greater political economic taxation and regulatory uncertainty and risks linked to volatility and market liquidity an investment in the units of the funds may directly or indirectly involve exchange rate risk the units of the funds may trade at a substantial premium or discount to their net asset value
