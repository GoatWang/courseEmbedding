envisions the bay colony as a seventeenth century oneparty state where congregations served as ideological cells and authority was restricted to an educated elite of ministers and magistrates from there staloff offers a broadened conception of the interstices of political social and intellectual authority in puritan massachusetts and beyond arguing that ideologies as well as ideological politics are produced by selfconscious and often classconscious thinkers author bio▼▲ darren staloff is assistant professor of history at city college of new york editorial reviews▼▲ an invigorating contribution to the scholarly literature on puritan new englandoriginal in perspective forceful in argument and graceful in presentation in staloffs sophisticated retelling the emergence to authority in massachusetts of certain intellectuals clergymen and intelligentsia magistrates as a thinking class shaped the puritan strongholds politics and cultural life until  by reading the sources with an uncommonly keen eye for the nuances of power staloff sheds new light on many heretofore slighted aspects of massachusetts history as well as such old chestnuts as the banishing of roger williams the squelching the quakers and the jousting over the halfway covenant staloff also offers perceptive new assessments of the bay colonys major personalities including john cotton thomas hooker and increase mather old hands at puritan studies as well as newcomers to the field will profit immensely from this insightful bookalden t vaughan columbia universityin all probability staloffs book will quickly become the one book that everyone will read and assign to get into the mind and culture of puritan new englandjohn m murrin princeton universitydarren staloffs analytical categories of class and power provide the structure for what is both an excellent social history of political conflicts and a useful political history of religious events his account gives new provocative twists to old stories like the hutchinson trial disputes over the charter and the halfway covenantstaloffs dramatic and nuanced narrative reveals not only the interplay of class and power but also the considerable influence of personalities and ideasilliam and mary quarterlyit offers a genuinely ironical way to understand the new england puritans lurch into modernity a topic of neverending interest to scholars in this fieldreviews in american historystaloff presents a provocative argument it is a thoughtful intelligent work one that considers the puritan elite as dynamic and selfinterested the book is certain to rekindle interest if it ever died out in the intellectual history of the puritans in new england and show us how we can use innovations from other fields such as sociology to refine our thinking about historythe new england quarterlydarren staloffs compact closely reasoned book provides the best account to date of the institutional means by which the values of protestant christianity whether contained in the calvinist federal theology or the biblicism of the primitive churches grew to power in massachusetts became pervasive and then wanedto staloffs great credit one finishes his book convinced that such notoriously slippery yet monolithic terms as the intelligentsia or thinking class were in the instance of the seventeenthcentury massachusetts both identifiable and

management is the process of marketing your business through various media channels in the social networking realm of the internet and managing your online presence with regularity and consistency why is social media management important companies are competing for attention not only through traditional advertising outlets but also through a sea of personal social information which is prevalent on the internet the social networking sites are monitored constantly by potential customers this creates the opportunity to reach people through their own surfing habits however reaching them is not enough you need to reach them regularly and you need to stand out in sea of competing information with concise words compelling images and marketing techniques that generate interest studies suggest on average one must see an advertisement at least seven times before they act a regular presence in various social media sites achieves this exposure and encourages individuals to act and those who act to share their activities with family and friends who may be interested in your product or service this becomes wordofmouth advertising with your message and branding attached as a small business
