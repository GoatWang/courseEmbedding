outcomes of vva estrogen products” olson also perceived this week’s regulatory update as “clear collaboration between txmd and the fda to achieve a common goal of delivering the safest and most effective vva treatment to patients” the analyst substantiated this claim by citing txmd effort to “proactively cooperate by voluntarily abandoning the  mcg dose and drafting a postapproval safety study protocol” olson also pointed to the june update to the nams position statement as evidence of “growing support from the medical community” the analyst believes that the txhr is on track and that
