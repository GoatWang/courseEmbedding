defendantsappellees charles y lackey winstonsalem and constangy brooks and smith by edward katz and terry price atlanta ga for corporate defendantappellee becton judge i this is a civil action for damages brought by virginia tyson and rose bennett against their employer leggs products inc the corporate defendant and fourteen fellow employees the individual defendants based upon an allegedly defamatory letter sara lee corporation of which leggs products is a division by special appearance moved to dismiss the suit as to the corporate defendant under rule b for lack of jurisdiction insufficiency of process and of service of process and failure to state a claim for which relief could be granted upon the grounds that leggs products is not a legal entity capable of being sued in north carolina the individual defendants in their answer moved to dismiss the action pursuant to rule b for failure to state a claim the trial judge after considering the pleadings attached exhibits affidavits related to jurisdiction and service of process briefs and memoranda of all parties and the arguments of counsel found that the defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law and granted the motions of all the defendants plaintiffs appeal we affirm ii we first consider the position of the corporate defendant in this action the sole issue raised in the parties brief is whether the corporate defendants motion to dismiss was properly granted on the grounds that it is not a legal entity capable of being sued in north carolina a these are the relevant facts on  july  consolidated foods corporation a maryland corporation registered its assumption of the assumed name leggs products inc with the register of deeds of richmond county north carolina on  april  consolidated foods changed its name to sara lee corporation sara lee and retained the assumed name leggs products inc for its leggs products division an amendment to assumed name registration reflecting these changes was executed on  april  but was not filed with the richmond county register of deeds until  july  the letter upon which this action is based was allegedly publicized in early june  on  june  plaintiffs filed the complaint and their summons was issued in addition to the fourteen individual defendants the captions of the complaint and summons named as corporate defendant leggs products inc the summons was directed to leggs products inc co registered agent proctorwayne leggett route  box  fairmont north carolina  proctorwayne leggett is the registered agent for a corporation named leggs inc which is a forprofit north carolina corporation located in fairmont north carolina and which is in no way related to sara lee or its leggs products division the registered agent for sara lee formerly consolidated foods in north carolina is and was ct corporation system wachovia bank building  south corcoran street durham north carolina in the complaint the plaintiffs alleged upon information and belief defendant leggs products inc is a forprofit corporation organized under the laws of the state of north carolina with its principal place of business at winstonsalem north carolina and owns a place of business in richmond county north carolina where it manufactures products for sale throughout north carolina on  july  sara lee by special appearance and through counsel served its motion to dismiss the defendant leggs products inc under rules b   and  on account of lack of jurisdiction insufficient process and service of process and failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted thereafter on  july  the amendment to assumed name registration which was executed earlier in april of  was filed with the richmond county register of deeds on  august  an alias and pluries summons was issued and directed to be served on leggs products inc co bill flinchum post office box  winstonsalem north carolina  william f flinchum is sara lee corporations vicepresident of manufacturing in its leggs products division the record contains the registry receipt showing actual receipt of the complaint and summons by the defendant on  september  sara lee corporation renewed its motion to dismiss the corporate defendant b  first defendants counsel contends that plaintiffs actually sued leggs inc the wrong corporation as a result their claim would be barred by the statute of limitations by the time the alias and pluries summons issued even assuming the second summons cured the error by substituting the correct party in support of its contentions the defendant points to  the direction of the summons to defendant co registered agent proctorwayne leggett and  the allegation in the complaint that the defendant is a for profit corporation organized under the laws of the state of north carolina because proctorwayne leggett is the registered agent for a forprofit north carolina corporation called leggs inc defendant concludes that plaintiffs intended for the trial court to exert jurisdiction over leggs inc we disagree in wiles v welparnel construction co  nc   sed   the court held that a summons directed to the registered agent of a corporation is not defective if the captions of the summons and complaint clearly indicate that the corporation and not the agent is the intended defendant in the case sub judice the captions of the complaint and summons plainly named as defendant leggs products inc not leggs inc moreover unlike the summons in wiles which was addressed directly to the agent this summons was directed to the corporate defendant in care of the agent therefore rule b of the rules of civil procedure which requires that a summons be directed to the defendant has been satisfied furthermore the erroneous description in the complaint of defendant as a north carolina corporation rather than a maryland corporation is not sufficient grounds to find that leggs inc was the intended defendant this is especially true since the same paragraph of the complaint describes the defendant as having its principle place of business in winstonsalem and as operating a place of business in richmond county both allegations which are true of leggs products inc but not of leggs inc we conclude that plaintiffs did not sue the wrong corporation but merely sought service on the wrong agent the function of an alias and pluries summons is to keep a lawsuit alive and maintain the original date of the commencement of the action when the original summons has not been properly served upon the original defendant named therein see roshelli v sperry  nc app   sed  rev denied  nc   sed   thus plaintiffs suit was properly instituted against leggs products inc within the statute of limitations period and was kept alive by the alias and pluries summons until service was properly made upon a corporate officer  the corporate defendants second position is that because leggs products inc is only a division of sara lee without separate corporate status plaintiffs action is directed against a legal nonentity which is incapable of being sued defendant further asserts that the failure of the complaint and summons to name sara lee as defendant precludes the court from asserting jurisdiction over sara lee and that any later attempt to do so constitutes an improper substitution of parties which is barred by the statute of limitations in its brief the defendant discusses a number of cases involving the relation back of amendments and the correction of misnomers which are inapposite to this case for example defendant cites teague v asheboro motor co  nc app   sed   to support its proposition that a plaintiff may not amend its summons and complaint to substitute another party for a nonexistant corporation as defendant in that case the intended corporate defendant had changed its name from asheboro motor company inc to rabb and york inc and a new unrelated corporation had assumed the companys old name thus when plaintiff sued asheboro motor company inc he literally sued the wrong legal entity and an amendment would have involved substituting an entirely new party after the statute of limitations had run in crawford v aetna casualty and surety co  nc app   sed   cert denied  nc   sed   the complaint and summons named as defendant michigan tool company a division of excello corporation and were served upon an officer of excello in fact michigan tool company was not a division of excello but was a separate corporate entity which had been acquired and later dissolved by excello accordingly plaintiffs amendment deleting michigan tool company a division of was improperly allowed because it in effect substituted a new defendant that had never been properly served teague and crawford are easily distinguished from the present case in both those cases there was some attempt to substitute one legal entity for another as defendant whereas in the case at bar we are concerned with only one legal entity which uses two names in park v sleepy creek turkeys inc  nc app   sed   one defendant was a sole proprietorship which operated under the assumed name amchick associates to which the summons and complaint were addressed the court did not address the propriety of suing the defendant under its assumed name plaintiffs critical error was in serving process upon the executive manager of the business a method of service which is proper for an unincorporated association but insufficient for a sole proprietorship by way of contrast in the case sub judice service of process was properly accomplished by way of certified mail upon an officer of the corporate defendant as provided by rule j of the rules of civil procedure the other cases relied upon by the defendant are equally inapplicable to the present action the true issue raised by these facts and one for which there is no precedent in north carolina is whether a corporation may properly be sued in its assumed name it seems to be universally recognized that a corporation may do business under an assumed name or a name differing from its true corporate name annot  alr   moreover there is some authority that a corporation may be sued under its assumed name or trade name see hutcheson memorial tricounty hospital v oliver  gaapp   sed   north carolina genstat sec   requires a certificate of assumed name to be filed before a corporation engages in business in any county other than under its corporate name the object of the statute is to require notice to be given to the business world of the facts required to be set out in the certificate to the end that people dealing with a firm may be fully informed as to its membership and know with whom they are trading security finance co v hendry  nc    sed    at the time plaintiffs instituted this action sara lee corporation had not complied with this statute the company was actively conducting business as leggs products inc and holding itself out to the public and to its employees under that name admittedly with greater effort the plaintiffs might have unearthed the true identity of leggs products inc however a search of the appropriate records would have revealed only the erroneous designation of leggs products inc as an assumed name of consolidated foods furthermore service of process was accomplished upon sara lees vice president of manufacturing in its leggs products division a corporate agent who might be expected to know that leggs products is a name used by sara lee under these circumstances we do not believe that any substantial confusion existed concerning the identity of the intended defendant nor that the defendant was misled or prejudiced on these facts we therefore conclude that sara lee corporation was adequately served with sufficient legal process under its assumed name leggs products inc and that the trial court had jurisdiction the corporate defendant belabors the fact that the plaintiffs never sought leave to amend their summons and complaint after acquiring actual notice of the defendants true legal identity in paramore v interregional financial group leasing co  nc app    sed    this court reiterated the rule that when a misdescription does not leave in doubt the identity of the party intended to be sued or even where there is room for doubt as to identity if service of process is made on the party intended to be sued the misnomer or misdescription may be corrected by amendment at any stage of the suit emphasis added we are cognizant of the need for accurate naming of parties when instigating legal proceedings however since the plaintiffs have sued and served the appropriate party their delay in substituting the correct name of that party is not fatal having determined that the trial court had jurisdiction over the corporate defendant we nevertheless affirm the courts dismissal of the action against it plaintiffs sole allegations regarding this defendant are that the individual defendants circulated the allegedly defamatory letter at its place of business with the knowledge and permission of plant supervisors and acted as agents of the corporate defendant in publishing the letter thus any liability of the corporate defendant must be entirely derivative for reasons discussed hereafter in section iii we conclude that the letter in question is not defamatory and that the plaintiffs suit against the individual defendants was properly dismissed consequently dismissal of the corporate defendant was also proper iii we next address the propriety of the judgment for the individual defendants the pertinent facts are as follows a virginia tyson and rose bennett wrote a letter to the editor of the richmond county daily journal which was published on the editorial page on  may  the purpose of the letter was to voice their opinions concerning a controversy over the workrelated nature of employee tendonitis at the richmond county manufacturing plant where the plaintiffs and the individual defendants are employed the plaintiffs letter specifically attacked an article released to the press by their employer which summarized findings of a medical study of the tendonitis issue and concluded that tendonitis was not a workrelated condition in their letter the plaintiffs accused their employer of inaccurately quoting the findings of the study of downplaying the recommendations made of being irresponsible and failing to admit the truth of denying all workers compensation claims and of ridiculing the complaints of many employees and telling them not to report their injuries the plaintiffs further stated that there are numerous other employees mostly ladies who are experiencing jobrelated tendonitis symptoms but who are afraid to make any complaints not only because of fear of losing their job but also because of the intimidation which will come down from management they indicated a hope that their letter would raise public awareness of the issue on  may  the plaintiffs also appeared on a wsoctv charlotte north carolina news report to voice their opinions on the tendonitis issue the plaintiffs comments raised company if not public awareness on june  and   the allegedly defamatory letter was circulated among employees of the richmond county mill and was signed by the individual defendants in addition to  other employees who were not made defendants in this action this letter expressly referred to an article in your paper from two ladies employed by leggs products which told of terrible working conditions and of women being afraid to report injuries and responded directly to these assertions as a bunch of hog wash the individual defendants expressed skepticism regarding the numbers of employees claimed to experience tendonitis symptoms challenging them to come out of the woodwork and speak their own minds and caustically criticized some people who want the money but dont want to work for it the letter strongly disagreed with the plaintiffs assertions of employee mistreatment and claimed that the majority of the employees feel this is one of the best companies anyone could work for the letter signed by the individual defendants was placed in the mail on  july  by an unspecified person and was received by the richmond county daily journal on  june  and by wsoctv on  june  b rule b of the rules of civil procedure provides that a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is converted to a rule  motion for summary judgment when matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court stanback v stanback  nc   sed   because the record indicates that the trial judge considered matters outside the pleadings we must review the courts decision as if it were a ruling on a motion for summary judgment summary judgment is appropriate whenever there is no genuine issue of any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law the purpose of the rule is to eliminate the necessity of a formal trial where only questions of law are involved and a fatal weakness in the claim or defense of a party is exposed foster v winstonsalem joint venture  nc    sed    c although the pleadings and briefs of the parties raise a number of grounds upon which the trial judges ruling might have been based the judgment dismissing the complaint fails to state the grounds upon which dismissal was considered appropriate the individual defendants first argue that the letter at issue is not defamatory as a matter of law we agree and therefore find it unnecessary to address any other contentions of the parties in order to recover for defamation a plaintiff must allege and prove that the defendant made false defamatory statements of or concerning the plaintiff which were published to a third person causing injury to the plaintiffs reputation hall v publishing co  nc app   sed   because we find that the letter signed by the defendants is not defamatory a fatal weakness exists in the plaintiffs claim which entitles the defendants to summary judgment north carolina courts recognize three classes of libel  publications which are obviously defamatory and which are termed libels per se  publications which are susceptible of two reasonable interpretations one of which is defamatory and the other is not and  publications which are not obviously defamatory but which become so when considered in connection with innuendo colloquium and explanatory circumstances this type of libel is termed libel per quod flake v greensboro news co  nc    se    see also arnold v sharp  nc    sed    cathys boutique v winstonsalem joint venture  nc app   sed   in the present case the complaint is insufficient to state a claim for libel within the second class because the complaint does not allege that the letter is susceptible of two meanings see renwick v news and observer publishing co  nc   sed   cathys boutique therefore we must determine whether the offending letter is capable of supporting an action for libel per se or libel per quod  libel per se plaintiffs allege in their complaint that the letters publication was intended to discredit plaintiffs implying that they were liars and malingerers and that the persons who received the letter understood it to have this meaning in their brief they point to the following statements in the letter in support of their claim the two ladies who sent the letter in have always been out of work for numerous reasons  we are not saying that there is nothing wrong with these ladies we definitely think that there is plaintiffs further emphasize the defendants response to the plaintiffs claims of terrible working conditions and intimidation of workers this in our opinion is a bunch of hog wash  we know the difference between reality and fantasy the plaintiffs conclude that the letter when read in its entirety clearly states that they are liars and deadbeats who expect to receive a free giveaway program all of their lives we disagree in flake v greensboro news co our supreme court summarized the law of libel per se  defamatory words to be libelous per se must be susceptible of but one meaning and of such nature that the court can presume as a matter of law that they tend to disgrace and degrade the party or hold him up to public hatred contempt or ridicule or cause him to be shunned and avoided  the question always is how would ordinary men naturally understand the publication citation omitted the fact that supersensitive persons with morbid imaginations may be able by reading between the lines of an article to discover some defamatory meaning therein is not sufficient to make it libelous citation omitted in determining whether the article is libelous per se the article alone must be construed stripped of all insinuations innuendo colloquium and explanatory circumstances the article must be defamatory on its face within the four corners thereof citations omitted id  nc at   se at  applying these principles we conclude that the letter giving rise to this appeal is not defamatory per se when viewed within the four corners thereof and stripped of all innuendo and explanatory circumstances the letter is not of such nature that the court can presume as a matter of law that it is injurious to the reputations of the plaintiffs on the contrary when considered in its entirety the letters overall thrust is not a personal attack upon the plaintiffs but a hearty declaration of disagreement with the plaintiffs views and an explicit expression of anger toward an unnamed handful of employees who are trying to ruin a company that has been good to its employees over the years the obvious intent of the publication is to defend the defendants jobs and employer and to inform the reader that they and not the plaintiffs represent the views of the majority of employees  libel per quod although the plaintiffs maintain in their brief that the letter is libelous per se the complaint alleges special damages and innuendo therefore we must determine whether the letter is reasonably susceptible of the libelous construction which plaintiffs place upon it by way of innuendo so as to constitute libel per quod we acknowledge that whenever an allegedly defamatory publication is ambiguous or capable of a meaning other than the obvious one it is for the jury to determine how it was understood by the recipient however it is the province of the court to determine in the first instance whether a communication is capable of a defamatory meaning bell v simmons  nc    sed    in determining whether a published article is libelous it must be read and considered in its setting yancey v gillespie  nc    sed    the circumstances of the publication are pertinent as well as the hearers knowledge of facts which would influence their understanding of the words used oates v wachovia bank and trust co  nc    se    the defendants letter was signed and published in the context of an ongoing public controversy regarding the tendonitis issue its production was a direct response to the plaintiffs own statements which by their nature invited response and which were published on the editorial page of the local newspaper a forum in which plaintiffs knew others would have an opportunity to state a contrary view everyone has a right to comment on matters of public interest and concern provided he does so fairly and with an honest purpose yancey v gillespie  nc at   sed at  in addition the letter by its terms indicates that it was signed in the context of a labor dispute the word tendonitis never came up until the union started working to get into the plant in bouligny inc v steelworkers the supreme court stated mere vituperation and name calling directed by a union against an employer or vice versa in the course of a labor dispute or organization campaign are not sufficient basis for a recovery of damages for slander or libel even when the plaintiff is an individual some thickness of skin is required of him by the law in the realm of labor disputes just as in battles in the political arena  nc    sed    we acknowledge that the opinions of the individual defendants are expressed in a robust manner and with some anger or hostility toward the plaintiffs however the plaintiffs having publicly expressed their own strong feelings on a controversial issue of public interest must have some thickness of skin when the response is less than favorable we believe the words used do not go beyond the bounds of proper debate and that the letter read as a whole and considered in its setting is not reasonably susceptible of the defamatory meaning alleged by the plaintiffs iv concluding as we do that the letter complained of by the plaintiffs is not defamatory as a matter of law we hold that summary judgment in favor of both the individual and corporate defendants was proper affirmed martin j concurs phillips j concurs in the
