photos military times stubbys story all about the iconic world war i war dog  and star of an upcoming animated film by ashley bunch   june  war hero friend to presidents generals and grunts alike pioneer in his field respected by military and academic institutions visited by millions of people a year subject of a variety of internetfueled legends and soon to be the subject of a major motion picture not bad for a dog especially one thats been dead for more than  years the story of stubby commonly referred to as sgt stubby is one of great service trust and loyalty it began in connecticut crossed the atlantic into the battles of world war i and returned home to a heros welcome after a lifetime of honors at the side of his owner james robert conroy stubby died in  received a paragraph obituary in the new york times and would eventually become part of the smithsonians collection — his coat laid over a cast is on display at the national museum of american history however the details that make up the stuff of legend — the animated sgt stubby an american hero is set to hit theaters in april — are a bit hazy chief among them the dogs rank im quite convinced that he was promoted by the internet said ann bausum who has written two books about stubby it sounds so good we want it to be true … and one of these reasons i think this isnt true is that there is not a single contemporary story from his lifetime and i looked at hundreds of newspaper articles of stubby there is not a single one that calls him sgt stubby part of the confusion may come from stubbys vest which includes a patch with three chevrons while they may represent a sergeants rank today they were used in world war i to identify soldiers — and apparently dogs — with overseas service he was just stubby bausum said and that was good enough for him sign up for our new good news report  all positive stories about the military subscribe for more newsletters click here ivy league beginnings stubby was no ordinary stray dog but thats how he started out one day he happened to show up at yale university in new haven connecticut where soldiers were training prior to deploying for france during world war i he came in with his stubby little tail and won the hearts of the men training there — he was taken along for the deployment though the exact details on how stubby made it to france arent certain its said that thenpvt conroy stowed him away on the soldiers ship and when found stubby saluted the commander that gesture earned him passage for the rest of the journey in france stubby was said to have saved the entire division by finding and detaining a german spy his new york times obituary breathlessly relays the tale saying the dog stole out of the trenches and recognized — a german attempts by the german to deceive the dog were futile the obituary notes its also said stubby learned when bombs where inbound and would warn the soldiers prior to the explosion so if even some of the legend is true was stubby a socalled war dog or a precursor to the modern military working dog or a mascot my grandfather was always clear he was a service dog said curt deane conroys grandson he gave the troops comfort he gave them support he used to run through the trenches and warn them about gas attacks he used to go outside of the trenches and into this sort of nomans land between the us and the german trenches and stand by soldiers who had been injured until the medics could come and get them wheres stubby all those heroics didnt necessarily make stubby a model soldier one of the most frequent questions asked by conroy and his fellow soldiers with nd infantry regiment th infantry division was wheres stubby stubby would disappear for weeks at a time deane said and the guys would kind of have no idea where he was and there was this whole fear that he had been killed or whatever and my grandfather would say he always came back with his head held high and his stubby tail up in the air and knew right where my grandfather was it was amazing and these troops wouldnt stay still — they were moving around but he always came right back and knew exactly where my grandfather was  the dog even somehow returned to conroys unit after hed been adopted by french soldiers bausum said like many stubby tales details are thin but he was back with the nd in time to return to the us where he continued his service to the troops there were these massive conventions at various cities annual conventions around the country and stubby would go to those and he would be revered bausum said he would march in the parades he would make newspaper headlines he was known to three presidents according to his new york times obituary he had his picture taken with gen john blackjack pershing the highestranking service member since george washington he was an official mascot for georgetown university where conroy studied law and an honorary member of the american red cross the american legion and the ymca — which gave him a place to sleep and up to three bones a day a breed apart why did his story catch on bausum said she sees stubby as a product of his time the backdrop for it was this horrendous horrendous war just the volume of destruction was just so unfathomable just sending people out in cloth uniforms against machine gun fire just the waste makes it a very dark war she said and yet there was this story that ran through it that had so much hope in it stubby didnt escape unscathed he was wounded and gassed according to the new york times obituary his coat sits alongside cher ami a decorated carrier pigeon known for its service during world war i gen john pershing awards sgt stubby with a gold medal in  stubby served in  battles and fought in four major allied offensives during wwi smithsonian institutionõs national museum of american history stubby died in conroy’s arms march   the dog’s loyalty and tenacity have earned praise for more than a century and have also led to some disagreement among dog lovers about stubby’s breed which has never been known ive come to view him as sort of like a rorschach blot where people look at these blots of ink and individuals can see all different manners of things in the shape and they sort of see what they want to see bausum said if you love boxers hes a boxer or if youre a pit bull fan hes a pit bull … when you say that hes a boston terrier people say well he sure doesnt look like a boston terrier but he did look like what was then a boston terrier stubby on screen  sgt stubby an american hero is set for an april  release among those lending their voices to the hollywoodized tale of conroy and his dog are helena bonham carter wholl play conroys sister and gérard depardieu set to portray gaston baptiste a battletested mentor to sgt stubby according to a news release from fun academy motion pictures studio as the film approaches deane said plans are underway to commemorate stubbys life and the bond he shared with his owner in other ways talks are underway with the american red cross to allow sales of a plush stubby doll to benefit the nonprofits program that sends dogs to visit soldiers at walter reed national military medical center bethesda maryland stubby originally after he died spent a lot of time in the lobby of the american red cross in washington deane said so the thought is to have a statue of stubby at the american red cross because he was a permanent member as his grandfather told stories about stubby it became clear to deane that conroy never quite let go of his heroic dog deane promised his grandfather that he would do everything possible to keep stubbys memory alive i used to always ask him why he never got another dog deane said of his grandfather and he made it very clear to me that stubby was so special and so unique that he just couldnt imagine another dog being able to fill that role comments recommended for you around the web

stubby into his overcoat and smuggled him aboard the troopship minnesota during the sea voyage one of the machinist mates made stubby a special set of dog tags shortly after the unit disembarked at the french port of st nazaire the commanding officer discovered he had an unauthorized member in his ranks but an earnest plea from conroy and a sharp salute from stubby convinced the officer to let the pit bull remain this time as the unit’s official mascot on one patrol stubby found something else hidden in some bushes it was a german spy who had been mapping the american positions attracted by canine barking and human cries the patrol arrived to discover the hapless spy on the ground with stubby’s jaws clamped onto his backside stubby’s baptism of fire occurred in february  shortly after the division was stationed in the chemin des dames sector in northern france within days after the troops took up position in the trenches they were hit by a poison gas artillery barrage stubby survived and from that point on was acutely sensitive to the deadly chemicals once the area where stubby’s company was deployed received a predawn poison gas barrage as soon as his nose scented the first whiff of poison gas stubby began raising the alarm running back and forth through the trench barking and nipping at the slumbering soldiers the men awoke in time to don their mask and fit stubby with his and fight off the german attack stubby was not content to remain in the trenches often accompanying raids and patrols into no man’s land the region between the opposing armies’ trench lines
