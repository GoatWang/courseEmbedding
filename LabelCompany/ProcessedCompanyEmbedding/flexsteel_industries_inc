bing ads has solutions for you i already appear in search results for free why should i pay for advertising your current customers may search for your business by name aiming it easy to find you in search results but customers youve yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldnt necessarily bring up your business in search results advertising next to relevant bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach what is the difference between seo and sem which one is right for me search engine optimization seo is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results you cannot pay to improve your website ranking on bing or yahoo thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or organic search results clicks from seo are free but seo also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results you dont have to choose between seo and sem you can do both if my time is limited should i still try bing ads yes call a bing ads specialist at and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free we’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success we’re here to help about bing ads where does my ad appear your ads could appear on the top or to the right of bing yahoo and msn search results and you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions times or days of the week and even demographics what determines my ad position bing ads is a payperclick ppc advertising system you bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads we auction those spaces you are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want so if you bid on the keyword shoe you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on shoe you determine how much you are willing to bid your ad position is based on several things including how closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched relevance how your bid compares to other bids in the bing ads auction how strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked clickthrough rate the stronger you are in these areas the better your chances of winning the top ad position how to use bing ads how can i use bing ads to drive more people to my website here are some tips to get better results review your budget and bid strategy if your ad keeps pausing your budget limit may be set too low competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website expand your targeting both for location and for devices computer mobile and tablet make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business how can i keep my costs down while your first instinct may be to lower your budget first try lowering your maximum bids yes this could mean fewer customers visit your site but if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid that would lower your costperclick and help stretch your budget how do i know if bing ads is working view a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats ad clicks the number of times your ad appeared impressions spend average costperclick clickthrough rate average ad position cost per acquisition and conversions you can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing can i run more than one ad yes in fact we encourage it only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see whats working best with your target customers frequently businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages getting started with bing ads how do i get started sign up
