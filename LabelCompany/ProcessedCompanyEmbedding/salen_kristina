at pm comments kristina salen kristina salen and her husband daniel bernstein live in brooklyn ny with kids jules  and arlo  my job as cfo since last year of an online marketplace with one million vendors of handmade goods my job is to help others do i’m a strategic therapist i listen to my colleagues listen for opportunities hear their problems and help them prioritize a cfo’s job is really to enable growth over a multiyear period to help determine whether plans will sustain growth my day is filled with meetings with our head of global facilities to talk about year real estate plans then with our chief technical officer then with our vp of international to talk about a global challenge i work with  passionate people in a missiondriven company with a strong sense of purpose we believe we’re reimagining commerce we’re a model that will create a more fulfilling and connected world that goes beyond price and convenience— creating a real connection between our  million active buyers and our sellers  how work life works not so well over the past year i started this new job in a new field and moved my family from boston to new york city meaning a lot of change and long hours and massive todo lists it’s been chaos and challenging to find calm in the storm but it’s okay as long as we all take deep breaths my husband is a partner in the fullest sense—we only allow ourselves one freakout at a time he’s been a stayathome dad for a decade and it hasn’t always been easy he’s the point person on pretty much everything kids and home so the burden is lifted from me i do the laundry because i like to and since i travel a fair amount i do everything i can do from my phone at the airport staying connected i travel one or two months out of the year otherwise it’s a real gift that i see my kids every morning i make sure they’re dressed have breakfast and are out the door with daniel i get home a little after  and get dinner on and do kid stuff and then go back online at  pm i go in to work late on fridays—when i have the luxury of walking my kids to school i take them to ballet classes and drum lessons on the weekends it’s about the little consistent things walking to school cuddling on the couch waking the boys with kisses family time it’s dinnertime nearly every night my husband is a trained chef and that’s lucky we talk about all kinds of stuff school bigpicture issues like why dogs and cats have to be neutered whatever comes up on weekends with the kids’ classes and all we focus on nighttimes we have movie night—recently it was raiders of the lost ark we like to have other families over for dinner we set the table nicely with place cards it’s a family date night for everyone as for date night with my husband our regular one fell away with the demands of my new job and our new home but once a month we go out to dinner or do something by september we should be through the transition in my bag a mess usually macbook air a drawing by arlo a lucky necklace jules made in preschool a cosmetic bag full of lipsticks i never wear a ton of old receipts and todo lists a pinecone or crab claw seasonally my favorite things listening to cheesy top  music getting

as cfo downplays predictions of ipo etsy hires fidelity star kristina salen as cfo downplays predictions of ipo by michael carney  written on january   share this article onfacebookshare this article ontwittershare this article ongoogle plusshare this article onlinkedin from the news desk in the course of building a company few factors contribute more to success or failure than the makeup of the executive leadership team the thing is the individuals that are right for a company at its earliest stages are not necessarily the same people who are right when the company scales massively and inevitably begins thinking ipo there’s even a debate raging on this topic in silicon valley with many adopting the cult of belief that founders should never be replaced and others believing that there’s a right person for each role in each stage of a company’s life today etsy new york’s darling craft marketplace announced the addition of a new cfo kristina salen  will join the company beginning in february following seven years leading fidelity investments media internet and telco group salen has experience leading “tens of billions of dollars” worth of investments including in such high growth startup and tech companies as google ebay amazon spotify and hubspot prior to fidelity salen worked in various financial and executive roles at oppenheimer capital merrill lynch and lazard freres  co she holds an mba in finance from columbia university and was designated a fulbright scholar in political science and economics following earning her undergraduate degree at vassar college this is all well and good but if you listened to etsy ceo chad dickerson announcing the news during tonight’s pandomonthly fireside chat he sounded just as excited that she’s been a member of the marketplace since  “she buys a lot of things on etsy” he said “i don’t think she makes and sells stuff but maybe she has a secret account but were really excited about her i think she really rounds out the management team” prior to salen etsy had gone without a cfo initially the company contracted an outside cfo and consultant named john mccarthy a move not uncommon among resource constrained startups as of late the senior most person on the finance side of the business has been vp of finance sinohe terrore terrore’s has described his role at the company as “managing the business intelligence finance accounting and operations teams” dickerson who was not the founder of etsy himself was quick to talk about “what adding a cfo means” at this stage many outside the company have looked for it to pursue an ipo in the near future with hundreds of thousands of active sellers more than  million monthly unique visitors per month to its site and some  million in venture capital raised all signs point toward such a public listing but the ceo says that it’s more about options not just an ipo “the reason i brought on christina is that as etsy grows we can think about all the options” he said “i want etsy to be an independent company for as long as it can be independent” dickerson pointed to surveymonkey as a company that pursued an alternative path the company recently did an  million recapitalization taking on debt financing they were able to pay back all their outside investors without going public and have all of the benefits of staying private he is smart to take what he calls a “more sophisticated view another wrinkle the cfo hopes to incorporate into any liquidity strategy is rewarding the community members the example he gave is the boston beer ipo in which the company’s customers got first right to buy its stock ahead of wall street the opposite example might be facebook whose users posted on its own platform requests for the  or so  they each represented at the time of its now flop of an ipo “doing something like surveymonkey did is very complex” dickerson said “if etsy wanted to do something like that i think we need a finance person” share this article onfacebookshare this article ontwittershare this article ongoogle plusshare this article onlinkedin read this next etsy revenue jumps  cfo to depart march   wsj dow
