perry create a polished family home print email r stephanie bruno by r stephanie bruno the timespicayune on april   at  am comments when james perry first laid eyes on the sidehall shotgun in esplanade ridge it was love at first sight but it was another story altogether when he first brought his future wife to see the place during mardi gras   gallery the perry and harrisperry home i took one look at it and told him we needed to get a hotel room instead said melissa harrisperry who was living in new jersey and teaching at princeton university at the time he had told me he was in the process of renovating but what he didnt say was that the house was a construction sitefor harrisperry renovating meant choosing new cabinets or the perfect hardware for a new kitchen as she had been doing at her house in princeton it didnt mean painting everything installing two new bathrooms refinishing the floors replacing a rotten porch or excavating a garden  all on the todo list at perrys housebut love it seems is thicker than sawdust instead of torpedoing the budding romance between the couple the unsettling introduction to perrys house may have actually strengthened itonce i got over the shock i realized that it meant james wasnt afraid to make a commitment harrisperry said if he could take on a project like that and stick with it it was a good signthe couple wed in october  and by thanksgiving harrisperry was en route to new orleans and the esplanade ridge house with her daughter parker  parkers grammy diana gray a dog named pebbles and two catsperry admits that their impending arrival put the heat on a renovation that had been years in the makingi was renovating the house after i bought it in  before hurricane katrina and then the storm added more to the work list said perry executive director of the greater new orleans fair housing action center and a homeowner whose postkatrina trials were profiled in the timespicayunes long road home column id say things were about  percent done by the time i knew melissa would be leaving princeton and taking a position at tulane university he said where she is a professor of political science but there was still a long way to gobasics firstto create enough privacy for his motherinlaw perry installed a wall in the third room from the front creating a hallway and bedroom the only bath in the house was the barely functional one that perry inherited when he bought the house out went its vintage pink tile in went smart blackandwhite tile and the floor was repaired so that the toilet was no longer at risk of falling through the floor there was just one nagging problem the lack of doorsright before i bought the house someone came in and stripped out all the doors shutters and mantels perry said since it was just me living in the house having doors didnt really matter much until melissa and the family arrived bathroom doors were the first to be installedperry and harrisperry picked the bold colors for the homes interior together a project they undertook on harrisperrys first visit at mardi gras three years agoit was really only our third date but that weekend james said come on i want you to help me pick out colors for the house harrisperry said i liked that he was bringing me in on his project but i had no idea at the time that what i was doing was picking out colors for my future housefurniture came next perry had almost none and harrisperry had too much  all oversized to fit in her spacious princeton home we may have been the first newlyweds who instead of having a shower to get things for their house had a wedding yard sale to get rid of everything harrisperry said after that we went out and bought the furniture we wanted for the housemaster bath visionspainting wall construction bath overhaul and redecorating were all crucial to making perrys bachelor roost into a family home but the final necessity was creating a master bath perry had long intended to convert a large closet off the master bedroom into the bath of his dreams complete with a fiveperson jacuzzi but the room was still a cluttered closet when harrisperry arrivedjames and i had been on a trip to new york where i was attending a meeting for one of the boards i serve on and they put us up at a superswanky hotel harrisperry recalled when james asked me what my dream design would be for our master bath i said i wanted one just like the one at the hotelwhat harrisperry didnt realize was that the bath in new york was lined with carrara marble slabs from top to bottom a material that wasnt exactly in perrys budget i asked her if she realized it was marble and she just said ok that sounds great she didnt have a clue how expensive it would be perry saidthe bath  now tiled in marble and complete with the crystal chandelier harrisperry had coveted  was a huge hit when harrisperry saw it for the first time and a far cry from perrys original vision for the space gathering spotsboth perry and harrisperry have demanding work schedules now that harrisperry is host of her own eponymous msnbc show she is away in new york on weekends that leaves weekday mornings for the family to be able to get together for a meali put on my running clothes and parker gets ready for school then we come to the kitchen and sit at the island while james cooks breakfast for us harrisperry said then were off  parker to mcgehees and i go to city park for a jog by the time i get back to the house james is goneharrisperry says she has come to love the house and especially the esplanade ridge neighborhood where she has gotten to know neighbors and appreciate the architecture harrisperry says that both the backyard and front porch are ideal places to spend leisure time as long as you like animalsin the back there is an intergenerational gang of th ward chickens that roam at will and one very lazy rooster who doesnt start crowing until about  every morning harrisperry said and one of the dogs from the house across the street likes to get up on the cushions on the front porch and nap you gotta love this placer stephanie bruno can be reached at housewatcherhotmailcom find local real

article international journal of purchasing and materials management operationalizing quality considerations in the purchasing process by perry james h perkins charles a read preview academic journal article international journal of purchasing and materials management operationalizing quality considerations in the purchasing process by perry james h perkins charles a read preview article excerpt operationalizing quality considerations in the purchasing process this article examines the use of product quality information in capital equipment purchasing decisions the authors incorporate specific quality factors in a simple analytical model designed to provide a buyer with the capability to appropriately consider quality differences in reaching a costeffective purchasing decision initially dimensions of product quality are identified and discussed based on the parameters proposed by david garvin using the garvin framework the article then reports the results of a study of procurement professionals in which the feasibility and desirability of explicit consideration of quality factors in the purchasing process are established finally the article extends the consideration of specific quality factors by introducing and illustrating an analytical approach that effectively incorporates quality differences in a structured and auditable model the model projects the cost implications to the firm of those quality differences identified the analysis indicates that generally accepted dimensions of quality can be identified and applied operationally to assist a buyer in making the most effective purchasing decision introduction important purchasing decisions typically involve a complex ranking and evaluation of a variety of objective and subjective factors these factors may be addressed explicitly in the form of objective criteria or implicitly based on judgment in the final analysis most purchasing decisions focus on the classical purchasing objective to buy materials and services of the right quality in the right quantity at the right price from the right source and at the right time success in selecting the right quality typically impacts the effectiveness of the buying organizations operations and for repetitive purchases suppliers establish a track record of performance that can be used in making subsequent purchasing decisions quality what is it and how can it be bought david a garvin has proposed the following five approaches to defining quality  the transcendent approach is the philosophic concept of innate excellence which is both absolute and universally recognized through experience  the productbased approach focuses on the quantity of some ingredient or attribute possessed by a product like the amount of cream in ice cream it can be assessed objectively and is based on more than preferences alone  the userbased approach begins with the premise that quality lies in the eyes of the beholder it is subjective and rooted in consumer preferences  the manufacturingbased approach focuses on engineering and manufacturing practices it identifies quality as conformance to requirements and it is equated with meeting specifications or making a product right the first time  the valuebased approach defines quality in terms of costs and prices quality provides performance at an acceptable price the phrase affordable excellence summarizes the dilemma in assessing these alternative definitions of quality it should be noted that the approaches often conflict or overlap and may lead to disparate conclusions for example under the productbased definition of quality one expects to pay more for quality because it is expected that better materials workmanship and inspection are applied to achieve this quality theoretically from the productbased model there should be a positive correlation between the price and the quality of an item this is a marketable attributeregardless of whether it is based on fact reputation or simply impressionwhich can be applied when marketing under the userbased perspective … subscribe today subscribe to questia and enjoy full access to this article and over  million more
