portfolio to a single manager he divided each portfolio among several managers each manager would share ideas with peers but have total discretion over a section of the portfolio known today as the

the portfolios reserving a portion of each to allow analysts to pursue their highest conviction investment ideas capital group’s longterm approach has helped it avoid some of the pitfalls that have plagued other firms in the late s the firm was criticized for not offering thenpopular tech funds but when the tech bubble burst capital was praised for not jumping on the bandwagon in the early s new

shaw wagener believes the changes help address capital groups performance problems revamps investment teams drops capguardian name by randy diamond · march   the capital group of companies inc is attempting to remake itself in hopes of regaining assets under management which have declined by  billion in the past six years and repairing its tarnished reputation capital group los angeles is still one of the worlds largest money management firms with  trillion in aum as of dec  but senior company officials acknowledge the employeeowned firm which dates to  often has been slower than competitors to react to the shifting demands of investors but changes are afoot related coverage capital group boosting asia presence via partnerships capital group mulls big index switch american funds to launch three bond funds in  capguardian in turnaround mode ccapital group is restructuring its active equity investment teams cthe money manager is introducing collective investment trusts aimed at the defined contribution plan market that are modeled after the firms wellknown american funds mutual fund family cit is dropping the names capital guardian trust co its primary institutional arm capital international the londonbased institutional unit capital research and management the investment arm of american funds and other subsidiaries beginning next month the only company names will be capital group and american funds by capital group cplus it is introducing separately managed accounts for individual investors the biggest change goes to the heart of capitals business its three active equity investment teams previously two teams chose stocks only for american funds while the third worked only on institutional strategies now all three teams work across both segments limited choices shaw wagener a senior portfolio officer who heads institutional investment efforts and is one of five members of capitals management group acknowledged the firm had created silos limiting institutional investors choices “if you would have come to us six months ago we would have said well the only way you can have that capital world growth and income fund is if you go buy the mutual fund and if you dont want to buy the mutual fund we cant offer it to you” mr wagener said in an interview “now what were saying is were going to deliver that investment service based upon the skill sets of these equity investment groups that have the best chance of success” that best chance of success in the past likely was mutual funds not institutional strategies data from morningstar inc chicago show that for the  years ended dec  american funds on average had better performance among peers than the institutional side tenyear annualized numbers show that american funds on average have been in the th percentile capguardians institutional strategies were in the th percentile for the three years ended dec  american funds ranked in the th percentile and capguardian the nd giving institutional investors the ability to pick more successful investment vehicles can help the capital group regain assets said morningstar analyst janet yang “performance speaks for itself” she said a decade ago “picking capital was a nobrainer” over the past six years capital group has been bleeding institutional assets losing almost threequarters between the end of  — when aum peaked at  billion — and the end of  when institutional assets had dropped to  billion american funds which has a big defined contribution plan business as well as retail has reported net outflows yearly since  and has lost about  of its assets just how much the asset drop has affected profits is unclear the company does not release such data spokesman chuck freadhoff said the company retains a healthy balance sheet allowing institutional investors greater choice could be a positive for capital particularly in cases where the mutual funds have outperformed the institutional strategies long term said john wasnock senior research associate at consulting firm wurts  associates seattle for example mr wasnock said one of capguardians biggest institutional offerings the  billion international equity strategy returned an annualized  for the fiveyear period ended dec  the american funds europacific growth fund which uses a similar approach returned  in part because of its greater exposure to emerging markets for the  years ended dec  the mutual fund outperformed the institutional strategy by  basis points an annualized  vs  he said mr wasnock said capital groups team approach to managing portfolios means its difficult to track the record of individual portfolio managers and understand why a portfolio is performing poorly capital group senior officials acknowledge they need to provide more information “theres a level of detail and information that up until this point we had not delivered in a satisfactory fashion from clients and consultants perspectives — which is really all that matters” said kevin g clifford president and ceo of american funds distributors and one of the five members of the board of directors of capital group mr clifford said capital will soon begin sharing detailed information with institutional consultants as to portfolio managers investment approaches and holdings the bottom line however is performanceproblems addressed mr wagener attributed the previous poor performance to capital having too many investment strategies individual managers overseeing too many portfolios and the companys research coverage not being organized as effectively as possible all three areas have been addressed he said mr wagener said  of capital group equity strategies managed for us institutional investors outperformed their benchmarks last year at american funds  of the  funds or  outperformed their benchmarks in  mr clifford said american funds had  million in net inflows in january its first month of net inflows since may  net inflows in february were  million even with the changes its going to be challenging for capital group to win back institutional and retail customers said geoffrey bobroff president and founder of bobroff consulting in east greenwich ri mr bobroff said performance has been just one of the issues that have plagued capital group a company he said is a victim of changing times he said capital was late to expand its fixedincome offerings missing opportunities to turn equity outflows into fixedincome inflows and as other money managers introduced exchangetraded funds capital group has avoided the area he said indeed adapting to modernday competition is behind some of capital groups other changes while capital has more than  billion in collective investment trusts none was modeled on its mutual funds such modeling is common practice among capitals competitors such as t rowe price associates trow inc trow fidelity investments and the principal financial group capitals first two new cits — based on the american funds capital world growth and income fund and international growth and income fund — were rolled out in january six more will launch later this year cits are favored over mutual funds by some defined contribution plans because they can cost less and provide greater transparency in structuring fees and expenses despite the changes under way mr bobroff said the money managers best shot at regaining assets would be longterm strong performance “people have to be convinced to go back” he said “you dont just flip a switch” n news money management this article originally appeared in the
