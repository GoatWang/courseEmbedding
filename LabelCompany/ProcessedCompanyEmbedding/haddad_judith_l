proceeded to get her master of business administration at nova southeastern university nova southeastern is a florida college and is wellknown as the largest private selective research university in the state finally she attended insead where she attended an executive management program insead is an extremely popular business school with highly rated financial training programs those who have graduated are qualified to work all over the world my experience in the insead program please follow and like usafter getting a bachelor’s degree and mba i had been working in my job at a bank when i realized i was going to need to get some more education if i was going to progress any further i needed more education than i currently had and i felt as though i had reached my stopping point so i looked into business programs and decided i should attend insead one of the top rated business schools in the world it was there that i met judith haddad who became not only a studymate but an amazing example of leadership about insead insead has three campuses in france singapore and abu dhabi in order to offer an exceptional education to many people of different origins the school focuses on different people and cultures bringing together ideas in order to help transform lives and create a better understanding of other perspectives which is extremely valuable in the business world the

international business education judith haddad – a role model for my daughter please follow and like usi have been friends with judith haddad since we worked together at blue cod technologies it has been a while since then but we still reach out to each other when we have time and catch up on our lives and what we are doing if judith wasn’t already very impressive when i worked with her she is even more impressive now in fact she is the role model for my daughter that i always wanted and i’ve been fortunate enough to have her around enough for my daughter to actually look up to judith l haddad holds the position of president and chief information officer for patriot technology solutions previously ms haddad served as vice president of information technology for nymagic a multiline insurance carrier based in new york strategic business planning with judith haddad please follow and like usthough i haven’t worked with haddad as am employee i have had the privilege of watching her work and seeing how she gets things done those who work with her have told me nothing but great things and i’ve seen the success in the businesses she has worked with more or less patriot’s whole job is to go into the insurance industry meet with a company that is struggling and create technology solutions for them she came in to our company and jumped right in the first thing judith haddad did was talk to us about our problems and what we were facing it was clear to us that part of the reason we were struggling was that the insurance industry is booming faster than the technology can keep up with it and we needed some programs created to help us get in line with where our customers need us to be judith l haddad holds the position of president and chief information officer for patriot technology solutions previously ms haddad served as vice president of information technology for nymagic a multiline insurance carrier based in new york judith haddad starting from the ground please follow and like ushaddad has worked for years in the technology industry one that has been typically dominated by men she has found success in positions where men would be and has successfully managed groups of men and women she has even been an example to encourage more women to enter the technology world showing them that they can do well too in fact when asked about a glass ceiling she made it clear that she never felt like there was a glass ceiling she felt like people didn’t care whether she was male or female all they cared about was whether or not she could do the job and that she could she could do the job better than anyone else and her gender didn’t even matter many women hope to get to a place in their career where they feel this way too and even if haddad doesn’t realize it she has broken glass ceilings women thought they couldn’t get through and made more room for more women at the top innovation is the key judith haddad leads over 0 employees in a team to accomplish their goals at patriot she has spent time teaching each and every one of them what it takes to succeed and while there are many paths to success innovation has been the most important one for her judith haddad is innovative and finds ways towards success others have only dreamed up sun fun and learning from judith haddad please follow and like usthere’s nothing i like more than business trips to sunny places where i can learn from the best in the industry and that is exactly what i got to experience when i travelled to florida the beaches in florida were absolutely beautiful and the nightlife is everything you see in the movies i even got a chance to hold a baby alligator and go on an airboat tour through the everglades but what i got most from my trip was an opportunity to spend a few hours with judith haddad getting some advice on how to better succeed as a cio spending some time with haddad judith haddad has been a friend since we met at college at clark university and we have kept in touch here and there over the years we parted ways and went into different career paths and hers has been much more successful than mine she has worked as an executive in the insurance technology industry for a lot of years and i’ve just barely started at a company as a cio i wanted to get some advice on how to find success and how to really lead my team i knew judith haddad was where i should go judith haddad – a real leader in school please follow and like uswhile attending nova southeastern university i was able to meet and make lifelong friends with many men and women who were also attending the program to get their masters of business administration degrees we all entered the program at the same time so we spent a lot of time together in study groups and even just hanging out after class and blowing off some steam while getting to know these other students the one i was most impressed with was judith haddad one of the top students in our class who was not only a great student but an amazing example and teacher for the rest of us i am so grateful for my opportunity i had to work with her and spend so much time learning from her learning in a group setting one thing i noticed about judith haddad right away after i met her was her ability to lead every time we worked in a group together she got up in front of the group and took charge without ever being asked while some students slacked off she would make sure we not only accomplished what we meant to but that we learned the necessary skills being taught to us in the program working with judith haddad at blue cod technologies please follow and like usi worked at blue cod technologies for a few years and it was a really fantastic experience for me both personally and for my career i’m very glad i had the opportunity to work there and learn about the property and casualty insurance industry as well as the chance to work with some amazing people who taught me how to do my job well and how to make a career out of the job i loved one of those people was judith haddad who worked at blue cod technologies for about five years as an executive consultant if it weren’t for her i don’t know that i would be the successful business woman i am today haddad’s powerful influence if nothing else judith haddad was an example to me as a powerful business woman who gets what she wants she doesn’t take no for an answer and she works hard to get what she needs for women in the workplace it is often scary to try and get what you want because you never know how people are going to react to what you ask of them when i told judith about my particular concerns she really encouraged me to go for and told me that women need to fight in this world to get what we want and that i would go the distance if i was willing to try judith haddad – looking as a whole please follow and like usa cio who isn’t being included in all of the business is not going to have the understanding of what the company needs to really be able to make the right technology decisions judith haddad has shown over the years with her executive experience that she understands how a business is supposed to be run and how to make it run more efficiently with the correct technology in fact her ability to understand and see the big picture is one of the main reasons why the companies she has worked with have had so much success when you understand the company’s end goals and can see how each facet of the technology is going to affect those goals you can find a lot of success it is truly impressive that haddad can make technology decisions for her company and the companies patriot is working with she has to understand the whole picture at patriot and at each of the specific companies in the insurance industry fortunately she has a lot of experience working with insurance so being able to understand the business is par for the course judith haddad – the woman leader please follow and like usjudith haddad has worked as an executive in the insurance technology world for over 0 years and at this point has the respect of all her peers we are fortunate to live in a world where women who are determined cannot be stopped by men and that they are able to progress with hard work and dedication despite the naysayers who would say otherwise haddad’s story is especially interesting given that she has found success in the technology world one that might typically be thought of as run by men the truth is that if you are good at what you do and you can prove you are essential then gender is no longer an issue and people will respect you anyone who has met judith haddad understands that she is one of the most respectable women out there and deserves more than anyone the awards she has received especially the 0 influential business women award that was given to her in april of this year search for search recent posts everything you need to know about judith haddad my experience in
