colleague selin hur was a key contributor to this project my wife jennifer who provided editorial input to the book also with us tonight are my daughter laura and her husband jed dennis jed is a commander in the us navy and spent a year in afghanistan serving our country thank you to them as well the truth will out this may sound familiar to many of you the truth will out is a line from act  scene  of williams shakespeares the merchant of venice during cacis abu ghraib ordeal i felt our team could use a motto that described our situation and that we could rally around and it turned out mr shakespeare had created the motto for our modern day crisis several centuries ago the truth will out shakespeare also said there is a history in all mens lives and his classic words describe all too well our experience which unfolds in the pages of our book – our good name in  caci – the company that i led for  years – endured the worst crisis in its long corporate history in fact we still face fall out from its effects today caci had always been a well known company within the government contracting industry we were also a contractor that had maintained an impeccable reputation for over four decades but in april  most of the world heard of caci for the first time when it was linked to the terrible abuses at abu ghraib prison in iraq overnight caci went from being a lowprofile wellrespected company to becoming a target of blame and shame it took a very long time and a lot of effort by a dedicated team to steer caci through this crisis in april  we published our good name a factual narrative of our ordeal in my time with you this evening i would like to discuss why and how this book was written simply put we wanted to get the facts and the truth out and to tell our part in the abu ghraib story this was a story not always accurately reported first i would like to tell you a little bit about caci caci is a government services contractor that was founded in  we began with one software product – a software simulation technology package simscript – that was sold by our founders from their first office – a park bench and phone booth in california caci has evolved over the years into a leading provider of information technology network communications and related professional services our clients include the us government particularly the department of defense and the us intelligence services caci is a public company listed on the nyse with about b in annual sales today we have  employees who work in over  offices around the world but lets go back to april  caci was just about to complete our largest acquisition ever – a m deal  one that would propel us into the top tier of our industry but our celebrations would soon be cut short on april   cacis head of business communications and public relations jody brown received an unusual and disturbing call ogn p it was seymour hersh who was on the phone more specifically he was on jody browns voicemail asking something about a prison in iraq there was a question about caci employees at the site and she didnt know for sure what hersh was talking about but one thing about the tone of his message she knew instinctively this was not good news hersh of the new yorker magazine had a copy of an illegally leaked army report which claimed – suspected – that one of our employees was directly or indirectly responsible for the abuses at abu ghraib two days later  minutes ii aired the now infamous abuse photos what came next was a media feeding frenzy and with the allegation in the illegally leaked report caci became part of the main course by the way my daughter laura had her first child my granddaughter charlotte rose on april   it was quite the eventful day we were as shocked and appalled as everyone at the abuses caci would never condone the behavior depicted in the photos but we were confused as to how a lowerlevel contractor was thought to have such authority over soldiers and could be blamed for everything that happened in the photos especially since no one from caci was even in any of the photos this was the first red flag we also noted that another civilian contractor was falsely named in the initial army report as being a caci employee while an actual caci employee was listed as working for both caci and another company – a second red flag most noteworthy both contractors had been assigned the same level of blame as two senior us army officers – a third red flag there also wasnt any evidence provided in the report…only a suspicion – yet another red flag these inconsistencies or omissions made us think that this was not the whole story but nearly everyone else disregarded these questions or inconsistencies meanwhile we had received nothing but good reports from our army client in the field despite the many conflicting accounts which would normally raise questions – particularly among investigative reporters the prevalent conclusion presented in the media was that caci was somehow to blame what was even more disturbing – at least to me – was that very few people questioned the inconsistencies of the conclusions made in an illegally leaked report including the allegations against caci this report was by major general antonio taguba and i will refer to it from here on as the taguba report there has never been any public inquiry into the leak of the taguba report who leaked it and why the army had issued a press release on the abuse investigation months earlier in january  and again in march there were a few media stories about it so the military was clearly not hiding the abuses and the numbers of discrepancies in the report indicated from cacis perspective that it was probably still a work in progress furthermore it was only one in a series of investigations that were being conducted into the abuses at that time yet the taguba report was taken as gospel – as it were the only and final word on abu ghraib our crisis began with tagubas report the report had several errors or inconsistencies as i just mentioned it also lacked hard evidence to support its biggest allegation – those named individuals responsible for the abuses so what most people would accept as a credible source – a us army report – was in fact wrong on the some important details as far as caci was concerned yet the taguba report was the primary source for the media and public at large on the abu ghraib abuses based on that army report cacis employees were accused of being unqualified and that management was putting our investors at risk caci was made out to be guilty of the abuses – even torture – in iraq and other parts of the world in which we didnt even work we were also labeled as war profiteers torturing for profit these errors continued to be distorted and amplified by the media for months to come and there seemed to be no limit to the wrong things said about caci caci conspired with other companies and the us government to drum up business by doing the governments dirty work – but this was wrong – not true caci provided armed security personnel and even mercenaries – also wrong – not true caci engaged in spying and knew of assassinations– again wrong – not true this is only a sampling of wrong accusations in fact we compiled a list of all the accusations – and their corrections – in the first appendix in the book it is  pages long what followed was nothing short of a witch hunt the media wasted no time pillorying us and in trying and convicting us opportunists tried to make caci a scapegoat the government reacted with several investigations one in particular – the gsa suspension and debarment inquiry  that could have put us out of business for good with this much wrong we had no choice but to push back full force we had to stand up for our employees our customers our investors and our reputation we had to act quickly thoroughly and with integrity we had to get the facts right and unlike others – mainly in the media – whose sense of justice was the court of public opinion caci would adhere to the rule of law we would follow the principles of due process and of innocent until proven guilty our good name is a detailed factual account of how we responded to this crisis we took great care to address all of the questions and accusations we carefully researched the issues and revealed our sources we presented the facts as provided in official records our good name was our effort to set the record straight about caci and abu ghraib and defend the fine reputation of our company a reputation built on over four decades of hard work by thousands of employees quality service to the us government and other clients and the investments – of trust and money – of our shareholders we had no choice but to stand up for ourselves in an information age you wouldnt expect an information shortage but thats what we faced in  better said we had a shortage of facts sure there were some but the governments hearings and additional investigations would take several more months so it would be some time before more facts about what happened at abu ghraib would surface the abu ghraib story was horrendous and salacious yielding captivating headlines and images there was a demand not only for more information but also for someone to blame so there was a large void that needed to be filled the media among others filled that void with speculation conjecture misinformation errors and even propaganda this was far more appealing than the few facts at hand or waiting for more information to be revealed and as adrienne rich american poet and essayist once said false history gets made all day any day the truth of the new is never on the news so you can imagine what caci was up against but even more daunting was trying to get cacis side of the story heard media coverage of caci at best included only a few lines from our news releases and statements at worst it amplified all of the distortions and errors about the companys work in iraq much of the coverage of the abu ghraib story lacked a basic understanding of the contracting business and even the rule of law in several interviews i had to not only explain government contracting but due process and the concept of being innocent until proven guilty but our voice was simply drowned out in the media frenzy we were not surprised at the lack of recourse in the media take newspapers for example while the original story may get large headlines on the front page… at best the corrections to that story are in small print in the bottom corner of another page days later and does anyone here remember the last time they heard a correction on broadcast news but we were surprised when there was little interest in our side of the story – when we were the story a prime example the washington post published an oped by a critic of government military contracting whose accusations named caci nine times but the post refused to publish our counter oped piece most companies tend to maintain a low profile in a crisis and thats the advice we got at first but caci had no choice but to step up and be heard too much was at risk so we developed a hypercrisis management strategy that addressed our various challenges and kept our stakeholders informed we first reached out to our employees and clients to reassure them that we were on the case caci employees also needed to be equipped with the facts so they could brief our clients as needed moreover we stated that caci was fully cooperating with all government investigations at the same time we launched our own investigation using outside counsel we also assigned key caci executives to talk individually to some  clients with major contracts it was critically important that we maintain ongoing communications with our army clients in iraq so we could get the facts from the people up close and familiar with the abu ghraib events the caci team also launched an aggressive response campaign to push back against the errors and misinformation in the media we put out numerous news releases and held conference calls with employees managers and investors we set up an faq section on our website and answered questions as soon as they came in and we sent written clarifications – several hundred of them – to all the reporters who were getting their facts wrong caci was included in nine probing government investigations in all and while we felt like we were getting a wire brushing caci fully cooperated with each one caci had absolutely nothing whatsoever to hide and we were as eager as the government to get to the truth we also tasked our outside legal counsel with conducting a vigorous internal investigation and we kept our board of directors fully informed nearly five years later not one current or former caci employee has been charged by the us government with any wrongdoing none of the government investigations and proceedings has found caci or any of its employees culpable of the photographed abuses in any way as for the business side we lost one small contract in the uk our stock price fell sharply at first but soon rebounded we are very competitive and we continued with our strategic and technology initiatives and have become twice the size we were in  some might say jack caci seems to have come through this crisis virtually unscathed business is pretty good youre holding your own why rehash it all and put caci in the forefront of this story again with a book the answer is simple because we had to we had to make sure the truth and the facts were known particularly where misperceptions remained we had to make sure caci people and our clients knew our full story and we also have three civil lawsuits pending against us they are clearly without merit and we are fighting them – vigorously so we felt compelled to defend our good name if you googled caci last month february  the top  results were as follows the first two were our corporate site and six referred to other unrelated organizations with the same acronym name the other two one was an activist nonprofits website with the description of caci as a private military corporation that provided contract interrogators to the abu ghraib prison in baghdad… all true except the false and disparaging private military corporation label the other is titled caci war profiteer nearly five years later after the abu ghraib ordeal this type of destructive and lingering slander is still coming up online so while we are not enduring a daily deluge of false accusations caci is still dealing with the abu ghraib stain so why did we write our good name our primary aim was to provide the public with a comprehensive factual account that was based on verifiable facts government investigations official reports and sworn testimony it would be a book that told cacis story about our role at abu ghraib and what happened to us as a result to set the record straight at the time we decided to write the book – and even now – there has not been a single resource that thoroughly and factually discussed the events at abu ghraib andor the role of government contractors i recently checked amazoncom to be sure so i felt our good name could be used as a historical reference treating it as something for the historical record the book was extensively sourced and verifiably reported we have  pages and  footnotes you might say no shortcuts the book also has several appendices supporting material and a robust index we spent much of the crisis countering misinformation and errors about caci and our work in iraq so the book was a way to have all the corrections with additional details included in one document we were also able to provide a factual timeline of events through our good name this was especially important in describing how caci ended up in iraq in the first place then we added cacis insider view to the crisis to fully tell our side of the abu ghraib story at the same time the book is also a business and a prcrisis management reference our hypercrisis management strategy incorporated an aggressive pushback campaign an all inclusive book brought together the various elements of our crisis response efforts we detailed cacis challenges and presented our decision making process we even included an appendix that detailed that process which we named a hypercrisis management model we had used the famous tylenol cyanide crisis and pr response effort of  as a reference in developing our own crisis strategy but there was little else in scale and scope to compare to our ordeal we thought it would be useful for other organizations to be able to use our experience to help them through their crises so we definitely had a purpose in writing our good name but we also knew we had a responsibility when you hear the phrase writing a book an image comes to mind of a disheveled author sitting in front of a computer – or a typewriter in an earlier day – struggling to write their story at caci we knew the story we needed to tell but we had a responsibility to the truth so we would tell it by using only facts my team and i approached writing this book as a historical document  a faithful and factual narrative and mirroring the standards of conduct of the american historical association caci would honor the integrity of the historical record leave a clear trail for others to follow and acknowledge the different perspectives as cicero so eloquently put it the first law for the historian is that he shall never dare utter an untruth the second is that he shall suppress nothing that is true moreover there shall be no suspicion of partiality in his writing or of malice with our purpose and principles set we went to the library not the corner public library but cacis abu ghraib library from the first day the scandal broke we kept detailed records every article that related to caci the abuses or other relevant topics was assembled and retained by both date and source every internal and external communication from key caci team members was printed out and organized this included saving many emails and other pertinent electronic correspondences and documents it also meant identifying all records related to our contracts and our iraq project documents basically if it had anything to do with abu ghraib it was put in our ‘library we first maintained these records to compile the facts as they emerged they were used as references throughout the crisis we used them to answer the many questions from caci employees clients and other stakeholders we also needed those records to make sure we hadnt missed anything or made any mistakes we were also actively cooperating with several of government investigations this often required providing detailed contract information on short notice and of course we maintained our library as a back up legal resource as a public company we had to have these records as a matter of accountability and transparency the records were also necessary in our fight against the two early civil action lawsuits filed in  this fulsome library served as a repository for our book as a result our book team had a wealth of resources to draw upon the first draft of our book was written by one of our outside pr consultants that had helped caci develop and implement our crisis response strategy he supplemented our records by conducting indepth interviews with every key caci team member involved there were at least six further drafts over the three years in writing of the book and before publishing the final copy last winter then my team and i finally put this book together i visited several area bookstores i was curious to see how other authors presented their books there was the first impression of the cover which i wanted to capture the story at first glance i also read the various tables of contents and looked at style and layouts but the thing i looked at most was sources and how were credible sources presented for example did the author use endnotes or footnotes or none at all i was surprised to see how many authors used endnotes as reader i find endnotes frustrating if there is more to be said on a subject i do not want to flip back and forth through several pages to find the reference source if the author made a claim i wanted to see who they credited in some cases i wondered if the author had intentionally obscured the sources or it was simply a preference in style as a reader i did not appreciate not having the full story on the same page our good name would use same page footnotes and our sources would all be verifiable no deep throats no anonymous sources and no undisclosed sources and where possible only sworn testimony that simple decision about footnotes was not just about formatting our purpose was to set the record straight so everything we would say had to be accurate verifiable and referenced we would deal only with the facts when the abu ghraib story broke early in  there was very little about the events that had been factually established and as i said before the lack of facts meant there was a vast amount misinformation and conjecture out there however by the time we sat down to write our good name all of the government investigations had been concluded several congressional hearings had been held and several courtsmartial had already been conducted there was the sworn testimony of major general antonio m taguba stephen a cambone undersecretary of defense for intelligence and lt general lance smith deputy commander of central command before the senate armed services committee may   the report by vice admiral albert t church iii march  sworn statements of individuals named in the taguba report law and treaties like the title  of the us code as well as the geneva conventions military procedures like the army field manual for intelligence operations september  it meant witnesses and other key players had already been interviewed or had testified under oath – or both it also meant significant resources had been put into investigations although we will likely never know the full details of exactly what happened at abu ghraib these proceedings and other official records provided the most complete set of facts about abu ghraib and caci that was possible for us to have our good name would also be fully documented the taguba report had become public through an illegal leak it was also misrepresented through out the media certainly as far as caci was concerned the infamous abuse photographs along with the meager facts available about what happened at abu ghraib exploded instantaneously all over the world in an over sensationalized and vastly distorted scandal – certainly as we saw it at caci and media reports throughout the abu ghraib scandal often referenced anonymous sources some accounts never included sources at all for their claims as i mentioned our good name has  on page footnotes our bibliography is  pages long we also reindexed the book ourselves when the publishers version didnt provide enough detail and as we said all of our statements would be factual and their sources readily available on the same page we also performed two rounds of factchecking the team and i went through a vast array of material to write this book every date reference statistic and quote in our good name had to be verified for accuracy and consistency at several points during the writing of the book we conducted peer reviews we had both internal and external readers review the manuscript for tone accuracy and messaging our reviewers included members of the original crisis response team and professionals with government contracting and military backgrounds typically books are reviewed during the publishing phase but we wanted to ensure that every question was answered and that there was nothing we overlooked although the abuses at abu ghraib were a specific set of events…in a specific period of time there was much more to the story for example one of the most misunderstood issues was the use of contractors in iraq as it turned out many in the public were not aware of this activity others used it to create bizarre conspiracy theories a popular one was that the government was hiring contractors to do their dirty work…like torturing detainees we wanted to include appendices in our good name to provide the greater context in which these events happened and we also wanted to provide easy reference sources and tools for our readers one of our appendices is a timeline of events we mark not only key events in cacis ordeal but key events in the iraq war to that date another appendix is a detailed overview of our hypercrisis management model we also included an extensive glossary it defines key terms in government contracting and the war on terror these appendices can also be stand alone documents we have provided appendix a on setting the record straight that presents a comprehensive listing of all the errors about caci along with their corrections – to the media or other organizations as i stated earlier this appendix alone took  pages appendix h describing our hypercrisis management model is already being used in business school classrooms the appendices in our good name are valuable supplements to our story but were created as useful resources to stand on their own another one of our extras is our photo section the abu ghraib story became as big as it did because of the photos depicting the horrible abuses committed there while a photo may be worth a thousand words the abuse photos did not tell the whole story about abu ghraib and definitely not about caci we felt that our readers deserved to see more than what had been presented to them elsewhere for example we show several photos in and around abu ghraib prison most people have no idea how open and vulnerable this facility was from the inside we present two photos of interrogation rooms at the prison although the abuses in the photos were taken in and around jail cells during overnight hours most people believed that this chaos was how detainee interrogations were conducted that was not the case…not true it was quite the opposite interrogations rooms had chairs tables twoway observation glass and even air conditioning we also included images that portrayed cacis plight one set of photos show stills from a news broadcast that discussed how contractors should be prosecuted…less than two weeks after the abu ghraib story broke and before any verifiable facts had been presented to say nothing about being proven we also included a few photos submitted by our employees in iraq one image you see here is of a bombed out caci office luckily the caci employee who normally sat there was on leave many in the media and public forgot that the civilian contractors they were so eager to vilify also shared the risks and dangers that our military faced every day in iraq kierkegaard the famous danish philosopher once said life must be lived forward but it can only be understood backward we at caci going forward during the crisis could predict neither the challenges nor the outcomes that would arise but looking back we could take the time to understand the scale and scope of what we went through cacis entanglement with abu ghraib and the media – at its height – only lasted a several months but our good name took over three years to write here we are now nearly five years later and what have we learned there are several conclusions we can make for sure about caci and abu ghraib caci was not in any way to blame and certainly not responsible for what happened at abu ghraib no current or former caci employee has ever been charged with any wrongdoing there has never been any proof or evidence presented linking caci to the abuses allegations – yes proof – no no caci employee appeared in the notorious abuse photos we know this because  the original suspicions about contractors voiced in the taguba report were never supported by any evidence that was ever made available and we do not know of the existence of any kind of evidence classified or publicly available that would prove anything to the contrary the illegally leaked taguba report was based on an investigation of the mps military police at abu ghraib and only made reference to the contractors interrogators and translators however later investigations also looked in detail at the interrogators military and contractor as well as the interrogation practices and policies eg the reports of gen fay secretary schlesinger and adm church in fact the subsequent investigations and evidence could not and did not conclude anything to support tagubas initial allegations that a contractor interrogator the caci employee was directly or indirectly responsible and  there are no official findings or evidence about caci the company because caci did not do anything illegal or culpable to find out about further caci would never even entertain the thought of condoning or participating in any inappropriate or illegal activities if any former or current employee had been found to have been involved in the abuses it would have been the regrettable actions of the individual not caci we are confident that caci has been long known as a company that takes the high road and does the right thing abu ghraib was no exception one of the benefits of having written and published our good name was getting these conclusions in print there now exists a permanent factual record of events about caci and abu ghraib caci also has finally had its say in rejecting the allegations made against it so thats the story behind our book our good name i wanted you to know why we wrote it and what we believe it provides to the reader and the history of abu ghraib we also have websites for the book and caci the books is wwwourgoodnamethebookcom and the companys is wwwcacicom i also wanted to remind everyone that all royalties are donated to disabled veterans charities for those who have proudly served our nation

story no description by evan london on  january  tweetcomments  please log in to add your comment report abusetranscript of my family migration storycountry of originmy oldest proven surname ancestor john london i hailed from england in what is now known as the united kingdom back in  when he migrated to the americas the politically united states of england and scotland were separate the uk is located in the british isles in northwestern europe with a total area roughly the size of oregon the climate in the uk is temperate and wet with  seasons today the uk has a population of  million people but when john london i migrated to the americas england and wales had a total population of only about  million christianity is the main religion of the uk and almost all of the population speaks english relationships with extended family are valued in the uk and among my family as well home sweet homeover the years my family has lived in many different places across north america some of the recorded places my family has lived are king and queen county md essex va halifax va westmoreland va burke county nc roane county tn crawford county ar oklahoma county ok kent county md sacramento ca dallas tx fairfax va and of course arlington county vawhy arlington my dad grew up near bethesda md he met my mom in law school at emory university they started dating and eventually got married they began to look for a house in the dc metro area because my dads parents who had divorced were both living in or around the city my mom also worked in dc at the time the house they found in arlington is the house i live in nowtraditionsviews almost all of my family has a eurocaucasian heritage we are not very diverse and very few traditions are left from the times of my ancestors we do not consider ourselves as from another country because we arrived in america so long ago instead we have begun to create our own traditions one of which is called cakecake all of us in the dc area gather together one evening around the week of someones birthday and have some kind of dessert usually cake and ice cream its not really a usual party because it is usually only for an hour or so later in the day and there are no presents the name came from how my cousin charlotte would say birthday when she was little one characteristic that is common among my family is patriotism and a love for freedom many members of my family have ties to the military or the government do we stand outthere is no ethnic difference between anyone in my family to be honest it was hard to even find interesting content most of our ancestors stories about migration were lost before i was born because of this my family is united together we have no choice but to identify as completely american that i think is the greatest statement my family makes to the world migration my family originated as englishmen with the name london no doubt coming from  of london eventually shortened to just london john london i arrived in colonial america in westmoreland county approx  he hailed from somewhere on the island of great britain when he arrived he served as an indentured servant for several years after his time was up john became a merchant and traded along the chesapeake bay not much is known about his pushpull factors today other than he left great britain to find better business opportunities the descendants of john i soon spread along the coast of virginia and maryland my family migration storyby evan london validityjohn london i is not proven to be my ancestor while it is highly probable my grandfather who is a genealogist in his spare time could not prove that john london was indeed the person who immigrated and started our family line depending how you look at it my surname side of the family technically has no proof of migration to america the first proven member of my surname line was john london iii probable grandson of the first johnnotorious relations documented evidence proves that i and my family are related to several famous kings and queens of england scotland and france several of the more famous persons with genetic connections to me are king charlemagne king john of the magna carta and king egbert first king of all england we are also recognized by the royal family as being related to hm queen elizabeth while that seems exciting the queen most likely shares less than  of her genetic material with me because of how distant the connection is that also means that over several thousand if not millions of people share genetic material with the queen making it not as impressive john london i  john london ii  john london iii  john jefferson london i  rufus houston london  john jefferson london ii  harry riles london  j phillip london sr

directreviewed by steve bestphilip has been leading worship at londons kensington temple for the past  years and has enlisted the musical support of nicky brown and mike haughton and the production and arrangement skills of paul field for this accomplished and relaxing set of easy listening worship songs theres no doubting that philip has a fine voice but it never really gets to be stretched too much during a repertoire that ranges from classics such as the lion and the lamb and tommy walkers superb lord i believe in you to trad workouts such as count your blessings and the ode to joy
