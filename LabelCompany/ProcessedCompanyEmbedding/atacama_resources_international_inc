located information for any other company or firm that is currently providing the specific services that we offer or with the focused approach of amri which is to introduce and connect small and medium sized chilean mining opportunities to potential north american partners company description arrakis mining research inc hereinafter “amri” is a company incorporated in the state of florida in june  we were formed as a consultant to the mining industry the mining industry is subject to constant change due to market trends thereby making it extremely competitive the mining industry is complex because several segments are regulated by both federal and stateprovincial governments amri’s approach is intended to assist our potential clients with general business operations with the growth and development international expansion including mergers  acquisitions and financing aspects of their business exposing our potential clients to a much wider international field of opportunities and perspectives by using the services provided by amri our clients are free to focus on compliance with regulations within their industry and to complete their primary business goals amri focuses on two main aspects of the consulting business international expansion strategy and financing our programs will be tailored to meet the needs and requests of our clients we will assist our clients with growth by exposing them to international merger and acquisition opportunities as well as financing opportunities we will provide customized business strategies based upon client preference which may include any or all of the following  international and domestic corporate development strategies  strategic and financial partnering  mergers and acquisitions  in our ceos business history he has consulted on a number of projects and as a result created a strong corporate history and respect in the mining industry the rate charged for our services will be dependent upon the level of consulting services the client company is interested in utilizing and the complexity of the client company business amri consulting fees will be negotiated and established based upon factors such as the level of services requested by the client thus far we have marketed our services primarily to mining and mining development companies located in the united states of america the “us” and canada amri has been doing business since inception june  to date we have not secured any paying clients however we are confident that with the relationships of our ceo we will soon have paying clients originally formed to do any and all legal business the intent of the corporation was to specialize in corporate development and growth management consultation ken olsen our president has been involved in the company since inception and is the founder we focus on geographic areas projects and budget levels where we believe there are significant demand for our services and the potential for attractive returns to our company and investors we do not consider our company to be a “blank check company” as such term is defined in securities and exchange commission rule  however we are a company with minimal revenues and limited operations and our auditor has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern the company is not a blankcheck company and is not being formed for the purposes of a reverse merger or any other like transaction the company does now and will continue to operate as an advisory company on a feebased compensation basis for independent clients requiring our expertise experience and international contact networks the company’s business plan is first and foremost designed to grow organically by obtaining clients by personal contact however as the opportunity present itself to further our business plan with potential growth through the acquisition of specialty service providers and other independent consulting services companies the company will consider acquisitions to enhance all of the personal efforts any acquisitions that the company may make in the future would be of companies similar in nature to our own operating in similar or complementary industry segments or geographic location to enhance the company with new growth opportunities and a competitive advantage amri anticipates growth through the consolidation of consulting service providers proprietary processes and small to midsized independent management consulting companies that operate in related industries our management has designed an aggressive but straightforward strategy to transition amri to a full service independent mining industry solutions provider in addition to our consulting with minimal risk to the existing operation we believe that our conduct to date evidences significant bona fide business operations and a scenario that is wholly inapposite to any attempt to create the mere appearance of a specific business plan and effort to avoid the application of rule  our general business strategy is to market our services to markets primarily in mining friendly regions of the united states of america our strategically located business development efforts are well positioned to benefit from the continuing need for our services we recognize that current market conditions are extremely challenging accordingly we have adapted our business plan and strategy with the goal of protecting liquidity enhancing our balance sheet and positioning our company for future growth when market conditions improve in connection with this strategy we have adopted a conservative approach and our principal business strategy is to utilize our sales expertise to  sell consulting services throughout selected regions of the united states canada and chile  provide consistently reliable highquality service  aggressively manage operating costs to maintain and improve operating margins  expand business by improving enhancing and
