pursuant to the insurance law of the insurance companys state of domicile presently tiaacref life insurance company is the only participating insurance company  the funds will sell their shares to separate accounts only if each participating insurance company sponsoring such a separate account enters into a participation agreement with the funds the participation agreements define or will define the relationship between each fund and each participating insurance company and memorialize or will memorialize among other matters the fact that except where the agreement specifically provides otherwise the participating insurance company will remain responsible for establishing and maintaining any separate account covered by the agreement and for complying with all applicable requirements of state and federal law pertaining to such accounts and to the sale and distribution of variable contracts issued through such separate accounts the role of the funds under this arrangement with regard to the federal securities laws will consist of offering and selling shares of the funds to the separate accounts and fulfilling any conditions that the commission may impose in granting the requested order  the use of a common management investment company or investment portfolio thereof as an investment medium for both vli accounts and va accounts of the same participating insurance company or of two or more insurance companies that are affiliated persons of each other is referred to herein as “mixed funding” the use of a common management investment company or investment portfolio thereof as an investment medium for vli accounts andor va accounts of two or more participating insurance companies that are not affiliated persons of each other is referred to herein as “shared funding”  applicants propose that the funds may offer their shares directly to qualified plans advisers and the general accounts of a participating insurance company  the use of a common management investment company or investment portfolio thereof as an investment medium for separate accounts qualified plans advisers and general accounts is referred to herein as “extended mixed funding” applicants legal analysis  section a of the  act makes it unlawful for any company to serve as an investment adviser or principal underwriter of any investment company including a unit investment trust if an affiliated person of that company is subject to disqualification enumerated in section a or  of the  act sections a a and b of the  act have been deemed by the commission to require “passthrough” voting with respect to an underlying investment companys shares  rules eb and etb under the  act provide partial exemptions from sections a a a and b of the  act to vli accounts supporting certain vli contracts and to their life insurance company depositors under limited circumstances as described in the application vli accounts their depositors and their principal underwriters may not rely on the exemptions provided by rules eb and etb if shares of the fund are held by a vli account through which certain vli contracts are issued a vli account of an unaffiliated participating insurance company an unaffiliated adviser any va account a qualified plan or a general account accordingly applicants request an order of the commission granting exemptions from sections a a a and b of the  act and rules eb and etb thereunder in cases where a scheduled premium vli account holds shares of a fund and one or more of the following types of investors also hold shares of the funds i va accounts and vli accounts supporting scheduled premium or flexible premium vli contracts of affiliated and unaffiliated participating insurance companies ii qualified plans iii advisers andor iv general accounts  applicants maintain that there is no policy reason for the sale of fund shares to qualified plans advisers or general accounts to prohibit or otherwise limit a participating insurance company from relying on the relief provided by rules eb and etb nonetheless rule e and rule et each specifically provides that the relief granted thereunder is available only where shares of the underlying fund are offered exclusively to insurance company separate accounts in this regard applicants request exemptive relief to the extent necessary to permit shares of the funds to be sold to qualified plans advisers and general accounts while allowing participating insurance companies and their separate accounts to enjoy the benefits of the relief granted under rule eb and rule etb applicants note that if the funds were to sell their shares only to qualified plans exemptive relief under rule e and rule et would not be necessary the relief provided for under rule eb and rule etb does not relate to qualified plans advisers or general accounts or to a registered investment companys ability to sell its shares to such purchasers  applicants are not aware of any reason for excluding separate accounts and investment companies engaged in shared funding from the exemptive relief provided under rules eb and etb or for excluding separate accounts and investment companies engaged in mixed funding from the exemptive relief provided under rule eb similarly applicants are not aware of any reason for excluding participating insurance companies from the exemptive relief requested because the funds may also sell their shares to qualified plans advisers and general accounts rather applicants submit that the proposed sale of shares of the funds to these purchasers may allow for the development of larger pools of assets resulting in the potential for greater investment and diversification opportunities and for decreased start printed page expenses at higher asset levels resulting in greater cost efficiencies  for the reasons explained below applicants have concluded that investment by qualified plans advisers and general accounts in the funds should not increase the risk of material irreconcilable conflicts between owners of vli contracts and other types of investors or between owners of vli contracts issued by unaffiliated participating insurance companies  consistent with the commissions authority under section c of the  act to grant exemptive orders to a class or classes of persons and transactions applicants request exemptions for a class consisting of participating insurance companies and their separate accounts investing in existing and future funds of the company as well as their principal underwriters  section c of the  act provides in part that the commission by order upon application may conditionally or unconditionally exempt any person security or transaction or any class or classes of persons securities or transactions from any provision or provisions of the  act or any rule or regulation thereunder if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the  act applicants submit that the exemptions requested are appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the  act  section a of the  act provides among other things that it is unlawful for any company to serve as investment adviser or principal underwriter of any registered openend investment company if an affiliated person of that company is subject to a disqualification enumerated in sections a or  rules ebi and ii and rules etbi and ii under the  act provide exemptions from section a under certain circumstances subject to the limitations discussed above on mixed funding extended mixed funding and shared funding these exemptions limit the application of the eligibility restrictions to affiliated individuals or companies that directly participate in management or administration of the underlying investment company  rules ebiii and etbiii under the  act provide exemptions from passthrough voting requirements with respect to several significant matters assuming the limitations on mixed funding extended mixed funding and shared funding are observed rules ebiiia and etbiiia provide that the insurance company may disregard the voting instructions of its variable life insurance contract owners with respect to the investments of an underlying investment company or any contract between such an investment company and its investment adviser when required to do so by an insurance regulatory authority subject to the provisions of paragraphs bi and biia of rules e and et rules ebiiib and etbiiia provide that an insurance company may disregard the voting instructions of owners of its variable life insurance contracts if such owners initiate any change in an underlying investment companys investment policies principal underwriter or any investment adviser provided that disregarding such voting instructions is reasonable and subject to the other provisions of paragraphs bii biib and biic of rules e and et  applicants represent that the sale of fund shares to qualified plans advisers or general accounts will not have any impact on the exemptions requested herein regarding the disregard of passthrough voting rights shares sold to qualified plans will be held by such qualified plans the exercise of voting rights by qualified plans whether by trustees participants beneficiaries or investment managers engaged by the qualified plans does not raise the type of issues respecting disregard of voting rights that are raised by vli accounts with respect to qualified plans which are not registered as investment companies under the  act there is no requirement to pass through voting rights to qualified plan participants indeed to the contrary applicable law expressly reserves voting rights associated with qualified plan assets to certain specified persons  similarly advisers and general accounts are not subject to any passthrough voting rights accordingly unlike the circumstances surrounding separate account investments in shares of the funds the issue of the resolution of any material irreconcilable conflicts with respect to voting is not present with respect to advisers or general accounts of participating insurance companies  applicants recognize that the prohibitions on mixed and shared funding might reflect concern regarding possible different investment motivations among investors when rule e was first adopted variable annuity separate accounts could invest in mutual funds whose shares were also offered to the general public however now under the internal revenue code of  the “code” any underlying fund including the funds that sells shares to va accounts or vli accounts would in effect be precluded from also selling its shares to the public consequently the funds may not sell their shares to the public  applicants assert that the rights of an insurance company on its own initiative or on instructions from a state insurance regulator to disregard the voting instructions of owners of variable contracts is not inconsistent with either mixed funding or shared funding applicants state that the national association of insurance commissioners variable life insurance model regulation the “naic model regulation” suggests that it is unlikely that insurance regulators would find an underlying funds investment policy investment adviser or principal underwriter objectionable for one type of variable contract but not another type  applicants assert that shared funding by unaffiliated insurance companies does not present any issues that do not already exist where a single insurance company is licensed to do business in several or all states a particular state insurance regulator could require action that is inconsistent with the requirements of other states in which the insurance company offers its contracts however the fact that different insurers may be domiciled in different states does not create a significantly different or enlarged problem shared funding by unaffiliated insurers in this respect is no different than the use of the same investment company as the funding vehicle for affiliated insurers which rules eb and etb permit affiliated insurers may be domiciled in different states and be subject to differing state law requirements affiliation does not reduce the potential if any exists for differences in state regulatory requirements applicants state that in any event the conditions set forth below are designed to safeguard against and provide procedures for resolving any adverse effects that differences among state regulatory requirements may produce if a particular state insurance regulators decision conflicts with the majority of other state regulators then the affected participating insurance company will be required to withdraw its separate account investments in the relevant fund this requirement will be start printed page provided for in the participation agreement that will be entered into by participating insurance companies with the relevant fund  rules eb and etb give participating insurance companies the right to disregard the voting instructions of vli contract owners in certain circumstances this right derives from the authority of state insurance regulators over separate accounts under rules eb and etb a participating insurance company may disregard vli contract owner voting instructions only with respect to certain specified items affiliation does not eliminate the potential if any exists for divergent judgments as to the advisability or legality of a change in investment policies principal underwriter or investment adviser initiated by such contract owners the potential for disagreement is limited by the requirements in rules e and et that the participating insurance companys disregard of voting instructions be reasonable and based on specific good faith determinations  a particular participating insurance companys disregard of voting instructions nevertheless could conflict with the voting instructions of a majority of vli contract owners the participating insurance companys action possibly could be different than the determination of all or some of the other participating insurance companies including affiliated insurers that the voting instructions of vli contract owners should prevail and either could preclude a majority vote approving the change or could represent a minority view if the participating insurance companys judgment represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote then the participating insurance company may be required at the relevant funds election to withdraw its separate accounts investments in the relevant fund no charge or penalty will be imposed as a result of such withdrawal this requirement will be provided for in the participation agreement entered into by the participating insurance companies with the relevant fund  applicants assert there is no reason why the investment policies of a fund would or should be materially different from what these policies would or should be if the fund supported only va accounts or vli accounts supporting flexible premium or scheduled premium vli contracts each type of insurance contract is designed as a longterm investment program  each fund will be managed to attempt to achieve its specified investment objective and not favor or disfavor any particular participating insurance company or type of insurance contract applicants assert there is no reason to believe that different features of various types of variable contracts will lead to different investment policies for each or for different separate accounts the sale of variable contracts and ultimate success of all separate accounts depends at least in part on satisfactory investment performance which provides an incentive for each participating insurance company to seek optimal investment performance  furthermore no single investment strategy can be identified as appropriate to a particular variable contract each “pool” of vli contract and va contract owners is composed of individuals of diverse financial status age insurance needs and investment goals a fund supporting even one type of variable contract must accommodate these diverse factors in order to attract and retain purchasers permitting mixed and shared funding will provide economic support for the continuation of the funds applicants state further that mixed and shared funding will broaden the base of potential variable contract owner investors which may facilitate the establishment of additional funds serving diverse goals  applicants do not believe that the sale of the shares to qualified plans advisers or general accounts will increase the potential for material irreconcilable conflicts of interest between or among different types of investors in particular applicants see very little potential for such conflicts beyond those that would otherwise exist between owners of vli contracts and va contracts applicants submit that either there are no conflicts of interest or that there exists the ability by the affected parties to resolve such conflicts consistent with the best interests of vli contract owners va contract owners and qualified plan participants  applicants state they considered whether there are any issues raised under the code treasury regulations or revenue rulings thereunder if qualified plans separate accounts advisers and general accounts all invest in the same fund applicants have concluded that neither the code nor the treasury regulations nor revenue rulings thereunder present any inherent conflicts of interest if qualified plans advisers general accounts and separate accounts all invest in the same fund  applicants note that while there are differences in the manner in which distributions from separate accounts and qualified plans are taxed these differences have no impact on the funds when distributions are to be made and a separate account or qualified plan is unable to net purchase payments to make distributions the separate account or qualified plan will redeem shares of the relevant fund at its net asset values in conformity with rule c under the  act without the imposition of any sales charge to provide proceeds to meet distribution needs a participating insurance company will then make distributions in accordance with the terms of its variable contracts and a qualified plan will then make distributions in accordance with the terms of the qualified plan  applicants state that they considered whether it is possible to provide an equitable means of giving voting rights to variable contract owners qualified plans advisers and general accounts in connection with any meeting of fund shareholders the fund or its transfer agent will inform each participating insurance company with respect to its separate accounts and general account adviser and qualified plan of its share holdings and provide other information necessary for such shareholders to participate in the meeting eg proxy materials each participating insurance company then will solicit voting instructions from owners of vli contracts and va contracts in accordance with rules e or et or section deiiiaa of the  act as applicable and its participation agreement with the relevant fund shares of a fund that are held by an adviser or a general account will generally be in the same proportion as all votes cast on behalf of all variable contract owners having voting rights however an adviser or general account will vote its shares in such other manner as may be required by the commission or its staff shares held by qualified plans will be voted in accordance with applicable law the voting rights provided to qualified plans with respect to the shares would be no different from the voting rights that are provided to qualified plans with respect to shares of mutual funds sold to the general public furthermore if a material irreconcilable conflict arises because of a qualified plans decision to disregard qualified plan participant voting instructions if applicable and that decision represents a minority position or would preclude start printed page a majority vote the qualified plan may be required at the election of the relevant fund to withdraw its investment in the fund and no charge or penalty will be imposed as a result of such withdrawal  applicants do not believe that the ability of a fund to sell its shares to a qualified plan adviser or general account gives rise to a “senior security” as defined by section g of the  act regardless of the rights and benefits of participants under qualified plans or owners of variable contracts separate accounts qualified plans advisers and general accounts only have or will only have rights with respect to their respective shares of a fund these parties can only redeem such shares at net asset value no shareholder of a fund has any preference over any other shareholder with respect to distribution of assets or payment of dividends  applicants do not believe that the veto power of state insurance commissioners over certain potential changes to fund investment objectives approved by variable contract owners creates conflicts between the interests of such owners and the interests of qualified plan participants advisers or general accounts applicants note that a basic premise of corporate democracy and shareholder voting is that not all shareholders may agree with a particular proposal their interests and opinions may differ but this does not mean that inherent conflicts of interest exist between or among such shareholders or that occasional conflicts of interest that do occur between or among them are likely to be irreconcilable  although participating insurance companies may have to overcome regulatory impediments in redeeming shares of a fund held by their separate accounts applicants state that the qualified plans and participants in participantdirected qualified plans can make decisions quickly and redeem their shares in a fund and reinvest in another investment company or other funding vehicle without impediments or as is the case with most qualified plans hold cash pending suitable investment as a result conflicts between the interests of variable contract owners and the interests of qualified plans and qualified plan participants can usually be resolved quickly since the qualified plans can on their own redeem their fund shares advisers and general accounts can similarly redeem their shares of a fund and make alternative investments at any time  finally applicants considered whether there is a potential for future conflicts of interest between participating insurance companies and qualified plans created by future changes in the tax laws applicants do not see any greater potential for material irreconcilable conflicts arising between the interests of variable contract owners and qualified plan participants from future changes in the federal tax laws than that which already exists between vli contract owners and va contract owners  applicants recognize that the foregoing is not an allinclusive list but rather is representative of issues that they believe are relevant to the application applicants believe that the sale of fund shares to qualified plans would not increase the risk of material irreconcilable conflicts between the interests of qualified plan participants and variable contract owners or other investors further applicants submit that the use of the funds with respect to qualified plans is not substantially dissimilar from each funds current and anticipated use in that qualified plans like separate accounts are generally longterm investors  applicants assert that permitting a fund to sell its shares to an adviser or to the general account of a participating insurance company will enhance management of each fund without raising significant concerns regarding material irreconcilable conflicts among different types of investors  applicants assert that various factors have limited the number of insurance companies that offer variable contracts these factors include the costs of organizing and operating a funding vehicle certain insurers lack of experience with respect to investment management and the lack of name recognition by the public of certain insurance companies as investment experts in particular some smaller life insurance companies may not find it economically feasible or within their investment or administrative expertise to enter the variable contract business on their own applicants state that use of a fund as a common investment vehicle for variable contracts would reduce or eliminate these concerns mixed and shared funding should also provide several benefits to owners of variable contracts by eliminating a significant portion of the costs of establishing and administering separate underlying funds  applicants state that the participating insurance companies will benefit not only from the investment and administrative expertise of the funds adviser but also from the potential cost efficiencies and investment flexibility afforded by larger pools of funds therefore making the funds available for mixed and shared funding will encourage more insurance companies to offer variable contracts this should result in increased competition with respect to both variable contract design and pricing which can in turn be expected to result in more product variety applicants also assert that sale of shares in a fund to qualified plans in addition to separate accounts will result in an increased amount of assets available for investment in a fund  applicants also submit that regardless of the type of shareholder in a fund an adviser is or would be contractually and otherwise obligated to manage the fund solely and exclusively in accordance with the funds investment objectives policies and restrictions as well as any guidelines established by the funds board of trustees the “board”  applicants assert that sales of fund shares as described above will not have any adverse federal income tax consequences to other investors in such fund  in addition applicants assert that granting the exemptions requested herein is in the public interest and as discussed above will not compromise the regulatory purposes of sections a a a or b of the  act or rules e or et thereunder applicants conditions applicants agree that the commission order requested herein shall be subject to the following conditions  a majority of the board of each fund will consist of persons who are not “interested persons” of the fund as defined by section a of the  act and the rules thereunder and as modified by any applicable orders of the commission except that if this condition is not met by reason of death disqualification or bona fide resignation of any directortrustee or directorstrustees then the operation of this condition will be suspended a for a period of  days if the vacancy or vacancies may be filled by the board b for a period of  days if a vote of shareholders is required to fill the vacancy or vacancies or c for such longer period as the commission may prescribe by order upon application or by future rule  the board will monitor a fund for the existence of any material irreconcilable conflict between and among the interests of the owners of all vli contracts and va contracts and start printed page participants of all qualified plans investing in the fund and determine what action if any should be taken in response to such conflicts a material irreconcilable conflict may arise for a variety of reasons including a an action by any state insurance regulatory authority b a change in applicable federal or state insurance tax or securities laws or regulations or a public ruling private letter ruling noaction or interpretive letter or any similar action by insurance tax or securities regulatory authorities c an administrative or judicial decision in any relevant proceeding d the manner in which the investments of the fund are being managed e a difference in voting instructions given by va contract owners vli contract owners and qualified plans or qualified plan participants f a decision by a participating insurance company to disregard the voting instructions of contract owners or g if applicable a decision by a qualified plan to disregard the voting instructions of qualified plan participants  participating insurance companies on their own behalf as well as by virtue of any investment of general account assets in a fund any advisers and any qualified plan that executes a participation agreement upon its becoming an owner of  or more of the net assets of a fund collectively “participants” will report any potential or existing conflicts to the board each participant will be responsible for assisting the board in carrying out the boards responsibilities under these conditions by providing the board with all information reasonably necessary for the board to consider any issues raised this responsibility includes but is not limited to an obligation by each participating insurance company to inform the board whenever variable contract owner voting instructions are disregarded and if passthrough voting is applicable an obligation by each trustee for a qualified plan to inform the board whenever it has determined to disregard qualified plan participant voting instructions the responsibility to report such information and conflicts and to assist the board will be a contractual obligation of all participating insurance companies under their participation agreement with a fund and these responsibilities will be carried out with a view only to the interests of the variable contract owners the responsibility to report such information and conflicts and to assist the board also will be contractual obligations of all qualified plans under their participation agreement with a fund and such agreements will provide that these responsibilities will be carried out with a view only to the interests of qualified plan participants  if it is determined by a majority of the board or a majority of the disinterested directorstrustees of the board that a material irreconcilable conflict exists then the relevant participant will at its expense and to the extent reasonably practicable as determined by a majority of the disinterested directorstrustees take whatever steps are necessary to remedy or eliminate the material irreconcilable conflict up to and including a withdrawing the assets allocable to some or all of their vli accounts or va accounts from the relevant fund and reinvesting such assets in a different investment vehicle including another fund b in the case of a participating insurance company submitting the question as to whether such segregation should be implemented to a vote of all affected variable contract owners and as appropriate segregating the assets of any appropriate group ie va contract owners or vli contact owners of one or more participating insurance companies that votes in favor of such segregation or offering to the affected variable contract owners the option of making such a change c withdrawing the assets allocable to some or all of the qualified plans from the affected fund and reinvesting them in a different investment medium and d establishing a new registered management investment company or managed separate account if a material irreconcilable conflict arises because of a decision by a participating insurance company to disregard variable contract owner voting instructions and that decision represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote then the participating insurance company may be required at the election of the fund to withdraw such participating insurance companys separate account investments in a fund and no charge or penalty will be imposed as a result of such withdrawal if a material irreconcilable conflict arises because of a qualified plans decision to disregard qualified plan participant voting instructions if applicable and that decision represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote the qualified plan may be required at the election of the fund to withdraw its investment in a fund and no charge or penalty will be imposed as a result of such withdrawal the responsibility to take remedial action in the event of a board determination of a material irreconcilable conflict and to bear the cost of such remedial action will be a contractual obligation of all participants under their participation agreement with a fund and these responsibilities will be carried out with a view only to the interests of variable contract owners or as applicable qualified plan participants for purposes of this condition  a majority of the disinterested directorstrustees of the board of a fund will determine whether or not any proposed action adequately remedies any material irreconcilable conflict but in no event will the fund or its investment adviser be required to establish a new funding vehicle for any variable contract or qualified plan no participating insurance company will be required by this condition  to establish a new funding vehicle for any variable contract if any offer to do so has been declined by vote of a majority of the variable contract owners materially and adversely affected by the material irreconcilable conflict further no qualified plan will be required by this condition  to establish a new funding vehicle for the qualified plan if a a majority of the qualified plan participants materially and adversely affected by the irreconcilable material conflict vote to decline such offer or b pursuant to documents governing the qualified plan the qualified plan trustee makes such decision without a qualified plan participant vote  the determination by the board of the existence of a material irreconcilable conflict and its implications will be made known in writing promptly to all participants  participating insurance companies will provide passthrough voting privileges to all variable contract owners whose variable contracts are issued through registered separate accounts for as long as the commission continues to interpret the  act as requiring such passthrough voting privileges however as to variable contracts issued through separate accounts not registered as investment companies under the  act passthrough voting privileges will be extended to owners of such variable contracts to the extent granted by the participating insurance company accordingly such participating insurance companies where applicable will vote the shares of each fund held in their separate accounts in a manner consistent with voting instructions timely received from variable contract owners participating insurance companies will be responsible for assuring that each of their separate accounts investing in a fund calculates voting privileges in a manner consistent start printed page with all other participating insurance companies investing in that fund the obligation to calculate voting privileges as provided in the application shall be a contractual obligation of all participating insurance companies under their participation agreement with the fund each participating insurance company will vote shares of each fund held in its separate accounts for which no timely voting instructions are received as well as shares held in its general account or otherwise attributed to it in the same proportion as those shares for which voting instructions are received each qualified plan will vote as required by applicable law governing qualified plan documents and as provided in the application  as long as the commission continues to interpret the  act as requiring that passthrough voting privileges be provided to variable contract owners a fund adviser or any general account will vote its respective shares of a fund in the same proportion as all votes cast on behalf of all variable contract owners having voting rights provided however that such an adviser or general account shall vote its shares in such other manner as may be required by the commission or its staff  each fund will comply with all provisions of the  act requiring voting by shareholders which for these purposes shall be the persons having a voting interest in its shares and in particular the fund will either provide for annual meetings except to the extent that the commission may interpret section  of the  act not to require such meetings or comply with section c of the  act although each fund is not or will not be one of those trusts of the type described in section c of the  act as well as with section a of the  act and if and when applicable section b of the  act further each fund will act in accordance with the commissions interpretations of the requirements of section a with respect to periodic elections of directorstrustees and with whatever rules the commission may promulgate thereunder  a fund will make its shares available to the vli accounts va accounts and qualified plans at or about the time it accepts any seed capital from its adviser or from the general account of a participating insurance

qualified plan documents each fund will disclose in its prospectus that a shares of the fund may be offered to both va accounts and vli accounts and if applicable to qualified plans b due to differences in tax treatment and other considerations the interests of various variable contract owners participating in the fund and the interests of qualified plan participants investing in the fund if applicable may conflict and c the funds board will monitor events in order to identify the existence of any material irreconcilable conflicts and to determine what action if any should be taken in response to any such conflicts  if and to the extent rule e and rule et under the  act are amended or proposed rule e under the  act is adopted to provide exemptive relief from any provision of the  act or the rules thereunder with respect to mixed or shared funding on terms and conditions materially different from any exemptions granted in the order requested in the application then each fund
