improvement era vol  number  october  page  two parents five brothers and three sisters of the prophet joseph smith were living at the time of the coming of moroni and each became a devout believer in the reality of the revelations  they comprise a virtual jury qualified to evaluate the consistency of josephs early story and his personal believability in telling it  without dissent these eleven gave total acceptance the first person to believe in the angels coming was the prophets father  the prophet went to the field the morning after the triple vision of instruction but physical exhaustion prevented his working  as he was leaving the field the angel appeared to reiterate his message and commanded me to go to my father and tell him of the vision and commandments which i had received  lucy mack smith added a detail likely to have been remembered by a parentthat the angel was actually requesting an explanation for josephs not following prior instructions to report the visions to his father  josephs answer was that he feared his fathers skepticism however the angel rejoined he will believe every word you say to him  one manuscript account adds vividness to the event in an  conversation the prophet recalled the moment when he first informed his father of the angels visit the old man wept and told me that it was a vision from god and to attend it joseph smith sr was the patriarch of his family and in at least one family gathering voiced for all a complete faith in his sons visions  in  the smith family and a few church leaders gathered to receive their blessings from joseph smith sr the appointed patriarch to the church  in an informal service preceding this semiprivate meeting the prophets father reviewed the many afflictions of the family including some deaths particularly that of the beloved alvin taken from us in the vigor of life in the bloom of youth  the patriarch was expressing the intimate feelings of his entire family his remarks were followed by prayer and then the initial blessing given to joseph smith jr  the opening words reviewed the experiences now accepted by the family that had known the prophet from boyhood  the lord thy god has called thee by name out of the heavens thou hast heard his voice from on high from time to time even in thy youth the process by which this family acquired such profound conviction can be reconstructed through the detailed writings of the mother and younger brother of the prophet  these two present significantly different points of view  certainly no one knew joseph smith jr more intimately than his mother  but for all of her faith in god and the calling of her son she resists the temptation to glorify his every act  for instance she begins her story of the early visions with the admission that she had told little about the youth of the prophet  some of my readers will be disappointed she acknowledges since leading questions had been repeatedly put to her about supposed remarkable incidents of his childhood  but as nothing occurred during his early life except those trivial circumstances which are common to that state of human existence i pass them in silence  such realism argues well for lucy mack smiths honesty in the remaining record of her son the memoirs of william smith nicely supplement those of the mother  one sees joseph smith through very feminine the other through very masculine eyes  moreover the confidence of the mother is balanced by the more detached point of view of the brother  in this case the brother is the most spiritually skeptical of all of the smith family  his later religious history proves a lifelong rebelliousness tempered only by older years at the time of joseph smiths visions hyrum and samuel h smith had followed their mother into the presbyterian church while most other family members were religious yet aloof from organized religion  william however describes himself as not even religious  family worship often became irksome or tiresome to me he writes page  of this early period he paid no attention to religion of any kind     only a powerful experience could unite this religiously divided family and lucy mack smith and william represented opposite poles carelessly quoting william smith is an irresponsible procedure  he published rather detailed recollections of his youth in   he also wrote detailed comments on the published stories about the prophet about   besides this access to williams memory is gained mainly through an interview of  a speech of  and an interview of   these five basic sources for william smith show a historical method that resembles his religious career spontaneous and not highly organized  sequence is not as important to him as making his point with a random illustration  one must be aware of these characteristics because he does not relate the first vision of his brother  that is understandable first of all because he was barely nine when it took place  furthermore speaking of later visions he indicated firm belief but carelessness  being young and naturally highspirited i did not realize the importance of such things as i should have done  memory depends on deep interest  william therefore writes impressionistic history recalling accurately his basic feelings of a time while often only approximating details  in this matter he is his own best critic for more than once he alerts the reader that joseph smiths story is more precise than his own  a more elaborate and accurate description of his vision however will be found in his own history through the recollections of lucy mack and william smith the clock can be turned back to the day when joseph announced moronis coming to the family  as discussed the stripling prophet first confided this news to his father in the field  of course lucy smith was not there but from family knowledge she reported that on that morning alvin noticed an unusual slackness in josephs work and that joseph was very pale  william confirmed this episode from firsthand knowledge  i was at work in the field together with joseph and my eldest brother alvin  joseph looked pale and unwell the most dramatic moment that day for the family circle was josephs narration to them of his visions of the night before  william places this event prior to josephs going to the hill and mother smith afterwards  yet both could be right  possibly joseph gave an announcement before and a detailed report afterwards  as to the familys reaction there is no doubt  lucy mack smith describes the intense interest of alvin and the most profound attention of the entire family at josephs first reports of what had happened to him  william also described the familys reaction to josephs explanations  they were astounded but not altogether incredulous the foregoing words are those of an interested professor of church history who talked at length with william in   later william specifically described the reaction of the smiths when joseph told them of moronis coming he arose and told us how the angel appeared to him what he had told him  he continued talking to us for sometime  the whole family were melted to tears and believed all he said  knowing that he was very young that he had not enjoyed the advantages of a common education and knowing too his whole character and disposition they were convinced that he was totally incapable of arising before his aged parents his brothers and sisters and so solemnly giving page  utterance to anything but the truth in this comment william singled out reasons for the implicit trust of the household in the nearly yearold joseph  his limited education and his whole character and disposition  there are important historical insights on these points that enable one to see young joseph smith through the eyes of his daytoday companions first of all it came as a shock that the teenager thought himself capable of writing a book  one autobiographical sketch summarizes his total education in one terse sentence  my father was a farmer and taught me the art of husbandry  that is to say muscle and tools were his skills not study and books  although not illiterate joseph at this point of life was relatively unskilled in reading and writing  one contemporary at palmyra pays him the compliment of showing native intelligence in the juvenile debating club but it is a long leap from that to gaining either the interest or capacity to reproduce scripture joseph himself commented on the demands of life that prevented his doing much reading  he mentioned the indigent circumstances of the family and the necessity to labor hard to support the dozen members alive in   this required the exertions of all that were able to render any assistance for the support of the family therefore we were deprived of the benefit of an education  suffice it to say i was merely instructed in reading writing and the ground rules of arithmetic which constituted my whole literary acquirements william and lucy smith concur  the former pictures his brother as educated only in a rudimentary way  that he was illiterate to some extent is admitted but that he was entirely unlettered is a mistake  in syntax orthography mathematics page  grammar geography with other studies in the common schools of his day he was no novice and for writing he wrote a plain intelligible hand  in other words joseph had taken advantage of limited opportunities for basic education but as his mother insists he was anything but widely read at  he had never read the bible through in his life  he seemed much less inclined to the perusal of books than any of the rest of our children but far more given to meditation and deep study  the smith family measured the adolescent joseph and found it unbelievable that he would know history or aspire to writing it down without the divine direction that he claimed if formal education was subordinate to survival it was the latter that fashioned the personalities of the men of the smith family  here alvins known dutifulness reveals the similarly conditioned traits of the older sonsand alvins dutifulness was also a profound influence on joseph  the prophet had loved and identified with his oldest brother  visiting his sister katherine  years after alvins death he recalled the use of his brothers physical prowess in defending an underdog when one irishman sought to gouge out anothers eyes in a fight alvin took him by his collar and breeches and threw him over the ring which had been formed to witness the fight to love alvin was to love his capacity for obedience  i remember well the pangs of sorrow that swelled my youthful bosom and almost burst my tender heart when he died  he was the oldest and the noblest of my fathers family  in him there was no guile  he lived without spot from the time he was a child  from the time of his birth he never knew mirth  he was candid and sober and never would play and minded his father and mother in toiling all day an untimely death came to alvin in   his mother recounts the deathbed drama as he exhorted his mature brothers to the responsibility that he had shouldered all of his life  he also encouraged his brother joseph to be obedient to the revelations of the angel  it is impressive that such a strong personality as alvin believed in josephs revelations implicitly  it is also impressive that he considered joseph an obedient person  obviously a great measure of alvins seriousness about life was also found in the personality of his prophetbrother william writes  i was quite wild and inconsiderate paying no attention to religion of any kind for which i received frequent lectures from my mother and my brother joseph his mother gives this same picture of joseph  late in life she summarized her achievement of raising a halfdozen boys and observed never was there a more obedient family  this is known to be true of the cluster of older brothers that surrounded joseph  alvin about seven years josephs senior was a youth of singular goodness of dispositionkind and amiable  hyrum older than joseph by some six years was remarkable for his tenderness and sympathy and consistently was a good trusty boy  samuel some two years younger than joseph always performed his missions faithfully whether in the church or in the smith household  these characterizations of her sons by lucy mack smith harmonize completely with their personalities in later life  his mother said that joseph a product of the same environment was a remarkably quiet welldisposed child the responsibilities that molded these elder smith brothers were alluded to by the younger william page  he summed up the economic challenge of moving on to forested land and the result obtained within seven years  while there we cleared a large farm built a house planted an orchard and had commenced living in more comfortable circumstances  the details are impressive  we cleared sixty acres of the heaviest timber i ever saw this work in about five years  some of the elms were    too large to be cut with a crosscut saw after cutting the wood was gathered for burning if anyone had wanted to see joseph at that time and remained very long he would have had to be in the field rolling logs or carrying brush  on the place there were from twelve to fifteen hundred sugar trees and to gather the sap and make sugar and molasses from that number of trees was no lazy job  originally their land did not even have a dwelling on it  the improvements made on this farm were first commenced by building a log house at no small expense and at a later date a frame house at a cost of several hundred dollars a cash outlay in scarce dollars after the  depression  a good fence around  acres was also built and outbuildings etc  in addition to their own taxing work the older sons constantly hired out  whenever the neighbors wanted a good days work done they knew where they could get a good hand and they were not particular to take any of the other boys before joseph either  in all the labor described above joseph did his share of the work with the rest of the boys  over years of trying conditions the smith family knew joseph as personally dependable no small test in a frontier society  this is the objective background for williams view that josephs whole character and disposition compelled all the family to believe in his visions one episode from the prophets youth brings his basic nature into sharp focus  this is his painful bone extraction without anesthesia in late childhood known ordinarily from lucy mack smiths published account of it but also recorded in fair detail in a nauvoo manuscript note by the prophet  before observing josephs heroism in that ordeal it is necessary to discuss some background of that event  all of the smith children had been born in vermont up to and including william whose birthdate there is march    then lucy mack smith says that the family moved during  to lebanon new hampshire where katherine was born july   while at lebanon joseph smiths operation took place  an approximate date is possible because this surgery was preceded by an epidemic that threatened the lives of several of the smith children  as mother smith says the typhus fever came into lebanon and raged tremendously  joseph remembered being cared for in this period by dr smith of nearby hanover  this dates the epidemic for dr nathan smith moved from dartmouth college to yale university in the fall of   furthermore writing his medical memoirs in  he remembered a typhus epidemic at the time  in the autumn of  professor perkins now of new york and myself attended between fifty and sixty cases of typhus in the vicinity of dartmouth college  josephs leg infection followed the epidemic so it is highly probable that his operation took place in the winter of   this means that we are studying the reactions of a boy seven years of age the typhus of that epidemic would now be typhoid complications after which may affect bone page  tissue in the manner indicated by lucy and joseph smith  both recount the infectious pain and its intensification in his leg but joseph gives the more objective summary account and i endured the most acute suffering for a long time under the care of drs smith stone and perkins of hanover  at one time eleven doctors came from dartmouth medical college at hanover new hampshire for the purpose of amputation but young as i was i utterly refused to give my assent to the operation but consented to their trying an experiment by removing a large portion of the bone from my left leg which they did  and fourteen additional pieces of bone afterwards worked out before my leg healed during which time i was reduced so very low that my mother could carry me with ease  and after i began to get about i went on crutches till i started for the state of new york after  years joseph smith recalled his basic facts correctly  doctors smith and perkins did practice jointly in hanover and were on the dartmouth medical faculty  the eleven doctors were undoubtedly medical students some  graduated in the class of   dr smith was famed for his skill as a surgeon in such cases  in fact accounts of his operations and the recollections of joseph and lucy smith precisely agree  more might be said of all this the question at hand however concerns the insight that the incident gives into the character of young joseph smith the first significant point concerns what joseph smith did not say about himself  spare of words and terse on his own suffering he treats his own experience without exaggeration  such a fact has obvious implications for assessing page  whether his supernatural experiences might be believed  his mothers account moves to the level of personal details of the operation  following known practices the boy was offered liquor for pain  at that solemn moment he avoided what many religious people then branded evil  likewise he opposed orders that he be bound  preserving physical liberty he insisted that he could best endure pain in the arms of his trusted father  sensitive to his mothers feelings the boy requested that she leave the room  lucy vividly remembered that moment  then looking up into my face his eyes swimming in tears he continued now mother promise me that you will not stay will you  the lord will help me and i shall get through with it  the necessarily brutal incision and forcible bone removal brought screams of pain but the first time his mother entered the room young joseph recovered enough composure to direct her to leave  i will try to tough it out if you will go away courage is first cousin to responsibility and is superbly shown by joseph smith as the child verged upon preadolescent accountability  what appears clearly is total trust in his parents acute empathy with loved ones and the power of a personality that knew how to submit to reality  in this single prevision episode one can see qualities that made josephs first testimony believable in the light of the known character of young joseph smith the familys complete trust of him is a striking fact  william smith repeatedly told of the angels coming with emphasis on the acceptance of that story by his household  there was not a single member of the family of sufficient age to know right from wrong but what had implicit confidence in the page  statements made by my brother joseph concerning his vision and the knowledge he thereby obtained concerning the plates no serious question can be raised concerning the sincerity of the smiths for they sacrificed reputation and safety by upholding josephs testimony  consequently their impressions of young joseph are a major historical tool  they knew the young prophet intimately they saw his expressions while relating his visions and they judged his sincerity  they are a critical means of standing close to josephs visions and judging their validity it is hard to dismiss the commonsense judgments of the practical brother of the prophet  all believed it was true father mother brothers and sisters  you can tell what a child is  parents know whether their children are truthful or not in his last known interview william smith drove that point home in answer to the question of whether the smiths did not occasionally doubt josephs testimony no  we all had the most implicit confidence in what he said  he was a truthful boy  father and mother believed him  why should not the children  i suppose if he had told crooked stories about other things we might have doubted his word about the plates but joseph was a truthful boy  that father and mother believed his report and suffered persecution for that belief shows that he was truthful  no sir we never doubted his word for one minute notes   joseph smith   modifications in quotations in this article are confined to spelling capitalization and punctuation   lucy mack smith
