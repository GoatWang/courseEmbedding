going concern the financial statements included with this quarterly report have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business   beginning in the quarter ended march   ezy cloud ceased providing services to customers and other activities that generate revenue as of june   we have accumulated operating losses of approximately  since inception our ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon the successful completion of additional financing arrangements and our ability to achieve and maintain profitable operations  management plans to raise equity capital to finance our operating and capital requirements  amounts raised will be used for further development of our products to provide financing for marketing and promotion to secure additional property and equipment and for other working capital purposes  while we are putting forth our best efforts to achieve the above plans there is no assurance that any such activity will generate funds that will be available for operations these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern  our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might arise from this uncertainty summary of any product research and development that we will perform for the term of our plan of operation our future success depends in part upon our ability to respond to changing customer requirements develop and introduce new or enhanced products and keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards we focus our development efforts on several areas including but not limited to enhancing operability of our products across distributed and changing heterogeneous hardware platforms operating systems and relational databases and adding functionality to existing products  these development efforts will continue to focus on deploying applications within a multitiered erp and supply chain environment including the internet    expected purchase or sale of plant and significant equipment we do not anticipate the purchase or sale of any plant or significant equipment as such items are not required by us at this time significant changes in the number of employees as of june   we did not have any paid employees  we are dependent upon our officers and director for our future business development  as our operations expand we anticipate our need to hire additional employees consultants and professionals however the exact number is not quantifiable at this time liquidity and capital resources as of june   ezy cloud had cash of approximately  since our inception on june   ezy clouds operations utilized approximately  of cash prior to the share purchase by mr lim kor kiat on december   the companys operations were funded primarily by the capital contributed by a

kor kiat this amount is not expected to be repaid and was recorded by ezy cloud as a capital contribution a critical component of our operating plan impacting our continued existence is our ability to obtain additional capital through additional equity andor debt financing we have limited financial resources available which has had an adverse impact on our liquidity activities and operations  these limitations have adversely affected our ability to obtain certain projects and pursue additional business  without realization of additional capital it would be unlikely for us to continue as a going concern in order for us to remain a going concern we will need to find additional capital  additional working capital may be sought through additional debt or equity private placements additional notes payable to banks or related parties officers directors or stockholders or from other funding sources at market rates of interest or a combination of these  the ability to raise necessary financing will depend on many factors including the nature and prospects of any business to be acquired and the economic and market conditions prevailing at the time financing is sought no assurances can be given that any necessary financing can be obtained on terms favorable to us or at all as a result of our current cash status no officer or director received compensation through the fiscal year ended june   we have no employment agreements in place with our officers    future funding could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities andor amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition  any future acquisitions of other businesses technologies services or products might require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing which might not be available on terms favorable to us or at all and such financing if available might be dilutive offbalance sheet arrangements we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors critical accounting

qualitative disclosures about market risk we are a smaller reporting company as defined by rule b of the exchange act and are not required to provide the information under this item    item  controls and procedures evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule ae and de under the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in rules and forms adopted by the sec and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management including the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures management with the participation of the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report  based on such evaluation the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective  our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of the material weaknesses described below under managements report on internal control over financial reporting which are in the process of being remediated as described below under management plan to remediate material weaknesses managements report on internal control over financial reporting our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting  internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules promulgated under the exchange act is a process designed by or under the supervision of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer and affected by our board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with gaap internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that · pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets · provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and our board of directors and · provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements    because of its inherent limitations a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met and may not prevent or detect misstatements  internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures  internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper override  because of such limitations there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process and it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk further over time control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of june    in making its assessment management used the criteria established in internal controlintegrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso  based on its assessment management has concluded that we had certain control deficiencies described below that constituted material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting  as a result our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of june   a material weakness is defined under sec rules as a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the companys internal controls  as a result of managements review of the investigation issues and results and other internal reviews and evaluations that were completed after the end of quarter related to the preparation of managements report on internal controls over financial reporting required for this quarterly report on form q management concluded that we had material weaknesses in our control environment and financial reporting process consisting of the following  lack of a functioning audit committee due to a lack of a majority of independent members and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures we do not believe the material weaknesses described above caused any meaningful or significant misreporting of our financial condition and results of operations for the quarterly period ended june    however management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods management plan to remediate material weaknesses management is pursuing the implementation of corrective measures to address the material weaknesses described above  in an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and enhance our internal controls we have initiated or plan to initiate the following series of measures we plan to appoint one or more outside directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to an audit committee resulting in a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures such as reviewing and approving estimates and assumptions made by management when funds are available to us      we believe the remediation measures described above will remediate the material weaknesses we have identified and strengthen our internal control over financial reporting  we are committed to continuing to improve our internal control processes and will continue to diligently and vigorously review our financial reporting controls and procedures as we continue to evaluate and work to improve our internal control over financial reporting we may determine to take additional measures to address control deficiencies or determine to modify or in appropriate circumstances not to complete certain of the remediation measures described above changes in internal controls over financial reporting there was no change in our

financial statement periods since inception our auditor issued an opinion that our financial condition raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern going concern the financial statements included with this quarterly report have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business beginning in the quarter ended march   ezy cloud ceased providing services to customers and other activities that generate revenue as of september   we have accumulated operating losses of approximately  since inception our ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon the successful completion of additional financing arrangements and our ability to achieve and maintain profitable operations management plans to raise equity capital to finance our operating and capital requirements amounts raised will be used for further development of our products to provide financing for marketing and promotion to secure additional property and equipment and for other working capital purposes while we are putting forth our best efforts to achieve the above plans there is no assurance that any such activity will generate funds that will be available for operations these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might arise from this uncertainty summary of any product research and development that we will perform for the term of our plan of operation our future success depends in part upon our ability to respond to changing customer requirements develop and introduce new or enhanced products and keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards we focus our development efforts on several areas including but not limited to enhancing operability of our products across distributed and changing heterogeneous hardware platforms operating systems and relational databases and adding functionality to existing products these development efforts will continue to focus on deploying applications within a multitiered erp and supply chain environment including the internet expected purchase or sale of plant and significant equipment we do not anticipate the purchase or sale of any plant or significant equipment as such items are not required by us at this time significant changes in the number of employees as of september   we did not have

price of  of this purchase price approximately  was contributed to ezy cloud to pay legal accounting and general and administrative costs this amount is not expected to be repaid and was recorded by ezy cloud as a capital contribution cash contributed was approximately  as of september   during the nine months ended september    was contributed to fund operating expenses by lim kor kiat this amount is not expected to be repaid and was recorded by ezy cloud as a capital contribution a critical component of our operating plan impacting our continued existence is our ability to obtain additional capital through additional equity andor debt financing we have limited financial resources available which has had an adverse impact on our liquidity activities and operations these limitations have adversely affected our ability to obtain certain projects and pursue additional business as a result of our current cash status no officer or director received compensation through the period ended september   we have no employment agreements in place with our officers future funding could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities andor amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition
