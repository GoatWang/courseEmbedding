paperbackthere is no doubt in my mind this is a seminal cancer classic from which all the latest findings and awareness about the emotional causes of cancer springs dr simonten was the pioneer of this science which now has mainstream credibility a friend gave me this book when i was diagnosed with stage  breast cancer it blew my mind i knew i had done everything right when i was diagnosed at  i ate only organic i kept a chemical free house i exercised regularly didnt smoke or drink much i breastfed  children for  months each i volunteered i was happy had good relationships and had forgiven my painful pastor so i thought i was a healthy person both physically and spiritually what dr simonten did was help me to begin my journey of emotional healing i was shocked and horrified to discover i had ticked almost every item on his personality test that indicated i was likely to get cancer that changed my life i sought counseling for buried trauma that on a conscious level i would have sworn i had moved past and forgivenbut nodr simonten gets you to question your emotional state and helps you to understand how vital is the role of the subconscious in your healing journey and how when explored and dealt with compassionately you expand your awareness to understand how cancer can be the start of your spiritual awakening and a peaceful contented life i always say sometimes the universe gives you your greatest gifts cleverly disguised as your worst nightmare do simonten gives you the pathway to understand this and turn cancer into your greatest giftread morecomment  people
