company act of  as amended  the adviser’s authority to vote proxies or act on other shareholder actions is established under the delegation of discretionary authority under its investment advisory contract  therefore the adviser will vote all proxies received in sufficient time prior to their deadlines as part of its discretionary authority over fund assets in accordance with these proxy voting policies and procedures procedures while the chief compliance officer is ultimately responsible for ensuring that all proxies are voted on behalf of the fund a proxy voting committee has been created

with an independent third party glass lewis  co “glass lewis” to vote proxies according to a set of predetermined proxy voting guidelines  importantly however kalmar investment advisers retains the ongoing right to override glass lewis proxy votes that it does not believe are in the best interest of the fund’s shareholders  internally a member of the advisers’ investment team serves as the glass lewis proxy voting watchdog reviewing glass lewis proxy research and recommendations in particular those to vote contrary to management’s recommendation  under that circumstance the glass lewis research and recommendation is forwarded to kalmar’s portfolio manager or research analyst most familiar with the company in question  after email communication with kalmar’s investment team on the voting issue in question and once a voting decision has been reached then voting instructions are transmitted to glass lewis and the watchdog prints and stores paperwork memorializing the decision and it is retained in the company’s files with regard to the relationship between securities lending and proxy voting kalmar’s approach is driven by its determination of the best interest of its clients including any mutual fund clients and their shareholders  kalmar evaluates several factors in determining whether to recall loaned securities in order to vote such proxies including but not limited to the subject matter of the proposal being voted on the likely impact on the voting results if kalmar voted the securities on loan and the value of voting the loaned securities relative to the securities lending income expected to be derived from such securities  based on its experience kalmar believes that in most cases the value of recalling loaned securities to vote proxies will be less than the securities lending income either because the outcome of the vote will not be impacted by voting the loaned securities or the result of the vote is not likely to have significant economic consequences  periodically kalmar analyzes the process and benefits of voting proxies for securities on loan and will consider whether any modification of its voting policies or procedures are necessary in light of any regulatory changes andor chaning securities lending economics the adviser will fulfill its duty of care in monitoring corporate actions and voting client proxies by regular and continual review in a deliberate and informed manner of the glass lewis proxy voting guidelines and override them as it deems necessary conflicts conflicts of interest will be identified monitored
