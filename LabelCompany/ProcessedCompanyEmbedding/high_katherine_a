when doctors determined he was braindead the family made the difficult decision to donate his organs not only did this painful chapter give katherine a greater perspective and appreciation for life

number of photographs of katherine then aged nine in a series of poses to advertise a hair care product she had invented upon returning to new york with permission from katherines parents she sent the

her love for both her father and a union soldier bug buster  and bride of chucky  represented a venture into the horror genre for katherine while both films could be described as rather tongueincheek despite their gory emphases bride of chucky  was the better received both critically and commerciallyin  katherine decided to branch out into series television when she accepted the role of the haughty yet vulnerable isabel evans on roswell  a show that blended teen angst with scifi drama though she had never planned to embark on a career in television the role of isabel a teenager with a

husband josh kelley personal quotes  on her role in my father the hero  there are still men who come up to me today and say you were really hot in that film i was  for gods sake one of the most interesting things about that show roswell  for me was that because isabel was an alien i got to do many things so that was creatively satisfying i think anyones fear of getting involved in a show that could run for several years is that youll be playing only one character for that long that can get stale for an actor so on roswell i really lucked out razor magazine interview im grateful people think im beautiful or think im sexy and i suppose its better than the alternative but i do try to fight it a bit so its not all people see me as and id love to one day be in a position where i could choose a role to showcase my creativity versus just my bra size i love changing my look i would love love love to cut all my hair off into a really short punky haircut my own mother told me i didnt have a shot in hell of winning tonight while accepting the emmy award for outstanding supporting actress in a drama series for her role as isobel izzie stevens on greys anatomy  at the th primetime emmy awards   september  on knocked up  a little sexist it paints the women as shrews as humorless and uptight and it paints the men as lovable goofy funloving guys it exaggerated the characters and i had a hard time with it on some days im playing such a bitch why is she being such a killjoy why is this how youre portraying women ninetyeight percent of the time it was an amazing experience but it was hard for me to love the movie id like to start talking children seriously in the next year  but my husband josh feels more like two years so well probably do a year and a half im excited about having a big family im talking five or six on hollywood stereotyping youre the blonde or the cheerleader or the girlfriend it would have been really easy to fall back on the blonde and the bra size and just do that for the rest of my career my mother says she thinks i wouldnt have appreciated success the same way if it had come faster or more easily now its a much bigger reward people who know me well know that i have an opinion about pretty much everything if i wasnt in this industry i wouldnt work out but i have hips and a butt and everything that goes along with that including cellulite so i do the best i can i pride myself on being kind but thats not to say there arent moments when im a diva everybody has bad moments on gerard butler hes a mans man and thats what makes him so appealing we all talk about how were missing the cary grants and those movie stars of old that were just these sexy charismatic men and i really feel like gerry is filling that missing thing right now if i spread myself too thin im not a good actor im not a good mother and im just really highstrung  and everybody hates me my husband and i feel strongly about manners when people are impressed by our daughters pleases and thanks you we feel like weve won the parents of the year award on her mother being her manager in hollywood she didnt care if she made any friends in this town this is a feardominated industry  and my mother refuses to be intimidated by that this is all a game of chicken and my mother is really good at chicken on admiring sandra bullock whenever im about to do or say something i first think wwsbd which stands for what would sandra bullock do i dont know her personally but from what ive seen of her and what ive read about her she seems to be one of the most wellspoken gracious charming and funny women in hollywood if i could get there i would like to be just like her on her brothers death thats one of those experiences in a family that changes the whole dynamic forever it doesnt mean that everything is horrible forever its just that we were a certain kind of family before that happened and we are a different family now hes dead we are all keenly aware of the precariousness of life you cant not be now  it was a moment that changed everything you think if only hed sat in the front seat that day and not the back and suddenly youre thinking we ought to be more careful about our decisions over the years you realize that we have no control things happen without warning we are not the perfect family we dont say i love you every time we talk to each other but we try not to take each other for granted one regret is that you wish you had a few more moments to tell them you loved them on her complaining on the set of one for the money  i was complaining about the hours and one of our producers said you should ask debbie reynolds about her hours on singin in the rain so i did it was so horrifying what women had to go through to make that movie it was her first big break and she was working with an icon and they were dancing and singing she said they worked  hours a day and she would get a few hours sleep on her sofa in the dressing room and then go back to work it was so much that i thought she was exaggerating then she told me how she had to dance with bleeding feet at one point gene kelly wanted to stop because debbies feet were bleeding all over the scene and she was like no no im fine i can keep going so then i stopped complaining about my hours salary  knocked up    dresses   the ugly truth   killers   life as we know

and recombinant proteins produced using sitedirected mutagenesis and a mammalian expression system  study of the regulation of expression of the genes encoding the vitamin k dependent clotting factors these genes manifest tissuespecific expression they are expressed only in the liver we have isolated the  flanking sequences of all three genes characterized promoter activity and determined using dnase footprinting the location of protein binding sites within these promoters in the case of factor x we have determined through a variety of approaches the identity of the transcription factors binding to the promoter and are in the process of carrying out similar studies on the promoters of vii and ix  studies designed to establish an experimental and clinical basis for gene therapy of hemophilia a bleeding disorder that results from a deficiency of functional factor ix we are currently using both viral vectors to introduce the factor ix cdna into target cells of interest my colleagues and i have several active projects including a study on the generation and use of recombinant aav vectors expressing factor ix to treat hemophilia b in particular we are investigating novel methods of delivering vector to target tissues and are also exploring the use of alternate serotypes and optimized expression cassettes in order to maximize gene expression other work focuses on safety problems including determinants of the immune response to the transgene product and assessment of risk of germline transmission of vector sequences in other experiments we are investigating the function of coagulation proteins through the use of targeted disruption of clotting factor genes current areas of interest include completion of clinical trials of an aavmediated liver directed approach rotation projects for   gene transfer for hemophilia b  immunological aspects of viral vectorbased gene transfer  novel approaches to the treatment of hemophilia lab personnel xavier anguela
