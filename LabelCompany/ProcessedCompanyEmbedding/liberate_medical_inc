of the day enlarge liberate medical ceo angus mclachlan with a prototype of secondbreath a copd treatment… more file photo crestwoodbased biotech company liberate medical llc wants to help people breathe a little easier and its doing that by developing two products for people with respiratory conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or copd flareups can hit suddenly and they range from mild to lifethreatening — and sometimes they put patients in the hospital with a machine breathing for them enlarge liberate medical ceo angus mclachlan with a prototype of secondbreath a copd treatment… more file photo even after theyre removed from the ventilator patients need help breathing for themselves ceo angus mclachlan said just as astronauts lose muscle mass when they arent fighting the effects of gravity its the same with ventilation vent free the first product is a medical device called vent free the idea is to use electrical charges to stimulate the muscles so they contract preventing muscle loss or restoring muscle strength lost while a patient was on a ventilator liberate has a working prototype and soon will enter two patient clinical trials — the last stage before liberate submits the technology to the fda for approval one trial in holland will test the effects of using vent free to prevent muscle deterioration while patients are on a ventilator the other trial in louisville will test whether the product can rebuild strength in those muscles after patients have been on a ventilator for a few weeks vent free would be marketed directly to hospitals liberate already has plans to work with one local hospital system but mclachlan said he could not identify it because of a nondisclosure agreement second breath the second product called second breath is a portable device that tackles another issue hyperinflation which occurs when the airway narrows and air becomes trapped in the lungs thats a problem because air builds up with every breath and the lungs become too full second breath uses electrical charges to force the abdominal muscles to contract which would squeeze the lungs and push out air the device likely would be administered by prescription only to be worn on the hip during daytoday activities mclachlan said when we wrote about liberate a few years ago the company already was working with the university of louisville on clinical trials and leaders were starting to think about manufacturing liberate now is vetting manufacturers and distributors for the device as required for the fda approval process doing so helps ensure that the design could be easily and costeffectively produced and distributed mclachlan said for both liberate products he thinks the profits could be substantial but the proof is sort of in the pudding and of course it depends on whether those products receive fda approval and make it to market — which can be an expensive process going to market for medical devices it can take two to three years and as much as  million to support development just to reach preclinical testing according to a  paper from california polytechnic state university mapping the medical device development process liberate currently receives funding through a mixed bag of private sources matching grants from the state of kentucky the national science foundation and other government organizations mclachlan declined to say how much funding the company has received if liberates products do make it to market promotion initially would focus on the us and europe but the technology could be applicable to the rest of the world mclachlan said although there are no firm plans to target any other markets yet liberate was founded about three years ago as a spinoff of apellis pharmaceuticals inc a crestwoodbased pharmaceutical company  which also has some interesting stuff going on i wrote earlier this week about an app being developed by another apellis spinoff revon systems inc the company has three employees including mclachlan all of whom are engineers liberate also uses subcontractors to do some work liberate medical is a graduate of the xlerate health business accelerator program
