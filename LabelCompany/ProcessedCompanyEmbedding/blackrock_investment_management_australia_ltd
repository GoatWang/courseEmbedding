leverage our expertise on markets assets and geographies weekly commentary overview over the past four weeks stocks have staged an impressive rebound from their february lows the equity rebound of the past month is a classic “relief rally” where investors are relieved conditions are not as bad as they previously feared this one has been partly predicated on hopes that china is stabilizing which helps explain the sharp rise in commodity prices given that china is the biggest commodities consumer unfortunately signs of real improvement in china are scant while the us appears to be stabilizing the chinese economy remains challenged given the still uneven pace of global growth and tighter financial market conditions volatility may too be low this in turn suggests the potential for a rise in volatility — which would imply another bout of stocks selling off rally marks its fourth week stocks continued to climb rising again for the fourth consecutive week the dow jones industrial average added  to end the week at  while the sp  index grew  to  and the nasdaq composite index advanced a more modest  to  meanwhile the yield on the benchmark year us treasury rose from  to  as its price dropped over the past four weeks stocks have staged an impressive rebound from their february lows but too much of a good thing can sometimes come with a downside and so it is with this recent rally which has pushed volatility back down but perhaps too low that means the stage could be set for a return of volatility and another selloff a mixed reaction to the ecb stocks rallied again last week as investors digested an extensive expansion of the european central bank’s ecb’s stimulus program which included an impressive array of old and new tools the ecb cut its deposit rate by  basis points  and lowered other policy rates by five basis points the package also included an increase in the pace of quantitative easing — to the tune of an additional  billion euro per month to accommodate the larger monthly bond buying the ecb added corporate nonbank investmentgrade debt to the list of assets it may purchase finally the ecb expanded a number of lending programs aimed at spurring further credit growth in the euro area the initial reaction on thursday was mixed stocks ended the session lower following comments from ecb president mario draghi suggesting that further rate cuts were unlikely but did manage to stage a strong rally on friday that notwithstanding one of the not unwelcome side effects of the ecb program would be a weaker euro to make european exports more competitive yet despite the size and extent of the package the euro remained higher against the dollar last week’s equity gains were accompanied by some lessening in investors’ appetite for socalled “safe havens” particularly us treasuries bonds sold off and rates continued to rise with the yield on the year treasury pushing back to  shortterm yields are also rising as investors recalibrate the odds of another federal reserve fed rate hike later this year futures markets are now suggesting a greater than  chance the fed will hike by year’s end the yield on the twoyear note is up roughly  basis points over the past month over the past four weeks stocks have staged an impressive rebound from their february lows but too much of a good thing can sometimes come with a downside relief rally too much too soon the equity rebound of the past month is a classic “relief rally” where investors are relieved conditions are not as bad as they previously feared this one has been partly predicated on hopes that china is stabilizing which helps explain the sharp rise in commodity prices given that china is the biggest commodities consumer unfortunately signs of real improvement in china are scant while the us appears to be stabilizing the chinese economy remains challenged the latest evidence came in the form of a  plunge in chinese exports this was the largest singlemonth drop since  the government is likely to try to stem the decline with some palliative measures but a large stimulus package remains unlikely furthermore the drop in chinese exports calls into question not just the state of the chinese economy but the global trade picture as well against this backdrop of continued uncertainty in the global economy the recent rally is beginning to look a bit excessive this is particularly evident in the sharp drop in volatility the vix index a key measure of equity market volatility has fallen to about half of its february peak meanwhile the vvix which measures the volatility of volatility or more precisely how frequently volatility spikes occur is back to its lowest level since last august given the still uneven pace of global growth and tighter financial market conditions this may too be low this in turn suggests the potential for a rise in volatility — which would imply another bout of stocks selling off march may have come in like a lamb but the lion may be lurking

easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in milliseconds creator deletiontimestamp unix epoch time in milliseconds deletor subject mid predicate
