one of the nation’s oldest independent investment firms needed to revamp its network infrastructure teresa m esposito coo  cfo knew that the company needed to ensure that their systems and applications continued to meet the growing demands of their clients and maintain adherence to increasingly sophisticated sox and glba compliance requirements in addition the company wanted to devote more of its internal management focus to its core business and less on the business of technology based upon extensive research and consultation with industry regulators and auditors as well as recommendations from peers in the financial industry hm payson  co contacted systems engineering after carefully evaluating three other vendor proposals hm payson  co chose systems engineering because
