december please contact your financial advisor for further details x insurancelinked securities webinars subscription request pioneer ils interval fund daily pricing as of performance is not indicative of future results insurancelinked securities may offer investors low correlations insurancelinked securities ils provide a unique opportunity to invest in an alternative asset class that is uncorrelated with financial markets this may result in strong diversification benefits and an attractive riskreturn profile² a measurable risk profile unlike corporate bonds where risk is tied to financial performance ils have wellmodeled and timetested actuarial risk  the risk of securities defaulting due to specific disasters  to assess potential returns and losses a hedge against interest rate risk the primarily floating rate structure of ils links a component of their performance to a benchmark rate such as libor leaving investors with limited interest rate risk correlation  the degree to which assets or asset class prices have moved in relation to one another correlation ranges from  always moving in opposite directions through  never move together to  always move together diversification does not assure a profit or protect against loss london interbank offer rate libor is used as a reference for shortterm interest rates   why invest in ils with amundi pioneer experience and commitment amundi pioneer has been investing in ils since early  we manage ils as a component of many of our diversified portfolios and on a dedicated basis as of june   amundi pioneer has over  billion in exposure to ils  extensive risk analysis the funds process is built upon a significant analytical foundation using industry analytics to evaluate the risk of individual investment opportunities comprehensive research coverage amundi pioneer supplements its robust proprietary research capabilities with third party analysis to incorporate broad industry trends as well as indepth companyspecific analysis into the investment decision our comprehensive coverage permits analysis of reinsurers from multiple views equity corporate bond and ils risk global presence and access as an asset manager with over  trillion in assets amundi pioneer has cultivated partnerships with many reinsurers providing us strong market access to the ils sector    source amundi asset management based on pro forma combined figures for pioneer investments and amundi asset management as of end december       more about insurancelinked securities insurancelinked securities are financial instruments whose performance is determined by insurance loss events primarily driven by weatherrelated and other natural catastrophes  such as hurricanes and earthquakes these events are typically lowfrequency but highseverity occurrences in exchange for higher potential yields investors assume the risk of a disaster during the life of their bonds with their principal used to cover damage caused if the catastrophe is severe enough   a word about risk   certain fees and expenses are associated with an investment in pioneer ils interval fund   please see a prospectus for a complete discussion of the funds risks the fund is a nondiversified closedend management investment company designed primarily as a longterm investment the fund is not a complete investment programthe fund invests primarily in insurancelinked securities ils which are high yield debt securities that involve a high degree of risk the fund is operated as an interval fund meaning the fund will seek to conduct quarterly repurchase offers for a percentage of the funds outstanding sharesalthough the fund will make quarterly repurchase offers the funds shares should be considered illiquid   insurancelinked securities may include eventlinked bonds also known as insurancelinked bonds or catastrophe bonds the return of principal and the payment of interest on eventlinked bonds are contingent on the nonoccurrence of a predefined trigger event that leads to physical or economic loss such as a hurricane or an aerospace catastrophe eventlinked bonds may expose the fund to other risks including but not limited to issuer credit default adverse regulatory or jurisdictional interpretations and adverse tax consequences the fund may also invest in structured reinsurance investments or similar instruments structured to comprise a portion of a reinsurers catastropheoriented business known as quota share instruments or reinsurance sidecars investors participate in the premiums and losses associated with these underlying contracts into which the fund has limited transparency the size of the ils market may change over time which may limit the availability of ils for investment the availability of ils in the secondary market may also be limited certain securities including ils structured reinsurance investments and derivatives may be impossible or difficult to purchase sell or unwind such securities and derivatives also may be difficult to value the values of fund holdings may go up or down due to market conditions inflation changes in interest or currency rates and lack of liquidity in the bond market investments in highyield or lower rated securities are subject to greaterthanaverage price volatility illiquidity and possibility of default when interest rates rise the prices of fixed income securities in the fund will generally fall conversely when interest rates fall the prices of fixed income securities will generally rise investments in the fund are subject to possible loss due to the financial failure of issuers of underlying fsecurities and their inability to meet their debt obligations prepayment risk is the chance that an issuer may exercise its right to prepay its security if falling interest rates prompt the issuer to do so forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates the fund would experience a decline in income and lose the opportunity for additional price appreciation the fund may invest in floating rate loans and similar instruments which may be illiquid or less liquid than other investments the value of any collateral can decline or be insufficient to meet the issuers obligations the securities issued by us governmentsponsored entities eg fnma freddie mac are neither guaranteed nor issued by the us governmentthe fund may use derivatives such as swaps inverse floating rate obligations and others which can be illiquid may disproportionately increase losses and have a potentially large impact on the funds performance derivatives may have a leveraging effect investing in foreign andor emerging market securities involves risks relating to interest rates currency exchange rates and economic and political conditions these risks may increase share price volatility there is no assurance that these and other strategies used by the fund will be successful    all results are historical and assume the reinvestments of dividends and capital gains nav results represent the percent change in net asset value per share   the performance data quoted represents past performance which is no guarantee of future results investment return and principal value will fluctuate and shares when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original cost   performance results reflect any applicable expense waivers in effect
