the most powerful plays ever written the characters face tragedy and are forced to either conform or stand up for what they believe is right in a time when people feared what was different and used religion and politics as a tool to manipulate others miller manages to show that people after nearly  years are still battling the same evils whether its witches in the s nazi germany the mccarthy trials which miller himself was subjected to or afghanistan todaythis book particularly was great with its plot summary and wider reading list its helpful for anyone writing essays on the crucible i

readeron  january format kindle editionverified purchasei think in general this a book of another tale of woe so just for those who like historical and nonfictional works with the hint of english prejudice worked into the mix i mainly dislike that how in an item originally intended to provide intellectual ideology for two time frames it ends up incorporating the usual kind of drama commonly found in modern day soaps i might recommend it therefore to people with a larger intellectual interests in the latter who cant stomach literature without a twist plot not found in places outside of the playwrights mind except the latter concern however a good readread morecommentwas this review helpful to youyesnoreport abuse out of  starsfascinating and horrifyingbya customeron  october format

to go on a beer run this new years eve if alcohol supplies run low this year in several columbus neighborhoods at least restocking adult beverages no longer will require keys or a car  just a smartphone and a credit card locallyowned refill can drop booze and beer at your doorstep and this month bostonbased drizly an online and mobile alcohol ordering service launched here and in two other ohio markets  akron and suburban cleveland as well as middletown the service is ecommerce for alcohol said nick rellas ceo of drizly it is a pretty simple idea letting you shop for alcohol on your phone mobile and online ordering has become the norm for a host of everyday items from shoes to shaving cream consumers can order groceries at giant eagle and kroger via their phone and arrange for pick up and there are numerous restaurant orderingdelivery platforms like grubhub cafe courier and amazon restaurants even wendys opened an office across from ohio state university that focuses on improving its mobile ordering and other technologies so it was perhaps inevitable that alcohol sales have made the move to mobile ordering and delivery there is clearly a tremendous amount of digital ordering said david portalatin vice president and food industry analyst at the npd group the consumer is rapidly adopting it  to get what they want where they want it yet alcohol has befuddled such enterprises before drinkos which offered alcohol ordering and delivery opened here in  and didnt last a year refill also opened in  and plans to expand into cleveland and cincinnati next year drizly has a longer track record at five years old its wellestablished for a mobileordering software company and operates in more than  cities further the company has experience navigating alcohol laws that vary state to state and that often date from the end of prohibition the other thing going for it is that retailers seem to like the concept and will keep trying some version of mobile ordering because an increasing number of customers want it people ask all the time it is a very common question said gursev sidhu owner of arena wine and spirits drizlys initial partner in columbus we had been looking to do delivery for two or three years but we had no system to do it with we couldnt do it on the fly sidhu has two regular delivery drivers and a pair of substitutes who can fill in his drivers are trained to combat underage drinking something drizly takes very seriously drizly requires that an identification card be presented and scanned at the time of delivery it is very thorough he said when we do id checking you have to check anyone you can see from the door if its fishy we dont complete the delivery sidhu also takes orders from refill drizly plans to expand to more retailers as it expands its service in columbus drizly is offering delivery to downtown german village clintonville upper arlington the university district and grandview heights areas sidhu cant usually reach from his arena district store refill can reach most of the neighborhoods inside interstate  as well as pickerington the services reach areas where we do not sidhu said thats one reason services like refill and drizly and amazon restaurants are likely to see a lot of growth in the years to come a good mobile ordering platform gives stores a way to reach additional customers in a format those customers prefer portalatin said refill can be accessed through its website wwwalcoholtogocom and via its app its service includes delivery of beer wine and spirits drizly can be accessed through its website wwwdrizlycom and by downloading its app its offerings include beer and wine  no liquor just yet  and it is offering free delivery for firsttime orders to promote its launch but delivery runs around  in most markets refill charges  for delivery there is also a minimum order set by retailers for arena wine and spirits the minimum order is  jmalonedispatchcom subscribe today choose the plan that’s
