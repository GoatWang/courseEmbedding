everybody like in many past quarters we have again been able to manage our spending in line with our forecast with our current cash we have a financial runway until the second quarter of  we have recently published our proxy for the annual general meeting which will happen on tuesday june  in new york and you are all invited you would have noticed that we included in the proxy a proposal to allow our board of directors to decide on a reverse split if that would be deemed necessary for the optimal positioning of our company in the public markets it should be very clear that it is the intention of the board and the management of the company to avoid this eventuality and that we feel that the data generation that lies ahead of us in the remainder of this year is expected to allow us to see  expected to allow us to see a share price appreciation that should avoid such a reverse split ms caitlin kontulis will provide more color and background explaining what the nasdaq rules are and she will provide guidance as to what the sequence of events is that determines the timing of a decision of such an action from a corporate development point of view during the first quarter of  we completed the mirimmune acquisition and have been able to integrate most of their immunooncology and cell therapy activities in our rd planning and timing dr alexey eliseev our chief business officer will provide more color as it relates to our plans for data generation as well as collaborations and partnerships he will talk about preclinical data in support of our immuneoncology activities including the preparation of our first clinical testing likely to occur as part of the cell therapy protocol in the course of  in the past few years under the leadership of dr pam pavco our chief development officer we have initiated clinical developments for rxi for treatment of hypertrophic scars where we are in phase  as well as for the management of retinal scarring in patients with wet amd where we are in phase  in addition after the acquisition of samcyprone dr pavco also supervised the continued development of this new topical immunotherapy a program where we are now also in phase  for treatment of cutaneous warts she has also been guiding our clinical team in the startup of our human testing of our consumer health compound rxi and sdrxrna that is capable of blocking tyrosinase an enzyme that is key in eumelanogenesis which stands for pigmentation from a news flow point of view it is important to note that the ongoing clinical studies will all have their complete read outs before the end of  dr pavco will provide her final update later on this call she is retiring as of may ’ and considering knowledge and network in the oligonucleotide world it has been important for us to be able to retain her as a member of our scientific advisory board where she will also join two other new sab members whom we added in q of this year professor jim griffin head of clinical oncology at danafarber in boston and professor rolf kiessling head of clinical oncology at the karolinska institute in stockholm sweden we are grateful and thrilled that she has accepted this invitation and that we will be able to benefit from her guidance knowledge and network also today dr pavco will introduced dr gerrit dispersyn the executive who is succeeding her as chief development officer gerrit has worked with pam pavco in the past several weeks to guarantee a smooth transaction of responsibilities dr dispersyn has strong skills regarding drug development activities with small molecules as well as with cell therapeutic approaches and comes with a wealth of regulatory experience as well as a very strong professional network gerrit will provide you with what he sees as the main priorities for him to announce what we are currently doing with our technology platform and with this i would like to turn the call over ms caitlin kontulis for the financial update caitlin kontulis thank you geert good afternoon everyone today the company filed its form q for the first quarter of  with the sec the form includes detailed information on the company’s financial performance for the three months ended march   during our call today i’ll focus on selected financial highlights research and development expenses for the quarter ended march   were  million compared with  million for the same period of the prior year overall research and development expenses were consistent quarteroverquarter they did see a slight increase due to the commencement of the companys immunotherapy program with the acquisition of mirimmune this increase was offset by a decrease in our stockbased compensation expense acquired inprocess research and development expense was  million for the three months ended march   there was no such expense in the first quarter of  this expense was due to the company’s acquisition of mirimmune a privately held biotechnology company that was engaged in the development of cancer immunotherapies in january  the company acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of mirimmune in exchange for shares of company’s common stock and series c preferred stock the fair value of this consideration given during the quarter totaled  million and was expensed as inprocess research and development general and administrative expenses for the quarter ended march   were  million compared with  million for the same period of the prior year the increase in general and administrative expenses was due to an increase in employee headcount with the hire of the company’s chief business officer in connection with the mirimmune acquisition and an increase in legal fees these increases were partially offset by a decrease in stockbased compensation expense net loss for the three month ended march   was  million compared with  million for the three months ended march   the increase in net loss was primarily driven by the onetime charge of  million of acquired inprocess research and development expense as previously discussed at march   the company had cash of  million compared with  million at december   the company believes that its existing cash should be sufficient to fund operations for at least the next twelve months as gerrit mentioned earlier the company has included a proposal in our most recently filed proxy statement for the company shareholders to vote on a potential reverse stock split this is in relation to the company’s recent notice of noncompliance from nasdaq as our share price is currently trading below  we discussed in our last conference call that the company has until august  to regain compliance with nasdaqs listing requirements if at that time the company has not regained compliance we plan to file for an additional  day extension period one of the requirements to receive this extension period is that the company must provide written notice to nasdaq that it intends to regain compliance with the  bid price during this second extension period by effecting a reverse stock split if necessary our goal and our intension is not to have to complete a reverse split and with the number of data points anticipated for the second half of this year it is our belief that a reserve split may not be necessary however taking into consideration the volatility of our share price the nasdaq requirement to receive an additional  day extension and the added cost to hold a special shareholder meeting at a later date the company has taken the necessary and preventative steps to put the reverse split to a vote at our upcoming shareholder meeting should the companys board of directors need to considering approving a reverse stock split at a later date they will weigh all possibilities including evaluating all of our listing options and private equity we look forward to seeing you at our upcoming shareholder meeting in new york on june  with that i will turn the call over to pam pamela pavco thank you caitlin and good afternoon everyone in the next few minutes i will give you a brief update on the status of our ongoing development program first ill begin with the status of our dermal antiscarring clinical study rxi as you know we expanded this study to include a longer dosing regimen six months rather than three months so that we could better cover the period of time that scar formation generally occurs in people prone to hypotrophic scarring im happy to report that all subject participation in this study is now complete and we are in process of verifying all data to clean and lock the database this time consuming process is ongoing and all clinical sites are in the process of being close as data verification is complete in line with our corporate goals we are on track to correlate and present the full dataset from this study in the second half of the year this complete evaluation is expected to include demographics and safety summaries as well as conclusions based on scar evaluation from the principal investigators and a comparison across cohorts as to which dosing regimen provided the best scar outcome rxi also continues to be evaluated in the eye in the phase  clinical study rxi we are close to closing enrollment in this study pending the last potential subject screening results todate the third and highest dose level has been well tolerated in two subjects with no drug related issues occurring in any subject in the trial we are on track to complete enrollment in the first half of the year as stated in our corporate goal and will complete subject participation seven months later based on the last subjects entry date of note last week we presented an overview of this trial and the data leading up to it in an international ophthalmology conference arvo which stands for association for research and vision in ophthalmology a copy of this poster can be found on our website in the consumer health area we are nearing the initiation of our first consumer studies with our antityrosinase compound which is intended to be used for skin hyper pigmentation disorder the compound for this study rxi has been manufactured and released rxi is in the process of being formulated in a gel formulation that will be used in the consumer studies this gel formulation facilitates the sdrxrna compound penetration through the stratum corneum the outer most layer of your skin to the epidermal dermal junction where the target the melanin producing cells reside an overview of the work supporting the upcoming consumer health studies and data showing compound update exvivo in pig skin was recently presented at the meeting of the society of investigative dermatology or sid an update on our other potential consumer health product which targets collagenase was also presented at sid data presented in this poster demonstrated that the elevation of collagenase mrna following uv radiation was statistically reduced by rxi treatment in culture itself and this is a proofofconcept of the potential to use this compound to reduce the effects of photoaging in addition the reduction of the targeted messenger rna after exvivo application of rxi to human skin and explants ph both posters presented at sid are available on our website lastly a brief update on the samcyprone study to treat cutaneous warts rxiscp since the last call we have initiated a second cohort with a more subject friendly protocol based on the preliminary results from the first cohort we reduced the sensitization dose and shortened the timing of it the earlier results from the first cohort showed that greater than  of the subjects were becoming sensitized something that is a prerequisite to have a clearance response we felt that the exploration of a lower dose would be better for the subject in order to avoid over sensitization enrollment is ongoing in this second cohort finally i am very pleased to hand this call as well as my current role over to dr gerrit dispersyn gerrit provides a wealth of experience to rxi hes an accomplished leader in clinical product and business development he most recently served as the vice president global head of clinical affairs at integra lifesciences corporation where he was responsible for integra’s global strategy and execution of clinical development clinical operations and medical affairs programs his background includes research and business activities related to human cellular and tissue based products an experience that will be beneficial for rxi’s newly added focus on immuneoncology and cell therapy prior to integra gerrit worked along geert at barrier therapeutics where he was vice president product development and portfolio management where he focused on the development and commercialization of dermatology products and met all aspects of rd operations and strategy scientific and competitive and business intelligence and alliance management dr dispersyn holds a phd in medical science from the faculty of medicine in maastricht university in the netherlands a postgraduate degree in biomedical imaging and a master of science in biochemistry from the university of antwerp in belgium although i am retired i look forward to continuing to work with gerrit and the whole rxi team as a member of rxi scientific advisory board gerrit is joining a positive enthusiastic and committed group of colleagues and we welcome him on board gerrit gerrit dispersyn good afternoon everyone i would like to start off my comments by thanking pam for a very pleasant and effective transition since i joined the company few weeks ago i have been impressed with the accomplishments of the rd team of rxi under pam’s leadership and i look forward to building on this solid foundation in the next half of this year my focus will be mainly on two fronts first hitting the clinical study milestones that geert and pam mentioned and second defining the clinical development pathway for the use of our sdrxrna technology in cellbased cancer immuneoncology with regards to the clinical study milestone as pam mentioned earlier this will include full study readouts in our dermatology franchise which studies  and  completing patient enrollment in followup in our dermatology study study  and initiation and early data assessment of human testing with our cosmetic product rxi on the cellbased immuneoncology side we aim to further expand our invitro and invivo proofofconcept data our targets include generating data further solidifying the concept that sdrxrna technology is highly suited to overcome several issues seen with different kinds of cell based immunooncology treatments data being generated in different cell types as well as with different indiscernible and targets will be used to decide on the target clinical indication that we will pursue this data will also help us in selecting the right extra muel ph collaborations for the execution of our clinical program slated to start in the  timeframe in addition to these two rd focus areas we will also work with our chief business officer dr alexey eliseev to identify potential opportunities for sdrxrna in cell therapy outside of immuneoncology as this may provide us with potential interesting business development opportunities and now i’d like to turn the call over to alexey who will provide you with more details on our immuneoncology programs alexey eliseev thank you gerrit and hello everyone i will briefly highlight our recent developments in the area of immuneoncology in which we are using our sd rxrna technology platform to create more effective cell based cancer therapeutics as we discussed in our previous call rxi is conducting preclinical studies in several areas where we believe our technology has a competitive advantage and can significantly improve over the existing and development of cell therapies one of these areas is the modification of cart cells to enable them to work in solid tumors last month we participated in the annual meeting of american association for cancer research we presented there the detail of our study with negative integrity in cart cells that we have been able to improve by silencing ph pd with our sdrxrna compound meanwhile we have advanced this program in our labs by identifying more potent pd targeting sdrxrnas through chemical modifications of the existing compounds one of these improved compounds will likely be designated as a clinical development candidate for our future studies we have also scaled up compounds targeting several other new immune checkpoints in the next few months they will be tested with different types of cart targeting solid tumors in animal models another area of interest for us is the improvement of safety and efficacy of hematopatics stem cell transplants which are currently standardofcare for many hematological cancers we have identified a number of targets that can be modulated by our sdrxrna compounds in the transplanted cells we are currently in the process of screening and identifying compounds for these targets this is in early stage but potentially high impact program the third area is the use of sdrxrna to mitigate the cytokine release syndrome or crs a common and sometimes fatal side effect that hampers the development of cart therapies for hematological malignancies we have generated a number of sdrxrna candidates for a target relevant to crs management and are selecting a least candidates for future studies in addition to our internal work we are actively exploring collaborations with leading academic groups and industrial partners who develop novel cellbased immunooncology treatments i will now turn the call back to geert geert cauwenbergh thank you alexey in recent months ive been asked multiple times by retail shareholders why im not buying stock at times when our share prices are under pressure i want to make a few things clear number one all rxi employees and that includes me are restricted from buying or selling rxii securities when the company is in a blackout period these periods are implemented preceding the release of companys quarterly financials or when the company is in position of privileged information number two my past buying pattern should make it quite clear that i am a strong supporter of our company and a strong believer in the potential benefit our technology platform can bring to medicine and unique in nature with our selfdelivering rnai technology and puts it in an unique advantageous position when compared to our peers number three it is my intention to continue to buy as long as people push the share price down those responsible for the selling pressure do so and not based on knowledge and understanding of the scientific and medical potential that our selfdelivering rnai platform that can bring but on a desire of short term gain and greed number four i firmly believe that at a certain value avenues can and will open up that may eliminate some speculative aspects that surround our company shares today with that i will now turn the call back to tammy tamara mcgrillen thank you geert this now concludes the formal presentation of our call operator at this time we would like to poll for questions please questionandanswer session operator thank you the floor is now open for questions operator instructions our first question comes from keith markey with griffin securities keith markey hi thank you for taking my call id like to start out by wishing pam the best of luck with your retirement and your new position on the sab youll be missed and then id like to ask a couple of questions one i was wondering if youve given much thought or would consider to use your sirna for immunotherapies as a potential add on to dendritic cell vaccines alexey eliseev yes keith thank you for question its actually a great question because we studied sdrxrna in applications to multiple types of cells so far they worked in most of them dendritic cells is one area that we are actively considering but we have not done any significant steps towards that end yet the short answer is yes its in our radar but not in any currently active program keith markey okay thank you and then i was wondering if you might when you might be able to elaborate a little bit about the actual targets of your sirna aside from the ones that are obvious already that youve made public alexey eliseev so the targets that have been disclosed so far are pd ctla indiscernible the usual suspects in the checkpoint world we also have a number of targets that are listed in our patent applications those are i believe about  potential checkpoint targets but some of the targets we are working on have not been protected by ip yet so were not disclosing them but they include the commonly studied in actively pursued checkpoint targets keith markey great and then in terms of developing your checkpoint inhibitors are you testing them in conjunction with any other companies or are you creating cart cells yourself for instance or other types of immune cells that you working with alexey eliseev so far we have worked with cros and academia on cart cells so there are  there is one cro thats making publicly unknown cart cells for us that we are using to target solid tumors those are mega cartillan ph we also collaborated with academia and one of the centers we worked with is karolinska university with professor kiessling who is in our sab we are in active discussions with some bigger players in the cell therapy area but its probably too early to mention any names keith markey okay thank you very much operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from justin foster private investor unidentified analyst hi good afternoon geert i want to thank you for the  shares that you bought a few months ago but i want to talk to you a little bit about your thinking on reverse split one of the things that was just not mentioned in terms of trying to meet the nasdaq guideline of a  and just chasing that and youve chased it through an  drop in the stock price from the time you decided on the last reverse split and its already down  from the time you just mentioned it this time youre contemplating a reverse split you havent talked about what would you do if you decided not to chase that  but instead accept listing on a different exchange and this is why i dont understand that the otc qb and otc qx are viable exchanges today with transparency companies on that stock exchange do raise money and if any of the people whove invested money with you have a problem with you getting off the nasdaq then just explain to them how things have changed and give them a choice do they want to see another  decline in their stock that theyre going buy or do they want to understand why youre saying we dont need to reverse split because there is no target dollar that we need to reach that would make your company a whole lot more healthy thanks for listening to that can i have you thoughts geert cauwenbergh absolutely justin first of all i certainly understand what youre saying absolutely remember we were on the qb and on the qc and we have had and we still have a terrific relationship with the management of the otc markets its certainly not that we dont like them we definitely do like them at a certain point when you are trying to grow you need to get to also substantial investments from the usual type of larger fund investors we have been primarily retail based company in terms of our shareholders and i am tremendously grateful for those who have been hanging in those who have become the shareholders those have then walked away but then came back it is a very difficult situation to manage but that’s what why we here for our board is consequently evaluating the situation as caitlin pointed out we have some lag time before we have to make the decision so the way i look at is we need to have a final decision by february  i think of  with what we have waiting in terms of data flow what we have waiting in terms of also the new items coming in our immuneoncology efforts i do think that we stand a good chance to basically survive the onslaught of the shortest as i call it which is if you look at the volumes these are not small players these are big players that do this basically recourse that’s how they make money i am pretty sure we can get through it deal with a major player or with other players in this space would certainly be helpful we are extremely active in doing those things and as i said before in the meantime i can only show and that is what  and i appreciate the fact that you noticed i can only show with the means that i have available that i am a very strong supporter of this company that i am putting my mouth where my heart and my mind is and then i am working with my team as hard as we can to basically roll back away ph from the down where we are the otcs are not excluded in our thinking trust me there is absolutely not excluded nasdaq is not excluded but if it would be necessary than fine we will value whether a reverse split is less or more damaging than moving to the otcs and as caitlin mentioned in her financial update even private equity we have had approaches from the blue or have expressed their interest right now we fell back and we are expecting and hoping that the data flow will help us to bring us to where we are supposed to be in terms of value i realize it may frustrate you as an answer because i have not given you one specific answer i have given you play out of spectrum of options we have and it will be up to the board to either meet me up until me what i have to do or me to negotiate and discuss with them what we think is the best solution but to be i have not a close mind to what you are saying not at all unidentified analyst well thanks very much and i let you go but let me just add if i might very briefly and i really appreciate you having heard me out in your considered response that you played into these hands that you are talking about the shortest the greed traders when you talk about a reverse split they just see a larger stock price that they can knock down again and that’s why you are down  from the time you guys have first mentioned the second reverse split and so if you didn’t have to do that and let’s say stock will go up as you anticipate but if you announce we don’t care whether we are on the nasdaq or not then there is not going to be this downward pressure after the initial jolt and you  if you manage the stay and all these things come true that you said they might than that’s wonderful but by announcing this reverse split contemplation you are going to  you are heading for another  decline and its already hurt and i feel bad for you here you invested just  in the s and maybe the low s price and look what happens but i knew that would happen but you didn’t anyway thank you very much i wish you the luck as you can discern i am a long time shareholder i believe in the company but i think transactionally you guys have not made the wisest decisions in terms of understanding what reverse splits do and how valuable or invaluable nasdaq is thanks again so much and i am going to stay with you guys take care geert cauwenbergh i appreciate it thank you very much unidentified analyst thank you operator thank you our next question comes from bjorn chase ph private investor unidentified analyst thank you very much for taking my call and i want to say that i appreciate this company that you work very very hard and it’s a small company and i think you have done remarkable things over the years i have been an investor an increasing investor now have a significant position with this company you briefly touched on your relationships with the rest of the industry with the biotech industry i wondered if you would care to just give us a little more color on what’s going on on the reception you had on the indications of interest for example in cutting a deal with you that sort of thing we  it seems maybe have heard relatively little of that and i think it might be helpful to people to know what the response is from the biotech industry geert cauwenbergh i’ll start and i thank you very much by the way also thank you very much for being a longterm shareholder those are the people that are the closest to my heart i’ll start with a little bit of  giving you a little bit of color and then i would invite alexey who has often been with me but also on his own in contact with those people in general when we announced  before we moved into immunotherapy and immuneoncology and cell therapy people were looking at us as an ophthalmology or dermatology company and really did not understand the value that our selfdelivering technology brings there is nothing wrong with rnai as discovery and actually as a tool to make it work in diseases the issue the challenge in the beginning loss to try to get it into cells and once they got it into cells the issue was well now that we get in sales because of vehicles we tend to see some vehicle related toxicity as recent as the last quarter of last year we have seen a number of those vehicle compounded compound they fail in clinical actually unfortunately one that i was hoping that omyla ph would be the first with the phase  because that would really validate the whole thing they were failures not because of the value of the compound or the toxicity of the compound but issues that very often came with the vehicle we with ourselves delivering technology do not have that issue and when alexey eliseev and mirimmune came to us it was an eye opening experience for me that lo and behold  this is the area which where this actually the easiest to show that selfdelivering rnais will be idle to deliver on the promises of rnai we could  and i am not going to dwell on it too much because you have seen i am sure all the material that we have generated going to the business development activities in the past since we announced the acquisition and since we started implementing it we’ve had exposure to many of the big pharma companies and many of the larger biotech companies and the cell therapy and immuneoncology companies i would say onethird looks at us like a crowd seeing the first train pass by and they have never seen it others immediately have taken us on their radar screen there have been numerous discussions going on the question that many people are asking is this is we comments of making is this is really interesting can you give us a little bit more data on things like actually one of the comments that dr markey brought up keith markey earlier dendritic cells how does your technology behave with dendritic cells which are notoriously more difficult it seems to get transacted those are things that as alexey mentioned we are focusing on the large players danafarber md anderson just indiscernible the guys in minnesota they all very interested some of them are actually already working with our compounds so to me its very simple its just everybody says give us a little bit more data show and even animal studies are fine they don’t need proof in patients that’s at least what they are telling us and so consequently i think its only a matter of time and in vitro and in vivo nonhuman goes a little faster than human its only a matter of time for us to generate that data and to actually be able to nurture and come up with some great collaborations and hopefully a deal but that still maybe too general but alexey i am sure you have much more detail to add if you care to do so alexey eliseev i would just add to that briefly that even when we were at mirimmune the company that are rxi acquired we did present this technology to almost every single major player in the cell therapy area and we received almost universal interest the technology is broadly applicable including the applications to cell therapy so we see lot of opportunity in making deals with other companies and at the same time retaining lot of value within the company for example out licensing certain type of cell therapy and keeping the others with us but as geert said the companies expect to see more data this is natural in immuneoncology deals happen at an early stage and we are hoping to be able to partner this technology already at the preclinical stage so right now we are keeping ourselves on the radar screen of the major players in cell therapy and we are hoping to make progress on that later this year unidentified analyst well thank you very much i just heard things that i really hadn’t heard before and i learned things that i really didn’t know that you were doing and believe me it makes me feel a lot better and thanks for that geert cauwenbergh we appreciate your loyalty we hope you are with us for long time and we hope that in the not too long time we will be able to provide you with some substantial increase in valuation of your holdings unidentified analyst thank you operator thank you there appears to be no more questions at this time

pharmaceuticals has licensed from flamel technologies  is a controlled release formulation of aspirin for prophylactic cardiovascular indications using flamels micropumpr technology platform asacardr is designed to provide effective and safe therapy for cardiovascular treatment its safety and efficacy for this indication comes from controlling the release of aspirin while providing cardiovascular benefits similar to conventional aspirin formulations asacardr is differentiated from conventional aspirin in that it reduces gastrointestinal side effects further it is the only aspirin formulation that significantly controls the rate of release of aspirin in the systemic circulation system thus avoiding cox  inhibition the major cause of gastrointestinal problems additionally its microparticle coating protects the stomach and intestinal lining from direct contact with the aspirin asacardr is currently approved for marketing in  countries including france and the united kingdom according to the world health organization cardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of mortality in southeast asia in china alone more than a quarter  of all deaths are due to cardiovascular disease and there are currently more than  million adults with hypertension in china about rhei pharmaceuticals rhei pharmaceuticals is a venture backed specialty pharmaceutical company with operations in belgium

equity value growth at reasonable pricemarketplacearrow loop researchs trading ideassummaryrxi is an emerging micro cap listed on the nasdaq cmit has a significant opportunity to market selfdelivering rnai compounds which could fill a largely unmet medical need in wound healingwe reached out to dr geert cauwenbergh president and chief executive officer of rxi for further insight on this opportunitytoday we are considering an emerging micro cap called rxi pharmaceuticals nasdaqrxii this company operates within the biopharmaceutical industry has roughly a  million market cap and is listed on the nasdaq cm in order to gain more insight on this opportunity we conducted an email interview with dr geert cauwenbergh president and ceo of rxi in laymans terms what is rxi all about rxi is all about using a biological mechanism rnai that exists in the human cells to selectively reduce the levels of bad or excessively expressed proteins to fight diseases while only minimally affecting other biological systems in the body rnai is a naturally occurring phenomenon by which short doublestranded rnas interfere with the expression of targeted genes the development of therapeutics based on rnai technology takes advantage of this phenomenon and potentially allows us to reduce the expression of particular genes within living cells the discovery of rnai is regarded as a significant advancement in the scientific community as evidenced by the selection of rnai as the breakthrough of the year in  by the journal science and by the  nobel prize in medicine being awarded to the codiscoverers of rnai including dr craig mello rnai offers a novel approach to the drug development process because rnai compounds can potentially be designed to target any one of the thousands of human genes many of which are undruggable by other modalities rxi is focused on developing innovative therapies based on our proprietary selfdelivering rnai sdrxrna platform therapeutics that use rna interference or rnai have great promise because of their ability to downregulate the expression of specific genes that may be overexpressed in disease conditions rxis sdrxrna oligonucleotides are designed for therapeutic use and have druglike properties such as high potency target specificity serum stability reduced immune response activation and efficient cellular uptake this allows sdrxrnas to achieve efficient cellular uptake and potent longlasting intracellular activity could you provide a brief technical explanation rxi pharmaceuticals has developed a proprietary rnai platform of selfdelivering rnai compounds termed sdrxrna these compounds are efficiently taken up by cells without the need for a delivery vehicle and represent an advancement in the rnai therapeutics field for local applications rxis sdrxrna oligonucleotides are designed for therapeutic use and have druglike properties such as high potency target specificity serum stability reduced immune response activation and efficient cellular uptake these hybrid oligonucleotides combine the beneficial properties of conventional rnai and antisense technologies taken together the design modification pattern and shorter duplex region allows sdrxrnas to achieve efficient cellular uptake and potent longlasting intracellular activity rxi is an sdrxrna that targets the mrna of connective tissue growth factor ctgf a gene known to modulate fibrosis and scar formation rxi is initially being developed to reduce or inhibit scar formation in the skin following surgery rxi pharmaceuticals believes that reducing the level of ctgf early in the wound healing process will result in a reduced level of scarring rxi may have broad applicability for prevention of scarring or fibrosis in other tissues and indications including the eye at this point do you have any idea of how effective rxi is for antiscarring the first clinical trials with rxi rxi and rxi showed excellent safety and tolerability with ascending single and multiple doses as well as dosedependent reduction of the ctgf protein and the mrna that controls production of this protein thus we were able to detect the expected rnai effect in our first clinical trials two phase ii clinical trials are currently underway to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of rxi on the outcome of scar revision surgeries performed on hypertrophic scars on the lower abdomen rxi or elective surgical excision of two similarlysized and placed keloids rxi in these studies the subjects are predisposed to scarring either hypertrophic scars or keloids and a difference in rxi vs placebotreated areas will be evaluated preliminary results will be compiled and reported before the end of  for initial patients reaching  months post treatment what are the main challenges that the industry in which you operate faces today from an operational perspective biotech is an industry that absorbs a lot of money in order to arrive at meaningful innovation for the health and wellbeing of people the chronic need for cash combined with the shortterm orientation of many investors today creates a difficult environment to be longterm focused for small companies in terms of the use of rna technology many of the early challenges in the industry have been at least partially met the addition of nucleotide modifications have improved compound stability reduced inflammatory response and helped to improve specificity the main challenge remaining is delivery not just into the cells which the sdrxrnas achieve but to the site of action in the body at rxi we are focusing on local applications to avoid the issue of systemic delivery in addition to dermal applications rxi has initiated an ophthalmology program in which local delivery to the retina is possible via intraocular administration other rnai companies are developing a variety of delivery options including lipid nanoparticles as a way to support systemic delivery to the liver numerous programs are in place in which the oligonucleotidelipid nanoparticle is taken up by the liver and reduction of their specific target can be evaluated in vivo many of these have shown the desired effect in human clinical studies delivery to organs other than the liver is the next challenge to be met in what ways do you feel the current stock price does not value rxis strengths or weaknesses with one of the most exciting technology platforms in the sirna space rxi pharmaceuticals is by far the smallest company among the publicly traded rnai companies its fully diluted market cap is  to  times lower than that of other companies in this space some of which dont even have a product in clinical development could you please go over your patent portfolio rxi was recently granted a patent from the uspto patent   covering ctfgtargeting sdrxrnas for the treatment of fibrotic disorders in addition rxi has received a notice of allowance for a key patent titled reduced size selfdelivering rnai compounds which broadly covers both the composition and methods of use of rxis selfdelivering platform technology this key patent broadly covers rxis technology platform this platform differentiates us from the competition providing us with a powerful advantage to deliver our rnai compounds without complicated formulations which are commonly used with the other sirna compounds in clinical development rxis intellectual property estate includes patents and patent applications related to chemistries sequences configurations compounds delivery technologies and therapeutic targets this ip has been developed by rxi as well as inlicensed or acquired from thirdparties we believe these patents and patent applications define broad coverage for the development and commercialization of advanced rnai therapeutics in particular they relate to novel and proprietary structural and chemical modification patterns used to introduce druglike properties to rxrna® compounds fundamental ip related to development of rxis rxrna compounds covers distinct structures with duplex length shorter than  bases or longer than  bases in the con text of advanced and diverse chemical modification patterns these patents also cover rnai compounds against targets that are believed to play an important role in fibrosis as well as diseases of the eye cancer and inflammatory diseases in  rxi further strengthened its patent portfolio with the acquisition of the opko rnai intellectual property estate the opko rnai estate includes  patent families and provides broad patent filings for sirna compounds which target genes involved in angiogenesis cancer immune disorders and inflammatory diseases methods for sirna delivery across the bloodbrain and bloodretina barrier are also disclosed for therapeutic and diagnostic use who are the emerging competitors in the rnai industry while some large pharmaceutical companies have reduced their programs in rnai it still remains a large component of the oligonucleotide therapies being pursued many companies including smaller biotechs like rxi are focused on developing rnaibased therapeutics some of the main rnai companies actively working on the use of rnai through systemic delivery are alnylam pharmaceuticals dicerna pharmaceuticals tekmira pharmaceuticals arrowhead research phaserx arcturus therapeutics and silence therapeutics in addition to rxi rnai companies focused primarily on a local delivery approach include quark pharmaceuticals aurasense therapeutics and sylentis the local delivery approach includes ophthalmology applications there are numerous companies working in the wound healing or dermal scarring area but few are utilizing an oligonucleotide approach of active programs using oligonucleotides at least two companies are targeting ctgf rxi with rxi and pfizer with an antisense oligonucleotide as noted here rxi is currently conducting its phase ii trials while pfizer has completed several phase ii trials with positive results showing reduced scar formation additional wound healing targets are being pursued by other companies using oligonucleotides an example is coda therapeutics which is in phase ii with an antisense that targets connexin for improved wound healing what differentiates your therapies from others on the market as well as those currently in development there are currently no fdaapproved therapeutics that are intended to reduce the formation of dermal scars if approved rxi would fill a very large unmet medical need especially for those people prone to poor scarring this type of therapeutic could ultimately have great benefit for trauma surgical or burn patients especially relating to raised or hypertrophic scarring or contracture scarring surgical revision of existing unsatisfactory scars and in the treatment removal and inhibition of keloids scars which extend beyond the original skin injury in the us there are approximately  scar revision surgeries conducted each year and over m surgical procedures our most direct competitor is pfizer with the ctgftargeting antisense oligonucleotide for which positive phase ii results have been obtained in the reduction of scarring following surgery rxi is currently conducting a phase iia trial which could demonstrate that rxi is effective in reducing the recurrence of keloids after keloidectomy keloid excision keloids are benign skin growths which are essentially scars that continue to grow past the original boundaries of the injury people with certain skin types including those of african hispanic and asian descent may be more prone to keloids while a cosmetic concern keloids can also be very uncomfortable itching pain tenderness and can result in tightened skin areas that affect movement and function as such there is a large unmet medical need for a drug to reduce growth or recurrence of keloids in your opinion are there risks in your current business that are underappreciated by investors likely not indeed some  years ago as a result of many failures the rnai approach was all but abandoned by larger companies it is only in the past few years that gradually people have started to realize that with novel technologies the issues of naked sirnas and the delivery of those compounds can actually be resolved there is still a lot of hesitation out there hence the wild fluctuations in share prices for the companies involved in rnai i think it can only get better slowly from here what part of the business do you think is being ignored that has more upside potential than wall street is giving it once people will understand that our sdrxrna platform is applicable to many body systems and diseases wall street will see the upside potential we will need to provide good proof of clinical efficacy with one of our early clinical candidates to start that recognition process do you have any plans to increase awareness of the stock the best promotion of our stock will be delivering meaningful clinical data in the meantime we do talk regularly about our selfdelivering platform and how it can become transformational once we have been able to link the clear effects on biomarkers lowered mrna for the target proteins and lower protein contents in the treated tissues to the clinical benefits data will be the best promotion is rxi actively considering partnership opportunities for rxi rxis therapeutic platform is broadly applicable to the discovery and development of products in multiple therapeutic areas our current partnering strategy for the dermal scarring program is focused on funding its development until the completion of clinical proofofconcept studies however we remain interested in establishing earlystage platform partnerships and collaborations  including research discovery and development collaborations in the therapeutic areas of dermatology fibrosis and ophthalmology as well as in specific diseases and targets of interest to our potential partners rxi also has opportunities in the establishment of platform development collaborations with potential pharmaceutical partners to further improve and develop our rnai therapeutic platform as our preclinical and clinical pipeline continues to mature we will establish specific productfocused alliances enabling us to further advance our pipeline rxi continuously engages pharmaceutical companies interested in rxis dermal and ophthalmology programs to provide updates on our progress in these areas why would someone purchase your product or service what specific needs does it address it addresses medical needs that today cannot sufficiently be addressed by other products in the specific case of hypertrophic scars and keloids no fdaapproved therapeutic agents exist physicians often use drugs offlabel corticosteroids cytostatics radiotherapy etc what is it about your management team that makes them uniquely capable of executing on this business plan highly capable hardworking very knowledgeable in our space nimble and focused on getting the work done without spending hours in meeting rooms also everybody in management actually does several aspects of the drug development process very much handson themselves what are the probable exit scenarios partnering acquiring or being acquired gradually building a complete organization including commercial activities at this point what is managements pipeline priority first our rxi for dermal scarring and second building up our ophthalmology franchise what potential valuedriving catalysts can investors generally expect in both the short and long term clinical data with rxi in scarring exciting results in ophthalmology deals in and out and earlierstage interesting pharmacology data against other protein targets what is the adequacy of rxis funding relative to its goals at this point our goals are aligned with our funding obviously we want to grow and do more to achieve that we will need to selectively look for targeted financing whats your current financial position on may   rxi had  million and no debt cash burn is about  million per quarter and we have cash for another  quarters we also have access to an equity line for another  million with the company currently advancing its clinical program do you have an idea of what the associated costs will be we are currently only advancing one clinical program ie skin scarring specifically for hypertrophic scars and for keloids we have generally a good idea of what the costs associated with that development will be are you encouraged by institutional ownership do you think rxi is gaining traction among retail investors we are gradually building institutional ownership our move to nasdaq has certainly been helpful in that regard it appears that rxi seems to be a fairly popular company with the retail and day trading community we cherish both the institutional side and the retail side very much is there anything else you would like our readers to know about rxi rxi is potentially one of the few biotech companies that will have a material impact on the treatment approach for several diseases based on its unique selfdelivering rnai technology
