have determined this illegal change in zoning regulations strictly violates acquired doctrine rights of the land and that cen biotech had clearly established legal precedent in constructing the facility long before zoning was a concern in other words one cannot retrospectively change bylaws to suit new underlying agendas this is illegal and will not hold much credence in the court of law common law doctrines provide nonstatutory avenues to prevent health canada and lakeshores underlying agenda from becoming legally binding a type of doctrine that cen biotech may indeed utilize against health canada is the manifestdisregard doctrine which is similar to the judicial review that cen biotech has initiated us legalcom explains an arbitrator acts with manifest disregard if  the applicable legal principle is clearly defined and not subject to reasonable debate and  the arbitrators refused to heed that legal principle it is a nonstatutory ground for vacatur though this is under united states court law canadas judicial review follows the manifest disregard terms and regulations to this end cen biotech has publicly revealed many violations of health canadas own rules and regulations regarding mmpr applicants and the implications are striking on may   cen biotech released important email correspondence with health canada that document in detail the time sensitive propogation of cen biotechs mmpr application bill chaaban explains april   health canada surprises cen and tells them they have to pass security clearance stage before the inspection is scheduled they also advise it could take months this was the first cen heard of this requirement on april th  health canada explains to bill chaaban click to enlarge consequently once security clearance has been successfully granted a prelicense inspection would be obtained it is also important to note that health canada asked cen biotech to accelerate their build out of the marijuana facility almost  months before their prelicense inspection and yet deliberately took months to process their application on may th  bill chaaban explains to todd cain executive director of market development for hc click to enlarge bill chaaban and health canadas executive director of market development conversed extensively to implement a systematic approach to successfully obtain mmpr licensure both parties have seemingly agreed to adhere to the rules and regulations established by health canadas own council it is perplexing for investors to notice that almost a month after todd cains letter and health canadas request for cen biotech to accelerate their build out that they finally received approval from health canadas security council to obtain prelicense inspection on june th  health canada explains to bill chaaban click to enlarge almost two months later cen biotech alas obtained their prelicense inspection on july th  in this regard it is feasible to conclude that all security clearance and inspections were successfully completed and accordingly a license would be imminent within weeks after successful inspection of the facility in an affidavit filed by the government in allard et al v her majesty health canada employee todd cain explained other significant elements of health canadas strategy for providing for reasonable access to a quality supply of dried marijuana for medical purposes included providing applicants with ready to build letters upon the completion of the paper review process upon request these letters advise applicants that if they complete their site build as described in their application if the site is verified by a prelicense inspection and if security clearances are granted the applicants license may be issued below are the common fundamental steps mmpr applicants undergo to obtain ready to build letters please note that security clearances are issued in step  subsequently a ready to build letter would be issued in step  hence it is indeed peculiar for health canada to ask cen biotech for another security clearance on april  long after they were issued a ready to build letter on november  it is interesting to note that health canada swiftly ended their ready to build letters process weeks ago attesting to yet another example of how elusive and corrupt their mmpr program has become more on this can be found here no more ready to build letters yet months of orchestrated attack from various media outlets particularly grant robertsons bizarre publications to tarnish cen biotechs reputation caused a political debacle unprecedented in the marijuana investment industry opponents and proponents of cen biotech were fueled to prove their own theories and ideas health canada began speculating under false pretenses that the very company they asked to accelerate their marijuana build out would be ironically rejected with no valid basis of action this is illegal and an injustice to not only cen biotech but many mmpr applicants today cen biotech explains the minister failed to observe procedural fairness and the principles of natural justice in making her decision by failing to consider that her delegates represented to the applicant and the applicant acted on the representations that a license would be granted upon completion of the expedited build out and the completion of the prelicense inspection health canada must be held accountable for their careless and gross negligence in this program and are seemingly under heavy scrutiny by the judicial system of canada more on this can be found on mmjtoday light at the end of the tunnel yet investors of cen biotech have remained hopeful in the chaos from within investors have been keen to notice a similar case of corruption by medical marijuana of massachusetts mmm a mj company that was improperly denied license in  mmm is now a licensed producer more on this interesting case can be found here important highlights of the mmm case in relation to cen biotechs case can be found on the table below mmm manifest disregard judicial review cen biotech judicial review mmm appears to argue that an agencys failure government to abide by its own regulatory processes in itself requires that the agencys decision be vacated cen biotech has indeed been a victim of a similar pattern of corruption in which health canada has failed to abide by its own rules and regulatory processes and thus should not be rejected for mmpr licensure if the agency government has acted for reasons that are extraneous to the prescriptions of the regulatory scheme but are related rather to an adhoc agenda then that agency has acted arbitrarily because the basis for action is not uniform in follow is not predictable health canada has acted its decision on the merits of nothing more than corrupt media outlets orchestrating an agenda to ruin cen biotechs reputation the court agreed that the board government has failed to follow its own rulesthere must be some prejudice before an agencys disregard of its own rules may constitute reversible error in announcing the rule that a failure to follow regulations will support reversal of agency action when the failure causes prejudice to the plaintiff the sjc relied on its prior decision health canada approved cen biotech to construct their facility in a ready to build letter furthermore hc because the department failed to follow its own regulation and the failure caused mmm prejudice the court vacates the departments notice of nonselection judicial review of health canadas actions merits the court to vacate the rejection decision immediately on page  and  of the  page memorandum of facts of the judges decision he detailed the recurring theme in the negative press coverage and there were stories attracted political attention  expressing concern subsequently leading to the denial of this companys license cen biotech has been in constant scrutiny with the globe and mail grant robertson ctv news mayor tom bain and others that have destroyed the companys prospects and goodwill subsequently health canada denied cen biotechs license this is prejudice and a serious gross negligent act of unlawful misconduct an investor of cen biotech explains why is this important in canada a decision of a tribunal board commission or other government decisionmaker can be reviewed on two standards depending on the circumstances the two standards applied are  correctness and  reasonableness in each case a court must undertake a standard of review analysis to determine what appropriate standard to apply this approach was described in detail by the supreme court of canada in dunsmuir v new brunswick therefore if the standard of review of reasonableness is applied to cen biotech health canada engaged and created an expectation for a buildout of the facility a ready to build letter was issued and after the town of lakeshore acknowledged correct zoning of the facility the million dollar facility was constructed conventional understanding in this case shows strong reasonableness for cen biotech to build their facility further supported by lakeshore municipality affirming health canadas acknowledgment that cen biotech was constructing a marijuana facility investors should note that an inspection would not have taken place if other requirements were not satisfied such as screening enhanced screening security clearance zoning etc but this case also shows an example of moving goalposts or in other words in the eye of the law prejudice many investors not limited to cen biotech have determined that health canada cannot follow their own regulations that would otherwise be predictable for all mmpr applicants this lack of proclivity has cost cen biotech and other mmpr applicants millions in revenue and expenses this seemingly appears the case law is in such that any decision of health canada in an adhoc manner would be vacated under section  of the mmpr provision all applicants denied of license or a restriction must be provided a written report to the merits of the refusal investors to date have not been able to determine any indication of a health canada report and are seemingly perplexed by the issue many believe that cen biotech will pave the way for other mmpr applicants to proceed with judicial challenges before federal courts against health canada delahunt ceo of mmm explains how many lives could have been saved if they administered it in a way    that wasnt adversarial but involved scrutiny and people had the option to choose a wellregulated marijuana product rather than oxytocins that are killing people cen biotech and other mmpr applicants have pondered similar concerns just how much more out of sync will health canada be before they eventually are blamed for the demise of the entire mmpr program and patients worldwide it is important for the judicial review of canada to rule with full authority and unbiased prejudice in cen biotechs license dilemma ultimately the court may find itself attacked if they ignore the injustice against cen biotech and lose some modicum of political authority rendering the entire court system vulnerable to further scrutiny and attacks by various political organizations health canada rejects cen biotech the scandal windsor star article health canada statement  “it has come to health canada’s attention that creative edge nutrition inc cen biotech inc issued a february   shareholder update statement which mischaracterizes the meaning of the department’s recent action in respect of the application for a licence to produce under the marijuana for medical purposes regulations matt finston involves the sec  there were some roughly  pages of shareholders telling the regulators that they should go after the real criminals aka the journalists and bloggers who had been exposing the companys dubious behavior for months health canada is instructing anyone with concerns about cen biotech – the company seeking to become the country’s largest medical marijuana producer – to contact police or securities regulators the globe and mail investigation  the ceo of cen biotech which is looking to become canada’s largest producer of medical marijuana has been unloading large amounts of his shares in the stock market while at the same time touting his stock to investors according to documents filed with the securities and exchange commission the ceo has unloaded more than  million shares for a personal gain of more than million stated the author in response to this investigative

patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments diabetes the patient perspective diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose sugar in the blood normally the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy with diabetes the body either does not make enough insulin type  diabetes or does not use it properly type  diabetes leading to high blood glucose levels uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications such as heart attack lowerlimb amputation vision impairment and blindness endocrinologist dr william bill chin has experience treating endocrine disorders including diabetes as chief medical officer at phrma he works to ensure that patient voices are heard drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes when dr chins son danny was  he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst dr chin diagnosed his son himself with type  diabetes he says i don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease particularly one that will be chronic in many ways it’s forever but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed the changing landscape of diabetes treatment the medications that danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years a decade ago a number of insulin options were available to patients as well as oral and injected medications successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels to control their glucose patients needed multiple daily injections andor multiple oral medicines in recent years researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients from fewer pills to less frequent injections careful monitoring and treatment are still needed but current medicines in development offer a promising future there are  medicines currently in development for type  and type  diabetes and diabetesrelated conditions a new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetesrelated complications that affect the kidneys blood vessels and eyes all of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the fda while these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type  diabetes ongoing research remains critical in fact diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the united states in  dr chin says collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes  we are

innovative research and technological breakthroughs of americas biopharmaceutical industry and get to know the people behind the fight to prevent treat and cure disease our fight our mission our companies follow us  pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america  f street nw suite  washington dc   p   f phrmaorg innovationorg privacy policy terms of service aboutus finding lifesaving medicines is a lifes work – the work of  researchers who never say never as well as the millions of patients who fight side by side with researchers in the battle for life against whatever odds they face together now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor the best is yet to come – like advancements in personalized medicine and immunotherapy – and its coming faster than we can imagine welcome to the future of medicine where disease is no match for tenacity no match for ingenuity where together we go boldly do not go gentle todays breakthroughs are becoming tomorrows medicines watch the video we cannot take progress for granted we cannot take progress for granted share tweet link email print we are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases but we must not take this progress for granted  to ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop lifesaving treatments and cures in order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients our country must     make medicines more affordable by rewarding value  today america’s biopharmaceutical companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment or agreements may lower copays if patients achieve better health outcomes while these partnerships will vary they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system yet outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements  government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines rather we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for americans     ensure patients get the best deal on medicines america’s biopharmaceutical companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers pbms those rebates are growing every year and now exceed  billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers but we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price even when their insurers get a rebate in fact patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine  that’s wrong health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive this could lower outofpocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year     make new breakthroughs accessible and promote competition we need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines it simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over  years and over one billion dollars on average  outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more to get medicines approved faster while ensuring safety we need to modernize the fda with new technologies and expertise to keep up with st century science modernizing the fda will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines which will bring medicines to patients faster and enhance competition in the market we also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the us food and drug administration fda  this will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection  at the same time we must avoid policies that deter risktaking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients learn more about our plan to build a sustainable sciencebased health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here related news mustknow facts about drug costs did you know due to negotiation and competition medicine costs are growing at the slowest rate in years  learn the facts do not go gentle welcome to the future of medicine where disease is no match for tenacity no match for ingenuity where together we go boldly watch the video the science behind the logo explore how genomics and new personalized treatments are
