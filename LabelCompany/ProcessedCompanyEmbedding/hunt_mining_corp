rhyodacitic ignimbrite flows and lava domes together with subordinate agglomerates volcanic breccias and tuffs with minor basalts andesites and volcanic agglomerates intercalated upward with mafic tuffs conglomerates and sediments faults active during the period of intense jurassic extension and volcanism generally trend nnwsse and form a series of grabens and horst blocks since jurassic time the rocks have been cut by normal faults of several different orientations but have undergone only a moderate amount of compression in general the jurassic rocks remain relatively undeformed and remain flat to gently dipping except locally where close to faults volcanic domes or similar features thin quaternary age basalt flows conceal about half of the jurassic age rocks on the la josefina project mineralization the type of mineralization and alteration styles present across the project area are classified as low to medium sulfidation type epithermal deposits gold and silver occur in fissure vein systems localized in structures often a meter or more wide and hundreds of meters long they are comprised of quartz veins stockworks and breccias that carry gold silver electrum and some sulfides primarily pyrite with lessor amounts of base metal sulfides mineralization is commonly zoned vertically over a few to several hundred meters from a gold and silver rich top to a relatively silverrich zone with increasing base metals at depth vein textures include open spaces with evidence of multiple generations of quartz reflected as finely banded colloform and textures one area is noteworthy for the sinter type epithermal mineralization found there here precious metals are located both within bonanzagrade pipeline feederbreccia zones and lower grade stratabound mineralization disbursed throughout and directly below the flatling sinter unit the goldsilver and base metal mineralization at la josefina is hosted by rhyolitic volcanics of the chon aike formation which is the host for most mineral occurrences found throughout the deseado massif with one possible exception the mineralization is a variation of classic structurallycontrolled lowsulfidation epithermal fissurevein systems with minor amounts of sulfide minerals and alteration primarily silicification argillization and sericitization the one exception the sinter target is a siliceous exhalite or water lain ash tuff related to fossilized hot spring activity nearly all of the vein systems at la josefina are steeplydipping ° to subvertical the textures and other characteristics reported for these veins are indicative of highlevel to medium epithermal systems this suggests goldsilver mineralization in many veins should extend below the depths tested by the drilling done to date drilling specifications sampling and analytical procedures ​ all meters drilled consisted of hq size diamond core  mm in diameter core recovery averaged greater than  core boxes were closed and shipped from the rig by attending geologists all core was unloaded and placed on indoor logging tables by techs geologic staff then completed core recovery and geotechnical logs core was then logged for lithology structure alteration and apparent mineralization mineralized intervals were reviewed again after splitting geologic staff then typically measured out sample intervals between  to  meters in length based on lithology alteration structure and apparent mineralization geologists determines symmetry of apparent mineralization then draws a cut line onto the core core was then photographed both wet and dry by techs core was then halved by techs with a standard table rock saw  inch diamond blade   halved core is placed back in the box and placed on sampling tables geologists then place one half of each sample interval into a marked bag and seals it with a zip tie half of sampled core is retained for check assay and geologic verification in each sequence of twenty samples geologist inserts one blank sample established barren crystal tuff one core quarter duplicate and one standard  different standards were purchased from an accredited lab and rotated periodically sealed samples are sorted and stored in a locked container until shipped by truck to bus station for transport to als chemex preparation facility located in mendoza argentina an independent report on hunt minings qaqc procedures is included here surface channel sampling​ geologist using paint marks samples intervals in the field under geologic staff supervision while filling out sample description and location information parallel cuts are made into the outcrop or trench floors by technicians saw cuts are made to a uniform depth using hand held electric saws sample cuts are made to replicate a halved size piece of hq core approximately  mm wide by  mm deep this was true historically and is still our target process but we are presently creating some channels that are narrower technicians then chisel out the rock between the cuts bag seal and transport samples back to camp bagged samples are sorted and qcqa samples are inserted into each batch of  as described above historically but not presently our procedure with samples historic work previous exploration valued at  million was conducted over a thirteen year period by fomicruz and minamerica including  surface samples  meters of trenching and  meters of shallow core drilling the historical exploration work completed by fomicruz and minamérica defined four general target areas in the la josefina project as noreste veta norte central and piedra labrada noreste a square kilometer area in the northeast part of the project consists of three separate target areas the most advanced being a sinter layer exposed discontinuously over an area of  kilometers x  meters or more its maximum thickness in outcrop is about  meters dips moderately to the wsw the best exposure is mogote hormigas a meter long sintercapped hill bounded on the east by a nwse fracture zone that displaces the sinter layer examples of highgrade gold over significant lengths of breccia include  m   gt au and  m   gt au in separate trenches veta norte is a  square kilometers area in the northeast central part of the project between the noreste and central target areas it consists of a prominent northsouth fissure vein system up to  meters wide and more than  meters long the vein system is divided into  separate segments all which are gold bearing outcrop and trench samples contain  to  gt gold over lengths of  to  meters and  of  drill holes intersected gold at widths and grades comparable to or better than the surface samples the central area is southwest of veta norte and is crossed by at least  known veinveinlet systems exposed in a squarekilometer window through the overlying veneer of quaternary basalts the veins are discontinuous sinusoidal bodies up to  meters wide  to  meters long trending nwse concealed in both directions beneath basalt cover thirtytwo holes drilled to less than  meters tested  of the  known vein systems in the central area strong mineralization  eg from  to  meters with more than  gt gold up to  gt  was intersected in at least  of the holes piedra labrada in the southcentral part of the la josefina project is a  x  kilometer area with structural fairways containing numerous zones of quartz veinlets and veinletstockworks these zones are a few hundred meters long up to  meters wide and aligned in nwse to nnessw directions over strike lengths of  to  kilometers samples are commonly anomalous in gold with values up to  gt au reported the historic exploration at la josefina has produced results which have been very favorable and in line with results expected from the initial testing of similar highlevel epithermal vein systems in several cases the results demonstrated good continuity of gold mineralization in three dimensions the geology and mineralization defined by this initial work suggests the la josefina vein systems are similar in character and size to other epithermal systems currently being exploited or developed in the region historic exploration hunt mining through ccsa acquired the la josefina project in  and immediately initiated aggressive exploration programs that have to date focused largely on drilling targets previously defined by the exploration
