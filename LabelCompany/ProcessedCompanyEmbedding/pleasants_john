remains unknown john donaldson of conowago street worked as the carpenter and builder known today as a contractor of this greek revival row house he estimated the cost in  at  but the final cost in

business accounts often appear inside the letters which are sometimes in duplicate or triplicate the practice of sending copies of a single letter on different ships to insure that at least one copy would reach its destination was widely used because of the unreliability of the mails early incoming business letters deal with the israel and john p pleasants company whose creditors including their father samuel and brothers charles joseph robert and james request the money owed to them by january  however israel and john realized that they could not pay their companys bills their brothers became angered at this announcement and worried if their reputations would be affected by the business failure of israel and john in fact some letters sent to baltimore by the brothers and the father were malicious and accused israel and john of willful deception their father who owned vast tracts of land in virginia and kentucky however offered them in his letter of  january   acres to use in payment to their other creditors if they assigned him  in good debts then the good debts would be payment for the money owed samuel by the israel pleasants company israel and john accepted this agreement the creditors however especially the english ones were not satisfied with this arrangement because tracts of land in the wilds of kentucky and virginia were useless to them and because they had carried the pleasantss debts for a number of months later all of the creditors agreed to the terms of exchanging land for money etc letter dated  march  except for the tunno and loughnan company

outcomes in the correspondence from  more information on the mandeville v gibson case is presented in the letters of  june and  july  while in virginia william pleasants wrote three letters in october  to his father concerning his effort to gather information for a court case the pleasantss trade with english merchants had been interrupted by a series of federal commerce regulations which forbade trade with great britain and france the nonimportation act of  the embargo act of  and the nonintercourse act of  on  may  macon bill no  once again restored trade between the united states and the two combatants great britain and france but only if these two countries repealed their similar decrees against the united states napoleon however by failing to return sequestered american vessels

take effect on  february  in a letter dated  february  to wallis and lloyd of birmingham england gf and j lindberger of baltimore expressed concern as to whether british goods could be shipped to america in the fall products traded with england included tobacco ginseng buttons and umbrella furniture parts american merchants were not in favor of nonintercourse because they already suffered financially from the ban on commerce with england congress therefore accepted john w eppes amendment to the foreign relations committee bill that would allow trade with england if they repealed their orders in council until that time however the  march  nonimportation act against the british would be in effect on  june  great britain repealed their orders of november  and april  but the congress had already declared war on england on  june because of their impressment of american sailors and seizure of american vessels therefore the trade between america and england continued to be interrupted by a new disagreement the war of  which did not officially end until the us senate ratified the treaty of ghent on  february  correspondence between the pleasantss and english firms began anew in  in october john p pleasants became an agent for joseph wallis and company of birmingham england when he took over the management of their american accounts from his brother charles pleasants

person to publish a book in america on geology was also involved in this speculation as an investor and reputed geologist as charles had suspected however lyons negotiations failed to secure the tract of land the men wanted lyon then proposed various options for the recovery of the two gentlemens investment but finally decided to buy a coal field on short mountain in pennsylvania from which profits

richard refers to thomas jefferson as a warm friend of mine and mentions gen horatio gates as a person from whom he will obtain a letter of introduction for samuel in his bid for consul these letters

whittell of england a first cousin of samuel her brother walter burling of baltimore maryland sought satisfaction from samuel in the form of money and therefore pursued curson from the west indies to london and finally to america in new york on  april  burling challenged curson to a duel in which samuel received a wound to the groin three days later curson succumbed and was interred at the trinity

copresident of disney interactive jimmy pitaro takes helm of group marc graser senior editor marcgraser share this article linkedin email print talk november    am pt execs departure comes after disney scored with disney infinity game in a surprise move john pleasants has stepped down as copresident of disney interactive move comes as the walt disney co said monday it will merge all game and online operations under jimmy pitaro who already is based in los angeles pleasants the company’s games guru recently launched “disney infinity” and is based in san francisco “following three years of consistent operating improvement at disney interactive and a great partnership between john and jimmy we are now in a position to fulfill our original objective to consolidate our interactive business under one los angelesbased leader” said robert a iger chairman and ceo the walt disney co “with jimmy and john’s input we have created an interactive organization that is best structured to meet the demands of the fastmoving technology industry” iger added “i thank john for his many contributions to disney interactive including building tentpole products like ‘disney infinity’ and establishing the company as a leading mobile games publisher and appreciate his passion for bringing disney experiences to guests on new platforms” reorg is meant to enable disney to take better advantage of merging web and mobile entertainment platforms the company said and embrace a single strategy to generate revenue from its franchises having two presidents simply proved too complicated for disney interactive especially with leaders who wanted more resources for areas they were interested in building at the company pleasants and pitaro had been copresidents of the group since october  pleasants landed the position after disney acquired his social gaming company playdom for  million in july  playdom however hasn’t proved as lucrative of a purchase as disney had hoped with mobile games proving a more successful area for disney under pleasants disney did recently score with the launch of new game “disney infinity” which competes with activision’s hit “skylanders” franchise it also oversees popular kids destination club penguin and is behind mobile hits “where’s my water” and the more recent spinoff “where’s my mickey” see also ‘disney infinity’ reaches  million global sales milestone in a statement pitaro said pleasants “has been critical in helping disney interactive build a great foundation off of which we will continue to deliver quality interactive games mobile and web experiences that entertain and engage our guests” “i am extremely proud of the work our teams have done to create leading interactive games and experiences for our guests” pleasants said in a statement the former chief operating officer at electronic arts and ceo of ticketmaster added “through quality and innovation the business is generating tangible results and momentum and i am confident that consolidating our collective efforts at this time will lead to even greater acceleration” disney interactive showed a positive sign of growth during disney’s fourth quarter which wrapped sept  when it reported sales of  million and profits of  million a positive sign for a division that has long struggled to turn a profit the group was losing  million a year when pleasants and pitaro took over in  in fiscal  it reduced that to a loss of  million see also can disney infinity turn around the mouse houses worst performing division filed under disneydisney infinitydisney

unit talks about creating a different kind of app store environment mobile by roger cheng september    am pdt rogerwcheng wait samsung has an app storejohn pleasants head of samsungs us media solutions unit plans to breathe new life into the company sarah tewcnet you could be forgiven if youve never heard of galaxy apps samsungs own version of an app store designed to service its increasingly large lineup of products which grew on wednesday with the unveiling of the galaxy note  and galaxy note edge prior to july galaxy apps went by samsung apps the change being an acknowledgement that awareness of the store was limited john pleasants head of samsungs media solutions center america or msca the unit responsible for the app store wants to change that our app store needs to be world class in itself he said in an interview we need to work more at attracting more developers the unit has seen some drastic changes over the last several months pleasants who joined samsung in june after stints at companies such as disney and electronic arts runs a unit that traditionally has reported back to headquarters in korea in august the unit was shuffled under samsungs us unit and pleasants reports to samsungs north american ceo gregory lee related stories samsung could give virtual reality the kick in the pants it needs with galaxy note edge samsung returns to comfort zone hardware samsungs milk music spills over to web tv wearables samsung rebrands app store as galaxy apps its a big deal actually pleasants said its a very empowering sort of thing for us by aligning itself more closely to the other regional units pleasants said his unit contributes more to the immediate success of samsungs products previously msca acted like a satellite operation more focused on research before it was people on the side reporting up to headquarters that were working on things not necessarily at the spear point of commercialization in north america he said one of the focuses for pleasants will be improving galaxy apps he doesnt intend for samsungs app store to replace google play which boasts more than  million apps and wide adoption instead galaxy apps will be more selective and focus on apps that take advantage of samsungs unique products or features such as the s pen stylus on the galaxy note line of bigscreen smartphones its also important that the apps and media run seamlessly on every device at the samsunghosted event in new york pleasants said the companys streamingmusic service milk will run not just on smartphones but web tvs and wearable products as well he also stressed that he doesnt just see galaxy apps as an app store but a potential new platformpleasants had adam levine and james valentine from maroon  show up to talk about milk sarah tewcnet were going to focus on making our ecosystem hum and sing better than anyone elses he said pleasants acknowledged that galaxy apps hasnt been successful yet the app store isnt easy to work with and there are improvements needed in software development kits application programming interfaces and general developer support the slew of samsung apps that came preloaded on flagship devices such as the galaxy s came from msca as well those apps have been the target of critics some of whom have labeled them no better than bloatware or useless bits of preloaded software that do little more than take up space msca will still make apps pleasants said but it will pare down the number to a few that are meaningful and move the dial he admitted that some of the companys apps havent had much success and that samsung would move away from them he wouldnt comment on how msca operated in the past noting only that things have changed radically in the last three years we intend on upping our game he said its gotten significantly better and it will continue to get better update  pm pt clarifies quote from john pleasants head of samsungs media solutions center america or msca
