customer service plant statistics plant statistics sustainability manufacturing process community our role in the community introduction cement has been manufactured at the hannibal location since  several thousand men were needed for construction and operation of the original plant a large number of polish slavic hungarian and italian immigrants were attracted to jobs here they settled on plant property and formed the small community of ilasco named for the constituents necessary in the cementmaking process iron limestone aluminum silica coal and oxygen our product has long been recognized for its consistent quality and was selected for many notable construction projects including the empire state building and the panama canal the original plant was expanded and improved throughout its operating history until  when a new manufacturing facility was constructed to replace it at that time one ′ x ′ kiln replaced sixteen small kilns and production was more than doubled this kiln was the second longest cement kiln in the world with annual production rates of over  tons of clinker improvements in the technology and efficiency of the cement manufacturing process along with increasing age on the existing plant prompted the construction of a new plant in  the current plant is now the third plant to produce cement from the same location south of hannibal this latest modernization included more than just a new cement kiln modernization began in the quarry with replacement of the existing fleet of  ton haul trucks with  ton komatsu units including larger komatsu frontend loaders and a new impact crusher that doubles the rock crushing capacity the onsite quarry provides both limestone and shale which constitute  of cement raw materials all raw materials are crushed and conveyed to a single new rock storage building where the segregated raw materials are stockpiled for blending a raw material reclaim system consisting of a tunnel belt conveyor and individual apron feeders controlled by a crossbelt analyzer blend the five component raw material mix the blended material is stored in a day bin just ahead of a new inline vertical roller mill where all the raw materials are dried utilizing preheater off gases and ground to a fineness up to  passing  microns the vertical roller mill is a loesche type lm fourroll mill equipped with a dynamic classifier and a rock circulating system the mill capacity is rated at  short tons per hour the mill product is then conveyed to a  ton capacity concrete slippedformed homogenizing silo equipped with an ibau hamburg blending and withdrawal system the new pyroprocessing line was supplied by khd humboldt wedag and consists of a fourstage preheater  flash calciner with pyrotop technology followed by a ’ long by ’diameter kiln the newest technology pyrofloor pfc a clinker cooler featuring an inlet static section four movable cooling tracks and a roll crusher at the cooler outlet cools the clinker material down to a temperature safe for handling and storage the total aerated surface in the clinker cooler is  ft the rated system clinker production capacity is  stpd or greater with a power consumption at  kwhst or less cement production capacity was also increased by the addition of a khd supplied rp  roll press complete with a vsk separator the roll press circuit was coupled to one of two existing  hp finish mill circuits each of which produce  stph the roll press modification boosted total mill circuit output to  stph and total cement production capacity to  stpd additional infrastructure support modifications were also made these included incorporating waste fuels for the new plant converting existing raw material storage silos into clinker storage increasing cement storage and loadout capabilities at the plant as well as at the st louis mo distribution terminal continental’s distribution network includes shipments from the production facility and terminals in st louis missouri and bettendorf iowa in order to respond to an environmentally beneficial opportunity and remain competitive continental began using supplemental waste fuels for energy recovery as a direct replacement for coal in  this usage increased over the next few years and in  continental acquired the assets of an onsite fuels recycler and formed mfr missouri fuel recycler mfr rapidly expanded the use of waste fuels by adding two patented processes for handling solid waste in  continentalmfr partnered with aes to form green america recycling today continentalgar is recognized as an industry leader this merger of operations has provided a new era of competitive cement operations and has proven to be environmentally beneficial by replacing coal a natural resource is preserved and kiln stack emissions are much cleaner waste that would otherwise be incinerated is reused for energy and we all benefit read more how cement is made at continental cement is made from common materials such as limestone clay silica and iron ore principle raw materials are a blend of  limestone  shale with the remaining raw materials being clay and iron ore the limestone and shale are mined from quarries on continental’s  acre plant site at hannibal clay is trucked in from reserves at our owensville mo operation  miles southwest of the plant large limestone boulders are dumped into the primary crusher and broken into gravel sized particles clay is also introduced through the crusher portland cement from clinker clinker is discharged from the kiln into a cooler where high volumehigh pressure fans drive the heat from the material heated air is recycled back into the manufacturing process after the clinker cools to approximately °f it is delivered by a conveyor system to storage silos clinker is then fed to the finish mills with about  gypsum to produce portland cement the combined finish mill capacity is approximately  tons of cement per hour after leaving the finish mills the finely ground cement is transported to the storage environmental controls the nerve center of the plant is the central control room where monitors and instrumentation allow operators to continuously control the entire manufacturing process redundant certified continuous emission monitors cems installed on the kiln stack provide a record of o co co nox so thc and opacity automatic waste feed cutoffs set by stack testing results and federal regulations are in place to assure compliance a cement kiln provides a perfect environment for safely processing certain waste materials and recovering their energy

cement high quality cement with exceptional customer service plant statistics plant statistics sustainability manufacturing process community our role in the community introduction cement has been manufactured at the hannibal location since  several thousand men were needed for construction and operation of the original plant a large number of polish slavic hungarian and italian immigrants were attracted to jobs here they settled on plant property and formed the small community of ilasco named for the constituents necessary in the cementmaking process iron limestone aluminum silica coal and oxygen our product has long been recognized for its consistent quality and was selected for many notable construction projects including the empire state building and the panama canal the original plant was expanded and improved throughout its operating history until  when a new manufacturing facility was constructed to replace it at that time one ′ x ′ kiln replaced sixteen small kilns and production was more than doubled this kiln was the second longest cement kiln in the world with annual production rates of over  tons of clinker improvements in the technology and efficiency of the cement manufacturing process along with increasing age on the existing plant prompted the construction of a new plant in  the current plant is now the third plant to produce cement from the same location south of hannibal this latest modernization included more than just a new cement kiln modernization began in the quarry with replacement of the existing fleet of  ton haul trucks with  ton komatsu units including larger komatsu frontend loaders and a new impact crusher that doubles the rock crushing capacity the onsite quarry provides both limestone and shale which constitute  of cement raw materials all raw materials are crushed and conveyed to a single new rock storage building where the segregated raw materials are stockpiled for blending a raw material reclaim system consisting of a tunnel belt conveyor and individual apron feeders controlled by a crossbelt analyzer blend the five component raw material mix the blended material is stored in a day bin just ahead of a new inline vertical roller mill where all the raw materials are dried utilizing preheater off gases and ground to a fineness up to  passing  microns the vertical roller mill is a loesche type lm fourroll mill equipped with a dynamic classifier and a rock circulating system the mill capacity is rated at  short tons per hour the mill product is then conveyed to a  ton capacity concrete slippedformed homogenizing silo equipped with an ibau hamburg blending and withdrawal system the new pyroprocessing line was supplied by khd humboldt wedag and consists of a fourstage preheater  flash calciner with pyrotop technology followed by a ’ long by ’diameter kiln the newest technology pyrofloor pfc a clinker cooler featuring an inlet static section four movable cooling tracks and a roll crusher at the cooler outlet cools the clinker material down to a temperature safe for handling and storage the total aerated surface in the clinker cooler is  ft the rated system clinker production capacity is  stpd or greater with a power consumption at  kwhst or less cement production capacity was also increased by the addition of a khd supplied rp  roll press complete with a vsk separator the roll press circuit was coupled to one of two existing  hp finish mill circuits each of which produce  stph the roll press modification boosted total mill circuit output to  stph and total cement production capacity to  stpd additional infrastructure support modifications were also made these included incorporating waste fuels for the new plant converting existing raw material storage silos into clinker storage increasing cement storage and loadout capabilities at the plant as well as at the st louis mo distribution terminal continental’s distribution network includes shipments from the production facility and terminals in st louis missouri and bettendorf iowa in order to respond to an environmentally beneficial opportunity and remain competitive continental began using supplemental waste fuels for energy recovery as a direct replacement for coal in  this usage increased over the next few years and in  continental acquired the assets of an onsite fuels recycler and formed mfr missouri fuel recycler mfr rapidly expanded the use of waste fuels by adding two patented processes for handling solid waste in  continentalmfr partnered with aes to form green america recycling today continentalgar is recognized as an industry leader this merger of operations has provided a new era of competitive cement operations and has proven to be environmentally beneficial by replacing coal a natural resource is preserved and kiln stack emissions are much cleaner waste that would otherwise be incinerated is reused for energy and we all benefit read more how cement is made at continental cement is made from common materials such as limestone clay silica and iron ore principle raw materials are a blend of  limestone  shale with the remaining raw materials being clay and iron ore the limestone and shale are mined from quarries on continental’s  acre plant site at hannibal clay is trucked in from reserves at our owensville mo operation  miles southwest of the plant large limestone boulders are dumped into the primary crusher and broken into gravel sized particles clay is also introduced through the crusher portland cement from clinker clinker is discharged from the kiln into a cooler where high volumehigh pressure fans drive the heat from the material heated air is recycled back into the manufacturing process after the clinker cools to approximately °f it is delivered by a conveyor system to storage silos clinker is then fed to the finish mills with about  gypsum to produce portland cement the combined finish mill capacity is approximately  tons of cement per hour after leaving the finish mills the finely ground cement is transported to the storage environmental controls the nerve center of the plant is the central control room where monitors and instrumentation allow operators to continuously control the entire manufacturing process redundant certified continuous emission monitors cems installed on the kiln stack provide a record of o co co nox so thc and opacity automatic waste feed cutoffs set by stack testing results and federal regulations are in place to assure compliance a cement kiln provides a perfect environment for safely processing certain waste materials and recovering their energy value the intense heat of the process ensures destruction of any organics in the fuel with residual metals chemically bonded subscribe to blog via email
